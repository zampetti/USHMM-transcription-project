me your name, where you were born, and your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is David Klipp, I was born July nine, 1905, in a small Lithuanian town called Skudy, S-k-u-d-y.</span> <span id="s13">Lithuania small little town, where we lived with my grandmother in their house, the -- all little houses were -- on Fridays, the baker -- there was a bakery open, on the Friday it was -- things so -- baked for the whole week for the family, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s14">Anyway, is -- my father, and his brother married two sisters.</span> <span id="s15">This mean my mother’s -- my mother and my uncle’s wife were two sisters.</span> <span id="s16">Then there was another brother, too, but I don’t have any recollection where -- I know he should only be in France somewhere, but I had no contact.</span> <span id="s17">My dad, when he was alive, kept all the contact with hi -- with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s18">No -- in 1907 -- you see, the -- all young men were rev -- educated in religious thing.</span> <span id="s19">Rabbinical preparation, all kind in these thing, there were no other type of thing.</span> <span id="s20">No -- and my father has a little bit older ideas, too, and he wanted to build up a better life for his -- for his family.</span> <span id="s21">So, when I was two years old, in 1907, he went to the United States.</span> <span id="s22">Was in the United States, the first [indecipherable] was how to -- peddling, like all the people do, and so on.</span> <span id="s23">But later on, he learned to make sweaters, and established himself a little factory -- factory -- they call it factory, all there was a couple machines to make sweaters.</span> <span id="s24">No -- he was very prosperous, very good, and in 19-0-10, he decided he is ready to bring the family to New York, and start in living.</span> <span id="s25">So he came back, but my mother didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s26">Her -- her parents were still alive, they lived all together, and what is in the United States?</span> <span id="s27">Where is it?</span> <span id="s28">What -- this is home, they knew only their world.</span> <span id="s29">So he had no choice, he had to give up the plant, and -- and he moved in 19-0-10.</span> <span id="s30">He moved to Lódz, Poland, where he established himself a little factory making sweater.</span> <span id="s31">The same thing what he had there.</span> <span id="s32">Same thing what he ha -- what they had there, and was a pretty good doing.</span> <span id="s33">Then the first World War broke out [indecipherable] Poland, 19 fort -- [indecipherable] 1914 in -- and we came to Lódz 1913.</span> <span id="s34">My father went 1910, and the rest of the family came 1913.</span> <span id="s35">The first World War got 1914, and Lódz was occupied by the Russian army at thi -- this is part of the Russian sphere of interest, or kind of the s -- Poland for -- the country was divided in three parts.</span> <span id="s36">It was the -- what they call the congers Poland, were Lódz, Russia, and all this thing.</span> <span id="s37">This for they -- they were -- they called the Poland under -- under Austrian supervision, and they’re very compulsive education.</span> <span id="s38">And people had to go to school, and people had to learn.</span> <span id="s39">The third part were in the area of Fooznine, which was more anti-Semitic oriented territory, so -- and so this was wa -- 19 -- 1914, then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s40">Not -- the war broke out, the people gel prepared, Poland can never last five weeks, six weeks.</span> <span id="s41">So, what people did, they bought bread, put on cases of loafs of bread, this will keep us over the war, and so on.</span> <span id="s42">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s43">So the war lasted quite a bit, until 1918.</span> <span id="s44">Then, the Polish armies became alive, too and so on, and there were the Polish armies from the Russian territory, the Polish officers were from the Russian army, and is all kind of thing.</span> <span id="s45">But Poland became a -- a independent to a certain degree.</span> <span id="s46">No political, I don’t recall too many things there, but it -- it changed the whole life, in -- in -- in the whole area.</span> <span id="s47">This went on, then the Russian army came into Lódz, I remember the Cossacks when they came in.</span> <span id="s48">And naturally they did whatever they want, and when they were going over -- they were in Lódz, and they saw a German plane flying overboard, a Russian soldier picked up his rifle and shot in the air, he don’t know what he is doing, what he shot, and this you can imagine.</span> <span id="s49">But this is the way, the level of the armies what -- of this time.</span> <span id="s50">In th-this, the war went on, and in 1920 -- 1920, Pilsudski came to power.</span> <span id="s51">And Pilsudski was more Socialistic oriented, and he was more cooperating with everything, and so -- and he was the one.</span> <span id="s52">The territory close to the German border what called the Posnine region was there, was General Halla, the anti-Semitic general whose soldiers were catching Jews from deflor, cutting their beard, and so on, all kind of things.</span> <span id="s53">In 19 -- I am going over fast, but there is not too many things sink.</span> <span id="s54">In 1926, I was called to the army.</span> <span id="s55">Yeah, until then, I was working, before, and I worked in a company where I did clerical work, and salers work, some small companies.</span> <span id="s56">In 1926, I was called to the -- to the army service.</span> <span id="s57">So I went in octo -- On October the 12th, 1926.</span> <span id="s58">I had to induct to the army, and I was assigned to the Fosnine region, where General Halla had his say, and so on.</span> <span id="s59">I went there, and then there was a very big limitation what a Jew can do, what a Jew cannot do.</span> <span id="s60">In the army, the regular probably hear the same thing.</span> <span id="s61">They need -- in the beginning they need young people to do -- at least to help, were write and read, and so on.</span> <span id="s62">So they needed people to the company office, to write.</span> <span id="s63">Who can read and write?</span> <span id="s64">Three people picked up their hands.</span> <span id="s65">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s66">I knew I will not make it, but I was one of them.</span> <span id="s67">So they called okay, there was one who was by profession a teacher in Poland.</span> <span id="s68">So they took him to the office, naturally.</span> <span id="s69">And he lasted about three or four weeks, and they get him out.</span> <span id="s70">Then there was another one who can read and write, some kind -- halfway educated.</span> <span id="s71">They took him in there, and he only last a few weeks, too.</span> <span id="s72">Finally they came to the point there are nobody else.</span> <span id="s73">So they decided they have to -- no choice.</span> <span id="s74">So I was taken to the o -- to the office, and this is not part of the military duty, of going through the military training, with all the [indecipherable] all the exercise, and so on, but in -- in spare time, day time, lunch time, evening, you do the -- the office work.</span> <span id="s75">No -- experienced I was, so they very fast decided that I can do the ho -- the payroll for the company also.</span> <span id="s76">Order was I get involved in many thing -- the -- the company payroll for the officers and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s77">And this way I get the contact with -- the battalion commander at this time, if I recall, was a majer -- Major Sheemak, in Polish majer, in English major.</span> <span id="s78">Sheemak was on this way -- he was a son of a very wealthy Polish landowner and so on, so he had his own horse, and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s79">But he was a little bit a nervous guy.</span> <span id="s80">When he went to the casino, and he drank a little bit, he took out his gun and shot at a lamp, shot at everything what [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s81">So then what -- after this was over, the following day, he realized, and somehow he knew the battalion working in the -- in the company office -- battalion officer.</span> <span id="s82">So he calls me in, and tells me, “When I go to the casino, and I start to drink, you come with me and take away my gun.”</span> <span id="s83">Order is order, I did it.</span> <span id="s84">And when I came in, he didn’t say anything, just took out the gun and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s85">This was -- this was not nice.</span> <span id="s86">And this way was on -- I was in the army until I went to the -- exercise the records there and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s87">This part of Poland belong to the division per -- General Halla was in charge of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s88">And when it came to the examination after the -- the three months, and the commander of the infantry for the division came for the -- for the high ranking general -- came down, then naturally they -- they have the bas -- the exercises.</span> <span id="s89">So when they start to ask question atfil, whatever he asked me to do, and he right away picked on me.</span> <span id="s90">And whatever he asked me to do, I did.</span> <span id="s91">I considered myself a pretty good soldier, and I knew what I am doing.</span> <span id="s92">And finally at the afternoon exams in the class, asking question again, and the professional -- one the officers didn’t know all the answers always, so he picked on me.</span> <span id="s93">One of the question was, who did more for Poland, General Halla, or Pilsudski?</span> <span id="s94">And behind him, there was standing officers, and he which showed me to mark on the picture where -- where Halla is.</span> <span id="s95">I said, “No, in mine opinion Pilsudski did more for Poland than Halla.”</span> <span id="s96">So this way we have a discussion and every question aired, I answered not to -- not to his liking.</span> <span id="s97">Anyway, this time were over, and then we had to come to the period of being sworn in.</span> <span id="s98">Being sworn in, they took, naturally, because swearing in for Christian one way, and then all the Jews from the whole area, they took to a Polish son of Kalish, and there they bought -- they ordered a rabbi to come there and swear it in.</span> <span id="s99">And then, in the meantime, waiting for the rabbi to come and so on, the officers made jokes.</span> <span id="s100">Naturally, anti-Semitic jokes were no problem there, so they -- they had fun.</span> <span id="s101">Finally there came the news that the rabbi arrived.</span> <span id="s102">So they had to send a -- a horse and buggy to bring him in.</span> <span id="s103">Came in a rabbi from the part of Baleetshia what was until the ouster -- occupation, all t -- Jew with a -- with a long beard, and so on, spoke a beautiful Polish.</span> <span id="s104">And they opened their eyes, how can he speak Polish like this?</span> <span id="s105">And he did his formal thing, and he di -- swearing in, and during this time they -- they get a little bit respect for him.</span> <span id="s106">They didn’t expect him to be such a Polishist.</span> <span id="s107">Anyway this -- this went over, and we went back to normal duty.</span> <span id="s108">And I was in the army until March of 1928.</span> <span id="s109">1928 I was released and I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes, ma’am.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Was your family fairly religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: My family was -- the background was a religious background.</span> <span id="s116">This is only thing they will -- learned.</span> <span id="s117">My father was a great Talmudist.</span> <span id="s118">But the goal for you went there is to be rabbinical educated, and what is much better than a rabbi, can’t be much more.</span> <span id="s119">My father himself was not -- he looked for something else, he had technical thinking and so on.</span> <span id="s120">That’s why he went to the United States.</span> <span id="s121">So he was -- he went -- he went to the United States, naturally taking all the religious books and so on, and he came [indecipherable] them.</span> <span id="s122">Was there he learned English a little bit.</span> <span id="s123">Was not a perfect English, but he learned, and he loved the United States.</span> <span id="s124">And he wanted to come back, but mother didn’t go.</span> <span id="s125">So all the way -- our fath -- my father, and my family was the less religious of seven -- of the other brothers -- uncles, and so on, so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: What about when you were in school?</span> <span id="s127">Did you go to a Jewish school, or to a spec --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I go -- it was -- it was a public school, it is called the Yarrowcheeskey gimnasium in pro -- in Skudy I went to the haider, to a religious school, to a rabbi.</span> <span id="s129">In Lódz when we came, we went -- there was a building, a gimnasium, there were a public school, and then they have all the -- a mechanical school for mechanical engineers.</span> <span id="s130">There was a big project, and there was donated by a -- by a wealthy family named Yarrowcheeskey.</span> <span id="s131">Well this -- their name was called to the whole thing, Yarrowcheeskey school.</span> <span id="s132">In the -- in the building of the school, they -- all they build -- they build it also a little synagogue, too.</span> <span id="s133">But they -- the headmaster of the school was not an observant Jew, he was more assimilated.</span> <span id="s134">And he was only the one thing, Yom Kippur, to say the high holiday, Kol Nidre, he has to be there.</span> <span id="s135">Thus he is only Jewish is what he displayed there.</span> <span id="s136">Not -- my father was -- he had a good voice, was a good singer, and knew how to run services before a group and so on.</span> <span id="s137">And he loved my father.</span> <span id="s138">So he want -- he wanted my father when he is there Kol Nidre, my father has to do it.</span> <span id="s139">At one time he was late, and the other people in the temple there, looked at the sun, cannot wait any longer.</span> <span id="s140">At san -- a certain time when the sun goes down, you have to do it.</span> <span id="s141">So -- and he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s142">So they decided not to wait, and let -- conduct the services.</span> <span id="s143">To another fellow, not my father, who was to be in contorial duties once in awhile, conducted the prayer, and serv -- everything.</span> <span id="s144">At the end the director came in.</span> <span id="s145">His name was Shweitzer.</span> <span id="s146">He came in and he find out Kol Nidre is over.</span> <span id="s147">So he insisted -- he insisted that the Kol Nidre will be said again, and my father has to do it.</span> <span id="s148">So there was a big rigamarole, it is against the lord, the religious [indecipherable] but finally my father said, “Look, for peace, it -- it will no harm than to say it again.”</span> <span id="s149">So my father went up and prayed Kol Nidre, and he was really happy, and this is the way it is.</span> <span id="s150">Well -- well this is to show that my father was religious, observant, but he was not a fanatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you have any Gentile friends when you were in school or growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, there were only Jewish boys in the school.</span> <span id="s153">The only Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s154">And on Saturdays you were going to the temple in the gimnasium, in the building there, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So you were part of a Jewish community in --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: A Jewish community, that’s right.</span> <span id="s157">And this way we were -- we were brought up.</span> <span id="s158">No -- my mother was born 1892, and she died in 1920, at the age of 28.</span> <span id="s159">And this time, children were not told what illness is, or what things this is.</span> <span id="s160">What do children know about?</span> <span id="s161">So, naturally we didn’t [indecipherable] from observation.</span> <span id="s162">From this reached the doctor who is -- who was the main doctor to my mother, Dr. Rosenberg, he was in the ghetto also.</span> <span id="s163">Dr. Rosenberg was a neurolo, so I figured all by myself there is something to do with neurology.</span> <span id="s164">So -- and my mother was extremely religious observant, she didn’t do -- at that time, the -- the doctor said you have to eat something fat, you have to eat not kosher meat, but eat what you need is fat.</span> <span id="s165">You could not convince her, there is no way.</span> <span id="s166">So my father brought in a rabbi who lived not far, to try to explain her that even by Jewish law, to save a life you can -- you can eat things what you are not usually do.</span> <span id="s167">But, it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s168">There was no way.</span> <span id="s169">She died as a result of her illness as the Dr. Rosenberg was coming there, and so on, and she died on -- in Lódz, in her bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I had a brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s172">My two sister -- my older sister went to unise -- my father was later very much for sending the children to the United States.</span> <span id="s173">So, in the meantime my mother died, and my -- and my father was left with my older sister, myself, and the sister was born 1911, and the boy was born 1916.</span> <span id="s174">So my sister went to the United States in 1922, went to the -- to the United States, and -- and I rejected.</span> <span id="s175">And I said, “I am not going, I will stay with you.</span> <span id="s176">Whatever I can help with the family we will do together,” and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s177">So it was not the easier time, but we survived.</span> <span id="s178">My father had worked on the job, too, so in the meantime he was coming home a few times to check what we are doing, and I was very helpful in raising the whole family, and so on.</span> <span id="s179">No -- my -- and then came the -- the war.</span> <span id="s180">The first war was 1914, 19 -- 18 - 19 - 20, we over this.</span> <span id="s181">The Germans started the war on September the first, 1939.</span> <span id="s182">This --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Let me ask -- before we get to that, let me just ask you a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: When you were a boy, and when you were a young adult, were you involved in any political organizations, any Zionist movements, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I was interested in Zionist movement, and I belonged to a group what was into Zionist thing.</span> <span id="s187">And I was attending their meetings and so on, and I was very much interested in Israel at this time.</span> <span id="s188">So this is the -- the way of life, what with the -- so I attended this as much time as I had.</span> <span id="s189">I had to work, too.</span> <span id="s190">And be a -- with my work, no matter what I did, I could help the family a little bit, which was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Were these organizations popular?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: This o -- oh yeah, this was the well-known Zionist organization, a group called Yidaktout.</span> <span id="s193">The head of it was Dr. Takover [indecipherable] died in Israel.</span> <span id="s194">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What was the goal of the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: The goal organization was for Israel -- for Zionist movements, and to be able to build up a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a Israel in -- in -- in post-war.</span> <span id="s197">You see, this was the war effort.</span> <span id="s198">No -- at this time there were not too many people were -- were sent to Israel to -- to kibbutz and so on, to work.</span> <span id="s199">But my interest was with the family, to help as much as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Before the war began with the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How much did you know about Hitler, and what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I was very, very much aware.</span> <span id="s204">You see, I was interested in the anti-Hitler movement, and here now was a lady by the name of Iren Hairind, I-r-e-n Hairind H-a-i-r-i-n-d.</span> <span id="s205">Iren Hairind did a publication, monthly publication called Garaishdifite, which is justice.</span> <span id="s206">And there she reported everything what she knew -- what she find out from Germany, so on, so on.</span> <span id="s207">So I was a subscriber to this.</span> <span id="s208">I worked on the job, and I did very well, and -- and she -- and I was -- as -- a subscriber to this.</span> <span id="s209">I worked for a man by the name of Anatole Funkin.</span> <span id="s210">Mr. Funkin was a very well to do -- a Jewish family from before the war, and you know, Jews could not keep in Petersburg -- this is the capital of -- of Russia unless he was a -- big merchant.</span> <span id="s211">No -- my father’s father was building railroads in Russia, so natural he was entitled to go.</span> <span id="s212">And his son graduated from law in Petersburg in 1890 - something.</span> <span id="s213">My father was born 1876.</span> <span id="s214">Somehow my father met Mr. Funkin after the war, I was back already from the Polish army.</span> <span id="s215">And I worked on the job, and yet, at one point there were in Poland three main factories of artificial silk -- the big ones.</span> <span id="s216">The most for the French capital.</span> <span id="s217">And in order to get the representation for this one, people paid money for it, and -- and gave deposits, and ba -- the guarantees, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s218">But it didn’t work out with some of them, and at one point Mr. Funkin was offered , if he [indecipherable] to say yes, so he will get the representation of the one company, which was named the Hodakoof.</span> <span id="s219">Now, Mr. Funkin, he was us visiting, he was not leaving, he came [indecipherable] so on.</span> <span id="s220">He had suites in all major towns in Europe, mostly Switzerland, Zurich so on, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s221">And Mr. loo -- and at this time, when he was offered this representation, he happened to be in Lódz, and my father knew him, how I don’t know, but -- and he wanted to meet me.</span> <span id="s222">And I was working on a job when I came out from the army.</span> <span id="s223">I was working there since 1928.</span> <span id="s224">So at one evening I went to meet him, and he told me what he has -- he was a very well educated elderly gentleman.</span> <span id="s225">And he -- and he told me he will only take it if I will work for him.</span> <span id="s226">So I told him I need a few weeks to [indecipherable] my [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s227">So I decided in four weeks I should be ready.</span> <span id="s228">When I came after four weeks to -- to take over the job, he was out of town.</span> <span id="s229">No -- the other man in the company [indecipherable] by the name of Vinerice.</span> <span id="s230">Vinerice was the president of the Cheskloveena lodge, and was in these areas.</span> <span id="s231">So I come in, and I -- they locate me, I say, “Mr. Funkin hired me to start.”</span> <span id="s232">“Oh, he forgot to tell me.”</span> <span id="s233">But when you told me he hired, you would do whatever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Tape #Two</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: You worked in this business for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: In this particular business, I sel -- no, I was start working for them for 16 years old.</span> <span id="s238">And different places were [indecipherable] town so on, so on.</span> <span id="s239">On this particular job we’re after -- we were -- I -- I started in 1928, and I took over the -- yet -- Funkin job in 1932.</span> <span id="s240">So -- and then -- and I wot -- I established myself pretty -- really in the community too.</span> <span id="s241">I had a name, and my personal card opened doors to many places, and so on.</span> <span id="s242">There was at time that -- in Poland was very anti-Semitic, and [indecipherable] all over, and there were no -- as I said, we were -- we were married July the second in 1933, we went away for a few weeks, and then we came back to work.</span> <span id="s243">Had my apartment, and I’ll even -- Mr. Funkin, his family from his life had two big buildings, where I was there managing, too.</span> <span id="s244">I had the [indecipherable] for tony for them, and so on.</span> <span id="s245">And I had there one apartment for myself.</span> <span id="s246">No -- the orderzite I married my stepmother’s younger sister.</span> <span id="s247">She was a teacher.</span> <span id="s248">And then in 1936, she became pregnant.</span> <span id="s249">And so I ask her, “You don’t need to work, it is already -- the school is end pretty soon, and now, no harm will ti -- be taken to the children if you don’t finish with them.</span> <span id="s250">Let somebody else take over.”</span> <span id="s251">In order to convince me -- and she wanted to be -- somebody might do harm to the children, judging wrong, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s252">So, in order to convince, she, without my knowledge, she went to the -- to the top doctor where all the big ladies were going, [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s253">And came back, and -- and brought me a letter from him, he didn’t see any danger in her continue working.</span> <span id="s254">But it wasn’t so.</span> <span id="s255">At one night she became very, very ill, and there was nowhere to go, nowhere to do.</span> <span id="s256">There was a clinic at -- kind of a hospital what was a mostly frequented by the poor part of the people, the rich didn’t go there, and -- and there’s a -- not far from my house, and I had to take her to a -- to a hospital [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s257">So fi -- I -- I called up, and they told me yeah, I can bring her.</span> <span id="s258">So I went, said then call up the doctor.</span> <span id="s259">Cause there were no doctor and so on.</span> <span id="s260">So he says, Ooh yeah, if I -- if I get 20 zloty, I,” -- so in middle of the night, “if I get 20 zloty, I -- I will come.”</span> <span id="s261">20 zloty was like hundred dollar here, at this time was money.</span> <span id="s262">I said, “Look you just come there, and the money is waiting for you here.”</span> <span id="s263">He came in the middle of the night to that thing.</span> <span id="s264">It turned out my wife was in the seventh month of pregnancy and had to have a -- so that they [indecipherable] it was not easy, and she almost paid with her life for it, but survived.</span> <span id="s265">Naturally, we did everything, but what could be done?</span> <span id="s266">And after all she never regained her health completely.</span> <span id="s267">After a long time the doctor says oh, and we -- you are having a f -- a very comfortable job, and -- and she was conducting -- still teaching a little bit, [indecipherable] little for do something for awhile, then she had to give it up, too.</span> <span id="s268">So we were living the -- the l-life at this time was in -- in Poland at this time, the big meal [indecipherable] the evening.</span> <span id="s269">Lunchtime with the -- with the big meal is there, so usually people met on Saturday, Sunday in the café houses, which has a live band playing and so on, for a tea, whatever -- before they went out for -- for dinners, and this was our life, too.</span> <span id="s270">This was we were doing.</span> <span id="s271">Yo --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So all of this -- you’ve mentioned several times that there was a lot of anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Another what?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: You mentioned several times that there was a lot of anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Anti-Semi --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Did this concern you?</span> <span id="s277">I mean, you knew what was happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s278">You were experiencing problems --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No, this was -- this was before.</span> <span id="s280">You see, the Christian church in Poland blamed the Jews for Jesus’ death.</span> <span id="s281">And in -- in Germany after the war, a Catholic priest, a good friend of my told me he knew, and -- and everybody knew this is not the case, but this was the cause the church used.</span> <span id="s282">And this -- so this was the anti-Semitism, was part of Poland’s life.</span> <span id="s283">And this was really helpful to Germans when they came in, to -- to drag down Jews, and so every Polish little kinder, five, six years old, could show all, hey, Jew, so someone took him away to work [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s284">This is the way the life was.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Tell me about the first day of the -- when the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: The German crossed the border on September the first.</span> <span id="s287">And this time we didn’t know -- we knew this they were [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s288">We were -- we were home sleeping at -- at one time in -- what four o’clock in the morning, five o’clock in the morning, a friend of my -- a -- a MD who was living a few houses away, knocked at the door and came in, and said, “Y-You are still sleeping?</span> <span id="s289">Everybody’s running -- everybody’s running away, and so from the Germans, the Germans are coming.”</span> <span id="s290">I say -- running -- fighting is not my nature, I never went.</span> <span id="s291">So I say okay, I will get up, get dressed, I will see what the situation is over there and so on.</span> <span id="s292">And then the rumors for the women -- to women they didn’t do anything, the Germans, but men they take away, either with the work here and there, and so on.</span> <span id="s293">So it was everybody were -- all men went -- tried to get away.</span> <span id="s294">Finally, I was talked into -- about eight o’clock in the morning, to go.</span> <span id="s295">So with my brother and a third man who worked for me, we were walking toward Warsaw.</span> <span id="s296">Nobody expected that Warsaw will be capitulated in a -- in a short time.</span> <span id="s297">I was living in Rosso at the time, in -- in the building on Aubushna six.</span> <span id="s298">Aubushna six I had friends of my, and we were stay -- and I was staying with them.</span> <span id="s299">And -- and Aubushna six was across the Polish theater, where the Polish police from towns were there staying, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s300">So at one time they had to bomb the buildings, too.</span> <span id="s301">But everybody say there was a retired general living in the building you saw, every shot would hear, he said, the old people are being shot.</span> <span id="s302">And then finally at one night, this was on the 25th of September, a bomb hit the building.</span> <span id="s303">And we were on the -- on the fourth floor.</span> <span id="s304">The sixth, and -- and the fifth floor collapse.</span> <span id="s305">We were on the fourth floor, and everything was burning around, and we had to start the war.</span> <span id="s306">Had to start the war, and the [indecipherable] I don’t know.</span> <span id="s307">So my brother and the three of men [indecipherable] we were walking.</span> <span id="s308">And the whole city was in flame, in fire.</span> <span id="s309">Everywhere we went you couldn’t pass by.</span> <span id="s310">Dead people and animal on the -- on the streets lying, this was a chaos completely.</span> <span id="s311">And [indecipherable] we saw this way, the whole night until we find the hideeron.</span> <span id="s312">Hideeron so on, until the morning.</span> <span id="s313">And then there was no -- yeah, but this time the German already came in.</span> <span id="s314">there.</span> <span id="s315">And we were running toward Warsaw, running to get away from the German, maybe they will just stop, maybe they will never stopped.</span> <span id="s316">Wherever we went, everything was burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: I’m a little confused.</span> <span id="s318">When you’re talking about the building being bombed --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: This is in Warsaw or in Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: In Warsaw.</span> <span id="s322">The big building where I was the [indecipherable] floor.</span> <span id="s323">And so then we were run to Warsaw and everything was afire.</span> <span id="s324">So we had to s -- we had to start to go -- go to a -- Warsaw, what we thought it might be safe and so on.</span> <span id="s325">It took us more than a week, cause we couldn’t -- daytime you couldn’t walk, so we had to lie down hidden somewhere.</span> <span id="s326">And nights you could walk.</span> <span id="s327">And finally we came to -- shortly before Warsaw, we came on foot so -- and -- and -- and then the population, mostly the Jewish population ha -- had prepared drinks, and broth, and everything to try to help us to get [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s328">But the main thing was, took us over the bridge.</span> <span id="s329">And this was the main part.</span> <span id="s330">So I put myself up further to the bridge and there -- and there is lying a Polish officer, waiting too.</span> <span id="s331">And I ask him how it is.</span> <span id="s332">He says, “Look, this is a l-long place was -- is constantly bombed.</span> <span id="s333">And here, if you don’t catch the moment between one set of flares gets away, and -- and the other comes, you might make it.”</span> <span id="s334">We did.</span> <span id="s335">I saw [indecipherable] let’s fly -- with away, so I’ll know whatever it is, we have to make it.</span> <span id="s336">So we on, and we crossed the long bridge, closer to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s337">There was a place called Majdanek if I remember right, and there the people were standing, helping us with food, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s338">Then, finally we -- we came into Warsaw, and the German came into Warsaw, I think it was on September the 25th.</span> <span id="s339">When I heard the s -- the German are already here and so on, so I -- so I approach the German column, and an officer was there, and I ask him if he can tell me if the way to Lódz is safe for me to walk -- to start to do.</span> <span id="s340">He looks at me for awhile, and then he say, “I on your place would go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s341">So, nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s342">We started to make our way, slowly different ways going back to Lódz and it took us a long time, and we had to -- walking and hiding and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s343">And we came to Lódz at one evening.</span> <span id="s344">We went in to the side of the cemetery there, and I paid somebody to go in and call up my wife, tell her that I am here.</span> <span id="s345">He took the money, but they never made the call, I found out later.</span> <span id="s346">The other fellow -- at the evening when it was dark, we took the freight car, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s347">And we went on, we made it home.</span> <span id="s348">Now then, from this one is -- life was different that the German came, and the German tried to take away every house where they can and so on.</span> <span id="s349">And I was managing the two big apartment houses for my bosses, too, but at this time there was no managing at all.</span> <span id="s350">I had -- I couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s351">So just living there, staying there for awhile.</span> <span id="s352">I had, before the war, working at Funkin, I had contact -- they were in Poland, were at a lot of companies owned by people who came years ago from Germany, manufacture, so on.</span> <span id="s353">The young, when hi -- when Hitler came to power, the young generation, the young Germans went to Germany, and they became the Hatenkroitzer and this all kind of things.</span> <span id="s354">I had a conflict w-with -- with one company, who was very good, very -- but the experience was when you see -- they were paying a lot with backslip.</span> <span id="s355">Those were checks with a longer period of time, so on.</span> <span id="s356">60 days, 90 days, and -- and I had some from the company [indecipherable] checks from other people, other name.</span> <span id="s357">And one check came back from my exper -- and my practice was mail it to them, and they will send me back a check.</span> <span id="s358">[indecipherable] I mailed it, but I never heard anything back, because the young fellow was in head office, he was already away in Germany.</span> <span id="s359">And he wasn’t -- so -- but he came back, as I was still in the building, leaving there.</span> <span id="s360">And I saw him through the window coming in, so I opened the door, and I approached him in Germany, and say, “You are coming to -- to collect a debt.”</span> <span id="s361">And he said, “No, Mr. Klipp, I am -- I am coming to pay a debt.”</span> <span id="s362">And apologized for this what happened, and so on.</span> <span id="s363">Now, he was a uniform with the arm band, with all kind German things.</span> <span id="s364">And that’s the way it was until we were living in the apartments, I was at my father with his family, and [indecipherable] and then until January 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Was your father able to continue his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Father was sick, and I couldn’t get the medical help for him.</span> <span id="s367">There was -- there was no doctor who could go to a Jew, and there was no way, and he had the illness, and finally he died on January 16, 1940, in his bed.</span> <span id="s368">I was at his bed.</span> <span id="s369">And the only thing we do is that -- use connections to be able to bury him in the cemetery, and this was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: What other kinds of changes happened after the Germans took over, for Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: When the German took over there, they first of all, they -- they fight to get all the Jews to work.</span> <span id="s372">And then their main thing was to get the Jews out of central town.</span> <span id="s373">They establish -- it was already toward the end of nine -- of -- of ’39.</span> <span id="s374">There was already rumors of a [indecipherable] assigned as a ghetto.</span> <span id="s375">And -- and they tried to force people to move there as fast as you can by their own and so on.</span> <span id="s376">But I couldn’t [indecipherable] cause my father was still alive, but when he died, a day after, they came in, and gave me 10 minutes to walk out of the building, and take whatever I can carry, nothing else.</span> <span id="s377">So we took whatever we can and -- and we start to walk toward the ghetto.</span> <span id="s378">And -- and my -- my friend there empty a room, empty apartment on one street, on Zigilska 36.</span> <span id="s379">So I went in and listen, there was no question asked.</span> <span id="s380">They open the door, you go in, and you are there.</span> <span id="s381">And this was the main street, where they build later the main artery, where they separated with two halfs of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s382">So then --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Pri -- prior to this in Lódz, were businesses confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Could people continue going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: What was the life like for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: People couldn’t whatever, the life stopped.</span> <span id="s389">Everything was -- there was no more life.</span> <span id="s390">People just tried to get out, and they were encouraging with many ways to people to move away f-from there.</span> <span id="s391">So people were constantly moving, going, and so on.</span> <span id="s392">For example, my mother’s family carried f -- 40 jar, things with -- out there.</span> <span id="s393">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s394">I was told only whatever I can have on my shoulder, and go.</span> <span id="s395">So it was -- there was no life any more after this, until the ghetto, and then we didn’t know what.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: What -- were there a lot of the -- were there attacks in the street, were the Germans around?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s398">Every Pole you saw a Jew here attack them or took them away, can’t do this, do this, do this, and so on.</span> <span id="s399">And they were -- and the Germans were just -- they didn’t care for this -- or wa -- they didn’t care to -- to defend, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s400">They let them do whatever they want, this was helpful to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: So the Poles were attacking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh, yeah, the Poles, and the German was helping them.</span> <span id="s403">A little Polish boy had a German soldier, and -- and he told him, he is a Jew, and okay, and this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Was this something if you were walking the streets you would see?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I -- oh yeah, [indecipherable] from the streets.</span> <span id="s406">I had in the building where I was living, and what was owned by my -- by Mr. Funkin, by my boss.</span> <span id="s407">I -- I -- I had a tenant who was from Germany region, the family, many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s408">And these were good friends, always, and we still good friends.</span> <span id="s409">So at one time then I n -- I was in a jam, I went to every -- and advice, what should I do?</span> <span id="s410">I couldn’t do this, I couldn’t do this.</span> <span id="s411">So I decided to up to his door, he wa -- lived on the second floor, and go in and try to talk to him.</span> <span id="s412">The family knew me very well.</span> <span id="s413">And I come to the door, and his son opened the -- the -- let me in, and I see a German uniform hanging in sight.</span> <span id="s414">So he right away came out to say, don’t worry, this is my nephew.</span> <span id="s415">Don’t worry, you come in, and whatever I can do, tell me.</span> <span id="s416">So I tell him what -- in the meantime we’re going in a conversation with the nephew.</span> <span id="s417">And the nephew, a young soldier tells me that we lost the war at this time.</span> <span id="s418">So I’m telling him, “Look, you are a member of a army who walks every day ahead, ahead, ahead.</span> <span id="s419">And you are tell me they lost the war?”</span> <span id="s420">There is a German word, zieg, zieg, this means that we get something, we ge -- com -- he says, “Herr -- herr Klipp, visignu stott.”</span> <span id="s421">This means you are getting so much of this good, that we are die from it.</span> <span id="s422">And couple years later I was in the ghetto already, I received a -- he sent me in a communication by somebody that his nephew died on the front.</span> <span id="s423">Non -- at this time they -- okay, this was -- the German -- under the German occupation, there couldn’t be -- naturally there was nothing.</span> <span id="s424">My father died, so I had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s425">The ghetto I --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Were you -- one question -- one more question and then we’ll talk about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Were you aware of any Einsatzgruppen activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Einsatzgrup.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: In Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: They were.</span> <span id="s436">The Einsatzgruppen were in the ghetto, in the part of the ghetto, and they all -- all around.</span> <span id="s437">They made a fence around the ghetto, and where we get close to the fence, could be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: And this was Einsatzgruppen?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: The Einsatzgruppen with -- the Einsatzgruppen with the whole -- the -- I think there was some regular SS or regular army also, but mostly Einsatzgrup were the one who was marching with all thing.</span> <span id="s440">So it is -- it was no way -- again already the ghetto was established, and Roomkofsky was the head of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: How -- how did he become the head of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: How was he chosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: He was chosen because he had a big head of white hair, an older, which means he can be the altesta -- the oldest of the Jews.</span> <span id="s445">About --</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Was he the head of the Jewish community before?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh yeah, we did, but those were all Orthodox so -- and they were not acceptable, and there were no Jewish community, they were all gone.</span> <span id="s448">The -- the Jewish community before the war didn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s449">It was a new -- new life in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s450">There are mid -- there are different opinions of what -- Roomkofsky, I didn’t judge him so bad, okay?</span> <span id="s451">No -- Roomkofsky’s goal was to try to have as many possible Jews to survive.</span> <span id="s452">Naturally he was under orders from the Germans.</span> <span id="s453">Veego was the head of the ghetto ferbotten.</span> <span id="s454">His assistant was a fellow by the name of Bardfish.</span> <span id="s455">But we had in the ghetto a circle -- we had one fellow who was listening to the BBC news every day.</span> <span id="s456">And he was making up little notes that most political value for us, and I was getting such a note every day.</span> <span id="s457">I was -- there’s not too many people hear that, but I was one who will get it.</span> <span id="s458">When somebody came in and gave me a piece of paper, I knew what it did, and is that.</span> <span id="s459">No -- this fellow eventually when they -- when they caught up with him, he committed suicide, hanged himself.</span> <span id="s460">His name was Hayden Vidofsky.</span> <span id="s461">And was -- he didn’t want to follow life in the Germans’ hand.</span> <span id="s462">And dote -- the German head as you know, a krippo [indecipherable] side, there they were calling Jewish and tried to get away -- all Jews had to work, the Jews were hiding, the Jews did all kind of things they wanted.</span> <span id="s463">And from time to time the [indecipherable] they were brought to the krippo.</span> <span id="s464">There were only -- they -- there were also Jews who worked with the Germans in -- in the krippo.</span> <span id="s465">They used them to [indecipherable] to [indecipherable] to bring something, to some -- whatever it is.</span> <span id="s466">Now, I was the office manager of the fiflagunsaftargum, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s467">Which means the department where all the food to the ghetto, for the Jews, whatever the German assigned, came in to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: How did you get this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Mr. Roomkofsky wanted to get me in the beginning.</span> <span id="s470">I understood -- I found that out later.</span> <span id="s471">There was a -- a lady by the name of Jacobson.</span> <span id="s472">Hers -- her son was a lawyer, and she wanted to promote her son, and when she get wind that Roomkofsky would like to -- to see me, I never get called to see him, until there was a change later, Mr. Stalshi Jacobson, by way was related to my -- relation t-to -- I know you very well as a kid.</span> <span id="s473">And but she maneuvered him, and I was not notified until there was a change.</span> <span id="s474">Jacobson was at once to a different position, and somebody else came in to his office to be the office manager, and in the drawer they found my name that Roomkofsky wanted to see me, which I never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did you know Roomkofsky before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I met him one -- I knew about him, but I met him once, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: And he was -- Roomkofsky himself was under the -- into very big pressure from the Germans, naturally, and he tried to get as many people to survive, as many possible, so on.</span> <span id="s479">So his approach to the Germans was, we have people of every line of work, we can do all type of work for the German could use, and what a German population can use.</span> <span id="s480">And he establish working results for all kind of things.</span> <span id="s481">And the German were taking advantage of it too.</span> <span id="s482">They were using it and so on.</span> <span id="s483">So he was a couple time taken away by the German out of town again, but after a few days, I don’t think -- you see, Mr. Roomkofsky’s secretary was a lady by the name of Dora Fuchs.</span> <span id="s484">Dora Fuchs was o -- the family originally from Poland, and many years ago, like many, they went to Germany.</span> <span id="s485">They settled in Hanover, in Germany.</span> <span id="s486">And this Dora Fuchs became the secretary to Roomkofsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: I think we need -- End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s495">Noy -- so he had to change of s-secretary, and he found so -- Jacobson to the legal departments, Jacobson was the lawyer.</span> <span id="s496">So, at this time came a new secretary to him, and opened the door and see a note to get me to see Roomkofsky.</span> <span id="s497">So -- and he knew me, so he -- the following day I -- I was told to go to see Roomkofsky.</span> <span id="s498">So I went to see Roomkofsky.</span> <span id="s499">I come there to a office, we are standing around, people everywhere.</span> <span id="s500">Rabbis, near rabbis, pela -- people, police, you name it, everybody was there.</span> <span id="s501">And he was meeting somebody in his office.</span> <span id="s502">Finally he came out, and he looked around, “I want to see you.”</span> <span id="s503">Left everybody stay and called me in, I’m going in.</span> <span id="s504">He said, “Look, I have a big mess in the fiflagunsaftargum,,” in there.</span> <span id="s505">This mean where the all food can be in the aprovasultsia, the -- all the food came in at once [indecipherable] there was a big mess.</span> <span id="s506">“I want you to go right away there, take it over, and make order.”</span> <span id="s507">No far I knew about him, that there is no -- if I -- I cannot go tell anybody what I’m going to do, I went right away over there, and I am working.</span> <span id="s508">He might think he’s a -- he [indecipherable] I come by horse and buggy, but I have to walk.</span> <span id="s509">So I went over there, actually there, and there was a fellow the -- o -- who head his office by the name of Roderusser, and he was unhappy with him.</span> <span id="s510">And Roderusser was not a real professional, there’s a different story.</span> <span id="s511">So I come in, and I said, “Roderusser, look, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s512">We will go, put everything together.</span> <span id="s513">They will arrange it, and once you will [indecipherable] in the -- in the certain order we will, it will work by themselves, unfort.”</span> <span id="s514">So, Roderusser was very afraid, because Roomkofsky got aggravate, he could send him away right away to -- to be transported out to -- to Auschwitz, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s515">And -- but, he didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s516">S --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Okay, I’m going to stop you one moment.</span> <span id="s518">Stop tape please.</span> <span id="s519">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s521">What was there -- you see, the Jewish bakeries from before the war, that were there over on the ghetto, they were baking bread.</span> <span id="s522">And they had to come to buy flour to the fiflagum sometime.</span> <span id="s523">So what they bought in their Polish money, they didn’t get this back, because th-the German took away the Polish money, they didn’t get the money.</span> <span id="s524">Anyway, when they -- this way he -- he came to transfer out the money and so on.</span> <span id="s525">I head the department with a head cashier.</span> <span id="s526">There were five people working with us, to get the money, sort it out, but -- and so on.</span> <span id="s527">The -- the head cashier was a professional cashier from before the war, from a big bank.</span> <span id="s528">From the same bank where -- becau -- the [indecipherable] Mr. Rosenblatt came.</span> <span id="s529">I knew about her, I didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s530">So -- but -- and she was just as a -- before the war, slowly do it, one time, think of another and so on.</span> <span id="s531">The ghetto was no time for it.</span> <span id="s532">So finally I saw the one day, it doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s533">So I tells her, “Look, Mrs. Steinbeck, you sit down at the corner, I will operate the cashier’s office.</span> <span id="s534">You sit down there and watch me.</span> <span id="s535">And then you tell me if you can do it or not.”</span> <span id="s536">The following day, the old people got there, and counting the money, sorting out, and I was sitting there, and I was doing the same time, collecting while I am paying out money, collecting, what she say it couldn’t be done.</span> <span id="s537">Circumstances are different, this is a war.</span> <span id="s538">So I worked there for a whole day.</span> <span id="s539">At the end of the day she came into there, “Mr. Klipp, I will do it.”</span> <span id="s540">Okay, good.</span> <span id="s541">That’s all I needed.</span> <span id="s542">And then the money -- what the Jewish bakers brought in, the following day, the Germans took away.</span> <span id="s543">There came a Mr. Schwinn was his name, a German from the ghetto Vivaldin, he came to collect the money and so on.</span> <span id="s544">So, from now on she was -- she was handling this, and I was to get myself back to the office, before the people -- and I had people whom I knew from -- from before the war, most accountants I knew, and they knew me and so on.</span> <span id="s545">So it’s all cloc pretty well.</span> <span id="s546">We somehow man -- and Roomkofsky came after awhile, it didn’t take long, I was there, and he was there.</span> <span id="s547">So I told him, Mr. Roomkofsky, mis -- [indecipherable] I think we called him, “It will be straightened out.</span> <span id="s548">Let me get to him orientity of what is, and I will assure you after I finish, I will be able to tell you that everything works.”</span> <span id="s549">Turned around, went away.</span> <span id="s550">And I started to organize the things, organize the people to work and so on.</span> <span id="s551">And 19 -- going back to Roomkofsky as a person, as a character, what it is.</span> <span id="s552">In 1942, he sent us in 5,000 from Czechoslovakia, and 5,000 from Vienna, and 5,000 from Berlin.</span> <span id="s553">And then another transfer to 5,000 from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s554">Most of them exsembly rich people.</span> <span id="s555">The lagers we told this what they had, this is the first time they had, they came in to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s556">So, had to find to do something and so on.</span> <span id="s557">Among them was a Mr. Hirsch.</span> <span id="s558">Mr. Hirsch was on the -- on the board of most of the heavy industry in Czechoslovakia, a great lawyer with a big legal office, and so on.</span> <span id="s559">And he was a sick man.</span> <span id="s560">Now, I tried to help him as much as you could.</span> <span id="s561">At the same time we were getting in potatoes.</span> <span id="s562">What happened?</span> <span id="s563">My [indecipherable] always.</span> <span id="s564">You know that from the farmer to get permission for one shipment of -- of -- of potatoes, with the same permission we get five, six, seven, eight shipments of potatoes.</span> <span id="s565">So the whole night we are working, and I was working with them.</span> <span id="s566">We are working with a little hand wagon what they pushed, what they pulled, and so on there, but they -- just to get away from the -- from the place where they are.</span> <span id="s567">At the same time, I had to watch to make Roomkofsky satisfied too, that -- that I am not problem.</span> <span id="s568">Among these people, as I say, was a Mr. Hirsch, extremely wealthy man, and Mr. Hirsch showed me, “Mr. Klipp, when the war ends, half what I have is yours.”</span> <span id="s569">So I thought myself, first let’s survive, and then we’ll talk.</span> <span id="s570">Then, as -- so, what I do with these people?</span> <span id="s571">So, there was a little shack in the corner of the fiflagunsaftargum,, there was a little shack.</span> <span id="s572">I put in in this shack a long table with benches, and -- and there I -- I working five people, Mr. Hirsch was among them, who couldn’t do anything else, they were not used to anything else.</span> <span id="s573">Everybody had their pencil with the pad and sitting there.</span> <span id="s574">And nobody knew about this arrangement, the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s575">Mr. Roomkofsky discovered it one time when he was down there, gwaiting to corner.</span> <span id="s576">“Hey, hey,” comes in there, “what is this?</span> <span id="s577">What are the people doing here?”</span> <span id="s578">So I tell him, “Present, they are waiting for the soup.”</span> <span id="s579">He looked at me, turned around, went out without saying a word.</span> <span id="s580">So, I had to -- so I am almost legal with them -- having them.</span> <span id="s581">So they were work over there, and were -- they sitting there hours, and waiting for the soup, then the soup came, then they went, and they sit -- went to their families, to the qualas, wherever they are.</span> <span id="s582">This was going on for [indecipherable] Roomkofsky, his reaction, what a deleeng I told him they wait for the soup.</span> <span id="s583">This was for him -- and this told me a lot about him.</span> <span id="s584">He wanted to -- I knew about him more than I knew him, what I hear, these activities and -- in -- in -- in -- in the homes for children with their parents, all kind of things.</span> <span id="s585">In the part of the Lódz -- I was actually in the same place, in different part of town.</span> <span id="s586">So at one time he -- he called me, and he said look, here is a big -- here is a family what the father’s going into the army, and he has a family of small children.</span> <span id="s587">If I take care of the smallest, he will take care of the bigger ones.</span> <span id="s588">He -- a deal.</span> <span id="s589">So I say, I’ll put in the smallest children in the order of [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s590">Anyway, this -- this worked pretty good with him.</span> <span id="s591">This went on until -- and yeah, and -- and every day Mr. Shrink was coming, collecting the -- the -- the -- the Polish money, take away the order.</span> <span id="s592">At the same time Mr. Meemorf, who was before the war a coffee merchant, a big coffee merchant, and he created for himself, after the war he should have something too.</span> <span id="s593">So he was sending in to the ghetto things like cacao, tea, rice, something like it -- it was -- what he couldn’t touch, and told not to touch it.</span> <span id="s594">And whatever a transport came in of his things, the following day he was in, and I had to give him a report what I have.</span> <span id="s595">Match a long paper, everything was beautiful.</span> <span id="s596">It always match.</span> <span id="s597">But, I had people with epidamia, dysentaria, all kind of, all kind of -- and rice was the only thing what I had.</span> <span id="s598">So I had the -- the man who -- who headed the [indecipherable] the magazine, a fellow Moshberg, he didn’t survive, I -- he was a very nice guy, so I told him, “Look, let’s opim a sacrifice, and when people call, they having dysentaria with the -- give them a little bit rice, so nobody should know that you were the only one who can give what they need.”</span> <span id="s599">And this [indecipherable] for awhile.</span> <span id="s600">So finally the German collected all -- all the money and so on, and I s -- falsified Roomkofsky with the cash -- with the -- with the handling and so on, and it worked smoothly.</span> <span id="s601">So -- so the office worked, and I could award it to myself too, to taking care of [indecipherable] and all kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Estelle -- it -- we’re hearing it --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: So, and this was -- the ghetto was goin -- going like it -- like this until they -- they started to liquidate the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Okay, then let’s -- I want to ask you questions --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Well now [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: [indecipherable] if that’s okay.</span> <span id="s607">You were talking about Roomkofsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: I think that he was controversial in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: He what?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Was controversial.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: People felt that there was a lot of corruption with the officials, and the police, and do -- was that something you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s615">In cases like this, without corruption, nothing can be done.</span> <span id="s616">You see, what is, there was more -- most people who were involved there -- he was the head of the ghetto for about -- of the ghetto, Roomkofsky, but then the other department, who could make all those deals with the Germans to duplicate or triplicate potatoes, shipments, all kind of this.</span> <span id="s617">Somebody who knew the underworld a little bit.</span> <span id="s618">And there was -- and fellows who were active in the more advanced under-underground thing, they came to power, and they were -- would they know how to handle, how to buy, whom to buy, what to buy with, and so on.</span> <span id="s619">And there was -- and this was the main thing, was nothing what they could do to it.</span> <span id="s620">You see, he thi -- this is the way we are getting in potatoes much more than we -- than we should have, and all the food items, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s621">But all lead to their activities, it was a means for us to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: So you got more than -- than what you were officially allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Oh yeah, no question about.</span> <span id="s624">You see, the -- whatever they officially send in, that the ghetto can afford, it was divided by the corporation, by so many, and we have distribution points, and we gave out, whenever this [indecipherable] what is the number of people in this area, and we gave them as much people a -- a -- as much food as was there.</span> <span id="s625">But nothing officially came in.</span> <span id="s626">The unofficial we couldn’t touch.</span> <span id="s627">So it was a -- there is -- in a case like this there were no normalities, forget about normality at this time.</span> <span id="s628">Everything -- most people from the -- I would call them underground for this.</span> <span id="s629">But most people came to power, came to di -- let’s say we created a sondercommando, was created in ghetto.</span> <span id="s630">The purpose of the -- of the sondercommando was to -- to try to get from the Jews the jewel, their values, whatever this is, and so on, and give them to the German.</span> <span id="s631">Now those people are involved in it, they are people too.</span> <span id="s632">So they knew how to handle who could work, no -- the -- the head of the department was a fellow by the name of David Yeelgla.</span> <span id="s633">He himself has a background, what I don’t know.</span> <span id="s634">He became a big man in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s635">His assistant was a fellow by the name of Mark Kleeger, whom I knew.</span> <span id="s636">And Mark Kleeger was the educated fellow, and -- and no other one was the -- doing, the connection, the bribing, the all -- the all kind of things.</span> <span id="s637">And this ghetto -- how they, if they collected something, what they did, they give in to the German or not.</span> <span id="s638">Naturally there were [indecipherable] and you couldn’t expect -- if they had to bribe German, they had to take it from somewhere, so they took from the [indecipherable] and buy the German whatever it is.</span> <span id="s639">It is in -- in such a time there is very hard to -- to talk about legal, and with lawyer, with problems, and this is the way they get the [indecipherable] it.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: But was it a situation where the people who had some power, their families were much better taken care of --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes, there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: -- while people were starving?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: -- there was.</span> <span id="s644">Mr. Roomkofsky had a group of people who used to get what they call talons.</span> <span id="s645">The leader of the department was a Miss Ivershitz, yeah Ivershitz.</span> <span id="s646">And she gave -- and people of those families were in charge of something, who were -- who were considered helping Roomkofsky run the whole thing, they were getting talons for their families.</span> <span id="s647">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Will you just explain what a talon is?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: A talon, there was such a coupon to go and pick up some food, whatever it is, to different departments.</span> <span id="s650">That’s a -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Well I -- yeah -- explain that again, though, there was a car honking.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Oh-oh.</span> <span id="s653">A talon, what you call that this thing was a piece of paper what Roomkofsky department gave out for those people to go to a meat department, get some meat, to this to get some these, and so on, and he -- no, we had in ghetto the -- another thing, too.</span> <span id="s654">Those Jews who worked [indecipherable] krippo, and those Jews who worked with the krippo, they were going to town with the krippos, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s655">And they were always coming in and he need a loaf of bread for a German, [indecipherable] for themse -- this the way it went.</span> <span id="s656">I gave it to them.</span> <span id="s657">Those people that are going, and there was we -- we have no medication, for example.</span> <span id="s658">And medication was a very important thing for a lot of people.</span> <span id="s659">The most thing, B12 was a very -- why tha -- those people who were working with the Germans to ghetto, they could get it if I contact them.</span> <span id="s660">So, there was a fellow whom I knew, some wa -- he came to ask for something, and I used this connection.</span> <span id="s661">The name was Wortman, he was old.</span> <span id="s662">[indecipherable] to talk with them, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s663">And I always told him I have a request for these, for [indecipherable] for other thing, and he tried to get me, because he wanted something in return, bread, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s664">And this way -- and this was my contact with the -- with the unofficial [indecipherable] department [indecipherable] to use them as much as I could.</span> <span id="s665">And -- and when I get medication, I had the problem who to give it.</span> <span id="s666">If I had a secretary to the fiflagunsaftargum -- Dagushensky, Yelsi Dagushensky, her father was before the war the -- the cormeister for the Jewish temple.</span> <span id="s667">And he was a sick man, a elderly man.</span> <span id="s668">And I get one medication what she needs for her father, and then was a young mother who need it.</span> <span id="s669">Who should I give it to you?</span> <span id="s670">I give it to the young mother.</span> <span id="s671">And -- and I became a -- a enemy of Dagushensky because I felt a y -- a young mother with a -- with a little baby, if you couldn’t help her, we are in -- we are in a pievin to a certain way, we have to make choices what are not normally done, but has to be done.</span> <span id="s672">So this way -- this way it works.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Were you able to help a lot of people in your position?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I did.</span> <span id="s675">As much as I could.</span> <span id="s676">Every time this Mr. Wortman went to town with a krippo, I give [indecipherable] and I was sitting and waiting, and finally I -- get me these thing, get me these thing.</span> <span id="s677">Whatever I get, I get away, I think I helped, because I didn’t need anything for myself, I gived everything away.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did you have a lot of -- did you get special privileges because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: I didn’t use them.</span> <span id="s680">I never ac-accepted a regular -- what I called talon before, a little slip to go and get milk, and I had contact with it.</span> <span id="s681">You see, if I wanted, if I would -- let’s say the head of the meat department -- and there was mostly horsemeat, there was nothing else -- so if I wanted to get meat, I could give him a loaf of bread, he would give me meat.</span> <span id="s682">I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s683">I felt that this is dishonest, and I am not in the position to be able to use dishonesty just to -- to -- I didn’t use it, except when I came to a point when my wife was very ill, and I did get a different type of food.</span> <span id="s684">So I talked to -- I was [indecipherable] say I need a special talon for my wife, certain food and so on, and I get it.</span> <span id="s685">But this is the only time I was using it for my own.</span> <span id="s686">Never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: You know, well, let me ask you, were your contacts mostly with the administration within the ghetto, or did you also have contact with the German authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: With the German no, nothing whatsoever.</span> <span id="s689">Only the Jewish army station in the ghetto, and -- and the main thing was, everything what came about from Kofsky.</span> <span id="s690">The manager of the -- ferfling of the food department where I was working was Roomkofsky’s ex-partner from years ago, friend of his.</span> <span id="s691">And he put him in charge of the department.</span> <span id="s692">Then every department had a commissar also.</span> <span id="s693">A high police ranking officer who was assigned to, and he what -- had to handle.</span> <span id="s694">In my case there was a fellow by the name of Reingold, Sigmund Reingold.</span> <span id="s695">So this is the way it -- it operates.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: But this Reingold was part of the Jewish administration?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Part of the Jewish administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Maybe you can explain s -- how complex the Jewish administration was in the ghetto, it was pretty large, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: The Jewish administration was fully well organized.</span> <span id="s700">We had the departments, we have a kitchen department, who was responsible for cooking soups and so on.</span> <span id="s701">And we have all kinds departments for -- for a different specialty for different work and so on.</span> <span id="s702">And the most what I was connected with was -- was the -- the department wa -- where the food came through.</span> <span id="s703">And they were very well organized.</span> <span id="s704">There was a -- let’s say there was a what you call meldinkovi -- registration of people, of vadiserobun, which was headed by a good friend of my, Naftali, a lawyer [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s705">And let’s say when somebody needed a job for somebody, he went there and asked for an assignment for a job.</span> <span id="s706">And one time Mr. Shinsheevy, my manager comes up to me, and say, “Look, Dave, I know you know everybody, I need a job for two girls.</span> <span id="s707">Can you get it for me?”</span> <span id="s708">I said, “Sure, I will try to do it.”</span> <span id="s709">And by this -- okay -- Estelle was one of the girls who he gave her the job.</span> <span id="s710">And this is the first time I met her there.</span> <span id="s711">When she sa -- heard, or saw that sh -- he asked me for jobs for the two girls, she came up -- and she graduated the same year from -- from -- from high school, and I saw her diploma, everything excellent, she was a good student.</span> <span id="s712">And the other girl was another girl there whom I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s713">And so I went to the department and came with the assignment -- with those two jobs.</span> <span id="s714">And they -- and they were both employed.</span> <span id="s715">Estolle originally was with the department where it was near the [indecipherable] everything was going ups and so on.</span> <span id="s716">And -- and Estelle I assigned to the department where the soup talons were given out, in [indecipherable] department.</span> <span id="s717">Everyone who works here the Jew, [indecipherable] me the

how much you got?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s733">We have a special department who was the distribution department, and the head of it was a fellow by the name Shisheesky, was a engineer, he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s734">And then they will figure out how much food to give to each point for the people leave, and so on, and -- and people came with their food carts, what they have, to go to pick it up, what is assigned to them, and so on, and pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Now, was there a different amount of food that could go to classifications of people, like people who were working, or women, or people [indecipherable] officials --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Every -- everything was for working people, there was no provision for not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So where did they eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: So, we divided f-for the number of -- population.</span> <span id="s739">You couldn’t do it otherwise.</span> <span id="s740">So everybody gets something.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: So that was up to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: This was up to the department was with doing it, n-not me personally.</span> <span id="s743">I was busy with the office downstairs, operations, so on.</span> <span id="s744">But we -- we knew how much people there are in the ghetto, how much people, so we figure out.</span> <span id="s745">Mr. Sheesheestio was on top of his -- he -- and he, with the -- the -- be the management came to the conclusion this why -- this is how much we can give to everyone and so on.</span> <span id="s746">And people were going to the distribution point, and picked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So the food the Germans gave you was only for the working people?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And then you had to figure out how much you could allot to other people who were not --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: This for the department to figure it out.</span> <span id="s751">We have so much food, and so many people, so we can give only the -- that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Now, were you able to kind of manipulate the statistics to show that there were more people who needed food, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Like, if people died you wouldn’t report them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: No, this wa -- th-this was not in my hands at all.</span> <span id="s756">This was not my part.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Was that being done?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: We saw the li -- we saw this -- how many people there were, were report from every day.</span> <span id="s759">This is how many people to get ahead.</span> <span id="s760">And people were dying, and people were getting won too.</span> <span id="s761">Get ready and so on.</span> <span id="s762">We -- we tried to run the ghetto with normal life, with musical concerts, with performances, with all kind of things.</span> <span id="s763">To make as much as possibly we will -- young people get married, and those thing happened.</span> <span id="s764">So this is with -- tried to ode a active life what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Did you -- did you provide soup kitchens and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: We had soup kitchens, was -- especially kitchen department, who was responsible for the soups, and sent the soup for every department.</span> <span id="s767">And the head of the -- the office manager of the office, head of this was a fellow by the name of Boller, who at one time at a meeting, Roomkofsky ask him, “How much cost us this soup?”</span> <span id="s768">He says, “I don’t know, because I’m getting free everything from Dave.”</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: The soup kitchens were -- now, or -- originally were they privately run, and then the government took them over?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span> <span id="s771">All g -- run always by the ghetto.</span> <span id="s772">There was no private an-anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So the -- so the ghetto government controlled every aspect of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Every aspect of life, the ghetto was under control.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: And there were no independent --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Even the theaters, and the schools, and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: So the schools were under supervision of the ghetto, and everything.</span> <span id="s779">There were -- school department what took care, and they had to report to Roomkofsky, I’m sure, and so on.</span> <span id="s780">But -- but everything was run from the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Was it efficient?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s783">Fully efficient under the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: What were the living conditions like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: What were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: The living conditions were not good.</span> <span id="s788">We were camped in small apartments, mostly.</span> <span id="s789">Let’s see, we had to occupy the -- the place where prior was the Polish underground, the Polish -- not underground, but the Polish volespart.</span> <span id="s790">They moved their mouth to a -- to a different area so the Jews can take over their quarters.</span> <span id="s791">For example, the office where I worked was on Droska six.</span> <span id="s792">My room -- room with a small kitchen was Droska 15, across the street.</span> <span id="s793">I want to be close if something happen, I can always communicate and so on.</span> <span id="s794">So it -- it was very cramped, was me, my wife, and my sister.</span> <span id="s795">And there is a lady here whom I knew, who works with my sister in that department where the jobs are assigned to and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: I thought your sister went to the United States, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: My older sister, I had two.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: My older sister came in 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s801">So this was your -- another sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: And did you have -- did you have plumbing, did you have sanitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: There was water inside, but you had to go to sanitation outside.</span> <span id="s805">Was a faucet for water was.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Did you feel -- I mean, you worked in the food department, so you had enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Not necessarily, I didn’t take anything more than I had.</span> <span id="s808">This was my thing.</span> <span id="s809">I didn’t use my job for personal benefit, until I needed help for my wife.</span> <span id="s810">Until then, no.</span> <span id="s811">I ti -- I could have it easily, I could go to any department and get meat, for bread, and this for thi -- I didn’t feel this is the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s812">You see, as a matter of fact, the war there’s -- before there war there’s so many political organizations, Jewish, Zionist, Bund, and you name it.</span> <span id="s813">And -- and I was active in the Zionist movement before the war, so after the war they came in, oh, this organize, I said, “No, I am a Jew here.</span> <span id="s814">I am not a Zionist, I would not, and I am a Jew here.”</span> <span id="s815">And they see the way it is.</span> <span id="s816">I didn’t -- went away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Were these organizations active in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Were these organizations still active in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Oh, the many -- the -- all organizations were active there.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: The Zionists, and the Bund?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yeah, they all had groups.</span> <span id="s823">I never attended, I never was interested.</span> <span id="s824">What I di -- feel this is the proper thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Do you -- were you aware of efforts to sabotage work in the factories, or for people to try to get out of the ghetto, any kind of resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Not to ob -- not to [indecipherable] no.</span> <span id="s827">I’m no -- people usually works in the different resorts somewhere.</span> <span id="s828">I di -- nobody was there was happy.</span> <span id="s829">Everybody had thousand complaints, probably, but the circumstances were different.</span> <span id="s830">The si -- the interest of Roomkofsky was t-to -- all those resorts work, and operate.</span> <span id="s831">So there was not much.</span> <span id="s832">It could be done if you -- if the -- some people did dishonest things, I’m sure they did.</span> <span id="s833">For example, some people did things where they were not informed -- where they had no right to do anyway.</span> <span id="s834">I found out after the war mainly a few cases like it.</span> <span id="s835">So it is -- but in doing the ghetto, and in the -- during the life on it, was a different story.</span> <span id="s836">I considered myself a member of the ghetto, and I have to live like everybody does.</span> <span id="s837">I didn’t vote any special privilege for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: When you said that you tried to make life as normal as possible, were you shut up from the outside world?</span> <span id="s839">Did you have any communications?</span> <span id="s840">Phone, mail, radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: No.</span> <span id="s842">At one time -- at one time interesting, I -- I had a communication.</span> <span id="s843">The company who represented votie -- represented from Estonia, and so on, their offices were in Berlin.</span> <span id="s844">A company [indecipherable] exterior export and import [indecipherable] shaft.</span> <span id="s845">And they had problems.</span> <span id="s846">At one point they had a problem with a bank.</span> <span id="s847">And somehow, I don’t know how, a letter was delivered to me from this company, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s848">And they’re asking one simple thing, if I could help them with this particular bank, to straighten it out.</span> <span id="s849">So I wrote them back, and I told -- and the letter was delivered.</span> <span id="s850">I wrote them back, and I told them with the circumstances we are, that I have no way of getting contact with anybody, and there nothing what I can do, because I am in such and such conditions here.</span> <span id="s851">In the [indecipherable] I get a letter the -- they didn’t know it, and they are very sorry for it.</span> <span id="s852">So, this whole was my contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Did anybody have radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: There was a fellow what -- Haim Vidovsky was -- was his name.</span> <span id="s855">He listened every day to the BBC.</span> <span id="s856">Nobody had radios officially, no shu -- shu -- should have radio.</span> <span id="s857">But he listened to the BBC, and they made the reports, little reports, and a number of people get them.</span> <span id="s858">I was one of them who get every morning, a little slip of paper, was he picked up from the BBC a day before, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s859">There were not too many people who get it, but I was one of them.</span> <span id="s860">So this fellow, one day finally came, and how they came across that he is the one who is having the news, and the radio and so on, and when he found it out, he hanged himself.</span> <span id="s861">His name was Haim Vidovsky, and he said he didn’t want to fall in life in the Germans hand, but if you break down you might s-say something.</span> <span id="s862">So he took his own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: What kind of information did you get on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: [indecipherable] from the BBC news as far as the war is concerned, what the Germans are doing and so on.</span> <span id="s865">They’re -- that they’re not doing so well, and so on.</span> <span id="s866">And then when they -- it was when the front came near to the ghetto, the Russian stopped, they didn’t want to move in.</span> <span id="s867">The Russian didn’t want to give the Poles the honor of doing something for themself.</span> <span id="s868">So they -- they didn’t go in, and they stopped ahead of time, and this cost many lifes, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: No.</span> <span id="s871">We were kept under information of the -- everything voozes -- voo -- who -- who were sending out, townswas people, that going to the cities to work, the German need people to work, and they can’t afford to, and we don’t have the work here, but they have the work in Germany, and so -- but nobody knew -- I wouldn’t say nobody, I didn’t, maybe some people guessed more than they knew.</span> <span id="s872">And I came to Auschwitz with the same transport what Roomkofsky came.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Were there -- were there a lot of transports into the Lódz ghetto from differ -- you mentioned a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: In 1941, they transport -- they -- they were from the little ghettos, they di -- transport the liquidated -- the able bodied people to work, send into the ghetto, there were not too many, they were little, small ghettos.</span> <span id="s875">But in 1942, there came in the 5,000 from Vienna, five from -- five from Berlin, and 10,000 Prague.</span> <span id="s876">And this was the new -- the newcomers that were came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Had they cleared some space for these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Had they -- had the authorities cleared some space to allow for the new people?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: They had to take [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s881">They had to assign quarters for them, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: But did they have to move certain residents of Lódz out to make room?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s884">They were not group, these persons, wherever there was a place available to put them in, and -- and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Were you aware of the Gypsy area?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Did you provide food for them also?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: The Gypsies were on the Jewish cemetery, they had Gypsies, and they was hanging them there.</span> <span id="s889">That’s all we knew from the -- some people who worked in the Jewish cemetery, who came by and saw that the funeral, something like it, somebody get the word, and they were spreading, gave it to somebody else.</span> <span id="s890">They are not official knowledge, but you knew what they are doing to the Gypsies there.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: So when you mention the cemetery, if somebody died in the ghetto, they actually had a proper burial?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: They take him right away to the cemetery, and bury them, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Did you -- did the Jewish government provide food for the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s897">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Were the Germans in the ghetto, or were only the people -- the Jewish police in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Did they come inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: They w --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: The SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: What kind they were?</span> <span id="s904">They were mostly people belong to the -- to the SS, and criminal politsi what the German call and so on.</span> <span id="s905">But there was no military units as such.</span> <span id="s906">Maybe there was some stationed not far, I am sure.</span> <span id="s907">But in the ghetto, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: So the -- the uv -- the SS, and the criminal police, they stayed outside of the ghetto, and they let the Jewish police handle?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: They were outside, yeah.</span> <span id="s910">In the ghetto, they have certain a number of military, I don’t know which corps and which ranks, who were just to help keep order in it.</span> <span id="s911">And they send [indecipherable] to the fences, or on the fences.</span> <span id="s912">If somebody went close to the fence at evening, they could be shot without asking questions, no problem.</span> <span id="s913">But there were cases, for example, my own experience.</span> <span id="s914">I had a young lady working in our department, her mother was ill, never get out of bed.</span> <span id="s915">But in order for her to get the soup, she had to be registered as a working.</span> <span id="s916">Now they lived not far from the fence, at a part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s917">And there was a time when -- when -- when [indecipherable] knew arbudscard, what they called, for people who working [indecipherable] card.</span> <span id="s918">So, then -- and I want to help her, she was begging to help my mother.</span> <span id="s919">So what I did, I went up as close as I could to the fence, and showed her to the German soldier there, that I’m here on a mission from the ghetto, go to this and this building there, just to check on something, and I am coming out right away back.</span> <span id="s920">So he said, “Okay, go ahead.”</span> <span id="s921">So I went, and I went in there, and I gave her a pass, a working pass, [indecipherable] I never saw her.</span> <span id="s922">And -- and this was the end, then I went out, and I say thank you to him, and I went back.</span> <span id="s923">F -- th -- only -- I was only a couple times when I went so close to the fence, but I -- I want to help her something, and I -- it’s the only way I could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: So you had a certain amount of these passes you could distribute?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: No, only for these particular names.</span> <span id="s926">For these particular names [indecipherable] with anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: But you had one for this lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: I th -- listen, if she was in -- in my department, I want to help her mother, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: But you were -- but -- but I’m asking is, you were able to get a pass for her -- a work pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, that’s what I delivered to her, a pass for that she’s working.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: For you?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: For -- yeah, what I deliver to her, a official passport from the -- from the department who gave her the passport, that she is a working member.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s934">I was just asking if you were able to get these passes for people, and say they were working for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Did you ever go outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So in -- in four years you never went outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: No.</span> <span id="s940">They ghetto was, in other words, inside a bridge over the main road to the other side of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s941">You have to go up and go down on the other side.</span> <span id="s942">The main line what was Zleerska Street, what goes through, went all the way down.</span> <span id="s943">And the Germans were using the roads, but we couldn’t pass it.</span> <span id="s944">So in order to go on the other side, you had to go up on these stairs and go down the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So the ghetto was cut up, divided?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Oh yeah, it was divided, it was divided.</span> <span id="s947">The ghetto was both sides.</span> <span id="s948">For the old, and for the good.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: And you couldn’t cross at the street because that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No way, no, no.</span> <span id="s951">There was no way, it was a barbed wire.</span> <span id="s952">There was no crossing.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Did some of the work groups go outside of the ghetto, or did everybody work inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: If --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: The workgroups.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: The work groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: The work commandoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: The work groups, they went outside the ghetto to work.</span> <span id="s959">They took them in the morning -- not all of them, I’m sure, but this ones what I know, they picked them up in the morning, take them outside the ghetto there to work, and evening brought them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: And there were also a lot of factories inside?</span> <span id="s961">Inside the ghetto, a lot of workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Back inside the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Now, were there regular actions, or deportations inside the ghetto that ha -- did that happen a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Oh yeah, that happened quite a bit.</span> <span id="s965">The German required from Roomkofsky, they want so -- so many people out.</span> <span id="s966">And so -- so he took people out to varian -- and get people together from [indecipherable] from everything they were, and they made groups wherever they get them, made groups to send them out.</span> <span id="s967">But they send them out and we never knew where they send them, if they send them, and so on.</span> <span id="s968">So we never heard from those people.</span> <span id="s969">Was at -- at -- at one time in ’42, they decided to take children away.</span> <span id="s970">And then they came up with the idea to take the children to a orphan house in Germany.</span> <span id="s971">And there is the mothers, [indecipherable] the children, very nice, and give it to -- give them anything, toys, what they can have, and so on.</span> <span id="s972">So when they come to Germany, they can play in the other kindergarten with all kind of thing, he says oh.</span> <span id="s973">Those children were taken away, we never heard, and never saw them, yeah.</span> <span id="s974">After a long time, some children clothing and so on, came in to be washed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s975">I never saw it, but this what I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: When these deportations happened, did you get any advanced warning?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: N-not advanced warning, but they decided they will come and they will [indecipherable] street maybe they had against -- I didn’t know it, but maybe they gi -- of course [indecipherable] I am not sure, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Were there certain groups of people who got deported first, or -- how did they choose who would get deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Who would get deported?</span> <span id="s980">They choose for -- where they took the people [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s981">Mostly they try to get rid of the -- of people from the underworld and so on.</span> <span id="s982">But they just shoot -- they had to have a number of people.</span> <span id="s983">And some people were [indecipherable] some people were there, I don’t know where, but they had no -- there are no special selections, or choose who.</span> <span id="s984">If somebody did -- did something wrong, he was included in [indecipherable] shipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: They didn’t take the women first, or the old people?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: This was a -- we arrived at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s987">From the ghetto, no.</span> <span id="s988">They took everybody who was -- not able to do something, whatever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So they took people who were not able to work, is that what you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Now, my understanding is that after this big aktion with the children, and when they s -- sometime after, I guess 1942, most of the people in the ghetto were working people, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Did -- wa -- did -- did the administrations change, did the mood change around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: When you say administration, you mean Jewish administration?</span> <span id="s995">No, it was going on the same way.</span> <span id="s996">The Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: They still [indecipherable] everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: The Jewish organization tried to keep all -- all the factories working.</span> <span id="s999">All the factories were doing something to -- for Germany, what they needed.</span> <span id="s1000">And this was the interest.</span> <span id="s1001">And one time the German came up with an idea, they -- to -- to build -- frame build houses.</span> <span id="s1002">So they start with a special department to build houses what can be built and transferred to Germany.</span> <span id="s1003">But this was a big thing.</span> <span id="s1004">And when an inspection came, and I happened to be there when an inspection came -- everybody had to be there, so they show, so all the people, from the officers, and the [indecipherable] saw group of people working on it.</span> <span id="s1005">So when one of the Germans tried to pick up such a piece of thing, so it’s -- it is heavy, how can we do it?</span> <span id="s1006">So there’s a what we are -- the [indecipherable] must help.</span> <span id="s1007">And this is the way [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Did they -- when they wanted to make deportations, would somebody come to your office and say, can you spare so many workers, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: That didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: They -- they simple -- they gave orders to their departments, give me so and so many people.</span> <span id="s1012">And then this was a matter of the insight, relation, or fanshee, whatever it is, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1013">I was confronted with this quite a few times, and I’m -- I most cases get away, not having to -- to comply, but in one case, [indecipherable] needed a name.</span> <span id="s1014">The reason?</span> <span id="s1015">I knew her sister’s boyfriend was a bigshot in the -- in the Jewish police there, and he will get her out.</span> <span id="s1016">And he did.</span> <span id="s1017">But somebody else went.</span> <span id="s1018">So if you helped anybody, you put somebody in.</span> <span id="s1019">So it was such a -- I mentioned wa -- a ex-coworker Mr. Vinerige long time ago, he was coming in the morning into my office, sitting in the corner.</span> <span id="s1020">Was his, nobody else.</span> <span id="s1021">And finally -- finally he was on one time when they came, and they took him away with everybody.</span> <span id="s1022">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: So these deportations, they were pretty regular from 1942 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yeah, they were going on mostly regularly.</span> <span id="s1025">They want to reduce the number of Jews in the ghetto, and the liquidation were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: You knew people who were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Did you know many people were -- who were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: With what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Did you -- you knew many people who were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: From -- from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s1034">Every time they took away somebody, is -- everyone is a world for themself.</span> <span id="s1035">And -- but it was -- it was part of the ghetto life.</span> <span id="s1036">And people who were -- somebody was taken away from the family, whatever it is, after awhile they -- lot of people, when somebody died, they kept the body at home, they didn’t report it to died, in order to get the food ration card.</span> <span id="s1037">[indecipherable] cases like it.</span> <span id="s1038">Although it came to a point where death didn’t mean a tragedy.</span> <span id="s1039">It -- somebody’s tragedy was somebody else’s benefit.</span> <span id="s1040">The morale, sentimentality went through quite a big change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: I think before we stopped you were talking about sort of a strange -- sort of a new morality, because people had unusual choices, so that people dying might be a blessing to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1044">Any -- any other thoughts you have on that?</span> <span id="s1045">Any other examples?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: People just kept the bodies at home, they didn’t -- they didn’t get them buried, in order to -- they would -- to get the food ration, whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: From your office, your food distribution was to centers, not to individuals, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1049">From my office, you see, we had distribution of food, was -- was special department, Sheesheesky, what I mentioned to you before.</span> <span id="s1050">And he figured out we have so much food, we have so many heads, this we can do.</span> <span id="s1051">And this is the way it was assigned.</span> <span id="s1052">Although this was not exactly what the German thought we should give everybody whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1053">Did we have more, we have more potatoes, so we give more.</span> <span id="s1054">If we -- was a time, whatever get, we get a lot of shipment of potatoes, this was helping, naturally.</span> <span id="s1055">This way people could get a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1056">But the [indecipherable] plants, the -- the -- the season, how much to give was based on the available food, and the number of heads in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: But toward the end, towards 1944 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: -- the ghetto was much smaller, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: In ’44, the ghetto was smaller.</span> <span id="s1061">The ghetto opened up, I don’t remember exactly, with 160,000 over there with the -- I th -- remember how much it came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1062">Then, lot of people went to Warsaw, and -- because there they were relatives, whatever it is, and they hoped Warsaw will not have such a tough time like Lódz, so -- so they went.</span> <span id="s1063">So it was -- fluctuated, and we never knew exactly how many people we have.</span> <span id="s1064">The food department, the Sheesheesky department knew how much talons he’s giving out.</span> <span id="s1065">But that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Okay, so what -- so what happened to you next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Well, next what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Well, is there anything else you want to tell me about the ghetto, or do you want to tell me how you happened to leave it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: And what -- and with the ghetto, do you have any specific questions I mi -- I think I know quite about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1070">There were the department of working, and lot of people who after the war immigrated, gave different recollection, different thing.</span> <span id="s1071">And this mostly cut in in my period from after the war in Germany.</span> <span id="s1072">When we were liberated from the camps, my idea was I knew at this time the [indecipherable] 19 people, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1073">Anyway, and I thought I will try to do what I can to help.</span> <span id="s1074">This is what was -- what it is.</span> <span id="s1075">Not having an idea how many there are.</span> <span id="s1076">There were a lot of -- more people than we expected.</span> <span id="s1077">And different people came to work with us, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1078">And some people -- but in a case like this, in a time like this, not in a case, the people who have more experience with doing illegalities, are better active doing something.</span> <span id="s1079">For example, we have -- we -- I organized the office to help people from concentration camp in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1080">What you call vicasette Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1081">Officially I am with hauptaushus [indecipherable] with a haftlinger.</span> <span id="s1082">And this -- came in a fellow, and then there wa -- in the concentration camp, there were green winkles, and red winkles.</span> <span id="s1083">The green were criminals, red was political.</span> <span id="s1084">No -- nothing -- he had a man working with us by the name of Geerob Ganda he passed away.</span> <span id="s1085">And he was a green winkle, criminal.</span> <span id="s1086">But he belonged to a youth organization who worked anti-Hitler, and they made -- they rob banks, and some of whatever they could.</span> <span id="s1087">And one time he [indecipherable], he was in the [indecipherable] and he was stamped with the criminal winkle.</span> <span id="s1088">But his explanation, I have it from him, his explanation was he did it for the group, what tried to help the -- [indecipherable] other people.</span> <span id="s1089">He did -- after the war he had to run away, had to -- went to Israel, he went back, came back.</span> <span id="s1090">He died in Hanover.</span> <span id="s1091">And so this fella knew how to handle those cases.</span> <span id="s1092">Was a -- even -- Ge-Germans basically would like to benefit, and when they have connection with a -- with a office, with a conshertoes, and they were able to get a little bit different food on certain occasions, they went all for it.</span> <span id="s1093">So -- but all those people who were in the camps as -- as political, they were actually from political activities.</span> <span id="s1094">A lot of people who were from the criminal thing were political in whatever their actions.</span> <span id="s1095">So, is the -- the [indecipherable] they forget to take the bot for.</span> <span id="s1096">And for this Geerab Ganda, he knew so much from the [indecipherable] that I was inclined to believe him.</span> <span id="s1097">He was able to manage the German’s authorities to give us more food, more this, more this.</span> <span id="s1098">He was able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Well, let’s go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yes, ma’am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: We’ve jumped a little bit to after the war.</span> <span id="s1102">You stayed in the ghetto how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: We -- I went to the ghetto in the beginning, after my father’s death in 17th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Then I was t -- 1940 -- then they came in and gave me 10 minutes to leave the house, and only take what I can.</span> <span id="s1106">And I left the ghetto on the 28th of August, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Can you tell me how that came about, you leaving the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1109">They were -- we were [indecipherable] getting out of the ghetto, they were setting transport every day to send out.</span> <span id="s1110">And there -- there was -- they decided to liquefy the ghetto, and just leave about 50,000 people to do the cleaning wa -- to clean up, or something like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: 50,000.</span> <span id="s1113">This was at this time they estimate 50,000 Jews to leave there to do the cleaning job after everybody left.</span> <span id="s1114">And so they took -- if the numbers are right, but this is the numbers we were given.</span> <span id="s1115">Not 50,000, but 50 people, pardon me.</span> <span id="s1116">Skip the thousands.</span> <span id="s1117">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1118">And so it was at this time they were organizing transports every day, and it came to this, my transport left on the 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: No.</span> <span id="s1121">They loaded it in the -- close the transport cars, no windows or nothing, put us in as many as they could, pushed in, lock the door, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1122">And we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1123">I didn’t know where we are going.</span> <span id="s1124">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1125">Had a lot of people -- not lot of, but a few people suffocated there.</span> <span id="s1126">And they died there, in it.</span> <span id="s1127">No, we came after, and I don’t -- at this time I lost the count of time, if it was a day or two, when they finally -- when it came to a point and they opened the gate and let us out.</span> <span id="s1128">So then, this was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Was [indecipherable] was a reception, a big field.</span> <span id="s1131">And we had to go down from -- from the cars, leave everything in the cars what we are left -- what we have left, just go down and form two lines, mens one side, women to the other side.</span> <span id="s1132">And then, on the head of it stood the German, the famous -- oh boy, and he make selection, with the finger.</span> <span id="s1133">Right, left, right, left.</span> <span id="s1134">The right what he assumed were good to work.</span> <span id="s1135">To me he hesitates for a little while, but put me to the right, to the working.</span> <span id="s1136">And to the -- and the -- they -- they did the same thing to the women’s line, too.</span> <span id="s1137">And the one who were taken to the left, never heard about them, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Who -- who else went with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: When we came to Auschwitz, was my sister, and my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Who else went with you to Auschwitz, to this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: To Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1142">My si -- my wife and my sister, Rachel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: And what happened when you all lined up, what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: They lined up -- I was in one line, and the women was in the -- in the other line.</span> <span id="s1145">And this here the last time when we -- when we saw each other.</span> <span id="s1146">We looked at each other, but we had to move, move, move, move.</span> <span id="s1147">And this the way it was.</span> <span id="s1148">And never saw before, never saw after.</span> <span id="s1149">It’s the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Were there other prisoners around when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No.</span> <span id="s1152">We didn’t see it, but later when we went in, and we were taken through the halls to wash, to be shaved, to clean our [indecipherable] then there were some prisoners working, who were there before, working in a establishments there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: What were you thinking this was all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: What did you think this was all about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: What was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: What did you think of all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: What I think this?</span> <span id="s1159">Yeah, no thinking at all at this time, you don’t think.</span> <span id="s1160">You following the certain way of life, and thinking -- no, I don’t think anybody want to think, and nobody was thinking.</span> <span id="s1161">We knew this is nothing pleasant for us, and what will happen, who knows?</span> <span id="s1162">Roomkofsky was with the same train.</span> <span id="s1163">They took him off, his father and adopted son, and so on, and they put him in a van.</span> <span id="s1164">I saw them take it into the van.</span> <span id="s1165">He came to Auschwitz with letters of re-recommendation from Veevofe to treat him well.</span> <span id="s1166">So this way he was taken to a van.</span> <span id="s1167">This is a van, when they start to move, gas comes in, and they suffocated.</span> <span id="s1168">I don’t meet -- I didn’t meet anybody who ever saw Roomkofsky afterwards.</span> <span id="s1169">So, this was the answer to me about Roomkofsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: When he went in the van, though, you didn’t know it was a gas van at the time, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: No, but I saw a special type of van, and so my assumption was this is the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: So after you were chosen to go to the right, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Then we were taken to Auschwitz and given numbers.</span> <span id="s1174">They -- in 1944 was the last time they tattooed numbers, they didn’t have any time to do it.</span> <span id="s1175">My number was 52962, a little metal tag, and it was a sh -- painted on on this uniform, 52962, this is my number, under this number I was known, there no name.</span> <span id="s1176">And -- and then we were sent, the first transport what we were sent was a thousand people what were sent to continue [indecipherable] worker to the rubber factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: So how long did you stay in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: In Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1179">I would say the most five days.</span> <span id="s1180">I don’t think any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: So you didn’t work or anything there, any [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Oh no, in Auschwitz I didn’t work at all.</span> <span id="s1183">Just trying to get out of there.</span> <span id="s1184">The smell in Auschwitz was not bearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Burned flesh, burning everything.</span> <span id="s1187">Came on from Birkenau, where the -- where the gas chambers were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: And you knew what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yeah, and they know about -- there was us people what they take to work.</span> <span id="s1190">And then when they called -- when they call who is a -- for example, a carpenter, everybody was a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1191">When they call whatever it is, everybody is a specialist.</span> <span id="s1192">For this arrangement, some people made it, some people, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: So how did they choose you to go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Oh, to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Wait, let me just ask a question, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: They sent a group of thousand people, and I was in the area count a thing -- a thousand people, it was not a individual choice, it was a count of thousand people, you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Okay, so what happened, what did -- what did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: And then we were sent to continue [indecipherable] work, as I said, continue [indecipherable] work -- employed people from -- from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1199">And the SS get paid for, they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1200">So we were sent there, but they need -- there was a camp set up not far, three miles, maybe two miles, so we could walk every night home, and every night go back to -- and every day go back to work.</span> <span id="s1201">There were 12 Polish, they did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: -- they couldn’t tattoo any more, I think the last time they tattoo was ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Okay, so you got to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Okay, then we wer -- then we went there, in the -- in a [indecipherable] they have set up a camp not far, to be the barracks for us, and we had to work in the factory there.</span> <span id="s1206">Now the factory was -- was producing all kind of rubber goods for the Germans, and the -- and the main thing was to produce [indecipherable] for tiles.</span> <span id="s1207">So the rubber was coming down from the third floor, liquid, and came on the current floor, and there were big machines turning the thing, and -- and they get harden, and we had to carve them with knives to make pieces of them, so they can go through again, and so on.</span> <span id="s1208">Now, they were mostly -- they were civilian workers too, who worked with it, mostly Poles.</span> <span id="s1209">The Poles were coming into work every time, in shift.</span> <span id="s1210">They leave [indecipherable] far, but they were brought in to work, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Let me ask you where was this factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: In Hanover.</span> <span id="s1213">It’s a big, big territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Was it a sub-camp of a larger camp, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: What, the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Was it -- this -- the -- the factory was separate, it was a German factory, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: A German factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Was -- were your barracks part of any -- you need to sit back, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Oh, pardon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Were -- were your barracks part of any larger concentration camp, was it a sub-camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1222">We were all part of Neuengamme, all the camps around the area belonged to -- they had -- the headquarter of Neuengamme, in the area.</span> <span id="s1223">So -- and we were part of it.</span> <span id="s1224">So we were there, and we had to work two shifts.</span> <span id="s1225">Now, working on the shifts, cutting the rubber with the -- the Poles who were coming there, the Poles, they were volunteers to work, and so on, they get gloves, and things to protect themself, we didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1226">So we have to somewhat burn the finger, burn the finger.</span> <span id="s1227">So when he will cutting it, try to do the best of the thing like this.</span> <span id="s1228">And this time, somehow, I attracted the attention of a g-German master, who was going around see how everybody is doing, and he spoke German, and I know German, so we get in -- in a little conversation, and -- and he became interested, and visit me as often as he could.</span> <span id="s1229">At one time, th -- and then he comes in one time and tells me he -- he is being transferred, and if I need anything what -- what he can help me, I should contact him.</span> <span id="s1230">I said, “Okay, who are you, where should I contact you?”</span> <span id="s1231">So there was a running sign around in the office there, Herr towans commarada edisnow pay.</span> <span id="s1232">The -- the man who the -- the trusted men from the National Socialistic Party is he [indecipherable] me.</span> <span id="s1233">But later on he confide to me he was never a Nazi, he never belonged to coo -- but this was his job with the factory, he worked there for many years.</span> <span id="s1234">So then one time, during, I think, yeah, then in seven -- we worked on machines -- they were special machines to make amon, and this happened with -- and I finished my shift, and we were taken back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1235">After a little while, a SS man came to the room and called my number.</span> <span id="s1236">So, come.</span> <span id="s1237">So I go.</span> <span id="s1238">Followed him back to the factory.</span> <span id="s1239">And turned out to be they had a few machines working upstairs, and the machines jumped somehow, they couldn’t make them go.</span> <span id="s1240">There was a -- a German master, and his assistant, and they couldn’t make the machines go.</span> <span id="s1241">I was working on this type of machines five at a time, and I knew the machines.</span> <span id="s1242">Because the Poles came, and they were going hiding, and I worked for them.</span> <span id="s1243">So they gave me a piece of bread once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1244">So -- then -- so I come there, and then -- and they’re stuck in the work, and they couldn’t make them, and the master comes up, and his eyes, you could see right away, he’s not a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1245">And he told me, “You know how to work these machines?”</span> <span id="s1246">I say, “Yes, I know.”</span> <span id="s1247">“Do you know how to work one machine?”</span> <span id="s1248">I say yes.</span> <span id="s1249">“Go work.”</span> <span id="s1250">I went, put up a machine.</span> <span id="s1251">After I let the machine go, I didn’t ask any question, put up another machine.</span> <span id="s1252">I was working, and they were looking, and they work with their machines, and trying to fix it.</span> <span id="s1253">I had it that this night I am working on three machines the same time, some [indecipherable] and they couldn’t make their own machine go.</span> <span id="s1254">So this -- this aggravated them very, very much.</span> <span id="s1255">Okay by then the morning, we had to go back and come back, I had to wait -- no, I didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s1256">They told me you stay here, lie down for a couple hours, then you’re back to your shifts.</span> <span id="s1257">Okay.</span> <span id="s1258">This was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1259">So then I didn’t see him, this friend of my, I seen him for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1260">One time I ge -- daytime, an SS man came in to the iddel, and called my number.</span> <span id="s1261">And I was working.</span> <span id="s1262">Come.</span> <span id="s1263">I had to follow him.</span> <span id="s1264">So I followed him to a big, big office, a long table where there sitting maybe 12 or 16 people around the -- around the table there.</span> <span id="s1265">They were probably given a positive information about me, that I can help, and they were trying to set me up for a good job for -- for after the war.</span> <span id="s1266">So, first of all they give me a chair to sit down, and had a little conversation in German, just to check my German.</span> <span id="s1267">So we’re talking.</span> <span id="s1268">Then finally they came to the point, that is my knowledge of German, and with my experience in this work, I can build up myself a great career for after the war, and work with them, and do it -- help them [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s1269">So I was very pleased, I was -- thank you for the acknowledgement, and -- and polite conversation, and I was dismissed not knowing exactly what there is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1270">There is [indecipherable] they wanted to train me as a knowledgeable man who helped to run the machines, and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s1271">I was transferred to the upper place where all the rubber were mixed.</span> <span id="s1272">I was very little [indecipherable] but many other things.</span> <span id="s1273">And there with was everything what you put in in the cooking machine was -- made me -- I wa -- black up and down, I couldn’t wash it out for weeks.</span> <span id="s1274">See, the question there [indecipherable], but at the time this -- and when this was going on for -- for quite awhile until November 30.</span> <span id="s1275">November 30, 1944.</span> <span id="s1276">November 30 they came up and told us the department is not happy with all of you, so we are going to transfer you to -- to a different.</span> <span id="s1277">And the office was a walking distance, probably an hour.</span> <span id="s1278">We walked to a place called Ahlen.</span> <span id="s1279">Ahlen was a -- a ex-asphalt mine.</span> <span id="s1280">There was not acting -- nothing there.</span> <span id="s1281">They wanted to create a factory in this asphalt mine, so it has to be dynamited, put hole to dynamite, explode it, take out all the junk, all that, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1282">And make it clear, which [indecipherable] this.</span> <span id="s1283">And finally they came to the point when is clear enough, and they wanted to set up -- so we worked with dynamite, with all kind of things for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1284">And [indecipherable] and every time to -- to take out, push up, blows up, and so at one time there was -- I am pushing up and I’m -- and I’m trying to go back, with pushing oh -- not by myself, with a few other people, and the German watch man was -- wa-was saying, give it back to me.</span> <span id="s1285">[indecipherable], so I say, “Gere shtatin zeebeeta.”</span> <span id="s1286">Gere shtatin is a nice German expression for please, excuse me.</span> <span id="s1287">He tells, “Oh, bitte, bitte.”</span> <span id="s1288">From this time we became buddies.</span> <span id="s1289">Every time I pass by he want to have a conversation with me.</span> <span id="s1290">And we were talking a lot, and he was put in -- he was out of the army, service a long time, but they needed a young people for the front, so they took all the -- all the la -- people, put them in the SS to guard the camps.</span> <span id="s1291">This is the way it was.</span> <span id="s1292">And this was going on until we cleared the outside mine, made floors, made a factory, and then -- and put in machinery, so they started to work, for this daily, daily hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: This camp Ahlen, this was also a sub-camp of Neuengamme?</span> <span id="s1294">Also part --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1296">Every -- all the camps were, they were part of Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s1297">Neuengamme was the head camp for the whole territory, for the -- all the a -- other.</span> <span id="s1298">The Neuengamme h-head office was in Hamburg, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: How were your living conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: The living condition were excellent.</span> <span id="s1301">We had the coffee pot in the morning to -- in -- in the rag -- the -- they brought in a big jar with coffee, and made sure that everybody receives coffee.</span> <span id="s1302">Then they turned around the whole cage on the floor, and we had to scrub the floor with the coffee.</span> <span id="s1303">Sometime we get the coffee [indecipherable], sometime not.</span> <span id="s1304">But this the way life was.</span> <span id="s1305">And then this -- and then we went to work, on these floors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Where -- did -- how many people were in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: In the -- in each barracks there were -- there were a few barracks.</span> <span id="s1308">In -- in -- in each barrack there was about 30 - 32 people, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: You have beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: The wa -- yeah, there was a bunk you could lay down.</span> <span id="s1311">Two story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: All by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: But -- but you could lay down, yeah.</span> <span id="s1314">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: You get food later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: And food then -- then -- at work we -- we had to go for lunch and get food, and so on, yeah.</span> <span id="s1317">The soup -- this -- the -- mo-most of the food was of a soup.</span> <span id="s1318">Could hardly find a piece of potato there, but listen, this is the one we have, and this -- we have to survive, to go on with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Was this camp only men?</span> <span id="s1320">Only men worked here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Only men, only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: About how -- how many men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Talking about the Germans, I knew Germany from before the war.</span> <span id="s1326">Etiquette is nice, excellent people, and so on.</span> <span id="s1327">This type, let’s say for example, the -- the cassette Auschwitz what we organize was th -- to help people from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1328">One day comes in a German farmer, and gives me a bill, and want me to pay it, for potatoes he delivered to the SS.</span> <span id="s1329">So I tell, oh, and what happened to the potatoes?</span> <span id="s1330">You people ate it, so why shouldn’t you pay for?</span> <span id="s1331">This was their mentality.</span> <span id="s1332">Basically, they were jealous people.</span> <span id="s1333">If somebody had something, they want and so on.</span> <span id="s1334">I had one time -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Are you talking about after the war now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yeah, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: I had -- one time, I had no car, and there were no car to get somewhere.</span> <span id="s1339">One time comes to me a German, and say, “I know where a car is,” and tells me of a farmer that he has in his thing hidden, covered up a car.</span> <span id="s1340">The following there I went over there, a few people, and we took home the car.</span> <span id="s1341">But this is characteristic for them, they were jealous of another, and if somebody had something, they liked to have it, too.</span> <span id="s1342">So it was a --a different type of experience with Germans between these two groups of German.</span> <span id="s1343">I cannot tell in -- tell the different groups that different people out of different groups, whatever it is, but this is the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: So let’s go back a minute to Ahlen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And also I know you had -- you seemed to have conversations and contact with Germans there, also at continental [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1347">How much information were you getting about what was happening in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: What was happening in the war?</span> <span id="s1349">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1350">This is a point I never touched.</span> <span id="s1351">I was only interested if he could help me to find out what will happen next to us.</span> <span id="s1352">So he told [indecipherable], tomorrow I will let you know.</span> <span id="s1353">And next time when he came to lead us to the toc, he told me the -- the -- the camp is to be set for evacuation on the sixth of April.</span> <span id="s1354">But from the outset what happen, I never went in with any German, no matter how friendly, in politics.</span> <span id="s1355">Was a dangerous area, and I stood away from it.</span> <span id="s1356">I j -- so this is -- the only thing was that I find out for him when the camp will be evacuated.</span> <span id="s1357">And the camp was evacuated officially on Friday, April the sixth, 1945.</span> <span id="s1358">And then when -- then you see, the -- the camp was in the middle of a field.</span> <span id="s1359">People were going by Sundays for walks, and so was going on and so.</span> <span id="s1360">There were nobody who didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1361">But when the camp was evacuated on April the sixth, the evacuated, I mean that the marching people went, and we were left who -- who couldn’t walk, or couldn’t march.</span> <span id="s1362">Then, people from all sides came in, disconnected electrical wiring from -- from -- from the fences, and trying to be nice and help us, they brought in coffee.</span> <span id="s1363">We says, okay.</span> <span id="s1364">But then our young people, very unpatient, run out, start to go around, look.</span> <span id="s1365">And I begged them don’t go, the German are still around somewhere.</span> <span id="s1366">What happened we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1367">No, we know we are here tomor -- and on the following day, Saturday, came an SS man with a truck, and loaded us on the truck, we were 19 people from this camp.</span> <span id="s1368">And these 19 people, [indecipherable] drove us to a place called the Shizenplatz.</span> <span id="s1369">The Shizenplatz was a place where the German SS were leaving their officers, and everything and so on.</span> <span id="s1370">So, he drove us there, and there before the gate is a general, a professional, looks almost gray, standing.</span> <span id="s1371">And here Plotsam and I was on the truck.</span> <span id="s1372">Here Plotsam, he get that here was some 19 people for execution.</span> <span id="s1373">And the general told him, “Look, we are killing people in a war, but we are not killing people who -- who -- who we’re not fighting.</span> <span id="s1374">Your friends left already.”</span> <span id="s1375">So he told us to go off the truck, and he told the [indecipherable] and he’s all off.</span> <span id="s1376">So’s the last I saw about him -- of him.</span> <span id="s1377">Not far away was a French POW camp, and they motioned to us to come close to them.</span> <span id="s1378">And this was a big -- a big help to us.</span> <span id="s1379">So we went over there, and they told us, “Look, you never know if the German come back or not.</span> <span id="s1380">This uniform is not good.</span> <span id="s1381">You have to go change uniforms.”</span> <span id="s1382">I said okay, how, where?</span> <span id="s1383">So, “This is a little building there, break in.</span> <span id="s1384">There are the uniforms what we are wearing.”</span> <span id="s1385">So I took my people, and we walk in there, and we took uniform, changed the uniforms, and put them in and joined them.</span> <span id="s1386">They would be very -- they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s1387">They were trying to help us with little bit what they had, but they didn’t have too much either.</span> <span id="s1388">So -- it was a -- a certain type of a good experience in bad times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Next this was -- this already was the next ist day on Wednesday, the 11th of April.</span> <span id="s1391">A lady comes running in, and say there are Americanos in the areas, be the American [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1392">So, naturally I got the courage to go.</span> <span id="s1393">So we went to center of the town, and there I saw the American tanks, first time I saw them, saw on the -- the lemt.</span> <span id="s1394">And so I up -- I approached the officer in charge there where it was, and I told them as far as I knew we are 19 people, and we need some assistance, we don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1395">So he -- talking a little bit German, a little bit -- he must have been Jewish, too, or -- or he -- or he knew a little bit more [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1396">So he told me to be the liaison, that he cannot talk to all 19 people, but a be -- and he appointed me -- gave me a piece of paper, so I can walk after the time where is walking not permitted.</span> <span id="s1397">And so then try to keep informed.</span> <span id="s1398">Then we went to a place there were people there sitting down, that we were actually housing.</span> <span id="s1399">Still, ours had benches and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1400">And there we were sitting, and evening American soldiers came to visit us.</span> <span id="s1401">And there -- pardon me -- and there where it was -- thank you -- and there where it was, my first disappointment, what it is?</span> <span id="s1402">We are sitting, black soldiers, white soldiers.</span> <span id="s1403">Comes in a white soldier, shakes hands with every white, not with the black.</span> <span id="s1404">No, it didn’t slide good with me, but there’s the way it is, I don’t what to think.</span> <span id="s1405">That’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s1406">And they -- the black people didn’t see anything abnormal in it.</span> <span id="s1407">This was the life what they had.</span> <span id="s1408">Then, among them was a fellow asked me if I have somebody in New York, I say, “Sure, I have a sister in New York.”</span> <span id="s1409">“Do you remember where she live?”</span> <span id="s1410">I gave him -- yeah, gave him the a -- the address.</span> <span id="s1411">His wife lived a couple blocks from there.</span> <span id="s1412">He notified his wife, and he went away, I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1413">But he notify -- later, I found out when I came to the States, he notified his wife, and she contacted my sister.</span> <span id="s1414">I never saw even the mo -- the units went off, so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1415">And this was -- we were sitting there, and trying to house the -- and we had to eat something, so we found them whole rice, cages of rice.</span> <span id="s1416">I never cooked rice in my life.</span> <span id="s1417">I didn’t know when you put in a little bit, it grows up, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1418">So I put in a little bit, and I got plenty of it, but this is -- the first time you learn, next time, do better.</span> <span id="s1419">And this is where life is -- slowly went back until we were able to resettle from there.</span> <span id="s1420">We settled in -- in -- in -- in Hanover himself, in the town, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Did they find you housing in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Did the military find you housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: No, no, no, they were -- we sa -- went into town, and wherever apartments available, we get in.</span> <span id="s1425">And there were many apartments available.</span> <span id="s1426">And we were not -- we were only 19 people, so was not a big deal.</span> <span id="s1427">And some of them are still live in Germany.</span> <span id="s1428">There was my experience in camp, the doctors.</span> <span id="s1429">There was a -- a sickum, what they called, and there was a doctor, a fellow who I knew from ghetto, who -- he did one year to graduate medical school from -- from Italy, but he was only a shop.</span> <span id="s1430">In the ghetto, he was working as a doctor.</span> <span id="s1431">He was very smart, and very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s1432">Dr. Faglovitch, his name now is Fago.</span> <span id="s1433">And the -- the order -- yeah, was a -- then there was a Dr. Vondaykunt in Belgium, picked up on the street, send him away to the camp, his family never knew where he is, what he is.</span> <span id="s1434">This I found out after the war when they came looking for him.</span> <span id="s1435">So -- but he was a doctor, and he became ill one time, himself, to the Jewish Dr. Faglovitch, who was not a [indecipherable] doctor told the German he had typhus.</span> <span id="s1436">What are you talking, what di-did you know about typhus?</span> <span id="s1437">So, not -- they went away, it’s not typhus.</span> <span id="s1438">Then he get worse, so I called [indecipherable] they -- they brought a doctor from outside, a German doctor from outside, and he says, yeah, that was typhus.</span> <span id="s1439">It was too late already, couldn’t save him any more.</span> <span id="s1440">Later on I find out more about him because the family came to look for him, and somehow they were directed to me, said maybe I knew something more about, but I was in the same group, and so on, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Okay, well let’s -- tell me a little bit about what you did with this freedom you finally had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: What -- what were you doing at this point?</span> <span id="s1444">You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: After the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: -- you’re in Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: I organized the -- the office of the cartsertosious.</span> <span id="s1450">This means to help -- to help the contact with all people, with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1451">There was no way that th -- a survivor and a German could get together without a fight.</span> <span id="s1452">Never happen.</span> <span id="s1453">And I had to avoid this.</span> <span id="s1454">And what we did at this time, the German authorities had orders from the American, then from the British to help us towelon to look for people.</span> <span id="s1455">So everybody had to get a -- 10 mark, and a [indecipherable] to buy food and so on I get this.</span> <span id="s1456">And tried to tasser.</span> <span id="s1457">She was one of them, she was going looking for -- for her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Estelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: And -- and pe -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1460">And people, they are going.</span> <span id="s1461">So I saw the -- how do you do when they have to work to the Germans, sign for the thing, get a card.</span> <span id="s1462">It didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1463">I saw this would be murder.</span> <span id="s1464">So I told them, “Okay, look, why don’t you give me the cards, the money, and I will deliver you the following day [indecipherable] complacent.”</span> <span id="s1465">And this -- and this work this way.</span> <span id="s1466">So I was every day what I was paid ousen to.</span> <span id="s1467">I gave them a list with the signatures, and they replaced me the money with the things on it, [indecipherable] looking, couldn’t even.</span> <span id="s1468">So this way we -- we had the cardset office working to help people as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Now, were you in a -- you were in a central office in Hanover, and people found out about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: We -- we -- yeah, we organized [indecipherable] office, in middle of it on -- was a empty few rooms, and -- and this is well known, if I -- the way I’m all people [indecipherable] they are.</span> <span id="s1471">I [indecipherable] if there was -- if there is time for it, for a little episode.</span> <span id="s1472">The British relief -- first were American, came in from HIAS, from the other groups, and Joint help.</span> <span id="s1473">Then came the British relief in, who took over.</span> <span id="s1474">And they were -- in the British was a rabbi Dr. Monk, who kept with me a contact, mostly of religious things, what he want, where anybody needs something, so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1475">And one time he comes for me, and says -- I take away your time with it?</span> <span id="s1476">Am I take away your time with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: It’s okay -- it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: And one time he -- he comes to me, and say he has to go for two weeks to London, and gives me a telephone number, if something -- I will need something with a religious thing, to call this
