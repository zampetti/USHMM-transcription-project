Alright.</span> <span id="s12">I was born in Bendzin, Poland.</span> <span id="s13">It was a town of about 75,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">It was very close to the German border.</span> <span id="s15">I was the youngest of seven children.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">I had five sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s17">My father had a large family: there were about twelve or thirteen children.</span> <span id="s18">My mother’s side I think there must have been about six or seven brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s19">You see it was quite a large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q.</span> <span id="s21">They all lived in the same small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A. All lived around in the area.</span> <span id="s23">Yes they did.</span> <span id="s24">When I was growing up my father was very religious.</span> <span id="s25">He used to go every Saturday to Shul (synagogue).</span> <span id="s26">He used to wear the special caftan, on Saturday.</span> <span id="s27">Not every day, just on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q.</span> <span id="s29">The large, long black robe with the big brimmed hat?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A. No, no, no Conservative.</span> <span id="s31">He wasn’t very Orthodox, but Orthodox.</span> <span id="s32">Our home was strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s33">We couldn’t put the lights on Saturday, or the switches or make fires to cook something.</span> <span id="s34">Everything was pre-cooked on Friday for the next day.</span> <span id="s35">I was a happy child growing up.</span> <span id="s36">Going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q.</span> <span id="s38">During your growing up years do you remember any anti-Semitic events that happened in your town or that happened to you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A. Well, the Polish people were known for being anti-Semitics.</span> <span id="s40">Their second word used to be “Jew Jew” or in Polish it was Zydow.</span> <span id="s41">And remember things like… We used to go behind a very good soccer team in our town, name was Haomer (Hashomer?)</span> <span id="s42">.</span> <span id="s43">And they were an A-class team…used to go to the small towns over there and they knew you were Jew and they used to throw stones.</span> <span id="s44">And if you were wining, you had to leave ten, fifteen minutes before so you shouldn’t get stoned to death.</span> <span id="s45">So that was some experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q.</span> <span id="s47">You talk about it now almost laughingly.</span> <span id="s48">But what was I like to live under those</span></p> <p><span id="s49">conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A. Well, our hometown was mostly Jewish people.</span> <span id="s51">Most of the store, the business, the store owners were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s52">The surrounding areas, there were the Polish people, the farm people, who used to bring in their goods to the city to sell and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s53">And in return they used to buy…like clothing or shoes.</span> <span id="s54">This was all in mostly Jewish hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q. I don’t think you said what your father did to make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A. My father was in the empty barrel business.</span> <span id="s57">He used to buy up empty barrels from all kinds of firms…like from places where they sold herrings, so they had empty barrels.</span> <span id="s58">From places where they had…they sold tar, tar which you used for the roads, he bought up those barrels.</span> <span id="s59">For barrels…he bought up…from oil…heating.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q. Cooking oil?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A. Cooking oil, all kinds and then he sold it back to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q. I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A.</span> <span id="s64">That was his profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q.</span> <span id="s66">How much education, formal education, did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A.</span> <span id="s68">When the war started 1939, I just finished, which called in Poland, poceknaskoya which is equal almost high school.</span> <span id="s69">Just about…above Junior High would I say.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q. Were you an apprentice in anything?</span> <span id="s71">Were you being trained for any particular life?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A. Well, I was supposed to…I had a…My brother-in-law was about 20…he was married to my oldest sister.</span> <span id="s73">He was a bookkeeper in a big factory.</span> <span id="s74">One of the biggest factories in Poland for bolts, nail and mesh wire.</span> <span id="s75">I was very good in school in drawing.</span> <span id="s76">So I supposed to go there…similar like maybe architecture something to that place at the big factory because I was very good at drawing.</span> <span id="s77">But then the war broke out and that was all crossed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q.</span> <span id="s79">When Hitler came into power or even perhaps before Hitler came to power, were you, in Poland, apprehensive about what that might mean to you people?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A. Well, nobody could realize that this is what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s81">I mean who would stay there and wait for a slaughter like this?</span> <span id="s82">You knew Hitler was in power.</span> <span id="s83">As a matter of fact, I had two uncles who lived in Germany, they lived very well.</span> <span id="s84">But once Hitler came to power this whole thing started to turn around.</span> <span id="s85">But nobody could realize that.</span> <span id="s86">Did the world realize what would happen?</span> <span id="s87">I mean…did they let it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q. Well, it’s hard to say from the standpoint of someone who was in the United States during all this time…but I wasn’t sure how you feel about it….</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A.</span> <span id="s90">This is the way I know…this is way I feel about this.</span> <span id="s91">This is the way… It was never spoken about.</span> <span id="s92">We knew Hitler was in power in Germany.</span> <span id="s93">We never realized this was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q. Do you want to go on then and say how it did happen, step by step, so we understand how you became involved in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s96">My brother, should rest in peace.</span> <span id="s97">He went to the Polish army in 1937.</span> <span id="s98">You had to go to the Polish army when you were 21 years old.</span> <span id="s99">He supposed to come home, the day 1939, September when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q.</span> <span id="s101">This is when Hitler invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A. September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s103">When this happened….</span> <span id="s104">When Hitler invaded Poland, the war started.</span> <span id="s105">In our town we didn’t even realize that the war started.</span> <span id="s106">We saw planes coming over our heads and we thought that was Polish planes.</span> <span id="s107">Because we lived ten miles from the border, the German border, the 1939 border I am talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q.</span> <span id="s109">How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A. I was 14 years old, fourteen and a half.</span> <span id="s111">So the war started five in the morning because my brother, he was fighting the Nazis for about five to six weeks until Poland was completely invaded and we didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s112">We thought maybe he had been killed or something.</span> <span id="s113">Then a couple weeks later, he came home.</span> <span id="s114">He got out.</span> <span id="s115">Somebody gave him a civilian…he came home.</span> <span id="s116">It was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s117">And he told us, which I’ll never forget, the war started (at) five in the morning.</span> <span id="s118">They were (at) that time on the border…the town name was Rybnik.</span> <span id="s119">Right on the border, Germany-Poland.</span> <span id="s120">The Polish army was bringing black coffee for them…like for breakfast that morning and all of a sudden they saw the tanks coming out of the woods.</span> <span id="s121">And they thought they were Polish tanks on training.</span> <span id="s122">That was the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s123">The Polish men there didn’t realize the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q. Weren’t very well informed</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A. Also, in that part of Poland, my brother also say they, another Poland, they called it volksdeutsche (German folk).</span> <span id="s126">They were shooting on the…there were Polish people living in Poland who were shooting on the Polish army.</span> <span id="s127">The Germans from one side, they were shooting because they were half German, half Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q. And what was happening to you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A. Well we were home and the Germans came in the same day into our town.</span> <span id="s130">We lived…the street was right on the river and right across the river was the beautiful synagogue for our town.</span> <span id="s131">That night, we peeked out of the windows, the synagogue was on fire.</span> <span id="s132">The Germans were laughing in the street, we were keeping quiet.</span> <span id="s133">As a matter of fact, my mother used to tell me…nobody should like breath(e).</span> <span id="s134">They were laughing down stairs…the SS, and the Germans.</span> <span id="s135">And they said “Juden heis machen” which means “we will make the Jews hot”…burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q. And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A. Then…was tough to get food once the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s138">Everything was in secret, all kinds of buying…potatoes from the Polish what they used to bring in from different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q. Black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A. Yea.</span> <span id="s141">And that’s the way…every else stopped…the business, everything else stopped.</span> <span id="s142">And it was getting tougher and tougher by the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q.</span> <span id="s144">What happened to your father’s business?</span> <span id="s145">Did the Germans confiscate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A. Everything was out.</span> <span id="s147">We couldn’t travel no more.</span> <span id="s148">We have to stay put…home.</span> <span id="s149">There were no ghettos yet… it was just the beginning of things to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q. Well, go ahead and tell me what did come.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A. Well… As I said, my brother came home.</span> <span id="s152">We and my brother…I was…especially me I always looked older than I was…than my age…somehow.</span> <span id="s153">So they [the Germans] said at home, that the young people, if they would work, get hard work around…us with a lot of coal mines.</span> <span id="s154">Would get hard work around there…they would get special papers like…they wouldn’t…they start to send the people already…to take people to the judenlager (Jews camp).</span> <span id="s155">There was no consent.</span> <span id="s156">But the judenlager…in the beginning was…so they said if you work on the coal mines, something like that, they wouldn’t take you to Germany.</span> <span id="s157">They leave you stay where you are.</span> <span id="s158">So me and my brother, we registered and we worked on the coal mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q.</span> <span id="s160">You were fourteen or fifteen years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A. I was fourteen and a half.</span> <span id="s162">We worked, me and my brother, in the coal mines, the name was “Saturn”.</span> <span id="s163">That was about six kilometers from our town.</span> <span id="s164">The town was Czleadz.</span> <span id="s165">So I worked there a few months, I don’t know exactly for how long.</span> <span id="s166">And then they started to take more people.</span> <span id="s167">One night I came home from work…it was the middle of 1940 already.</span> <span id="s168">So my sister says…you’d better go away because they were looking for you, the Germans were looking for us.</span> <span id="s169">Somebody says there’s two young people here.</span> <span id="s170">So my brother, he went away and I said to my mother…I’ll never forget that…I said “I’m so tired, I don’t want to go away, I’m going to sleep here.”</span> <span id="s171">Sure enough, 11:00 at night the Germans came…and it was Jewish militia…I can’t stop crying…</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q. It’s hard to recount this…</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A. So, as I said, I didn’t want to go away.</span> <span id="s174">I came home so tired from working a whole day on the coal mine.</span> <span id="s175">And they caught me at home and took me away.</span> <span id="s176">I was one of the earliest going to the camps.</span> <span id="s177">Most of the people are still home for a while.</span> <span id="s178">I went in the middle of 1940…I went to concentration, no it wasn’t concentration it was judenlager, Jewish camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q. Was your family allowed to stay in their own home or were they moved to a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A.</span> <span id="s181">When I left, yes.</span> <span id="s182">I found out later that the ghetto…well the ghetto was formed I think 1942.</span> <span id="s183">My whole family…they took away in 1943 from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s184">Then everybody went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s185">But I was in camp, somehow I survived.</span> <span id="s186">I’m here… to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q.</span> <span id="s188">What was it like in the camp?</span> <span id="s189">What did they make you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A. Well, we came to the first camp, it was named Fulbrick.</span> <span id="s191">Over there we worked in a…how they call it in English…where they make bricks…bricks for buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q. Brick factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A. Brick factory.</span> <span id="s194">It was a very bad camp.</span> <span id="s195">After six weeks, I was almost out of my mind.</span> <span id="s196">They gave us very little food.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q.</span> <span id="s198">What kind of food did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A. Well…when you came home, they give us two slices of bread and a little bit soup that you had to dig in to find…in order to find a little piece of potato in it.</span> <span id="s200">So…after six weeks over there, or seven weeks over there…they needed carpenters.</span> <span id="s201">So I said okay.</span> <span id="s202">I got to get out of here, it’s no good, very bad.</span> <span id="s203">So I said I’m a carpenter.</span> <span id="s204">So they put me on a transport.</span> <span id="s205">I went to different camp.</span> <span id="s206">It was called Larahut.</span> <span id="s207">I was very happy because they was…I knew the family was still home.</span> <span id="s208">I thought maybe I be able to get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s209">So I went there as a carpenter, but I couldn’t…there was no way to get in touch with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q.</span> <span id="s211">What time of the year was this?</span> <span id="s212">What season of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A. Well, it was Larahut, that must have been 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q. No, I mean winter or fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A. Winter, I think, maybe fall…</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q. Well, either one really.</span> <span id="s217">Did they give you warm clothing?</span> <span id="s218">Did you have blankets?</span> <span id="s219">Was it cold all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A. No.</span> <span id="s221">No.</span> <span id="s222">No.</span> <span id="s223">No, you had one pair of socks.</span> <span id="s224">You were lucky to have a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s225">You were lucky nobody stole your shirt.</span> <span id="s226">It was some day when we didn’t work, you walked around almost naked.</span> <span id="s227">You used to wash what you had, dry it up and put it on again.</span> <span id="s228">That was the procedure.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q.</span> <span id="s230">You must have lost a great deal of weight during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A. Well, I’m sure I lost but who was looking?</span> <span id="s232">We just were looking around the ground for something to eat.</span> <span id="s233">Digging in the garbage or find a leaf or something.</span> <span id="s234">Because the food they gave was outrageous.</span> <span id="s235">It was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q.</span> <span id="s237">Did people who worked in the kitchens do any better?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A. Well, I guess so.</span> <span id="s239">Because they were right up there.</span> <span id="s240">I mean…couldn’t stop them from grabbing something…eat a potato…another slice of bread.</span> <span id="s241">They were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s242">That’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q.</span> <span id="s244">Now these were not extermination camps, these were work camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A.</span> <span id="s246">This was not extermination camp, this was working camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q.</span> <span id="s248">Did a lot of people die though from the bad conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A.</span> <span id="s250">If you were sick, you had no chance.</span> <span id="s251">Then they send you away.</span> <span id="s252">That we heard already, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s253">If you were sick, they sent you to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s254">So it was a big thing not to get sick, even if you didn’t feel well, you wouldn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s255">Because you were gone.</span> <span id="s256">If you had fever or something, forget it.</span> <span id="s257">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q.</span> <span id="s259">How long were you in Lara Richte?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A. Lara Richte, it must have been to about the beginning of 1941.</span> <span id="s261">Something like that.</span> <span id="s262">Then it was bad there, too.</span> <span id="s263">They needed carpenters again.</span> <span id="s264">So we went to Brande.</span> <span id="s265">Brande was called _____.</span> <span id="s266">Over there I worked on the German Autobahn for a while.</span> <span id="s267">But then they stopped it too because they found out that they couldn’t afford…they needed all the oils, all the things for the armies…the Germans.</span> <span id="s268">So, they stopped it.</span> <span id="s269">There was no more work there.</span> <span id="s270">And again, they needed carpenters in a different…once a few thousand people, I don’t know how many thousand people were there.</span> <span id="s271">So they needed carpenters again, like I said.</span> <span id="s272">We went to the next lager (camp)…was Brundslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q. Were there mostly Jewish people in these camps or were there a lot of…</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A. Those camps, mostly Jewish people.</span> <span id="s275">Brundslau already…that was a place where you make barracks.</span> <span id="s276">Barracabau, in German it is called ____ which means complete barracks for civilians, for the army mostly, furniture.</span> <span id="s277">They shipped out complete barracks to be installed at this and this destination plus the furniture, everything complete.</span> <span id="s278">Over there I was there until February 12, 1945.</span> <span id="s279">I was there…this was a very unusual thing, to be in one place so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q.</span> <span id="s281">When you said they needed carpenters in Brundslau, was that…did that mean they asked for volunteers to go to these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A. No, just who was a carpenter.</span> <span id="s283">But the reason I said I was a carpenter…I stuck with it because the other camps were so extraordinarily bad, I said I got nothing to lose I got to get our of here or I’m going to perish here.</span> <span id="s284">So finally I would up in Bundslau.</span> <span id="s285">This is...really was only for carpenters.</span> <span id="s286">We were over there 1,100 Jews.</span> <span id="s287">When I came in it was still judenlager (Jewish camp) but then end of, I think 1942, it became concentration camp.</span> <span id="s288">They gave us…we changed from the civilians we had only the marks, no hair, and the yellow stars.</span> <span id="s289">And then they switched it over…It was such a bitter cold…in the winter…we were standing outside naked and they gave us just a jacket and a pair of pants and some kind of shoes and nothing else.</span> <span id="s290">It was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s291">You almost froze to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q. Were you then being guarded by German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A. Yea, the Germans, the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q. Were they especially brutal?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A. Well, in those camps…they were watching us in the quarters, where we lived like.</span> <span id="s296">When we came in to sleep and all this.</span> <span id="s297">They had these…what you call… turrets…the wacht thurm …</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q. Watch tower…</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A. Watch towers.</span> <span id="s300">You know, high up, the machine guns over there and they were watching us.</span> <span id="s301">But where we worked, especially in Bundslau, I had a foreman…we were…I was in the…his name was Lesingham…I’ll never forget that…and I was one of the good workers.</span> <span id="s302">I didn’t look to fool around.</span> <span id="s303">But I…let’s say they gave me work for ten, eleven hours…I had to do this, this.</span> <span id="s304">They say Yackov, you do this kind of work.</span> <span id="s305">And I did it from three to four hours and I used to run around the whole place there looking for food.</span> <span id="s306">But many times the other Germans used, when ever he looked…I worked on the bandsaw…on a big bandsaw,…six meter bandsaw…whenever he used to look in there…so he used to complain I’m never there by the machine, the machine is standing still he says.</span> <span id="s307">But I did my job…and so he (Lesingham) says, alright so…Yackov stay by the machine, he says, because Schultz complained.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q. Shouldn’t look bad for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A.

I don’t know.</span> <span id="s694">Any recollections, or personal comments or anything you’d like to have on the record.</span> <span id="s695">Or something you maybe, you remembered after we talked about that part, you can always add it.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A.</span> <span id="s697">The things that we went through…losing five sisters and a brother, my father, my mother, uncles, nieces, nephews…I told you in the beginning we were a tremendous big family…oh, there’s one cousin in Ft. Lauderdale, one in Montreal, and I have a cousin in Toronto…we’re talking hundreds of hundreds people just…And right now, even so many years after…many times…well, you have dreams, bad dreams about it…still…So many years after it’s so hard to believe that (it) did happen…that something like this could have happened….</span> <span id="s698">that the world stood by and did nothing about it.</span> <span id="s699">And now, after all these years, it shows that actually the world didn’t care to liberate us as earlier or step in or do something…it’s hard to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q.

Well I can certainly understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A.</span> <span id="s722">But you have to live with it.</span> <span id="s723">There’s nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s724">I’m not going to lay down now and die.</span> <span id="s725">My grandchildren…</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q.

I think you were very brave to go back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A. I will finish…(long pause)…This is from Auschwitz, from the barracks…a latch from the door.</span> <span id="s777">And we lit candles and laid flowers over there and you can imagine our hearts.</span> <span id="s778">And they have some people around the world, even in the United States that got to tell you that this never happened.</span> <span id="s779">Take him by his neck and bring him over there and then let him tell you it never happened.</span> <span id="s780">I would once like to go once more to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s781">Like I said, we so out of our wits, we couldn’t concentrate.</span> <span id="s782">I would like to go back once more, if I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q.
