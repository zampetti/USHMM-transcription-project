Peterson was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s19">Mother, Laura May Peterson.</span> <span id="s20">I had two – two others, my older sister Josephine, who was 11 years older than I, and my brother Robert, nine years older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And you spent your childhood in this one location?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Exactly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What were your interests as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I had, oh I think a variety of things.</span> <span id="s25">One thing I think Mother and Dad encouraged a lot of reading, we did a lot of reading at home.</span> <span id="s26">The usual childhood sports, I think.</span> <span id="s27">I think beyond that also Mother and Dad encouraged collections of things.</span> <span id="s28">Stamp collections, that sort of thing basically that was of interest.</span> <span id="s29">Music was always a part of our home.</span> <span id="s30">Mother sang beautifully and she played the piano, we had that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s31">Interestingly too at home, I think though, we had quite a bit – because on my father’s side, Danish background, as the name indicates.</span> <span id="s32">On my mother’s side the family went way back from New England Yankee people.</span> <span id="s33">So on Dad’s side we would have my grandparents who lived just a block away, we’d be often times in their home.</span> <span id="s34">We learned little bit of Danish, used some Danish in the home place, and my father had not spoken English until he was five.</span> <span id="s35">On Mother’s side we had a lot of Civil War background because she had three uncles who were in the Civil War.</span> <span id="s36">We had a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of that sort of thing basically.</span> <span id="s37">So there was a kind of a developing interest of history as well too, during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What kind of physical condition were you in?</span> <span id="s39">Were you a healthy child?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s41">Oh I had the usual, I think, childhood diseases basically and the scrapes and bruises, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s42">But no, nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s43">It was – it was a good – good childhood, healthy-wise, you bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And were you small for your age or tall for your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Right about average I would think, yeah.</span> <span id="s46">I think average.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s48">And did you have any religious training?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: We were Baptists.</span> <span id="s50">The Baptist persuasion is that there is no baptism until you reach what is called the age of believer.</span> <span id="s51">I was baptized when I was nine years old after some instruction, basically.</span> <span id="s52">And of course in the Baptist church that’s by immersion.</span> <span id="s53">Mother – D-Dad was very active.</span> <span id="s54">Not only his profession but in community life and religious life as well too.</span> <span id="s55">He’d been the past president of the Iowa Baptist Association.</span> <span id="s56">Mother was even a stronger Baptist than he was.</span> <span id="s57">She was what was called a deep water, loud shouting Baptist and she enjoyed the reli – so we had – we had a – a good – good – good religious background.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did you have many friends?</span> <span id="s59">Were you a social child?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s61">Neighborhood friends, quite a few of those.</span> <span id="s62">The neighborhood quote gangs, end quote, I suppose.</span> <span id="s63">Then farther along in school we lived just within a – oh, a block or so of [indecipherable] school where I attended, and we had a lot of friends at school, I – I think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s65">Was your family a very emotional family?</span> <span id="s66">Did they encourage you as a boy to show your emotions, or to keep them in?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: There was never direct lect – any – any limitation of – of showing emotion.</span> <span id="s68">Dad was quite serious just by his demeanor basically.</span> <span id="s69">Mother – Mother had more expression I think basically and she enjoyed things more.</span> <span id="s70">She was a – a – a delightfully humorous person, a lot of fun to be around.</span> <span id="s71">Dad, as I say, was more serious, but he was a very, very, very fine person.</span> <span id="s72">And looking back, too, in the home, as I said, it was a lot of encouragement of reading and a lot of encouragement of motivation to do things.</span> <span id="s73">Dad was very active community-wise and he urged all of us to – to be involved in high school activities, other activities as well.</span> <span id="s74">An interesting thing about the family, though, you see, we’re almost rather like two families.</span> <span id="s75">My – in the sense that my sister was 11 years older, my brother nine, and I, as Mother said, the side dish that came on orders was that much younger, you see.</span> <span id="s76">So I – they were up and growing, my – my sister Josephine, brother Robert, they were kind of on a different level by the time I was – I came along.</span> <span id="s77">So I was home quite a bit myself, in those later years.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: When did you start becoming aware of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young, because Mother’s two spinster sisters had both been to Europe.</span> <span id="s80">Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in Europe.</span> <span id="s81">My Aunt Agnes had – had been in Germany a number of times and studied there.</span> <span id="s82">Aunt Belle had been with her also.</span> <span id="s83">But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt – Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and visiting about Europe.</span> <span id="s84">So really as younger people we were aware of at least Europe.</span> <span id="s85">Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly.</span> <span id="s86">And I’m speaking now of – of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe.</span> <span id="s87">News-wise, later though, because it wasn’t of course until I was getting into later grade school that the world news became more and more important.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did your parents talk that over with you?</span> <span id="s89">How aware were you of the situation getting worse in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: We were aware because first of all we had the “Des Moines Register,” the state paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it.</span> <span id="s91">We had radio news basically as well, too.</span> <span id="s92">So I think probably as – as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930’s.</span> <span id="s93">And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second of September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: What was your personal reaction when – in September ’39?</span> <span id="s95">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, I remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into the kitchen, the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the – the war that – the word had come that – that of course as we remember, Germany had moved into the – in-into – into Danzig, and then that the British gave the ultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that they were given ultimatum, we have rece – [indecipherable] undertaking, so we’re therefore at war.</span> <span id="s97">I remember Dad being disturbed, Mother to a degree too, but I-I think – I think maybe – maybe Dad was more evident about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And you were in what grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Well, I would have been at that time, which was 1939, in – I’d bega – I began school as a five year old in 1930, so I – I would have been about the eighth or ninth grade at that time, or in that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you feel threatened at all by that news?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s102">That came a bit later.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Okay, so you continued to go to school in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: And your life did not change immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Correct, correct, but the real – the real change came in April of 1940, the next spring, during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war, nothing happening basically.</span> <span id="s107">But it was in April, the next April, when Germany moved into first Denmark and then the Scandinavian countries, and that was very – very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to Grandma and Grandpa’s, they’re still living.</span> <span id="s108">This time they were in – in the 80’s.</span> <span id="s109">But I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the sun in the early morning as if he were stunned.</span> <span id="s110">The war did come.</span> <span id="s111">And I said in Danish, Bedstefar [Danish].</span> <span id="s112">Yeah, da – I’ll put it sa – put it in Danish again.</span> <span id="s113">[Speaks Danish here] The Germans have Denmark.</span> <span id="s114">And then in English he says, poor little Denmark, she couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s115">She couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s116">And he just – he’d been in the German army, you se – oh, I’m sorry, the – the Danish army.</span> <span id="s117">And of course it was a great history in the 1860’s when Grandpa was in Denmark growing up, of the first – you know, th-the first war with Germany.</span> <span id="s118">And then of course the World War II is – World War – war was there also, but this was a really traumatic thing for them.</span> <span id="s119">And we – we sensed that, we could see that in – in – in their – in their make-up, what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And did you respond in any way, did you feel threatened then, because of the connection to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Oh, I think – I think not too much at that time.</span> <span id="s122">We knew things of course were getting much more so because following that of course we recall Norway fell, and then of course Germany moved into – in to the low countries and on and then of course there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went through the Ardennes, to the great – the great shock and surprise of the French and British.</span> <span id="s123">And then of course the – the escape of the British at Dunkirk to get across, we – that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So this is a young – as a teenager, you followed in the news.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Quite a bit, because in school we would also – not by tha – by this time we’re getting into – into – into high school.</span> <span id="s126">I would have begun high school – I began high school, it would have been in – it had begun in 1939.</span> <span id="s127">I begun just that fall.</span> <span id="s128">In high school the current affairs magazines, the teachers were visiting about it back and forth, even though the war was still in Europe, of course, basically.</span> <span id="s129">But we were quite aware of it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Up to that point, did you have any Jewish friends, were there any Jewish families living in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">Yes.</span> <span id="s133">Polish friends as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s134">I was in grade school with Marvin Richards, with Stanley Krazney(ph), both of Jewish – and some – and some girls, too.</span> <span id="s135">So we – we – we had good friends that were, yes.</span> <span id="s136">We were just youngsters, of course, but then on into high school we – we had number of Jewish families in Council Bluffs, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And did you read anything in the newspaper about what was happening to the Jews in Germany in the 30’s and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: To my recollection, nothing that I recall, no.</span> <span id="s139">Although I do recall Dad brought ho – brought hom – brought home a story once from the office, very facetious, a fun story.</span> <span id="s140">He had some Jewish clients and th – interestingly enough, h – Dad represented one side, the other attorney in his o – the other people, and they were visiting back and forth, the Jewish gentlemen ga – came quite involved back and forth.</span> <span id="s141">And finally as they left, the first group left, Dad’s client remained, leaned over and says, can you blame Hitler?</span> <span id="s142">Can you blame Hitler?</span> <span id="s143">But that – that was a kind of a – of a joke sort of thing.</span> <span id="s144">But there had been word obviously at the time that things were happening in Germany as far as anti-Semitic things basically, but no greater awareness at the time, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And no evidence –</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: As far as I would –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: – of anti – and no evidence of anti-Semitism in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, I think not.</span> <span id="s149">We had at that time a synagogue.</span> <span id="s150">The building is still there, the congregation no long – but the – i-it was a fairly active synagogue.</span> <span id="s151">And I don’t ever, ever recall at home any – any suggestion of anti-Semitism at all.</span> <span id="s152">The wa – ma – dad – Mother and Dad were both very, very liberal in attitude, and very, very tolerant.</span> <span id="s153">Matter of fact we had Jewish neighbors lived right next door to us.</span> <span id="s154">And there – there was never, to my recollection, any reflection about them as individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Okay, so I assume then as things go on, you’re a student at school, you’re following world affairs and then when – what happened when Pearl Harbor occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We got the word, of course, that Sunday afternoon at home.</span> <span id="s157">They’re saying, we interrupt this news [indecipherable] and so forth.</span> <span id="s158">A great – a great shocking thing.</span> <span id="s159">At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect us.</span> <span id="s160">The next morning in the “Des Moines Register” there appeared a – a – the name was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the country, and here was this – this drawing.</span> <span id="s161">It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a sailor with a knife in his back.</span> <span id="s162">And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger, shaking his fist at the departing Japanese aircraft.</span> <span id="s163">Powerful thing.</span> <span id="s164">I remem-mem-member very well, and that’s one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in tears, at that.</span> <span id="s165">And that was now Monday morning at home.</span> <span id="s166">At school, Abraham Lincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a – a very fine educator and he ran a tight school.</span> <span id="s167">He called the entire school body together, we were in the – the big, large auditorium.</span> <span id="s168">He perceived in his wisdom how he’ll be affecting us, and he had brought – he brought in a large floor model radio which was up on the stage.</span> <span id="s169">And I can see him yet.</span> <span id="s170">The auditorium, large but couldn’t take all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the balcony, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s171">And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President Roosevelt’s war message.</span> <span id="s172">And how interesting.</span> <span id="s173">I thought about it over the years.</span> <span id="s174">Over – over the – the – the stage, on the proscenium of the stage, in large gothic letters in high school were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve.</span> <span id="s175">How rather prophetic looking back, huh, at those times.</span> <span id="s176">That was Monday and then of course during the week, difficult.</span> <span id="s177">To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a tense week because I remember th-the – the – the [indecipherable] this country as we recall, as the special en – envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of them in the paper, them smiling and very – you know.</span> <span id="s178">And then came the word about it.</span> <span id="s179">But I remember when, during the end of the week as we’re reaching – it would have been in probably December fourth or fifth – third, fourth or fifth, that the word came that they were re-reaching some kind of an accord, they thought – I remember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky – a war with Japan would be terrible, wouldn’t it?</span> <span id="s180">And then of course, came the events of Sunday and then Monday, of course, war was declared.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And so you went on with life as usual at – in – in high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: To a degree, but it was changing, because we realized things were indeed happening, and they already had, to this extent.</span> <span id="s183">The National Guard had been already brought into federal service by that time.</span> <span id="s184">I thi – I think that our local unit, which was the 168th infantry of the na – 34th division had been mustered in in January the year before.</span> <span id="s185">And we were aware of it because a number of the high school student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone.</span> <span id="s186">And I remember then, it was in the – May of that year, which would have been 1941, before the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in – I was in the band and orchestra, and it was always typical that we would play, the orchestra, we would play – our – our school march was “The Pilgrim’s Chorus” from Tannhäuser.</span> <span id="s187">And – and Mr. Kern liked it, it was very good.</span> <span id="s188">Much better than “Pomp and Circumstance.”</span> <span id="s189">But I remember being th – we were practicing and in came the high school seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster, moved, because here were four, five or six of the high school students now on active duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate.</span> <span id="s190">So that was – so we were very much aware of it.</span> <span id="s191">And to drop back to your other question, how did it change?</span> <span id="s192">We were much aware, the – the high school paper, “The Echoes” began having items more and more of classmates we had, or students who were now in the service, in the military, back and forth.</span> <span id="s193">As well, at our high school we had ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band – band people had a military band and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s194">So there was more emphasis all the time.</span> <span id="s195">I mean that things are going to happen, young people and you’ve got training that’s going on here, it’s going to be helpful to you.</span> <span id="s196">So the – the high school paper as I said, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where they were training and so forth, so we’re very much aware of it.</span> <span id="s197">And, may I add, the school activities began to be directed.</span> <span id="s198">Junior Red Cross, for example, was having more projects.</span> <span id="s199">As – as youngsters, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the Boy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to get for the war effort.</span> <span id="s200">So we – were doing, things were happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did you ever picture yourself in the army when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Not immediately.</span> <span id="s203">You suddenly began realizing, as the senior class ahead of us graduating, they were going in, that this was going to be happening to you.</span> <span id="s204">So gradually we recog – it was a part of it, and we were expected to do it and we knew it was coming by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Was it a frightening prospect?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No.</span> <span id="s207">I – I think at that time there was so much – so much patriotism.</span> <span id="s208">You know, remember Pearl Harbor and so forth, and of course Germany declared war right away too on this, as you recall – as one recalls.</span> <span id="s209">So, I don’t think – I don’t think wa – it was a fearful project.</span> <span id="s210">Our feeling was everybody’s in it, we will be too, and it’s a part of party responsibility.</span> <span id="s211">It’s a gr – a gr – a great sense of patriotism at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So would you describe yourself in the later high school years as a mature young person?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I think fairly so.</span> <span id="s214">[indecipherable] to this.</span> <span id="s215">I had been the quote baby unquote at home.</span> <span id="s216">Josephine and Robert were up, they were in college and so forth.</span> <span id="s217">And of course, you touch upon them actual – the war touching us, brother Robert was finishing University of Iowa in law.</span> <span id="s218">He had finished in 1940.</span> <span id="s219">He went into the FBI initially, for a time, and then because he had an ROTC commission from Iowa, he got a deferment and had a special service with the FBI overseas, but we were aware of the war going on, very much indeed.</span> <span id="s220">So – and – but I, in my situation, Mother always – she was very candid about it, she said that I needed to get out more and so forth.</span> <span id="s221">And it – I-I was, I think, a little bit sheltered at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Did you talk about the war with your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s224">We – we did quite a bit.</span> <span id="s225">To drop back now, we’re talking now ’41, you see the first real involvement that we knew about, was when the Marines landed in Guadalcanal in August of 1942.</span> <span id="s226">That was the first real, as I recall, over action by the nation as far as being on the attack, that I remember offhand.</span> <span id="s227">So we were much aware of that basically.</span> <span id="s228">Things were happening then too.</span> <span id="s229">And of course, as well, the National Guard unit that I spoke of, the 168th regiment, 34th division was at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana and they were one of the first to go overseas, which was a – yeah, they went over, went to north Ireland, I think it was in January of ’42.</span> <span id="s230">So the result is that all the hometown people were aware of their – their – their sons, their husbands, brothers were – in the National Guard now – now were overseas now, so you began to feel it much more locally, that here were local hometown boys that had already gone over.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Had you heard anything in 1942 about camps, labor camps –</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Not a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: – other kind of camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Not a bit.</span> <span id="s235">As I recall – it’s hard to loo – think back on that, and I don’t think no-no-not a word about labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Had you heard about –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: And even about concentration camps, I don’t – I don’t recall any awareness of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Had you heard anything about ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Ghettos, yes, because of our history study basically that we knew – we knew historically, I mean, of the – the existence of the – the older – the European cities of – of ghettos, oh, I – I think particularly in – in Germany, the German ghettos.</span> <span id="s240">The Rothschilds, it was a wonderful, interesting, th-the Rothschild family.</span> <span id="s241">The film, George Arliss was in it.</span> <span id="s242">They – we’re talking the mid 30’s now.</span> <span id="s243">And that began in the story of a – in – in, I think a ghetto in Frankfurt, I’m not sure, but it was new then, but we began reading about it, so we were aware of it on the matter of – matter of what it was, what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Okay, now you’re what, a senior in high school?</span> <span id="s245">And anything special about that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Junior, I mean basically then, I would have been, you see, a junior – yeah, I would have been a senior, you’re right in 1942, because then, all into the rest of the year and then graduated 1943.</span> <span id="s247">I became – yeah, 17 in September of ’42, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And what was your senior year like?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: We were getting closer to graduation obviously.</span> <span id="s250">I think, looking back, the courses that we had, there was a real awareness of maybe boning up on your mathematics and so forth, that kind of thing basically because you might have military.</span> <span id="s251">In the ROTC units, as I recall having a lot – a lot of training.</span> <span id="s252">If nothing else, we learned at least close order drill and the manual of arms, if nothing else.</span> <span id="s253">So that was it.</span> <span id="s254">And also, in school we were getting recruiting requests from the navy, the army and so forth to get signed up to take tests basically, see if you – if you could qualify maybe for some kind of a – of a – of a military education program, which there was a number of them.</span> <span id="s255">The navy had them, the army had them and so forth.</span> <span id="s256">So we took tests now during that year to see if you could qualify for that.</span> <span id="s257">So we were heading in that direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And did you qualify for any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes, the way it worked, graduated in June of 1943.</span> <span id="s260">We’d heard nothing back from the tests at that particular time.</span> <span id="s261">Some of our class, for example had already done – signed up for submarine officer training and so forth, some for the air force.</span> <span id="s262">I did not.</span> <span id="s263">I went to Drake University in June, just after graduation for about – it was about a month, six weeks.</span> <span id="s264">Drake, because it had been Dad’s school, it was a good school in Des Moines, and Dad’s thought was, get as much education as you can before the military, which was exactly right.</span> <span id="s265">And then, after about six weeks there, I got word that I would be eligible for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program, ASTRP.</span> <span id="s266">Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age 18 and you could go into the enlisted reserve, start off.</span> <span id="s267">And then, after finishing one’s first term, and when you reached your 18th birthday or past it, then that term would stop in school, you would be s – be – you would become a part of the army itself, be sworn in, have your basic training, then the program would come back to school afterwards.</span> <span id="s268">All right, to drop back now, my particular group that I qualified for, we were – I was still in Des Moines, Drake University.</span> <span id="s269">Down, I remember going downtown at the direction, and I had all the papers and so forth, I – in – went into the enlisted reserve, took the oath basically and so forth.</span> <span id="s270">And then terminated my work at Drake, went home and oh then two or three weeks afterwards reported to then Fort Crook for induction into the actual – the actual service itself.</span> <span id="s271">Our group went to Kansas University at Lawrence, Kansas.</span> <span id="s272">And we began our first tour of ASTRP, all reservists, we had – we had uniforms, ROTC uniforms basically, the first part of August and we were there then with the first term of just basic engineering beginning supposedly, until we’d accomplished our 18th birthday.</span> <span id="s273">Mine was September 29th, you see.</span> <span id="s274">So I finished the first term, and then those of us that had reached age 18 then went home for a brief furlough, we reported to Camp Dodge in Iowa, then sworn into the army itself, huh, and then began our real army experience, because after the initial beginning in the army you have just your uniform, your shots, your medical, the whole thing, [indecipherable] orientation, then you are sent to a basic training camp.</span> <span id="s275">And that would have been then – that was just about the middle of November of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And wh-where were you sent for basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Fort Benning, Georgia.</span> <span id="s278">That was the training – th-the training camp.</span> <span id="s279">First of all, that was the so called infantry school for the United States, th-th-the – for historically that had been the – the headquarters of infantry training basically and General Patton had been there basically, earlier years, quite well known.</span> <span id="s280">We went there and began our basic training then, that would have been the first part of December of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And still, had you been aware in the previous spring, the Warsaw ghetto uprising in April ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I don’t recall it at all, no.</span> <span id="s283">That was in the spring of ’43?</span> <span id="s284">No, I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Okay, now you’re in Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes, ma’am.</span> <span id="s287">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And can you just tell us a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: It was cold and damp, I recall that quite a bit.</span> <span id="s290">But it was something else because now we were in uniform full time.</span> <span id="s291">We began our actual basic training which at that time was a 17 year – a 17 week course.</span> <span id="s292">You begin the whole thing again.</span> <span id="s293">Now, we’d already had, to a degree we’d had some military training at – in high school we had some, w-we had – we’d had some at Kansas, KU, at Lawrence.</span> <span id="s294">So we had the basic, we had alr – been through close order drill, we had the manual of arms degree, but then you go through the whole thing and now for the thirst – the first time you’re in the barracks and so forth.</span> <span id="s295">Non-coms were okay, we were learn – our training company was in the area called the Harmony Church area, which was the training area that we had for the AST people.</span> <span id="s296">We were there and week by week the training went on basically, and we got underway in pretty good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: And then when you completed basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: I had a mishap.</span> <span id="s299">I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s300">Measles was quite virulent.</span> <span id="s301">I never had measles.</span> <span id="s302">And I remember I got we – I – and this – we were pretty well down the line, we had – we had – we had got rid of our training rifles, we had our new M1s, training further with them.</span> <span id="s303">And then the next – the next program was that we would hike out to, call it Caramouche, c-a-r-a-m-o-u-c-h-e range.</span> <span id="s304">It was a – oh, about a 10 mile hike.</span> <span id="s305">We hiked out and we had a week tha – actually I think a week on the range itself.</span> <span id="s306">And we had just finished – a week or 10 days – we had just finished the last exercise, which was the infiltration course, where you crawl, you know, under the – the firing machine gun bullets and so forth.</span> <span id="s307">A lot of very vigorous, you know.</span> <span id="s308">That next morning I woke up and I was just speckled with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s309">And I remember th-that my non-com was there, I se – I s – I said, corporal, what – he says, Pete, you got measles.</span> <span id="s310">Into the hospital.</span> <span id="s311">Now the rule was that if a person, a trainee lost five days or more of basic training, he had to go back into an earlier training cycle, of people who had begun later, you see, to pick up the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson.</span> <span id="s314">This is tape number one, side B. And you were talking about the measles during basic training.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Into the hospital, a fairly high fever, but I made it by about four days okay, back in, but because of technicality I had – I was told I would have to go back into an earlier cycle.</span> <span id="s316">I was devastated.</span> <span id="s317">Here I was, I’d been with these – most of them my friends from Kansas and all fellows I’d known basically now – in basic, literally, for over the last 10 weeks or so.</span> <span id="s318">And it was very – a really tough growing up process because these are the folks I’d come to know and so forth, that I was taken aback.</span> <span id="s319">But anyway, transferred back into another – another group basically, and we completed it.</span> <span id="s320">But then, the next thing that happened was this, we were just barely finishing it up, word came from Washington that the AST prog – P program was being eliminated.</span> <span id="s321">They needed people carrying guns, not books and the result was that not only the ASP – TP was being washed out, but also a number of Air Force cadets that had only gotten to a certain level, were also into the infantry.</span> <span id="s322">Result was then that we were much – a lot of turmoil what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s323">Mother learned about it, she was terribly upset, she wrote the congressman and so forth, as if anything could be done.</span> <span id="s324">But that’s the way it was and so we got packed up, we had finished pretty much of our training and we were then shipped to the 86th Blackhawk division, then training at Camp Livingston, Louisiana.</span> <span id="s325">So the trip then was from Fort Benning to Camp Livingston.</span> <span id="s326">There we were met and greeted basically and then – and then began our training with the 86th division.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: At that time you s – obviously spoke Danish, did you speak any German at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: A little, not – not much.</span> <span id="s329">My – my – actually, the few words I had I learned from Aunt Agnes who had been a German teacher, as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s330">My really second language if I have it was Spanish.</span> <span id="s331">Because I’d had – well, first of all, I had two years of Latin, wonderful background and then two more years of Spanish in high school.</span> <span id="s332">So I could get along to a degree.</span> <span id="s333">My – and my Danish, I – I was rapidly forgetting, because that drifts away.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Okay, now you’re with the 86th in wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And you were trained to do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Infantry.</span> <span id="s338">We were assigned to A company 342nd infantry.</span> <span id="s339">We were a – wh-which is – which, as I should add, a rifle company.</span> <span id="s340">To explain a bit further, in a division, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-half of those are infantry themselves, in the form of three regiments.</span> <span id="s341">We were in 342nd.</span> <span id="s342">The Blackhawk had regiments 341st, second and third.</span> <span id="s343">And every regiment then would have three battalions.</span> <span id="s344">A battalion would be composed of a headquarters company of the colonel, lieutenant colonel ba – of the lieutenant colonel basically, of the – of the battalion.</span> <span id="s345">The headquarters company had staff and there was a reconnaissance patrol and some other service.</span> <span id="s346">Then, in each – in each battalion beyond that, there were three rifle companies and a weapons company.</span> <span id="s347">And I – and I give this because it gives a better background for the future I think, too.</span> <span id="s348">A rifle company had approximately, in what was called the table of organization, TO, about 180 men commanded by, normally, a captain.</span> <span id="s349">And then there would be a lieutenant, who is called the platoon leader, for each of the four platoons.</span> <span id="s350">The – the three rifle platoons and the weapons platoon.</span> <span id="s351">And sometimes there would be another – another officer who is – be assistant – the assistant company commander.</span> <span id="s352">In our company it was Captain Mitchell, and then we had the – th-the – the four lieutenants.</span> <span id="s353">Basically – trying to recall base – the names we had ba – there was Lieutenant Hess, Lieutenant Budman(ph), Lieutenant Greenburg(ph).</span> <span id="s354">And those were basically the officers that we had.</span> <span id="s355">Each platoon, rifle platoon was composed of three squads of 12 men each.</span> <span id="s356">Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon guy, like an assistant, the assistant person.</span> <span id="s357">And then, for each squad, the squad leader was a staff sergeant, which is the three chevrons and then the rocker underneath, an assistant squad – squad leader, who’d be regular [indecipherable] and then the balance of the men will be 12 [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s358">Be two scouts, two patro – two [indecipherable] of two squad scouts, a Browning automatic rifleman basically and other riflemen down the line, too.</span> <span id="s359">So therefore each – each rifle platoon had those people.</span> <span id="s360">In the weapons platoon.</span> <span id="s361">separate, those – those were the light machine guns, and there were two sections of those basically, with machine guns each and also mortars, which is 60 millimeter weapon, the tubes that fire the rockets, those thi – that would be a rifle company.</span> <span id="s362">There was also each ra – in each battalion, a heavy weapons company, which would be the – would be the – the – the water cooled heavy machine guns, and the 81 millimeter mortars.</span> <span id="s363">And so that was basically the structure of – of a regiment.</span> <span id="s364">And then we were A company of that, and I was in the first squad, third platoon.</span> <span id="s365">I was a scout, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And so then you were trained to be a scout and then you continued on to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Exactly, we finished training, provisional training in February, March.</span> <span id="s368">Picture changed because all of us recognized there were more people.</span> <span id="s369">Air Force people coming in that had been washed out of – ne – not wa – that’s the wrong te – but they – they’ve been transferred out of the infantry.</span> <span id="s370">So we began getting a lot more people in and really the company was pretty much complete, the way it stayed pretty much through, by probably May, June.</span> <span id="s371">We were then Louisiana, Camp [indecipherable] until – through July, went on maneuvers for the month of August and then the word came down that we were going to be transferred probably out to California, the whole division for amphibious training, and that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: To California in September, we had about – been probably a span of two months of amphibious training, which was getting us ready for the south – the Pacific.</span> <span id="s374">There’s the small landing craft you see in the pictures of basically, you know, like fre – quite a bit more.</span> <span id="s375">So we had a training camp, complete amphibious training.</span> <span id="s376">We finished that training at San Luis Obispo by mid-November.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: 1944, exactly.</span> <span id="s379">Waited and then back after San Luis Obispo, we’ve been in southern California, basically in San Diego, December 17th began the Battle of the Bulge, which changed the picture tremendously.</span> <span id="s380">Word came down we were going to probably be going to the east coast, going to Europe.</span> <span id="s381">The requirement was they needed more troops in Europe because of the impact of the bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: You are now 19 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s384">Important because at that time you had to be 19 to be qualified for overseas training.</span> <span id="s385">And interestingly enough, back in June, those who’d already attained age 19 of our group, privates, wer-were transferred out, more people brought in.</span> <span id="s386">But that was the rule at the time.</span> <span id="s387">So we were 19 at the time, exactly.</span> <span id="s388">The division got the information, we were put on a – on an emergency basis of packing.</span> <span id="s389">We were put on special details, cutting wood and so forth to get all the crates together, to get all the material crap together, put together.</span> <span id="s390">That was finished up by probably about mid-January and we were on the troop trains headed east to our division the end of January of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: And then we went east, and we – our particu – all – all of our regiment, basically, went to Camp Miles Standish, which is about 30 miles – was about 30 miles south of Boston.</span> <span id="s393">Coming from California, bright, pleasant, into the snow of Massachusetts, quite a change.</span> <span id="s394">New equipment, we got some new uniforms, more additional equipment than we had basically.</span> <span id="s395">We were there probably staging for about a week, 10 days, and then early in February, onto the trains, down to the port of Boston and we sailed from Boston in about – oh, th – maybe the second week of February.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: By that time had you heard of anything – any news about labor camps, work camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Not a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Not a bit.</span> <span id="s400">On the matter of orientation, we all received from time to time, all of us have, the so-called why we fight series.</span> <span id="s401">That was a Walter Huston, as I recall, was involved very much in that.</span> <span id="s402">And they were – they were – the first was why we fight generally and the whole history basically of the rise of Germany and Nazism and so forth.</span> <span id="s403">And then they would take it country by country, go into it.</span> <span id="s404">These would be a series of documentary films we’d have, as well as other films we were having on training, gas training and so forth, and f – and firing.</span> <span id="s405">But this was an orientation series as I read it now, that really had been acted by Walter Huston, directed by Capra, Frank Capra, he developed the whole series for the army, as I remember.</span> <span id="s406">So we learned why we were with England fighting, why we were basically the free French, the Chinese [indecipherable] and the Russian.</span> <span id="s407">And these were all good guys.</span> <span id="s408">And then the bad guys, of course, were the Japs.</span> <span id="s409">The militarism of the Japanese, and Pearl Harbor all over again and then of course in Germany the rise of Hitler and all the – the nasty Nazis and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Were you eager to go abroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I don’t know about eager.</span> <span id="s412">We were ready.</span> <span id="s413">We had trained completely and the time had come.</span> <span id="s414">And I don’t think that there was any question of eagerness.</span> <span id="s415">It was a part of it.</span> <span id="s416">Maybe in the sense that we had friends and relatives and my – my situation.</span> <span id="s417">My brother was by that time in military intelligence in South America.</span> <span id="s418">He had acquired marvelous Spanish and so he became military intelligence, however – in the – in the – in the army.</span> <span id="s419">So we were ready, let me – let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s420">And maybe the time had come, I – I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s421">There was a lot of – get a lot of – of patriotism about – to – to a modified degree.</span> <span id="s422">We – we were still in the army, we complained and bitched, pardon the expression, but that was a part of it.</span> <span id="s423">But our friends were over there, brothers, relatives overseas, so it was a part of it, it was expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you feel very old then?</span> <span id="s425">Older than your years?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I felt – I felt more mature.</span> <span id="s427">I was no longer the baby of the family.</span> <span id="s428">I was one of many, many people by that time, others of my – my – my peers, huh, and I was ar – I think probably more self c – more self confidence in myself and I know looking back that the army made all the difference in the world to my growing up.</span> <span id="s429">By that time, we’re talking now, as I said, February of – of 1945, I – we had our friends in our unit, good buddies and so forth.</span> <span id="s430">There was a lot of togetherness about the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And where did you dock?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Our trip over was about 10 day – about 10 days, we – right at LaHavre.</span> <span id="s433">By that time it had been secured, you see.</span> <span id="s434">Earlier it had to be brought in by [indecipherable] but this was right – right in LaHavre itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: And then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: We arrived – we debarked late at night, I recall, down onto the dock into great big – big, huge trucks, large trucks.</span> <span id="s437">And I recall very well as we came down, we’re getting in.</span> <span id="s438">I went past the truck we were getting into.</span> <span id="s439">It happened to be the one where our company commander, then Captain Mitchell was seated.</span> <span id="s440">And I recall seeing Captain Mitchell looking up at the windshield, there was a bullet hole right through the windshield of the truck.</span> <span id="s441">Introduction.</span> <span id="s442">Before we had debarked also, the guys, very juv – some are throwing candy bars over, and the soldiers on [indecipherable] said, keep your candy, you’re going to be dead in three days.</span> <span id="s443">Well, ah – okay.</span> <span id="s444">All the trucks black at night, we drove over some – this is now LaHavre.</span> <span id="s445">We went, as I recall [indecipherable] and then on north to the area called Old Gold.</span> <span id="s446">Now there were staging areas in France named for – for – for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s447">Old Gold, Lucky Strike, not as – but a large area.</span> <span id="s448">We were in the Old Gold area, which was right up – it was north of the town of Yvetot, y-v-e-t-o-t.</span> <span id="s449">The home of Madame Bovary in the novel, hm.</span> <span id="s450">Not – not Proust, but anyway – Madame bo – however, we were about oh, eight or 10 miles north of – of Yvetot and as – right near a small French village called Normanville, n-o-r-m-a-n-v-i-l-l-e in large tents, large, large squad tents, cold and chilling.</span> <span id="s451">And we were located there, staging for probably 10 days, two weeks, getting ready to go up to the front.</span> <span id="s452">Some more equipment, some more training.</span> <span id="s453">As is – as a – as a squad scout I was sent with my fellow scouts up to so called mine, m-i-n-e school, up at Sassentot, s-a-s-s-e-n-t-o-t to learn about German mines.</span> <span id="s454">The teller, t-l-e – t-e-l-l-e-r mine, that was like a plate [indecipherable] plate.</span> <span id="s455">The shoe mine, that’s what you have a – a variety of them.</span> <span id="s456">German explosives, Primacord, tetracord.</span> <span id="s457">Not th – we would have much, but at – we theoretically, the scouts, you see, go out in front of the squad to study the terrain and so forth and then the squad leader in charge behind you controls your actions.</span> <span id="s458">So we had that, we were finishing that up and we got the word, okay men, fold up your tents, we’re going back, we’re going to be moving out, you’re up tomorrow to the front.</span> <span id="s459">Back we went, down to Normanville and got ready to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: And you then went?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And then you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: We left, of all things, down to Yvetot, loaded onto 40 and eights, the old World War I style 40 and eights, 40 men or eight horses, yeah.</span> <span id="s464">Quarante hommes ou huit chevaux.</span> <span id="s465">In the boxcars, they were [indecipherable] small, strewn with straw, wonderful, because you could sleep on the straw, but there we were.</span> <span id="s466">So we left by this – by the train.</span> <span id="s467">Some units I guess went by truck, but we went by train, up through Amien, on up to Namur.</span> <span id="s468">Now by this time we’re up in – getting up toward Belgium.</span> <span id="s469">This – this took two or three days, long time.</span> <span id="s470">Namur, Liège.</span> <span id="s471">We went through just a very small part of – of the Netherlands at Maastricht, m-double a-s-t-r-i-c-h-t.</span> <span id="s472">And then I remember we got really, really something to think about because boy I remember going through Liège, l-i – l-e-i-g, I think, l or l-i, whichever.</span> <span id="s473">There on a – on a fencepost was a German helmet, just stuck on top.</span> <span id="s474">Hm, first evidence.</span> <span id="s475">Then we began seeing signs of – of a lot of damage, either artillery or – or bombing damage of the city.</span> <span id="s476">There was – of course, Liège was one of the early areas where f – where fighting took place.</span> <span id="s477">And then really, because that particular day twilight was falling, we had already gone through Maastricht, and were there stopped when there was a – a – at least a false alarm, they thought of a German, an air attack, because our anti-aircraft guns, which were out near the – near the – near the – the – the – the – the train yard – railroad yards, began go – in an action getting – nothing happened, but they – we – we saw they were there.</span> <span id="s478">But then at – twilight came and then it became dark and we went through Aachen, which had been terribly destroyed.</span> <span id="s479">The moonlight, I remember driving on – riding on the train basically, looking out and seeing all of these ghostly white buildings out there, just – just the ruins, huh, of th-the – the destruction of Aachen.</span> <span id="s480">We –</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: What does that do to a 19 year old from Iowa, to see that kind of destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: You – it’s pretty spooky.</span> <span id="s483">That was our first major di – war damage we’d seen.</span> <span id="s484">It was pretty spooky.</span> <span id="s485">I think we were getting pretty silent by that time, watching what was going past.</span> <span id="s486">I was on guard that night, which meant that you – the sentry seated there on the – tha-that open doorway, basically.</span> <span id="s487">And I saw a lot of it as we went through and I think we had two hours basically and – but you watched and went through.</span> <span id="s488">Still awake and I think it was probably mid-morning, black of the morn – I mean, by – by two or three in the morning.</span> <span id="s489">We arrived at the city of Duren, d-u-r-e-n in Germany, we were in Germany now.</span> <span id="s490">Off the trains and on the big trucks, which we call six by sixes.</span> <span id="s491">Six wheels and all six [indecipherable], th – we call them six by sixes.</span> <span id="s492">Out of the trucks and heading then – we left Duren.</span> <span id="s493">And they pointed out to us as we went through – went through a – a city square, I don’t know who pointed out to us, a statue there of a – of – I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s494">But earlier bombardment had been so intense that the statue, the bronze statue had completely turned around.</span> <span id="s495">It had been facing one direction and now it was facing the other direction.</span> <span id="s496">[phone ringing, tape break] On the statue, which was of a bro-bronze, as near as we could tell, it’s s-still dark in the morning, but there – there were – there – there were truck lights.</span> <span id="s497">They pointed out the fact that it had apparently originally been facing on – to – t-to the west, but the – the arterial bombardment they had had in Duren was so intense that it had just shifted, the statue was facing east.</span> <span id="s498">Weird, weird.</span> <span id="s499">So here was dark, middle of the morning, cold, chilly.</span> <span id="s500">We – we were – we were course in – in-in-in March now.</span> <span id="s501">And out of Duren we drove, heading east toward Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: What was it like to be in Germany when you put your foot down on German soil?</span> <span id="s503">Did that have any kind of feeling for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: One had a – one had a different feeling.</span> <span id="s505">We were there first time again on re – you know, on – on – on – on enemy soil.</span> <span id="s506">Lot of curiosity what it looked like Strangely, in my situation I kind of – could kind of relate back because of the tales of my Aunt Agnes and being in Germany and so forth and – and – and – and what little German she had, there were the signs and so forth we would see, you know, the directional signs.</span> <span id="s507">I didn’t know much German at all.</span> <span id="s508">I have a little more now, but not that much.</span> <span id="s509">Then, of course, in the morning it began getting lighter, you know, eerily morning.</span> <span id="s510">And began reli – we were driving through an area now heading east on the – a main, a fairly main roadway toward Cologne, which I think probably was about, I’m guessing 30 - 40 miles east of Duren.</span> <span id="s511">But here we were, of course, basically in a truck going on east.</span> <span id="s512">We had seen, oh, forests to one side and then buildings.</span> <span id="s513">Then began to see a lot of bomb damage or some kind of damage to buildings, basically.</span> <span id="s514">And then we probably got into Cologne, I’m guessing, in the con – with the truck convoy by – by seven, eight o’clock in the morning, I’m guessing.</span> <span id="s515">And that was something else.</span> <span id="s516">The – Cologne had been badly damaged, and yet, way up ahead were the two huge spires of the Cologne cathedral.</span> <span id="s517">Some damage, but they were standing, they were still there.</span> <span id="s518">And then off – truck stopped off into the house, and then in – into houses, apartments where we were being billeted.</span> <span id="s519">So then we were there in Cologne.</span> <span id="s520">Now, at that point something different happened.</span> <span id="s521">These were apartment houses, people’s belongings, I mean their furniture and so forth.</span> <span id="s522">And somebody, strangely enough, began tossing the contents out of the windows into the central courtyard, just indiscriminately.</span> <span id="s523">And, was it the result of being in a foreign country, the enemy country?</span> <span id="s524">A strange thing but it just seemed to catch on and – and on just a – still I look back and why in the world that was done, but a – just tossed to get rid of it, I guess, stuff out of the – out of the rooms, into the courtyard tha – then emptied the rooms out and we cou – we slept in them.</span> <span id="s525">A strange thing.</span> <span id="s526">I – I still wonder why it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did you see any civilians, any townspeople?</span> <span id="s528">Were they affected by the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: In Cologne, people were all, I presume had been evicted or gotten out of – before we came in.</span> <span id="s530">I don’t remember seeing a lot of civilians in ca – where we were in Cologne itself.</span> <span id="s531">Later, yes, bu-but not in Cologne itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Okay, and then how long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: We were there, I’d say oh, maybe oh, a couple days.</span> <span id="s534">I remember of that that we were begin getting – we getting broadcasts from the BBC because their signal – well, we had – some guys had radios, I vi – it was that the – that tune about Bow Bells, bum bum bum bum bum, buddle um bum, bum bum bum.</span> <span id="s535">That was the signal of the BBC.</span> <span id="s536">[indecipherable] the Bow Bell, whatever, yeah.</span> <span id="s537">And we – then we got the news from England, British accents and everything, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s538">Getting things ready, I remember basically we were told we’d be there a few days.</span> <span id="s539">I remember the day before we left, they took us all up, we went up to the – the attic area, huh.</span> <span id="s540">It was a la – fairly large area.</span> <span id="s541">And there we were briefed in.</span> <span id="s542">We had been designated as taper red able.</span> <span id="s543">Taper red able, code word.</span> <span id="s544">Taper was the 86th division.</span> <span id="s545">Red, the 342nd, able, A company, hm.</span> <span id="s546">So that was the designation and they told us what to expect.</span> <span id="s547">They meaning, I think it was Captain Mitchell and na – cap-captain – then Lieutenant Greenburg(ph), who we met.</span> <span id="s548">We were going to be assigned, said they, up on the Rhine river, in of all things, the Ford factory.</span> <span id="s549">Was a major factory before the war that Ford had built and we were gonna be sent there as our – as our location up on the Rhine, okay.</span> <span id="s550">Left fairly – as I remember we – we left fairly early because we went in at nighttime and we relieved the eight infantry division, which was already there, the men were there.</span> <span id="s551">And I remember going into the bunkers and we – and – and with – was – was rather wide-eyed because here were their old veterans, I mean you – they’d been – th-the eighth had been in combat quite awhile.</span> <span id="s552">And different.</span> <span id="s553">They were a pretty rough, tough outfit.</span> <span id="s554">And amazingly, the first real eye opener when we got there, one of the medics was there.</span> <span id="s555">Now, the medics, every platoon had a – had a – had a medic, hm, and they were not armed, their helmets had great big red – white circles with red cross.</span> <span id="s556">The medic that was with that particular group, in the – in the bunker [indecipherable] with eight – eighth – with the eighth – of the eighth division, strange guys.</span> <span id="s557">Projecting out of his aid kit was – was a bone.</span> <span id="s558">Whether it was an animal bone, but you know, that – that – well, really, where are we, what are we doing here?</span> <span id="s559">Any event, the eighth then – the eighth – the men of the eighth division pulled out and we were then in place in the Ford factory.</span> <span id="s560">And that’s where we saw our first – the first beginning evidence that we’re having and that we’re in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And again, up to that point you hadn’t seen too many civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: A – hadn’t seen what, I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: No.</span> <span id="s565">Some, but not – not – not – oh, maybe some people walking on the street, that kind of a thing, but no-nothing – nothing to get tha – no, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And then you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We were in the Ford factory, I’m guessing probably about a week.</span> <span id="s568">That’s when we first began to realize we were there because the Germans were our – on the opposite side of the Rhine.</span> <span id="s569">Now we – we’re now on the left or th-the – the – the west bank, all right.</span> <span id="s570">Germans on the east side.</span> <span id="s571">And the Rhine at that point, very sizeable.</span> <span id="s572">I’d say the Rhine was probably maybe a half a mile wide.</span> <span id="s573">It was wide.</span> <span id="s574">And we could look over and see there was a village over there.</span> <span id="s575">And we would go up in the – in the – in the – in the structure of the Ford factory.</span> <span id="s576">It was just as if the workers had walked away, there were big – there were rather big assembly lines, there were engines on the assembly lines being put together, but they were all gone, but – and walked in, there was a great big [indecipherable] inside.</span> <span id="s577">Cologne, thanks to the second armored division, they’d already bi – somebody painted it up there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s578">We were there, I’d say, about that length of time, but from time to time we were getting artillery coming in, just nuisance that the Germans had put across.</span> <span id="s579">Our fir – introduction to the 88, which was the 88 millimeter ca – a remarkable weapon the Germans had.</span> <span id="s580">First of all, it was – it was began, it was ta – it was tested in the Spanish Civil War by the Germans.</span> <span id="s581">It was anti-aircraft, could reach way up [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s582">It could also be a Howitzer, which is a – and a flat trajectory.</span> <span id="s583">And I remember that’s the first experience, I remember we would – the flat traje – that was really spooky because the Germans would fire in and this sharp crack and that’s the first you knew it’s – it was there.</span> <span id="s584">And it was – it was – it was frightening.</span> <span id="s585">That was our first [indecipherable] mm-hm.</span> <span id="s586">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And then, to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s589">We were there for about a week.</span> <span id="s590">Then we were told we’re gonna be pulled out and indeed we were.</span> <span id="s591">We were replaced by the 82nd airborne division, now that had had experience already during the war.</span> <span id="s592">And as we – I remember as we were walking out, marching out past the – past the cut – en-entry kiosk they have there, in were coming men of the 82nd, we were on the outside, yes.</span> <span id="s593">And I remember walking past, looking up and there was this great big, tall, tall soldier, two big stars.</span> <span id="s594">It was General Gavin – Gavin.</span> <span id="s595">We saw him.</span> <span id="s596">Then we were pulled out into trucks and dropped, taken back into a German town some distance back.</span> <span id="s597">Now there we did see civilians for the first time.</span> <span id="s598">We were moved into the house, we were supposed to be there for a day or so, something, til we’re moved on farther.</span> <span id="s599">But there was the conversation, what little German I had with – with one of the ladies there, because she – she was very upset, very unhappy.</span> <span id="s600">This is [indecipherable] this is your war, this is nicht unsere.</span> <span id="s601">This is not our war, this is zine(ph) war, this is your war, she was saying.</span> <span id="s602">But she wa – she was very, very upset about things.</span> <span id="s603">We didn’t accept it of course, but that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s604">We were there a limited time only and then we were take – put – back on the buses – on the bus – on the trucks again, six by sixes, and this was the long trip we had.</span> <span id="s605">This was really, now will take us into Germany itself, okay.</span> <span id="s606">We left that suburb o-of Cologne, but not until after we became aware of the first fatality we’d had in our company.</span> <span id="s607">We had some injuries because as the Germans were dropping these shells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell right into th – into the kitchen area and injured, didn’t – not badly, some of the cooks, shrapnel.</span> <span id="s608">And – an-and you had to watch it because you could sometimes hear the shells coming in and you’d duck.</span> <span id="s609">And that was pretty unnerving for – this was our first [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s610">But then we had learned and got the whole story, it was a – it was a bad situation, unhappy.</span> <span id="s611">Somebody, an officer had determined it was necessary to have an reconnaissance patrol across the Rhine.</span> <span id="s612">Why, I’m not sure, but there – maybe to make a record or something, but they saw a set up and A company supplied – I was not in – A company supplied a number of the men, and went off at nighttime, boats, rubber boats across the Rhine.</span> <span id="s613">Lieutenant Henry, who – fine, he was a good man, of the first platoon, was in charge.</span> <span id="s614">The patrol was probably about – I’m guessing probably, I understand about 15 or 20, two boats.</span> <span id="s615">They got across and as reconstructed later they came back.</span> <span id="s616">Tell – the story came back and we were told that they got over to the other shore, dark.</span> <span id="s617">Apparently there was – there had been a lot of firing and there was smoke drifting back and forth.</span> <span id="s618">And – and what happened was – was one of those drastic, terrible things that happens in combat.</span> <span id="s619">The two scouts moved out ahead.</span> <span id="s620">They were probably, as we get, maybe 10 or 15 yards ahead of the patrol itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson.</span> <span id="s623">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: The scouts had gotten out ahead, maybe 10 or 15 yards or so, and as we get the story, the main patrol was behind them.</span> <span id="s625">The main patrol saw then, two figures coming at them in the dark.</span> <span id="s626">They gave the password.</span> <span id="s627">The challenged party is supposed to answer.</span> <span id="s628">The parties did not answer.</span> <span id="s629">Somebody in the patrol opened fire, only to discover afterwards it was the scouts coming back, our own people.</span> <span id="s630">And Corny Rippons was killed, he was one of them, the other I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s631">They tried, apparently then, to carry Corny’s body back.</span> <span id="s632">They couldn't get it all the way back and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came.</span> <span id="s633">But that was our first – one of – one of those terrible thi – I mean, you know, the matter of the so-called friendly fire.</span> <span id="s634">As I think General Schwarzkopf said once, once the missile leaves the barrel, it’s no longer friendly.</span> <span id="s635">But it was a bad thing, so we – on that – on that note then, we learned about that basically.</span> <span id="s636">And then – then after that, the next day or so came our continuing trip on into Germany farther.</span> <span id="s637">To go and pick that up, we left during the day, six by sixes again, the same trucks, parallel down through Cologne itself and then on south to Bonn.</span> <span id="s638">And we’re going through Bonn, later of course, the capitol of the west – West Germany, a ba – interesting old town.</span> <span id="s639">I remember from Aunt Agnes’ [indecipherable] that was the birthplace of Beethoven, here are these things coming back.</span> <span id="s640">We wound up someth – south of Bonn and then onto a pontoon bridge to cross the Rhine.</span> <span id="s641">We crossed the Rhine then at a pontoon bridge.</span> <span id="s642">We could see to the south what were called the Drachenfels, that’s part of that – tha – of the other Wagnerian business.</span> <span id="s643">And there were – there were – there were barrage balloons farther south.</span> <span id="s644">We learned later that’s the point where the first bridge had been captured across the Rhine at Remagen, it’s quite a way south, but we saw the balloons.</span> <span id="s645">Then – now by this time we were really now on the east side of the Rhine and moving deeper into Germany.</span> <span id="s646">We crossed several remarkably interesting roads, because they were autobahns that had built, you know, by the Reich in – and the Germans in the 1930’s as – as big work projects.</span> <span id="s647">We crossed them.</span> <span id="s648">So we got the ti – we got the word autobahn right away.</span> <span id="s649">But farther into Germany we began seeing more signs of combat.</span> <span id="s650">There were destroyed tanks, American tanks and [indecipherable] tanks, too.</span> <span id="s651">We went through, oh I would say some 60 miles or so east, a major town called Siegen, s-i-e-g-e-n, and then we turned north up into what was called the Ruhr pocket, called that because about a week or 10 days before, two major American armored thrusts, armored divisions had moved east parallel to each other, about 60 - 70 miles apart, between them being the German Ruhr, which was the great industrial area, and is, actually.</span> <span id="s652">Düsseldorf, Duren, Essen and so forth.</span> <span id="s653">Then, as these two armored thrusts went east, they began to come together in out at area called Paderborn, p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e.</span> <span id="s654">They joined.</span> <span id="s655">That became within that, what was called the Ruhr pocket.</span> <span id="s656">Then the plan apparently was that they would – Americans, we would bring in reinforcing divisions along where those two big pincers – p-i-n-c-e-r-s had come together.</span> <span id="s657">The divisions would then, on the south side turn to the north, on the north side turn to the south and gradually converge to come together to eliminate the pocket.</span> <span id="s658">We were one of those divisions.</span> <span id="s659">Other divisions were the 78th, the men of the eighth division, I’ll come back that, that we had re-reinforced – replaced, they come into the pocket.</span> <span id="s660">The 97th division was there, on the south side.</span> <span id="s661">We were taken to a small town called Zimmersbach(ph) z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h – z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h.</span> <span id="s662">Small, tiny, tiny town.</span> <span id="s663">We were billeted in a house, a great, huge manure pile out in front, typically of – of a – of a – of a German peasant area.</span> <span id="s664">A comfortable house, so we – we – it was good because we – the guys could find eggs and we fried eggs and so we were there a matter of two or three days getting final togetherness and getting things ready.</span> <span id="s665">I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we attended church, and one of the medics we had was a – a very accomplished organist who played the German organ there.</span> <span id="s666">I remember seeing in the front cemetery of the church there was some – some – some graves which had been obviously German soldiers buried there, I mean they [indecipherable] where they were buried.</span> <span id="s667">Then – then we left that area, April eighth of 1945, we were taken by our six by sixes in the final – the final stretch – or we’re – we’re hiking, we’re – we are on foot, into a wooded area, because we’re getting ready to take off, as we say, if we jump off in the attack the next day.</span> <span id="s668">So we’re rowt – right up – right practically at the front.</span> <span id="s669">And spent the night there in bivouac, not tents, we just s-slept outside, basically.</span> <span id="s670">And then early the next morning we – we jumped off in the attack.</span> <span id="s671">That would have been April ninth now, of 1945.</span> <span id="s672">To the north – nor-northwest actually, into the pocket.</span> <span id="s673">Then, next several days, our first major incursion into the area, the area was called Sauerland, s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d.</span> <span id="s674">Sauerland, one word, l-a-n-d, because apparently the soil was – was – of all strange things to know – but it was very rugged country, wooded.</span> <span id="s675">I-I-In the infantry we say, excellent defensive terrain for the defender, huh.</span> <span id="s676">We moved through it.</span> <span id="s677">Not much was happening, however.</span> <span id="s678">The Germans were pulling back, there was some occasional firefights there, not much.</span> <span id="s679">And I remember several times there, we – we did experience German mortars coming in as they were defending, but not – not a great deal.</span> <span id="s680">It was a fast push, because we would be on the way most of the time.</span> <span id="s681">We – at nighttime we’d grab a few hours sleep if we could, maybe in a – in a – in a – I remember sleeping one night on the – on the – on the – on the kitchen floor.</span> <span id="s682">Another night we were – and that was lucky, we were in a barn, and they had some straw.</span> <span id="s683">But pretty much we were pushing.</span> <span id="s684">And that would have been Monday we jumped off, Tuesday that way.</span> <span id="s685">And then it was on Wednesday, which was April 11th when we began – I si – remember seeing a sign in gothic print, Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n, three k-ms ahead.</span> <span id="s686">And that was when we began really approaching Attendorn and that’s – that was our first major combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And you –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: We were on the reverse, or south side of a hill, in strength, meaning we were – we were – we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s689">We – A company at that time was the – was in the lead.</span> <span id="s690">To explain, I am the lead.</span> <span id="s691">Normally in a battalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side by side, the third in reserve.</span> <span id="s692">And the same with two bi – there might be two ba – battalions there, and the third in reserve.</span> <span id="s693">At that time A company then, we – we were leading in the attack into this town called Attendorn.</span> <span id="s694">And the result was, up the hillside, I remember then around the c – as we made the curve on a roadway and began working through the trees, we looked across and there was a treeburst on the distant hill.</span> <span id="s695">Let me explain treeburst.</span> <span id="s696">Artillery shells are so constructed, either number one, they’re solid shells, or secondly explosive shells.</span> <span id="s697">Explosive shells are ones that have a very sensitive tip on the end.</span> <span id="s698">And the minute that even touches any object, even a twig, it would explode.</span> <span id="s699">Very sen – and in a fa – in an artillery barrage, if the barrage is going into wooded area, as it would hit the trees, it’d break and that’s called a treeburst.</span> <span id="s700">Very, very dangerous because of the – the shell – shrapnel just spins right down.</span> <span id="s701">That was at a distance though, but – I’m speaking to you.</span> <span id="s702">Then we came around the top of the hill and then ahead of us, red tile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was Attendorn.</span> <span id="s703">We came up through – I si – the company, I mean basically, I remember we’re coming past some of the units of our cannon company, the cannon company and – the cannon company is a large, self propelled, it’s a one-oh-five.</span> <span id="s704">Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) of our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but he also has some direction and control over the fourth platoon, the weapons platoon, he was helping on that too.</span> <span id="s705">Weapons platoon then began setting up machine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our platoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the double, rifles up well, ther-there ha – we call porter, to attack the town.</span> <span id="s706">And then we began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s.</span> <span id="s707">We learned afterwards that the entire Ruhr was so much attacked by allied aircraft that they had a tremendous amount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft material.</span> <span id="s708">88s and 20-20s.</span> <span id="s709">When there were no longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level those and use against the aca – ca – oncoming Americans.</span> <span id="s710">So we had a lot of – a lot of 88s coming in, artillery.</span> <span id="s711">There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak, and as we started down the hill, 3rd platoon began taking casualties.</span> <span id="s712">We had a sergeant who was killed, our lieutenant was injured.</span> <span id="s713">Several others were injured down the late – way, too, basically.</span> <span id="s714">This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat.</span> <span id="s715">And it’s a strange thing.</span> <span id="s716">You’re there, it’s happening to you, and yet fortunately, because of the discipline you’ve had, you – you’re scared, right down in the pit of your stomach, but – but y-y-you do it, you go on.</span> <span id="s717">Then into this house right nearby – I sa – I say, then, a number of us.</span> <span id="s718">And then Dave Sargent(ph) – Sergeant Dave, a sergeant, I remember, was outside, he said okay, because then the next thing we had to do out of the house, Dave directed us down the hill, we went on down the hill to cross a river, a small stream, waist high.</span> <span id="s719">Cold, though.</span> <span id="s720">Up the other side basically and I – I – I’d had – I forgot, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete, you’re the first one across.</span> <span id="s721">So I crossed the river, up onto the other side, cold, rifles held high to keep them dry, and there was sniper fire coming in over the railroad.</span> <span id="s722">Then across the railroad, we got across okay, but you get – for the first time you’re getting some vicious snapping – you know, th-the – or sniping, around.</span> <span id="s723">Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out.</span> <span id="s724">We learned however, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because he had good German, go in with a white flag and their at – their – see if they surrender.</span> <span id="s725">The company man who thought they might.</span> <span id="s726">They wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s727">The name was Bob Oelke, o-e-l-k-e.</span> <span id="s728">The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him, tossed him in the cellar.</span> <span id="s729">With presence of mind he went into the next room, because they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped.</span> <span id="s730">But that we learned later.</span> <span id="s731">Into the town and then we began moving through.</span> <span id="s732">We, meaning the third platoon, we were still there.</span> <span id="s733">Now, at that time, as we moved along, by this time it’s probably three, four in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s734">Cobblestone streets, rifles on the ready, covering each other.</span> <span id="s735">This is called a mopping up operation.</span> <span id="s736">But the Germans seemed to have pulled out – I mean, I don’t remember anything more at that time.</span> <span id="s737">And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street [indecipherable] that we approached a factory area.</span> <span id="s738">Obviously there was some – and then behind this barbed wire fence were these people, unkempt, dirty, emaciated and Mac – I’m sorry, MacGilvery(ph), in charge, I was behind him, went up and opened the gate.</span> <span id="s739">Now, at this point I must explain that for some reason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the gate, but I have talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of Dallas, Texas.</span> <span id="s740">He – he had detail – details I’d forgotten.</span> <span id="s741">Strange about memory, some things you – but Mac is very explicit that he’d opened the gate.</span> <span id="s742">The people were in there.</span> <span id="s743">They realized apparently we’re Americans, uniforms ra – they began crowding out and – and – and – and – and trying to embrace us, and – and – and kiss us apparently.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t recall that.</span> <span id="s745">But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was confirmed by – by sar – Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by Lieutenant – then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy stench and odor.</span> <span id="s746">Again, I – this I didn’t recall and I’m surprised because I’m normally pretty aware of olfactory things.</span> <span id="s747">But it was there, amb – obviously.</span> <span id="s748">What I do recall though now, very clearly, myself.</span> <span id="s749">We had gone into a nearby building, because Mac’s determination was we gotta – gotta watch out for whate – there might be krauts around.</span> <span id="s750">Kraut being the derogative name for German.</span> <span id="s751">There might be krauts here, they gotta check it out.</span> <span id="s752">And I remember stepping into the building now, and I think it – it was a large room, maybe 50 by 50 or so.</span> <span id="s753">And I do remember there were – there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac started to walk over across the room.</span> <span id="s754">Now, in his detail, Sergeant MacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it – he – he’s from Texas.</span> <span id="s755">It was horse’s skeleton.</span> <span id="s756">And walked over.</span> <span id="s757">This I remember too, beca – he walked over and there was an old – to me appeared to be an old woman, crouched down, holding something.</span> <span id="s758">And – and Mac was over there, paused for a moment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I’m being explicit.</span> <span id="s759">Those goddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches.</span> <span id="s760">The lady is scraping out that horse’s skull for food and eating it.</span> <span id="s761">Gee, well.</span> <span id="s762">He also said, forget about the goddamn horse, they’ve scraped all the meat off that too.</span> <span id="s763">There was a heavy – I remember it now, this at – there was a heavy odor and – and we walked past and – and there was a body.</span> <span id="s764">I’m not sure dead or alive, but – but – but Mac pointed out the face and he – he – look at that poor son of a bitch’s legs, they were – they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been putrid-putri-putrefaction, I’m guessing.</span> <span id="s765">Back out into the street, fresh air thank God, because all the other – and on back out and I remember we got back out in the street and as our patrol got back out there, somebody behind me was throwing up, one of our guys be – just – just the impact of it.</span> <span id="s766">And Mac said, and I did remember this, that a lot of – they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know [indecipherable] people were out in the street, they just kind of wandered out, the gate was open.</span> <span id="s767">A – an officer came along and advised that we had to get them back inside because they needed attention, whatever.</span> <span id="s768">And they could not be wandering the street by themselves, so somehow, and I don’t recall, they must have been herded back in, because after that then we – we moved ahead and we were on our way after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Let’s talk a little bit more about that experience before we move ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Did you try to talk to any of these prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Not – not that I remember.</span> <span id="s773">Now, in my – in – in my notes – and I mention notes because – I-I must go ahead, I’ll fast – fast forward a moment.</span> <span id="s774">When we had gotten back from Europe, we had a 30 day – a 30 day furlough.</span> <span id="s775">We were the first division back from Europe, big welcome, but we have 30 days.</span> <span id="s776">And during that time I sat down and typed out my – a log.</span> <span id="s777">Now in – in that log that I have – I-I got it – well, of course, it was so fresh then.</span> <span id="s778">I c – I could do it day by day and the towns, the names of towns and guys names.</span> <span id="s779">I showed basically in that – and if I may refer for a moment to this.</span> <span id="s780">This – this isn’t my original log.</span> <span id="s781">And turning now on it to April 11th, and here we are at Attendorn.</span> <span id="s782">I am showing here things that I’ve touched upon quite a bit before, some other details that don’t relate to this, but as to this particular matter, through the houses, as we’re going up the street, into the town.</span> <span id="s783">Pillbox warehouses, first platoon to our right flank, went through houses, capture of a German ak-ak crew in the photo shop.</span> <span id="s784">West and south along the [indecipherable] past the bridge to the left, with an 88 covering, okay.</span> <span id="s785">Through the factory into – I [indecipherable] a Russian prisoner enclosure.</span> <span id="s786">Now, whether we were told they were Russians, I have no recollection o-of the – I wouldn’t know Russian probably, well if I – you know, I could guess, but – when I’d heard it basically.</span> <span id="s787">And I don’t recall any conversation with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did any of them try to touch you?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I don’t – I don’t recall that, but Mac in his recitation says that they were trying to grab us and so forth.</span> <span id="s790">We probably pushed them off.</span> <span id="s791">Again, this heavy, terrible odor, and – and – and Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) who was there at the time, and I hadn’t realized this, he said it was caused probably, mostly from lot of – the latrines.</span> <span id="s792">The latrines were only ditches dug there, said captain, about 30 - 40 feet long, full of excrement and – an-and – and other elimination that caused this terribly heavy odor that was there.</span> <span id="s793">But as far as – I don’t recall the touching, but Mac says that they were trying to grab us.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Were they wearing civilian clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s796">Th-These were not – these were not prison type uniforms at all.</span> <span id="s797">They just seemed to be, as I remember, just civilian clothes, but rags – ragged, torn and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: These were men and women.</span> <span id="s799">Were there any young people, or mostly –</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I do not recall –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: – age-wise?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: – seeing any young people.</span> <span id="s803">Now Mac mentions that there was an episode, a part of that we left there, said he that there was a woman who apparently it was a – had been a prisoner, who – who apparently was – was getting at and be-beating up a German woman who may have been a guard.</span> <span id="s804">Now, as near as – apparently there were both men and women there.</span> <span id="s805">Whether they were housed together, I-I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Not long.</span> <span id="s808">My own recollection was that – that our – our going into the room where the – the horse’s skeleton was, probably three, maybe five minutes at the outside, because it was, as I said, Mac got right over, saw what it was, and we just left pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s809">There were no German soldiers at all to run – there – there – there – the Germans had pulled out apparently – apparently.</span> <span id="s810">So we were out of there within oh, I’d say probably five minutes.</span> <span id="s811">A little longer, then probably get out of the compound, back out on the street again.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Did you try to feed any of them?</span> <span id="s813">Give them any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Not too my knowledge.</span> <span id="s815">Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s816">The situation has been really defined by Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph) quite well.</span> <span id="s817">When, as we look at it in the context of that whole day, we had had a drastic experience coming in.</span> <span id="s818">I mean, the – we – th-the fighting and so forth, and the weaponry.</span> <span id="s819">And – and – and this was just one other part of it, and – and it did not really assume any great importance until a more recent time, when we realize now, seeing what was happening elsewhere in Germany, the scenes we’ve seen of the death camps.</span> <span id="s820">Now, there were – I’m told – historians – a good friend who’s an historian says that there were no death camps up in the Ruhr.</span> <span id="s821">Slave labor camps only, which – which apparently the Germans had established the industry to set little satellite areas where prisoners would be required that th – th-the labors to build parts or something of that type, which would then be taken in and used by the German industry in the major cities of Düsseldorf, whatever.</span> <span id="s822">But that was a part of – of the whole program.</span> <span id="s823">But, backing into their appearance, there was emaciation basically and – and – and – and – but the – but the – that the clothes, they were wearing rags, tags, but they were not uniforms, as I recall.</span> <span id="s824">Just not uniform types.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Was it a frightening experience for you to see people in this kind of condition?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Very different.</span> <span id="s827">Different.</span> <span id="s828">I don’t know that it was any more frightening than what we’d already had, I mean in the combat side of it, you know, from the firing and so forth.</span> <span id="s829">I-I think – I think it was just, we accepted it, but without really paying a great deal of attention to it at the time.</span> <span id="s830">I mean, it was there, we saw, it was there basically it was bad, it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did it make a difference to you that these were civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: It was different in the sense that the – the – these were not combatants, not combatants, and how they could be used that way, later on upon reflection, you realize, yeah.</span> <span id="s833">At the time, that’s the way it was, but then you begin to think about it afterwards and yeah, there’s a part of the – the incongruity of it, I mean, the fact that they were simply civilians, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: You said when you walked out, one of your fellow soldiers got nauseous.</span> <span id="s835">Did you all talk about what you had just seen?</span> <span id="s836">Did anybody say anything to the other person?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Oh, the usual.</span> <span id="s838">The usual oaths and so forth and expressions of you know, to put it bluntly, Jesus Christ, what the hell are we seeing, what was – well, all – all – all – all – without going – becoming too explicit, but you get the idea, I mean, gee, I mean, my God, it – it was – it was an incredible thing, yeah.</span> <span id="s839">I suppose the – the passage of years puts a – puts a different complexion on it.</span> <span id="s840">I know that – that as far as other parts of combat, guys were killed, we recognized it, accepted it.</span> <span id="s841">And I realized, it wasn’t until maybe after getting home, the 30 day span of time, it really began to come back of what we had been through and seen.</span> <span id="s842">I wonder if probably in that situation you – you – you develop a sort of an inurement to that.</span> <span id="s843">I-I know that was our discipline, held us together despite the fear, the terror.</span> <span id="s844">And – and – and – and – and to be, for example in a – in a -- an artillery barrage is a – is – is – is – is a gut grinding – you know, experience.</span> <span id="s845">But we were there, and – and – and it was a part of it.</span> <span id="s846">Some guys – we had a few that – that chickened out, that couldn't handle it.</span> <span id="s847">My sergeant – not – not – well, not – not Mac, he was fine, but my own squad sergeant, we got through Attendorn, if this is a part of what you want, we were talking about, we got through Attendorn to the other side, came back on the same railroad again, dropped down to take a few minutes break basically, and then Sergeant Markson(ph) from Iowa, good chap, and my own sergeant, George Evans just flopped down.</span> <span id="s848">George was ashen.</span> <span id="s849">He said, I can’t take this shit, he says, I – I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s850">Bud came down pretty – he said, George, God damnit, you got the stripes, this is our job.</span> <span id="s851">And maybe that did it, but – but – but – but he – geor – he was out of it.</span> <span id="s852">Now, I think he got put back together himself a lit – later on.</span> <span id="s853">But – but at the time, he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s854">It happened, and you couldn’t – from unexpected persons, it ha-happened.</span> <span id="s855">You would have expected some others, who you think might be washouts, did well.</span> <span id="s856">It – it – it – th-there’s no rule of thumb.</span> <span id="s857">But that was a particular experience at that time.</span> <span id="s858">You speak about the matter of what we had seen and so forth.</span> <span id="s859">I-I don’t know, there wasn’t a lot of discussion afterwards, we went through it, that was it.</span> <span id="s860">Other things were taking priority.</span> <span id="s861">I mean, you know, your own safety and your own welfare and what was going to happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And then what did happen next?</span> <span id="s863">You left the town of Attendorn and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: We stayed there that night.</span> <span id="s865">We finished through the town probably by six, seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s866">We were assigned there and the next thing that they – that the – Captain Mitchell did was to establish a guard perimeter around the hills around the town.</span> <span id="s867">So the nor – the north hilltop.</span> <span id="s868">And Sergeant Evans and myself and Frank Horn went up to one hilltop and were there that night.</span> <span id="s869">And that-that was the night later on that we got machine gun fire in the black of the night and – and in the topography of it, on the hilltop, George above me and to the north, Frank Horn above me a bit and to the south, and I was down.</span> <span id="s870">Machine gun fire, George was – was killed almost immediately and Frank so badly shot up in the back, he – tha-that – that – back to battalion aid and died several days later, I guess.</span> <span id="s871">All I got, a – incredibly fortunate, just a flesh wound in my – in the – my – in my left leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: You are 19 years old, how did you feel – how old did you feel after that day and that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I didn’t realize what had happened about getting a – th-th-the [indecipherable] my leg, until the next morning.</span> <span id="s874">We came off the hilltop that night.</span> <span id="s875">Our – our – our medic Hank Billskey(ph) was right there, I see him now, he was right there, amazing, after this happened.</span> <span id="s876">My captain, Captain Greenburg(ph), who is here in Washington with me, we’ve had [indecipherable] we talked about that this morning.</span> <span id="s877">He was describing some of the things that happened to him, so – these close calls.</span> <span id="s878">Friend he had been in OCS with was killed with a treeburst about three or four feet away from him.</span> <span id="s879">And as I told him, I said, Captain, I can – I can sit here and right now, I ca – I can hear – I can hear George gurgling as he was dying.</span> <span id="s880">I can hear – I can hear Frank – when Billskey(ph) got there he said, I need a sa – I need a syrette.</span> <span id="s881">That – that was a morphine syrette.</span> <span id="s882">An-And Hank says my God, he said, good for you.</span> <span id="s883">In – in it – he – he co – he could name it [indecipherable] right there.</span> <span id="s884">So, it could come right back, I don’t know that there was any particular sign of aging at the time.</span> <span id="s885">I-It doesn’t – it doesn’t come that peremptorily.</span> <span id="s886">You realize after you’ve gone all through these things that – that – you know, you had them.</span> <span id="s887">Bur as far as an immediate recognition, it’s just a part of the whole damn thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson.</span> <span id="s890">This is tape number two, side B. And you were talking about your reaction to the – that day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: A-As commented, I think – I think that at the time there is a – there – there is an insulation, I suppose, that is given you by your – your discipline that you have, to a degree.</span> <span id="s892">Other things become so drastic that you – something I suppose, maybe mentally helps block them out.</span> <span id="s893">To get through them you have to.</span> <span id="s894">Maybe, as I suggested, it was only after getting back in a peacetime setting like the – our har – our months furlough.</span> <span id="s895">And I remember it happened when I was home, after we’d gotten back from Europe, th-the month between, we went back several times, I ca – I kind of – and I-I-I know that the death of a couple guys swept back.</span> <span id="s896">George, Frank’s did, some others we had then too, the – just the – the – the – the immensity of it.</span> <span id="s897">After those experiences, you’re do – you do have dreams and nightmares.</span> <span id="s898">I had – it’s diminished greatly over the years, but after first getting out of the service, an-and let me just finish perhaps by the German experience, we had that then.</span> <span id="s899">Then we also had some more drastic experience.</span> <span id="s900">We were the second company, the second American company in the whole army to cross the Danube farther south.</span> <span id="s901">A company from the 103rd division to the southwest, crossed in the morning of the 26th, and we crossed the night of the 26th, so by – by an English [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s902">And we lost a number of people there, and a lot of – quite a few wounded.</span> <span id="s903">Some wounded.</span> <span id="s904">But it’s after then as I discovered, getting back over there, I would have occasional dreams that would be quite frightening.</span> <span id="s905">I’d wake.</span> <span id="s906">They’ve diminished.</span> <span id="s907">And yet even now I do have a recurrent dream which is that – either – I’m either going to be going into the army again, or I’m in the army again.</span> <span id="s908">And I find that I have a feeling of concern, of fear, if you please.</span> <span id="s909">And terribly glad to wake up to realize that it is not happening again.</span> <span id="s910">That i – that has come sometimes.</span> <span id="s911">The most drastic thing recently was to have seen the movie “Saving Private Ryan.”</span> <span id="s912">Now, I’ve talked to my company – Captain Greenburg(ph), he’s seen it too.</span> <span id="s913">Every – every combat veteran I’ve talked to has had a similar experience, some more, some less, but I remember, to see it, the first oh, five minutes is in the cemetery, but then – then you begin – then one begins seeing the beginning of D-Day with the small craft, the landing craft coming in.</span> <span id="s914">Now, we were not D-Day of course, but we did have the training in amphibious.</span> <span id="s915">And it was a remarkable thing because as I watched that in the darkened theater – my sa – Pat wa – wife Pat did not go.</span> <span id="s916">As I watched that and – and – and – and the camera, for those who will see it recall that you saw the boats from the side and then that moved over and panned right into the boat itself, and you’re looking at the men.</span> <span id="s917">Hanks, the captain and the ca – played the part of the captain.</span> <span id="s918">I was there again.</span> <span id="s919">It was like it was our platoon going in.</span> <span id="s920">The – the roar of the motors, the spray of the spray coming over the top.</span> <span id="s921">Guys being – throwing up around you.</span> <span id="s922">The gear all just the same, basically.</span> <span id="s923">And I began to cry, just this weeps and then when, in the picture, the craft hit the shore, the ramp went down, typical training, and then the German artillery, the mortars opened up, machine gunning the whole – I found myself audibly crying, I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s924">And I – I’ve – I – I – I have a free sample, Captain Greenburg(ph) who you [indecipherable] have met said he had the same experience.</span> <span id="s925">That he – he had that happen.</span> <span id="s926">He – he w – he was weeping.</span> <span id="s927">And to drop back to our experience, the lieutenant who had taken the platoon across the Rhine that I spoke of earlier, who had both the command responsibility of that group, a terrible burden to take back.</span> <span id="s928">After our first reunion of our company, he attended, it was back in – okay, it was Council Bluffs, my home.</span> <span id="s929">We had them there in 90 – ’95 and ’97.</span> <span id="s930">In ’95 for the first time, cap – Lieutenant Henry came.</span> <span id="s931">Now a doctor in Dallas, a – a very, very fine, but rather sensitive.</span> <span id="s932">And we visit a lot and he talked about that experience, the patrol across the Rhine.</span> <span id="s933">I had for Lieutenant Henry, after he got back home, a very gracious letter thanking us for – my wife and I.</span> <span id="s934">But he went on to say, the value it was to him to visit with comrades-in-arms of years ago, to just hear about, that – that it – he understood things better and that it relieved from his should – from his shoulders the burden of guilt that he’d felt all these years.</span> <span id="s935">One good thing about reunions, they helped.</span> <span id="s936">I talked to him, we were at ak – our division reunion in newy – Louisville last September and he’d seen the movie and he said it – I shouldn’t have, he said, it put me back again.</span> <span id="s937">So I think seeing the par – again, after all these years, it comes back.</span> <span id="s938">And you wonder – what little I read of psychology on it, they – we’re told in psychology that – that these memories are latent, that certain things can trigger them off.</span> <span id="s939">Example, the – the – the smell, the odor.</span> <span id="s940">I can stand on a street corner today, pass those – a diesel bus and the diesel fumes take me right back to our training days when the – the diesel of the outfit.</span> <span id="s941">And yet on the other hand, come back to it, I don’t remember anything about the terrible stench at Attendorn.</span> <span id="s942">Strange.</span> <span id="s943">And I don’t know.</span> <span id="s944">My one thought, it might be that – who can tell about these things?</span> <span id="s945">It may have been a reaction to what – that night, later on when we were close to death, or the others were close to death and sa – I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s946">I-I – I-I do not have the wisdom to answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Your – you’re saying that one may have superseded the – the following?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I – I – yeah, I – I – I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s949">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Where were you when President Roosevelt died?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Very interesting question because we learned about it, it was the day after the 12th of course, after the night the bad – we were – we were in – we were in – in reserve at that time in Attendorn.</span> <span id="s952">And I remember that they – they kind of got us all together basically and we had the – had this word that – that he died, and I remember it was, who the hell is Harry Truman?</span> <span id="s953">I didn’t ta – he’s our new president is who he is.</span> <span id="s954">We know – we didn’t know much about him basically, but it was – it was – you know, it – it was – it was different.</span> <span id="s955">Of course you – I’ve seen – we’ve all seen the pictures of, in this country when all the – all the – the – the – the – the weeping, I mean, and then – and the – and the sorrow and so forth.</span> <span id="s956">I don’t think, frankly, it made a lot of differ – I mean, he – so be it, I mean, it happened –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Wasn’t a sense that you had lost your commander in chief?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No, I – no, no, no.</span> <span id="s959">Things were gonna go on, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: And then what – what did happen to finish up your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: We had passed that in Duren and then as I said, we were transferred then, the pocket was finished, closed.</span> <span id="s962">We went by motor march at night.</span> <span id="s963">We were transferred from the first army to the third.</span> <span id="s964">And the first night going down in the black of the night, one of the trucks went off the road, not ours.</span> <span id="s965">We had several men killed quite a few injured on the [indecipherable] down and then we went to – in the area called Franconia.</span> <span id="s966">Went through Würzburg in Franconia.</span> <span id="s967">We’re there and then we – then we jumped off in the attack again.</span> <span id="s968">By this time we were in Patton’s third army, transferred.</span> <span id="s969">Went down through the area, cities of Eichstätt, to Ingolstadt.</span> <span id="s970">Ingolstadt was more trouble, was difficult.</span> <span id="s971">The back –</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: As you were moving, did you see any civilians, any –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: – DPs, any –</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: DPs as well, too.</span> <span id="s978">As we moved farther down and got into Bavaria, we saw quite a few more civilians.</span> <span id="s979">And saw quite a few displaced persons, as you mentioned.</span> <span id="s980">On the roads, moving, traveling, wherever they might be going.</span> <span id="s981">At the city, the town of Eichstätt, different because our company commander Captain Mitchell was ill, and then Lieutenant not Captain Greenburg(ph), then age 22 took over the company, and he had the responsibility of 200 men there were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s982">And we had – we had it – a – a bad time at Ingolstadt – I take it back, at Eichstätt.</span> <span id="s983">Got – got quite a bit of – of resistance there.</span> <span id="s984">Then on down towards the major city of Ingolstadt, which we were told was the hometown of Heinrich Himmler, expect defense.</span> <span id="s985">Well, it – I’m not sure if it was with Himmler or not, but there was a – going into Ingolstadt was not the bad, but that’s the night we crossed the Danube.</span> <span id="s986">There was resistance there and that was a – a pretty drastic night, to get in and get across basically, cross the river.</span> <span id="s987">As I said, we were th – we were the – we were the second company of the Americans to go cro – I mean, a – the whole American army to cross, apparently.</span> <span id="s988">We got a counterattack that night, got some – oh, we had a number who were killed, two or three killed, I think, and quite a few wounded.</span> <span id="s989">And that’s one of the nights one realizes how thin is the veneer of civilization, by which I mean this.</span> <span id="s990">I remember that I was the – I was the platoon runner by that time, sort of ran messages between the company command posts, CP and our – where we were, some – oh, some blocks away.</span> <span id="s991">In the black of the night the Germans had come in, and the ka – and then several were wounded.</span> <span id="s992">And I remember going past and this – this German was crying, he says, I am blessé, well, French for woun – well, be – any – and I remember I – I said – I just – I said, [speaks German] shut up.</span> <span id="s993">I mean, I – no compassion at all on my part, huh?</span> <span id="s994">Yeah, I mean, you know, just – that was it.</span> <span id="s995">And you realize that yeah, I suppose that’s our training and to – basically we – we couldn’t – couldn’t take a chance, that kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s996">Maybe he was – maybe he was just a – faking it, who knows?</span> <span id="s997">I couldn’t take a chance.</span> <span id="s998">That was Ingolstadt and then we were there brief, and then after that really, the war was really finish up because by that time we were just on the move in – in – or sometimes – sometimes we were riding tanks and going out ahead, other times mostly in trucks.</span> <span id="s999">Then, within a matter of a week we were down in Austria, we crossed into Austria.</span> <span id="s1000">We – we stopped, oh we were pro – at a small town called Perwang, which is about 20 – p-e – p-e-r-w-a-n-g, about 20 kilometers north of Salzburg, we were in Austria.</span> <span id="s1001">And there – we were there when the word that the – it was May seventh or May eighth, take your choice, the war was over.</span> <span id="s1002">And immediately rumors began coming, okay you guys, you’re already – there – you’re going to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1003">My God.</span> <span id="s1004">Well, the thought was bad, but in the meantime we realized we were gonna have some time at home.</span> <span id="s1005">So indeed that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1006">We came back by truck back to Mannheim.</span> <span id="s1007">We were there in Mannheim for a time, probably just a few days only in Feudenheim then truck again back across France to the same tents we were in when we first came, in Old Gold.</span> <span id="s1008">And then – then we got new uniforms, got the combat jackets.</span> <span id="s1009">Pretty spiffy stuff, we thought.</span> <span id="s1010">And now getting ready for home.</span> <span id="s1011">Trucks down to LaHavre.</span> <span id="s1012">I was mentioning to Captain Greenburg(ph) when we talked today, as we were leaving LaHavre now, some romantic soul put on the loudspeaker system Debussy’s Clair de Lune.</span> <span id="s1013">That was a nice departure.</span> <span id="s1014">A week back to cross the Atlantic and then came this tumultuous arrival at home, because we were the first division back from Europe and we had the grand welcome.</span> <span id="s1015">Blimps in the sky, fireboats in the – in New York harbor.</span> <span id="s1016">Great big, huge banner across a hill, well done, welcome home.</span> <span id="s1017">And off – off the ships.</span> <span id="s1018">Our ship had on a great big panel, ETO to Tokyo.</span> <span id="s1019">Well.</span> <span id="s1020">But we got in and my captain, Captain Reed(ph), we were still [indecipherable] tell me that he – his home was Hoboken.</span> <span id="s1021">His parents had learned of our return and his father was able to get around over to the Manhattan’s ri – we – I think he s – I the captain said pier 77 or something.</span> <span id="s1022">57.</span> <span id="s1023">Got off and his father was right out there.</span> <span id="s1024">Father shoved and pushed, he – right past and he bay – they kissed.</span> <span id="s1025">Marvelous, huh.</span> <span id="s1026">And even the rest of us, it – it was tremendous to come back, our own country again.</span> <span id="s1027">Amazingly – I have it here, but amazingly there were – we had dignitaries and well wishers, but a lot of media.</span> <span id="s1028">Reporter – a reporter from the “Des Moines Register” was there and we had a great big feature, which I still saved at home basically, the – the Blackhawks back again and they had the – the name of every Iowan who was coming back and – and so there were many, many happy families.</span> <span id="s1029">We knew from the Register at home they knew we’d been in combat, that’s the first word, because that had a little feature, what they’ve done.</span> <span id="s1030">And they had in the Register, toward the end of April that the 86th was in combat.</span> <span id="s1031">Course, folks were just terribly tied up, terribly tied up.</span> <span id="s1032">An amazing thing happened, a tragic thing.</span> <span id="s1033">When I – we got back to Mannheim, got our mail for the first time.</span> <span id="s1034">My mother had written that she met a good high school friend of hers of Council Bluffs, now in Omaha, they got talking and her son was in the 86th, [indecipherable] together, his name was – was Captain Bruce McAllister, of our K company [indecipherable] in our regiment.</span> <span id="s1035">And I remember as clearly sitting as we’re sitting here.</span> <span id="s1036">I remember saying to one of our – I said, my gosh, Wes, I – I’ve got to look up this Captain McAllister.</span> <span id="s1037">He says, Pete, you’re too late.</span> <span id="s1038">He was killed two weeks ago, down on the – on the [indecipherable] down the Danube.</span> <span id="s1039">So those things happen.</span> <span id="s1040">That was – now –</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: When you were leaving Europe and you were going towards LaHavre and you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Leaving LaHavre, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Yeah, no, but on your way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Oh, way in, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: On – on – on those weeks getting back there and you saw civilians and again DPs, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: – were you aware of the extent of the damage of the war at that point, or were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Well, LaHavre –</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: – or again – or again aware of the camps?</span> <span id="s1050">Were you ex – aware of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Oh, LaHavre was badly smashed, badly smashed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: But even on the way to there, you know, as you were going through other cities to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: You mean ye – on the way back, you mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: – from – yeah.</span> <span id="s1056">Mannheim – well, let me back up.</span> <span id="s1057">War finished we were it – we were north of Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1058">Back then by the autobahn, from Salzburg up to Munich – Munich was badly smashed.</span> <span id="s1059">I remember driving and we’d go over in the trucks and – and we – in – in Munich, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: I – I mean the terrible human toll.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Oh, I see, yeah.</span> <span id="s1062">We were – a lot of people – you feel particularly sorry for the old people and children, who are the – the innocent, I – truth is, much as it can be, but the children [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1063">And yet interestingly as we’d drive – I remember driving along in the trucks, there would be children watching us and they would be giving the Nazi salute.</span> <span id="s1064">They were taught – we were sold – they didn’t know, we were soldiers, and that was enough.</span> <span id="s1065">But to the civilians we would talk.</span> <span id="s1066">Now when we came back to Feudenheim, a suburb of Mannheim, where we were billeted, the Germans were there and they – they – they were all right.</span> <span id="s1067">I mean, they were very sub – subservient.</span> <span id="s1068">Get along basically, and of course, what little was that there were – you never – you never met any who were ever Nazis.</span> <span id="s1069">Down the street, I heard [indecipherable] but we were not – w-we were not political, huh?</span> <span id="s1070">Typical, typical.</span> <span id="s1071">Whatever – how did Hitler ev – ever come to power, you’re thinking.</span> <span id="s1072">None of them, none of them.</span> <span id="s1073">But it was there, you know, I s – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: O-Other – other people – let me back up, if I may.</span> <span id="s1076">Another experience that I remember that was such a remarkable thing.</span> <span id="s1077">I remember we were on trucks after we’d gone through Ackstatt – Eichstätt, heading toward, and suddenly realized that – that the trucks were being surrounded practically by this wild horde of persons in green uniforms.</span> <span id="s1078">They’re Russian – Russian.</span> <span id="s1079">They were Russian, released Russian – Russian appar – I’m sorry, Russian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1080">And my first rec – these are like Chinese.</span> <span id="s1081">Mongolians, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1082">My – my first realization, I mean, you read of – of what Russia was, I mean, all this – this variegated population, in appearance, I mean, the-these were Orientals, basically, huh.</span> <span id="s1083">Then they moved on back basically, we go to the – we would see again – a-again also – we came across a number in Bavaria of allied prisoners, British, who were out of ba – sent to work on farms, huh.</span> <span id="s1084">Course you know, th-they – they were – they were lucky to be in the country so they had food, you know.</span> <span id="s1085">Others didn’t.</span> <span id="s1086">I don’t remember though – there were quite a few displaced persons moving back.</span> <span id="s1087">It’s hard to get a count, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Did you see anybody in prison camp you – concentration camp uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: No.</span> <span id="s1090">The on – th-they were just civilian clothing, basically, that we saw.</span> <span id="s1091">Now, to back – go back to the death camp side, though.</span> <span id="s1092">After we – our division, 86th, was in – we were down in Austria, our engineer battalion, I understand, was sent over to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1093">And I had a friend in it, and he – he – he said he – again, he’d never such terror in his – that’s where you had that – of course, the slave was bad enough, but of course there were others where you’ve seen the pictures of, they are just incredible, incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: By May of ’45, June of ’45, had you heard of a place called Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: I don’t think that we got the names until later.</span> <span id="s1096">None of them, to my recollection, none of them.</span> <span id="s1097">That seemed to come later.</span> <span id="s1098">But then of course, by – we learned more of it during the fall.</span> <span id="s1099">By that time we had been back home, furlough, trained again briefly at Gruber(ph) then came to Baums(ph) and we were sent out to the Philippines.</span> <span id="s1100">We were in the Philippines now when the war trials, the Japanese were going on.</span> <span id="s1101">General Hawla(ph) for example, was being tried there.</span> <span id="s1102">We saw a lot of the – of the – the tales of atrocities committed by – and they were – by the Japanese, as they were leaving the Philippines and that was really – that was bad.</span> <span id="s1103">And – and of course the same time, I’m not exactly sure, I think the Nuremberg trials were in October November, maybe, of ’45, right?</span> <span id="s1104">And so we began seeing more of – in just general, news about the information coming out.</span> <span id="s1105">Th-That – so much was new that I – incredible.</span> <span id="s1106">But I don’t recall prior to that time any of the names, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: How long were you in the Philippines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: We got to the Philippines, we – we – to draw back.</span> <span id="s1109">We were at Camp Gruber(ph) for a couple weeks, and then the bombs, what was it, like August 6th, August whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1110">And naga – fi-first of course Hiroshima, then Nagasaki.</span> <span id="s1111">We were on – we were on the train shortly after that by order.</span> <span id="s1112">We got to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1113">We sailed to San Francisco about the last week – next to last week in August.</span> <span id="s1114">Got to the Philippines about three weeks later and we were there from late in September.</span> <span id="s1115">And the program was this, that as you were in longer, there was a point system, so many points for so many months.</span> <span id="s1116">Combat infantry badge gave you 10 extra points, a Purple Heart gave you fi – by the point system then, you see, our particular group was ready to come back, and we did, we left in March from Manila to come back, March o-of ’46.</span> <span id="s1117">We were home a month later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: And then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: First of all bought a suit of clothes.</span> <span id="s1120">No, beyond that it was fla – great to be back home again, of course.</span> <span id="s1121">Planned to go, and I did then begin school.</span> <span id="s1122">My summertime was open.</span> <span id="s1123">Began school at the University of Iowa in – in September of ’46, right away.</span> <span id="s1124">And I finished my schooling there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: So you went four years of university?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: I had to go – yes – es – I – I had – well, I had a little bit of a credit from – from Kansas, in Drake, not much.</span> <span id="s1127">But result was that I – I took what is called a combined schedule of liberal arts and law.</span> <span id="s1128">Your first – your first three years are all liberal arts.</span> <span id="s1129">Then your first year law, combined with – with the other.</span> <span id="s1130">So you actually had the whole thing six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: I had – I went through the summertime basically [indecipherable] so I – then I finished – I finished my – the law s – law school in June ’51 and took the bar.</span> <span id="s1133">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: [indecipherable] I went home to Council Bluffs, I entered my father’s firm.</span> <span id="s1136">Dad was still practicing at the time.</span> <span id="s1137">And practiced with the firm then following that time.</span> <span id="s1138">Met my wife at Iowa, Pat and I were married in – mustn’t forget this, August 14th of – of – of 1949.</span> <span id="s1139">So we has the last two years of school together and then came back home and our first child was born October of ’51, and been practicing law since that time.</span> <span id="s1140">In October – November of 1955, Dad, my father was appointed to the Iowa Supreme Court.</span> <span id="s1141">After which time then, I was in the firm, of course, continued that basically.</span> <span id="s1142">And then I made some career changes over the years, but I practiced law ever since that time.</span> <span id="s1143">All – all – practice of law all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And you are currently still working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: In a private firm, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: No, no, I – well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1148">I, for a variety of reasons left the – Dad’s law firm, he – he was long since gone, in 70 – ’75, and then I was a trust officer of – of a bank for two years.</span> <span id="s1149">Then back in the practice, I practiced since that time.</span> <span id="s1150">First on my own, and now with another firm which is Telpner, Peterson, Smith and Ruesch in Council Bluffs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: And you’re also a magistrate judge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I’m a part ti – i-it’s called United States Magistrate Judge exactly, it’s a part time position.</span> <span id="s1153">And have – and a-actually, interesting because I’m – last June I finished 40 years of federal service, long.</span> <span id="s1154">And I think probably my position is going to be fazed out.</span> <span id="s1155">The picture changes.</span> <span id="s1156">Quite alright, but it’s been – it’s been fine, so – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: And how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Three.</span> <span id="s1159">Daughter in the 40’s, married of course.</span> <span id="s1160">And then they have – they have three children.</span> <span id="s1161">The older son, married and they have three children and the younger son, married with one child.</span> <span id="s1162">So I have seven grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Can we now talk a little bit about some of your feelings and reflections about what you went through, though you have alluded – you have talked about some of it already.</span> <span id="s1164">Do you think you are a different person today because of what you experienced during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Oh yes, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: And if so, in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: As I mentioned before, I think my – I do not ha – had had a rather sheltered life, even through high school.</span> <span id="s1168">I was the – the so – the youngest in the family basically and so forth, and I – I think probably looking back, indulged to a degree.</span> <span id="s1169">But I was typical growing up.</span> <span id="s1170">There is no question though, that being in the military, you’re on the common denominator with a lot of other people of all different backgrounds, sizes, shapes, tempers, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1171">It’s a very – to me a very valuable experience.</span> <span id="s1172">Require a lot of self confidence about it, but you get to assume much – realize so much more about people and understanding people hopefully.</span> <span id="s1173">And having served as we had in the military, too, it’s a – it’s a source of satisfaction, and – and – and not to be nostalgic or sentimental about it, but I think to me there is a – there is a great – a great value and a great importance of serving one’s country.</span> <span id="s1174">And I think all of us felt that, at least the World War II people pretty much.</span> <span id="s1175">I can’t speak for the other – in Vietnam, different things basically.</span> <span id="s1176">But I think for us it was a source of gratification, satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1177">I – I – I know, in answer t – to answer to the question presented that it – that it was a very valuable experience for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: When your children were 19 and 20, the age – 19, th-the age that you were when you experienced such life threatening ex – you know, moments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Did that bring back to you in those years, when your children were that age, what you went through?</span> <span id="s1181">Did it trigger memories or thoughts of those times?</span> <span id="s1182">When you looked at your son and he was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1184">I didn’t think that much about it.</span> <span id="s1185">When sons were that age we were fussing around with rebel without cause kids.</span> <span id="s1186">We were fussing around with musical colleges, what to do.</span> <span id="s1187">And – and at that time too, concerns about what life was doing to them, with exposure to drugs and so forth.</span> <span id="s1188">Fortunately that – not, but it-it’s a concern for parents.</span> <span id="s1189">That wasn’t happening then, I – and I never really – I never really equated them with my experience very much.</span> <span id="s1190">And I knew – I talked to a degree military, the importance of my – of my experience basic – we never talked very much about it, though, I mean as far as what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: That was going to be my next question.</span> <span id="s1192">Did you share with them those –</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Wife [indecipherable] she would make occasional references to it, but I – all to a degree they knew about it, but not until several years ago, which was the 50th year after Attendorn, the rite of peace, which I call – and then only because I felt the time had – some – generally speaking these are things you visit only with your buddy – your – your – your – your immediate friends about.</span> <span id="s1194">Other veterans to a degree too, yeah, but you can really share with those that you served with.</span> <span id="s1195">You have your own lingua franca that you can go back and forth with.</span> <span id="s1196">And you – you can share with them, say a certain thing and a whole picture comes back.</span> <span id="s1197">One of our – one of our A company people, James McRandall(ph) later got his doctorate in history.</span> <span id="s1198">And – and Jim is a brilliant fellow.</span> <span id="s1199">Wrote a marvelous book called, “The Antique Drums of War,” in which he – in which he profiled quite a bit our – our military experience and ha – its affect upon us.</span> <span id="s1200">Does a – a marvelous job in my judgment of – of – of describing, as best one can, combat, put into words, but – but as he would say, to get together to re – renew recollections at a – a reunion is like watching a broken mirror, in the sense that the mirror is broken and there are certain shards of memory that come back.</span> <span id="s1201">Shards of memory like I’ve talked about here.</span> <span id="s1202">Sometimes incomplete.</span> <span id="s1203">We see – we see this broken mirror, each of us in a different way, because in our combat experience, some of what – had the things – some, for example, what Sergeant Mac in great detail, hm, things that – that for some reason or another, now whether – whether they’re still latently – latent up here, that need to be triggered, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1204">But – yes Ma’am?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson.</span> <span id="s1207">This is tape three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: We have spoken about my friend Jim McRandall’s(ph) analogy of the – of – of – of the broken mirror and the shards of memory, and – and says Jim, just as you cannot effectively reconstruct that mirror with the broken shards, some pieces are missing, some pieces are quite sharp, to carry on the – the – the metaphor of it.</span> <span id="s1209">But to all of us, to all of us, we can go back, and in our experience, in this – in the world in which we live, the – the – i-in my terms, the crucible of contra – of combat, you can see and remember the expression a certain fellow had, one of your – one of your G.I. buddies on the street corner at a certain time.</span> <span id="s1210">You can – you can see or visualize a hillside, or a certain setting where you were and what was happening at the time.</span> <span id="s1211">You can still recall the thunk of a mortar in the distance or the rattle of machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s1212">And they bring back – they – they can bring back these things, in some bizarre, strange way, but can never be fully – never fully reconstructed, just as – as a broken mirror can not be.</span> <span id="s1213">And what you’re seeing in the broken mirror also many times is – and results of being distorted in some ways, you know, th-th-the – the different angles you’re seeing of it.</span> <span id="s1214">And – and – and that’s why you get with different veterans different views of things.</span> <span id="s1215">The – the famous story of – of the – of the four blind men blindfolded with the elephant.</span> <span id="s1216">One, the one leg and the trunk and so forth.</span> <span id="s1217">And you – then that’s very much the way it is.</span> <span id="s1218">And – and in – in a combat situation, the first thing you realize is there’s begin – it-it’s confusion.</span> <span id="s1219">I have here our division history.</span> <span id="s1220">And as I read it through there are many areas – history is hard – is hard to recover accurately and I find many things that I – I ca – I describe as being garbled in this.</span> <span id="s1221">It depends who one talks to, it depends how it’s reconstructed, and it – wh-while there’s a lot of good work, at the same time there are things that do come off wrong.</span> <span id="s1222">But so be it, I mean, tha-that’s a part of the problem of reconstructing history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Speaking about different perspectives, do you think it – it was an advantage that you were so young when you went through this, or – or would it have been – been better to be older?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: I think – I think better to be young because we were young, impressionable, but we learned.</span> <span id="s1225">We did not have intense, deep preconceptions of things and we would accept discipline better as younger people, I think, basically and could be trained better, seems to me.</span> <span id="s1226">And – and – and – and war is not a thing for anybody, but less I think older persons than younger.</span> <span id="s1227">I think you maybe adjusted better.</span> <span id="s1228">There was so many descriptions of it.</span> <span id="s1229">One of the best, of course, is course the old original, the wa – the time honored one of – of Sherman.</span> <span id="s1230">Another one too that – that to – to be in combat is looking like – you are looking like in a window into hell.</span> <span id="s1231">A variety of things, the base – I think maybe as young people we can hopefully, maybe accept them more easily than we can a-as older – I’m not – I’ve not followed that too, too much, but certainly it – it – it’s for young people.</span> <span id="s1232">If – if – if you have to be there, a younger person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Have your – or do you think your religious views are – or were influenced by your brush with death and what you saw, the sights you saw during the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: I – I will say this, I mean, we were – we – we had religious training in the background basically, but you have the imponderable question, in our experiences.</span> <span id="s1235">You’ve got people killed right beside you, the – the – the question, why them and not me?</span> <span id="s1236">It’s an unanswerable question and – an-and still after all these years, I puzzle.</span> <span id="s1237">An-And th-there is no solution to that, no answer.</span> <span id="s1238">I-I think maybe the religious faith, you know, faith in God, of course, in the hereafter if we’re going to accept that, is important.</span> <span id="s1239">S – but apropos of the matter of – of how to reason it out, it ca – it cannot be reasoned out.</span> <span id="s1240">You see too many things where there is no reason of why things happen or shouldn’t happen in combat.</span> <span id="s1241">You see brutality where it shouldn’t be.</span> <span id="s1242">You see incredible cruelty.</span> <span id="s1243">You see some of the best guys are – are taken, killed, and other dunderheads, pardon the expression, seem to skin through.</span> <span id="s1244">Th-There – there i – there is no logic to it.</span> <span id="s1245">And yet, and yet there is an incredible attraction to it.</span> <span id="s1246">Strange, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1247">We – we’ve seen the movie “Patton” [indecipherable] well, we don’t love him, but – but it’s undeniable and many, many, many people feel this, that there is an incredible thrill in that situation, if you come through.</span> <span id="s1248">If you come through.</span> <span id="s1249">We can look back and see things, there is – there can be – there can be, strangely, a great exhilaration in – in – in a firefight, it’s strange.</span> <span id="s1250">People inflicting death on others, and here again, the veneer of civilization, the old tradition that when you get your blood up and so forth, it’s the strangest thing.</span> <span id="s1251">You – you want to deny it to yourself, and yet contradictorily it’s still there.</span> <span id="s1252">Strange.</span> <span id="s1253">Not often, but – but more often it – more often is a – come – comes the feeling of – of the futility of it and the – and th – and the – I remem-member coming home in my furlough and – and during that time, I remember we lost some of these guys, tha-that – that brought me to tears.</span> <span id="s1254">I think [indecipherable] good guys, wonderful guys.</span> <span id="s1255">Why, why, why, huh?</span> <span id="s1256">Huh?</span> <span id="s1257">My good friend Sergeant Smith, Smitty was our re – machine gun section.</span> <span id="s1258">They were just laying down field of fire as we were heading down into Attendorn.</span> <span id="s1259">An 88 round came in right through the center of the house they were in, took them all out and they were all badly injured.</span> <span id="s1260">Smitty partic – badly bu – very badly injured.</span> <span id="s1261">And of course he later on learned of our – my experience at night.</span> <span id="s1262">Smitty, in Rochester M-Minnesota now, a great, wonderful guy, very devout Catholic, go – goes to mass daily.</span> <span id="s1263">Has had – has had some bouts with cancer, we’re in close touch.</span> <span id="s1264">We always talk and we will talk next Monday on Attendorn day, the 11th, we’re there.</span> <span id="s1265">It’s kind of a contest who calls who first.</span> <span id="s1266">I-I – I catch him before mass, his morning mass, but we talk about it a bit and I – and I recently said last time, I said, Smitty, how you doing with the cancer?</span> <span id="s1267">He says Pete, doing fine, but he says every day, every day you – you – you and I have after Attendorn is a plus.</span> <span id="s1268">That’s right.</span> <span id="s1269">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: What else do you do special on April 11th, besides call him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Oh, I think that’s basically it.</span> <span id="s1272">No, that’s the big thing is that, that’s – but that-that-that’s the day.</span> <span id="s1273">How much longer it will happen, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: You also had mentioned that you do think about what had happened more frequently now.</span> <span id="s1275">Is that true as you’re getting older?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: I – I – I – I – I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s1277">I think that – oh, I suppose we get older, maybe we begin reflecting more about it.</span> <span id="s1278">Hate to call them the twilight years for gosh sakes, but – no, but maybe – and then you re – go back and reflect upon these things and – and – and recognize what a full life a person’s had, but – and – and – and interestingly enough too, Oliver Wendell Holmes, the justice, a Civil War veteran, combat veteran, injured three times in the war, in the 1890’s was asked to give a Memorial Day talk.</span> <span id="s1279">And in that – and in that he touched upon – made this comment, may – maybe you’ve read it before, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1280">It was our great and good fortune that in our youth we learned that life was real and life was meaningful, powerful [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s1281">I’m not sure about the great good fortune, but – but so be it, we can’t change that, but it’s a part of our lives and always will be and – and as I say, I mean, Smitty, God bless him, with his comment that whatever happens, every day, every day after is a plus.</span> <span id="s1282">And th – i-it’s a good thing to remember sometimes when you get, you know, down or depressed or something, it’s – it – it’s – we’re lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Ho – did – has your experience, those few minutes in that labor camp assumed a more prominent part of your memories in recent years –</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: A-Ans –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: – than it did at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: – answer yes.</span> <span id="s1287">I-I think the comment made by – by Captain Greenburg(ph), we touched upon earlier that at the time it was just a part of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1288">Now, having seen the unfolding history, and we see here is about the – the death camps as well as the slave labor camp, it assumes a different importance basically, an – an importance, because it – it – it – it’s a – war itself is bad, but that – that, to evidence the cold bloodedness, and the – and – a-a-and th-the depravity of what this – this remarkable nation Germany – I say remarkable, it’s – has a – of culture, of art and beauty and [indecipherable] all pluses, had sunk to.</span> <span id="s1289">A-And I think probably the – the – the mission of the – o-of – of your institution, the Holocaust here, to let it not be forgotten – if I may add though, I’m interested too, I – I read an interesting piece by Leon Uris(ph), who would certainly be qualified to speak, on the matter – on the m – on the matter of – of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1290">It was following the publicity on “Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s1291">And he touched upon it, he – he said that – hi-his thought was this.</span> <span id="s1292">He said, it – it’s a critical part of our – naturally of our human, but let it not obsess us.</span> <span id="s1293">Let it not obsess us because, he said, we – we become sickened by it and we are limiting ourselves and our capacity if – if – if – if we take a narrow view, hm.</span> <span id="s1294">Int-Interesting point.</span> <span id="s1295">Now again, it’s difficult to judge when you’re not in the other person’s moccasins, so to speak and you think of all the people, I’m sure that you – that – that – that it – an interviewer must [indecipherable] their experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: What is your feeling about Germany today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Now?</span> <span id="s1298">Interesting, after the war we had a number of good German friends and my mothers says, why in the world do you like these darn Germans so much?</span> <span id="s1299">Especially my Danish background, my – cause the Dani – all – Germany, interesting, we do have some good German friends.</span> <span id="s1300">And they have a long difficult job ahead with the reunification to blend it together, but I think it can be an interesting country, and yet – and yet – and yet there are still people that have the feeling should they reunite it because of in the past what Germany has done.</span> <span id="s1301">The old saying, forgot who it was, Germans are either at your feet or at your throat.</span> <span id="s1302">I – I can’t answer – generalizations are always a little bit dangerous, I mean, you know, you can’t follow it that much, but we’ve been in Germany a number of times, enjoy it, beautiful country, good friends.</span> <span id="s1303">And yet, and yet.</span> <span id="s1304">Captain Greenburg(ph), ther – they’re both Jewish and his wife Phyllis will not go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1305">Will not go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1306">For my own part we – we – as I said, we have good friends in Germany, we enjoy having been there basically.</span> <span id="s1307">We’re thinking now about maybe this October, October ’99 with a good friend from home who has lived some length of time in Germany, has good German, of going back.</span> <span id="s1308">I’d like to begin, if we go back in October, at the Margraten cemetery, American cemetery where my – where George Evans is buried.</span> <span id="s1309">Then up into the Ruhr again to see it and then down into Bavaria, Eichstätt, Ingol – and I don’t know, just – interesting.</span> <span id="s1310">We’ll see.</span> <span id="s1311">We’ll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: You said that you – you father was a lawyer and that you studied law quite soon after you got back.</span> <span id="s1313">Was any of – aside from those aspects, do you think your choice of law was influenced ag – also by the war experience and what happens when the rule of law gets distorted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: That-That’s a very idealistic and appropriate thought.</span> <span id="s1315">I-I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1316">I once said to Dad, practice law – he practiced law for – he began in 1908 and there until he went into court in 1955.</span> <span id="s1317">I said, Dad, why did you become a lawyer?</span> <span id="s1318">Oh, he chuckled [indecipherable] said, you know, he said, I was in grade school at home with a young kid, he used to – I’m gonna be a lawyer, I’m gonna be a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1319">He said, I got thinking, maybe I should be.</span> <span id="s1320">And so I did.</span> <span id="s1321">I said, what happened to the other guy, Dad?</span> <span id="s1322">He said, I think he became a housepainter.</span> <span id="s1323">But we kind of in the family, Dad, my uncle in his firm, my brother was a lawyer and of course, I am too.</span> <span id="s1324">I don’t know, I – we just always seem to head that direction, and it’s been a very fulfilling thing.</span> <span id="s1325">I don’t know, and I – I – I appreciate your comment about the – the benefit of the rule of law.</span> <span id="s1326">That’s quite idealistic.</span> <span id="s1327">I don’t think we think it, but we see it, as we get older and have lived a lifetime of law, it – it’s our discipline and of cour – there’s no question about the – the importance of it, because we saw in Germany what happened when – when – when the – when law vanished.</span> <span id="s1328">I mean, proper law vanished.</span> <span id="s1329">And it wa – it was abused by the – by the German system, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: What are your thought when you pick up the newspaper today and you see people fleeing from Kosovo –</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: – for instance, and you – you, 50 years ago saw people on the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Yeah, yeah, it – again, I – I-I would have great compassion and – and – and – and – and sorrow for the – the old people, the young – the children, for heaven sakes, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Does it bring back memories to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: I-I thought about it some, yeah, I’ve seen them, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1336">Especially – especially the – the children.</span> <span id="s1337">I – I cannot – I do not have the wisdom to sort out the right and wrong of it, I mean I – I don’t know, I – I – I – I can’t answer that.</span> <span id="s1338">My inclination is – is that maybe it has to – has to happen, but even so, the – the side effects, and that’s not the correct word really, for a war, the – the consequences of it to – to the un – to the people who had – were not really involved in causing it, i-is terrible, is terrible.</span> <span id="s1339">We read the book of Job.</span> <span id="s1340">Why?</span> <span id="s1341">Why do these – these – I – I have no answer.</span> <span id="s1342">It’s just a part – a part of – a part of the life we lead, apparently it’s gonna happen, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1343">Until we find some way to conquer all these things and get over and get th – get past them, but not in our li – not in la – maybe your lifetime, not in mine.</span> <span id="s1344">No, we’re too far – we would do all we can to help, but I don’t know what we can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Why did you feel the need, when you had that 30 day furlough and you came back to the United States, why did you feel the need to write a diary, a log?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: It’s a most interesting question, yeah.</span> <span id="s1347">It’s a most, most interesting question.</span> <span id="s1348">I don’t know why, unless it was still vivid in my mind.</span> <span id="s1349">Looking back, I’m glad I had the foresight to do it, because t-to look over here, and touch these old, now semi-yellowed pa – piece – paper, with some additions on the end in my almost undecipherable hieroglyphics, of each day down the line.</span> <span id="s1350">I – I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1351">But I can go through here and pull things out basically and I’m glad that I did.</span> <span id="s1352">I d – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1353">Wha – why – why do we do some of the things that turn out to be so good and other things – and overlook the things we don’t?</span> <span id="s1354">I don’t know, tha – tha-that’s interesting, I never thought too much about it, but I felt it had to be done.</span> <span id="s1355">In addition to this I have quite a few items of memorabilia in a great, big scrapbook that I have at home.</span> <span id="s1356">Clipping from papers, a variety of postcards from Germany, a leaf – leaflets that the Americans dropped.</span> <span id="s1357">A variety of things, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: I had a – a – just a small factual question to ask you.</span> <span id="s1359">I noticed in some of the reference books, when I looked up the Attendorn labor camp that it said it was in the British zone, but this was the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: It – it probably would be now, because that was actually, has become the British zone, but we took it, you see?</span> <span id="s1361">I mean, the – the Americans took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: I have to – I’ve – it would be the British zone now, that’s right, yeah, because that would be the area that they – that they did take.</span> <span id="s1364">That the a – that’s correct, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: So they came in after you is what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yes, because the division a-aft-after the complete – the complete conquest of Germany, then – then came the impact and the – and the implementation of the [indecipherable] agreement, which made the division, as I re – as I understand it, with the – and the – within the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1368">Is there anything we haven’t touched on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Well, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: – that you would like to say – talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: – I – I – it’s – it’s – it’s been very, very, very, very well asked, very, very well done.</span> <span id="s1372">I-I think basically that – that would cover it.</span> <span id="s1373">I mean, le-let – to review … I-I-I pause because – because I’m trying to – to think base – basically of what else could be contributed on the matter of the – of the individuals that – that were released that day.</span> <span id="s1374">I wonder sometimes what their fate was, if they were ru – were Russian, probably a bad fate.</span> <span id="s1375">What we read, at least about the prisoners of war, the Russians, they were not accepted back or they were, if they were taken back they were – brutal thing.</span> <span id="s1376">As far as the civilians, I – I – I’ve – I sometimes wonder what happened to those people, a-again, you know.</span> <span id="s1377">Didn’t think at the time, but after the pass of years you wonder about it, basically.</span> <span id="s1378">Interestingly also, I did some checking out – I had occasion to read – check back in to the records of the Nuremberg – Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1379">November, it began.</span> <span id="s1380">One of the major cases was that of a Field Marshal Milch m-i-n-l – m-i-l-c-h, Milch, who was a subordinate of Albert Speer, and that was the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1381">He was one was responsible for the – the so-called forced labor, alright?</span> <span id="s1382">And in the exhibits presented at Nuremberg in his behalf were requirements by the Reich supposedly that these people would be adequately fed and cared for.</span> <span id="s1383">Not humanitarianly-wise, but to insure the fact they could do the work they were going to do, huh.</span> <span id="s1384">The other was – simply seemed secondary, basically.</span> <span id="s1385">And of course in the case of these poor people, in ha – admittedly now, probably the logistical system had broken down, I mean as far as food, but that does not still explain in a – in any way excuse the way they were being held.</span> <span id="s1386">Read, as we have, Manchester’s book, “The Arms of Krupp,” and the – and the – and th-the treatment to which the Kruppianer subjected all their force people, huh.</span> <span id="s1387">It’s an incredible thing, incredible living in it.</span> <span id="s1388">And – and what we saw that afternoon, I mean, the way these that – the way these people were.</span> <span id="s1389">As Mac said, look what these fucking German – terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: You are rightfully proud of your Danish ancestry.</span> <span id="s1391">What do you attribute th-the difference in their response in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: The Danish people.</span> <span id="s1394">I said you were rightfully proud of your Danish ancestry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: And we know what the Danes did during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: To what do you attribute that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: The Danish experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: The Danish experience, as opposed to the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Well, it’s quite inters – it’s quite interesting.</span> <span id="s1402">Number one, there had been a great – a great tradition, history of tolerance in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1403">Smaller countries [indecipherable] also.</span> <span id="s1404">But early enlightenment, which began in Denmark in the 1820’s - 30’s, they had – they had left the monarchy, I mean the – the actual absolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped.</span> <span id="s1405">A smaller country, as I mentioned again, and beyond that, I’m not sure, except that there was – it was indeed a safe haven.</span> <span id="s1406">Now, as to how the wonderful escape took place in October, several things I – I read – as we read it.</span> <span id="s1407">Number one, there had been the great feeling of the Danish people.</span> <span id="s1408">The-The-These are not Danish Jews, it’s Jewish Danes.</span> <span id="s1409">A subtle distinction, but it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1410">Secondly the war situation was turning against Germany.</span> <span id="s1411">Allies were in north Africa by that time.</span> <span id="s1412">Stalingrad had been completed.</span> <span id="s1413">The general feeling was – was different.</span> <span id="s1414">The proximity – the proximity of Sweden now, made it possible, which might, in a landlocked country not have happened, huh.</span> <span id="s1415">And the willingness of the Swedes to accept it.</span> <span id="s1416">There’s a wonderful story told apropos of that, about the Swedish side of it now.</span> <span id="s1417">When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to take the Danish Jews, time was short.</span> <span id="s1418">It was a matter of days, but they had to somehow – they meaning the Danish people under their leadership and the resistance get them out.</span> <span id="s1419">But they had to have the agreement of Sweden to take them.</span> <span id="s1420">They could not deal with Germany and say – because that would tip it off.</span> <span id="s1421">So what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish leadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown.</span> <span id="s1422">The arrangement was made that they, the Danish people would select, hopefully, that – a leader of the Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of Sweden.</span> <span id="s1423">It was arranged.</span> <span id="s1424">And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1425">The story goes on to say that in – in Bohr’s words he said – he said, I’m a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why – well, they said you have th-the standing, the name, the King will – all right.</span> <span id="s1426">It was arranged remarkably [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1427">Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently then, either – either by boat – they’re not – they’re – they’re – they’re still – they’re c-careful, or possibly by a British aircraft, the Mosquito coming, take him over, Bohr was taken to Stockholm, to probably Drottningholm and the palace, the story is told.</span> <span id="s1428">He said, in I went, to this massive palace.</span> <span id="s1429">Re-Realized what was on my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king.</span> <span id="s1430">I was shown into the room.</span> <span id="s1431">Had a room and th-th-th-the king’s attendant was there, basically very fine, he said Dr. Bohr, please wait.</span> <span id="s1432">Then he said the moment came, he said [indecipherable] here – here – here I am just becoming more tense by the moment.</span> <span id="s1433">The door opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now.</span> <span id="s1434">He said, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the king, King Gustav.</span> <span id="s1435">Gustav Aroff(ph) I think it was.</span> <span id="s1436">And he said, I-I have some Swedish.</span> <span id="s1437">And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of our people, what was going to happen and – and that we desperately pled for help.</span> <span id="s1438">He said, the king, very courteous, stood up.</span> <span id="s1439">He said, of course I stood up too.</span> <span id="s1440">The king walked to the window, looked out.</span> <span id="s1441">He said that – I can [indecipherable] it was probably all of maybe 10 seconds, but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your people will be welcome in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1442">And that was it, laid the foundation.</span> <span id="s1443">So, a combination of things put together, you see, and of course the – it was not all – I mean there were – there were some problems to getting them – getting the Danes across or getting the – the – the Jews across, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1444">Some – some boat people did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable, remarkable thing, huh?</span> <span id="s1445">Incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Anything else before we close, any message?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I – I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Any message to your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Any message to your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Keep the faith.</span> <span id="s1452">No, oh I – I – no, th-the – the kids are doing fine.</span> <span id="s1453">And I have one of my – my good Jewish friend who i-i-is very – is very much involved in his persuasion, which is fine.</span> <span id="s1454">But he often repeats the fact, he says, how fortunate we are a-a-as Jews to live in this country, this is – to be a part of this great country.</span> <span id="s1455">That’s very true for all of us.</span> <span id="s1456">Apologize, I didn’t mean to get all – but – but it’s – it’s a – you know, I come to Washington, this tremendous country and – and – and I still – don’t we all – get a look, you see our great flag, great flag.</span> <span id="s1457">And speaking to this – this’ll be the final thing, I – we – it’s been – I – it’s been a ri – fine experience.</span> <span id="s1458">I gave a talk, I think you have it here, when I die, don’t play “Taps,” “Taps” makes me cry.</span> <span id="s1459">I cry for – cause I – if I may go on, I cry for all the young men, my friends that I couldn’t save and tried to.</span> <span id="s1460">So don’t play “Taps” but when the time comes, I see I’ll join on gree – on a – on a grassy knoll, they’ll be a bunch of G.I.s there in well pressed uniforms, they’ll be a lieutenant with a piece of grass and they’ll say to me, where you been?</span> <span id="s1461">You got any cigarettes?</span> <span id="s1462">We’ll fall in, and – in two lines, basically, put on our packs, grab up our M1s basically and move off, and right, left, easy cadence.</span> <span id="s1463">No ice, no mud, no snow.</span> <span id="s1464">No 88s or mortars coming in, or 88s.</span> <span id="s1465">And then we will move off, my – my buddies and I, past the moon, Jupiter on our left, the sun on our right, following our glorious flag to God’s peaceful eternity.</span> <span id="s1466">Isn’t that good?</span> <span id="s1467">Marvelous, huh?</span> <span id="s1468">Well, I – I – I – I think of nothing else, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: It’s a beautiful note to end on.</span> <span id="s1470">Beautiful note.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Well, Gail, so
