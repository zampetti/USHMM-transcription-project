to take over the office in Japan because somebody had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s4">We had planned to meet in England, we were invited by Hubert’s British boss to come to England.</span> <span id="s5">Mid-way through Hubert’s stay in Japan, he wrote “Have you found anyone to take care of the kids?”</span> <span id="s6">There was only Rick and Edward at the time.</span> <span id="s7">I said “I found somebody.”</span> <span id="s8">The next day, I got a cable from Hubert saying “If you can come here now, get going”.</span> <span id="s9">So talked the office and the big boss, <name></name></span> <span id="s10">wasn’t there, but Henry Rothschild said “Go if you can.”</span> <span id="s11">So I got <name> in for the kids and next day went to Tokyo to join him.</name></span> <span id="s12">This was somewhere mid-February.</span> <span id="s13">Stayed in Tokyo and then left together the end of April and went to Manila, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Calcutta.</span> <span id="s14">This was all on business.</span> <span id="s15">And in Calcutta, Hubert had to go straight to England.</span> <span id="s16">And this was the first time I was going to see my grandmother who was still living in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">ML: Oh because she wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s18">She wasn’t punished for having married a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">IH: Well, her husband was long dead.</span> <span id="s20">He died in 1926, my grandfather so I hardly knew him.</span> <span id="s21">She was French and was very feisty and still lived in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s22">And spent her vacation in <some place="" russian="" zone="">.</some></span> <span id="s23">I hadn’t seen her.</span> <span id="s24">This was 1956.</span> <span id="s25">Hubert went straight to England and I was going to Hamburg from Calcutta.</span> <span id="s26">Got stuck in Kariachi, Pakistan.</span> <span id="s27">There was plane trouble and I got stuck overnight and then on to Zurich.</span> <span id="s28">My plane to Hamburg had left and there was no way to get there.</span> <span id="s29">Everything was overbooked and they could only get me to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s30">This was a long trip.</span> <span id="s31">I hadn’t thought about Germany, none of this too much.</span> <span id="s32">Get to the airport in Frankfort and there was somehow the German arrogance and all of sudden I could not talk a word of German.</span> <span id="s33">Only English.</span> <span id="s34">I was really seeing myself from up here.</span> <span id="s35">It was totally weird.</span> <span id="s36">They put me up in a pension.</span> <span id="s37">I come to breakfast and they offered me (some German word) and then they said “roll” and I said “yes, I’ll have a roll”.</span> <span id="s38">Then I got on the train, Frankfort to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s39">There were no flights.</span> <span id="s40">And then I was in a compartment.</span> <span id="s41">A middle aged German couple comes into the compartment.</span> <span id="s42">She sees my luggage with all these decals on it.</span> <span id="s43">She says to her husband, in German, “Ask her where she’s been.”</span> <span id="s44">And the husband, using his grammar school English says “My wife wants to know, how old are you?”</span> <span id="s45">.</span> <span id="s46">And I knew that’s not what she asked, but at that point, I am thinking to myself “what am I going to do with my grandmother?”</span> <span id="s47">My French was not that good, but you know her German was not perfect at all.</span> <span id="s48">But this is crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">End up in Hamburg, take the bus from the airport to the city.</span> <span id="s50">The bus driver stopped at a light.</span> <span id="s51">I’m sitting somewhere behind the bus driver.</span> <span id="s52">The light changes and there’s an older woman with a babushka and she starts stepping off the sidewalk and the bus driver starts giving the gas, then stops, opens the window and leans out and says <german first=""> “Little mother, I’ll wait, go ahead.”</german></span> <span id="s53">And this was normal and comfortable and all of a sudden I could speak German again.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">ML: Talk about psychosomatic</span></p> <p><span id="s55">IH: It was psychological of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">ML: So when the husband asked you, what did he tell his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">IH: How old I was.</span> <span id="s58">Then they had a conversation, but I had to go out.</span> <span id="s59">I felt too nutty.</span> <span id="s60">The airport was all so bureaucratic.</span> <span id="s61">But this bus driver was human.</span> <span id="s62">And then it was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">ML: Only time went to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">IH: I visited my friends all the time.</span> <span id="s65">But I had my school friends.</span> <span id="s66">After that it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">ML: You were literally dumbstruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">IH: I did not want to be a part of that.</span> <span id="s69">I don’t remember whether in Zurich I may have even spoken German there.</span> <span id="s70">But Frankfort airport, something set me off, that was absolutely the bureaucratic thing that I wanted no part of.</span> <span id="s71">Then I get to my grandmother who was furious at me.</span> <span id="s72">Because I had arrived a day late having been stuck in Karachi (which of course I could help) because she had tickets to a concert the night before.</span> <span id="s73">And I hadn’t arrived in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">I hadn’t seen her since the ‘30’s.</span></p></body></html>
