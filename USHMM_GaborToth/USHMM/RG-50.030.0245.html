were were were second .</span> <span id="s68">Hitler and his army invaded Poland and uh there was far from the uh battle, about...uh because from west Poland to where I I'm in the south...Tarnow is in the south, middle of Poland, in the south Poland...about uh about over two hundred kilometer kilometer from uh German border over...so in uh almost two weeks we see the German airplane uh go around, even shooting uh people from airplane on the on the field, all over uh on the town, but there was no much bombing uh in the Tarnow or Krackow (ph).</span> <span id="s69">Most of them uh was by Warsaw, where my brother was in uh...was married already and uh my brother Anthony when uh 1944 when was uprising, when the bomb was...destroyed Warsaw, his daughter, a five year old girl was killed.</span> <span id="s70">In uh '39 another brother in Tarnow was uh was uh when there was...the war action was shooting, my brother's six year old...he have...uh wounded, but he die after uh a couple day from

she was buried because there was...in Warsaw was uh...there was uprising in 1944 of two hundred fifty thousand people dead, all over bury on the street and it was very terrible mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Uh can you tell me uh how your life changed once the Germans came to uh to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, uh change uh dramatically because uh I want to go to school and I couldn't go to school, so uh I study at home and I study uh with uh professor uh private privately because uh German uh take out, uh throw out professor from university, from Krackow, from and uh send some to concentration camp and some sent to our place and uh we have to uh take care of them.</span> <span id="s76">Was two professor in my father's place, so we have to give them food and uh shelter, cause there was all this two men, so I have an advantage that they teach me uh during uh 1939 and during '40, because I was prepare for uh higher education, so they teach me.</span> <span id="s77">Then after the the German take them anyway in 1940.</span> <span id="s78">And there was uh first few months when German take over, was uh was quiet.</span> <span id="s79">Uh they put, posted all over be calm, go back to work, uh everything be OK.</span> <span id="s80">Then then uh everybody have to go register, have to have an have an ID card.</span> <span id="s81">Then after that the German advertising, uh 19...beginning of 1940, they advertising to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s82">Mass uh advertising that they needed...they say they have a good pay and so so but nobody want to go.</span> <span id="s83">Only people work in the Tarnow wherever there was industry, in the Tarnow...in some...the German opened the industry and make the people was before, but other people, they have no no work.</span> <span id="s84">There was no any other care uh only go to Germany to work, no other living.</span> <span id="s85">So some people go to underground to , underground...(Cough)...Excuse me...uh against uh German or they go to woods to live, hiding, and do a sabotage against German, uh start uh start uh be against uh sabotaging and against the German...1940.</span> <span id="s86">But there was uh not...they was organized but it was hard because it was a cold winter and uh and uh German was powerful, have a motorized car and and motorcycle and go all over, so people escape.</span> <span id="s87">Go to woods and uh and that way survive.</span> <span id="s88">Uh and the farmer would feed them but uh that was 1940.</span> <span id="s89">Then they start arresting uh people.</span> <span id="s90">First uh they put in the city hall all the name, because they have it from ID cards, they have the name who you are and they wanted so many people uh report and go to Germany to work who have no way to live to go, uh to go by themselves.</span> <span id="s91">They go register because they have no way to live, like in the city have no no food or nothing so so they go...some people went and went to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s92">But not so many, so after they start arresting on the street uh just...Gestapo have uh on truck a dozen.</span> <span id="s93">Then the car stop on any of the street.</span> <span id="s94">Two two trucks, uh pick-up truck when it was with the Gestapo...one on the beginning of the street, on another.</span> <span id="s95">Stop the traffic and take all the people on the street.</span> <span id="s96">Uh young young young most of them...they look for them that be work for...and they put on the truck and sent to uh sent where there were examination and they sent to Germany to work for uh slave labor, forced labor labor camp in Germany, and during uh this uh 1940, the occupation, uh we have a flier that was come from England or uh or through underground all situation how is work German are and uh the people organize underground a a campaign against German, and uh all the...because a printing shop was all closed when the German take over, put people do by by uh called small, hand...uh by hand printed, so and uh we have a message what's going on from already the underground who already have.</span> <span id="s97">Then they print some note and we give a message to people, but if uh if they catch you, German, then uh then you sometime they kill you on the spot or send you...</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Were you personally involved or were any of your brothers or your your your parents involved in with what the partisans were doing or in handing out these leaflets?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Uh yes, my brother was involved in the Tarnow and I don't...still don't know how he got involved because there was always was secret and even never told me where he get it, how he get it...just told...he give me a few uh bundle of them and uh take down to to down where...and give people at the church, on on the village or wherever wherever he sent me, but I was uh...he give me a basket.</span> <span id="s100">There was a bundle of of the leaflets in a small basket like a fruit basket and on the top is hay and I put rabbits, and that's how I transport uh message, because if...excuse me...(pause)...uh that way I transferred the message in the basket with rabbits because when the when the Germans stop me on the...always was a patrol on the street...when they stop me, they look the rabbits and kick me and and I just hold it that they don't fall out...it was tight...because they don't like the rabbit.</span> <span id="s101">That way I went through and I was always dressed ragged uh there be...there be no suspicion that I something, you know.</span> <span id="s102">Also that way uh in another city, like in Tarnow, there was short on food.</span> <span id="s103">There was ration of food and so we, from the farm, we bring to my brother food that way uh just on the bicycle or I walk with the basket...put bread and uh salt pork and uh butter...also same way.</span> <span id="s104">Uh have a big basket, put on the bottom and put hay on the top and rabbits on the top, because if you have open and and uh German look uh they'll take it, so uh we transferred the food uh to to my brother and uh my brother live in Tarnow, two of them.</span> <span id="s105">Neighbor was Jew, people where he was before work, before war he was work with them...also that they was still make the dress uh but for the store also, but the the Jew was uh persecuting and uh and uh buying...they can't go out.</span> <span id="s106">They have to have a a Star of David uh on their uh clothes and uh in Tarnow...that's beginning of 1940 and '41, so 1940.</span> <span id="s107">And uh my brother helped them uh with the with the food, because he also...my brother come, two of them, they come uh to my father and they transport the food to to town.</span> <span id="s108">Many time uh when they have a bigger amount, like potatoes or something, when uh when they got to the house, the German uh Gestapo spotted and uh they got beaten because they they know the Jew was live over there next door, so my bro...I was beaten a couple of times too, because they they saw me come out from the building where Jew was and uh somehow they know it and say are you a Jew.</span> <span id="s109">I say no, I have ID.</span> <span id="s110">So so uh they kick me, say what you do over there, you know.</span> <span id="s111">I say nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s112">Uh I I want buy some thread because I always had some little item for excuse what I what I was doing, because if you have nothing uh then then you're suspicious, so I have a little thread or some small item that uh to or even button, you know, because they have a store or or no...only small item, so that way uh that way I go away with this partisan you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Can you tell me what happened next to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Well, then...that was 1940.</span> <span id="s115">I was twice arrested on the street because uh many time when I saw what's going on I..</span> <span id="s116">.</span> <span id="s117">when uh was arresting...we we can see how they stop so I know which which way to run away to one one house and go outside on another street, but uh twice the the block so tight I cannot escape so I was arrested, put on the on the truck...usually the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s118">The Gestapo was special uh German police.</span> <span id="s119">They have a..</span> <span id="s120">.</span> <span id="s121">on the front...they black uniform some and some they are grey uh and have a big under like a SS underneath, under Polish sign...special po...police.</span> <span id="s122">They have the power to kill you on the spot.</span> <span id="s123">You can do nothing, so uh they put on the truck, a pick-up truck, uh how many they can fitted...young people, then they go to the railway station...that was not far...and put on the wagon uh wherever was wagon.</span> <span id="s124">Usually was uh cattle but they usually...they don't do uh no more they usually do for concentration camp.</span> <span id="s125">They put on...they call third- class wagon, and lock personal (ph) and uh about a hundred people and then uh train go to Krackow and over there also we have to walk with the Gestapo to check point.</span> <span id="s126">Check point in the Krackow was in a big school because all school was closed.</span> <span id="s127">There was no no teaching during the occupation.</span> <span id="s128">Only...they only allowed first grade, first couple grades of public school and not not high school.</span> <span id="s129">There was...high school was empty.</span> <span id="s130">They using for transportation checkpoint, so there was hundred people and with no room to sleep or nothing.</span> <span id="s131">They will stand up in in each hall or class and uh have a kitchen, so they have something to eat, and they go through examination...doctor, German doctor examine each one and if alright go to next room and uh shave close all, everything, uh arm and all over, and uh put back clothes, get in and go another room and put on a train again.</span> <span id="s132">Another trip, you know, twenty or a hundred...it depends how many they selected and sent to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s133">So twice I was arrested.</span> <span id="s134">Twice I was...once I was shaved uh but he say you no have no...you have clean hair so you'll be alright...the barber said.</span> <span id="s135">Then I escaped twice in Krackow because there was so many people so I was able to escape and my brother would know it and help me.</span> <span id="s136">He know what happened in Tarnow so he went uh and he helped me, so I come back home, but uh third time there was uh...it was so strictly uh tight uh guards I couldn't escape and uh then uh they send me to with other about twenty all just men...young

April 1945 uh we uh we know the American not far.</span> <span id="s289">We already hear uh uh shooting and uh and it was in the paper, newspaper that the German give us newspaper...they always say where where they are, where the American and English are.</span> <span id="s290">And uh the German advise to the German to hide their last men, so so and also uh uh were of us, the , like Polish and all other prisoners, because afraid of uh we do the revenge, so uh come April 12th, we we spot American tank and uh tank go by...one, two, three.</span> <span id="s291">We...and uh it was in the morning and first we knew, we go after the guard, because the barrack where we stay by the gate was the barrack and by the gate is more food and all ammunition and a guard and everything.</span> <span id="s292">We went over there.</span> <span id="s293">There's nobody there.</span> <span id="s294">The the guard, the German escape away before we don't even know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">They left some empty uh rifle in the window and it look like they there.</span> <span id="s296">And uh so uh American uh uh 9th Army came.</span> <span id="s297">First there was very because people when they go home and was a thousand mile, kilometer from uh where I was, like , it's now West Germany...to my town is too far, so uh we stay in the camp and there come organization uh International Organization for Refugee...they call UNRA...and uh we put all together uh like in the one camp the Polish uh refugee in the one camp.</span> <span id="s298">Same camp where we where we was, but we clean up.</span> <span id="s299">We was uh free.</span> <span id="s300">We have a kitchen, but we have to do everything by own.</span> <span id="s301">Uh kitchen...we have to have...people have to work uh by uh in order to to survive...do everything by themselves in the camp.</span> <span id="s302">Uh uh there was also...we org...we organized school and chapel.</span> <span id="s303">We have a a priest.</span> <span id="s304">Many priest was liberated from Dachau concentration camp, so they come and the one we have in our camp, and I was work with him in the school, in the church because also was so many families the German take to work on the farm, so they left the farm when the American came and they come to camp.</span> <span id="s305">They call this place displaced person camp, DP camp in in West Germany, and there was under English occupied zone, but there was very strictly...uh we can do what we want but we can't go to Poland because it was uh Russia occupied Poland and was different government under Russian uh Russian, so many people take uh chance and go back to Poland and many of them wait in the camp for uh immigration so meantime I uh start school.</span> <span id="s306">There was also uh like a professor, professional people, so I take examination and I pass and I uh receive a a diploma for teaching and we organize school and there was about...uh the camp where I was, displaced person camp, there was about two thousand, over two thousand Polish persons, uh men, women, children.</span> <span id="s307">Uh men like single they separate and uh lady, girl

organize Scouts.</span> <span id="s308">I was the scoutmaster.</span> <span id="s309">There was life like a little community in uh in the camp, because everybody have to uh work how...uh wherever he wanted, in the kitchen or in a guard, because we have to guard the camp uh just order, you know, like self uh self-organization, and we go out to uh German town.</span> <span id="s310">We can uh if we have the money we buy something or but nothing too big because we have no money and there was was bad.</span> <span id="s311">The food uh we get uh we have ration also because uh Germany economy was bad and uh and uh international organization supply uh make the German supply some food for for us for a few , so there was a short of everything but uh uh because it was free so so we survived and everybody was waiting for uh immi...going...immigrate, go to Canada or United States or Australia.</span> <span id="s312">Whoever have a a relatives in uh United States or or Canada so so ask for
