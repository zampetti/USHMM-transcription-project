birth, and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: My name is John Woodruff.</span> <span id="s5">My date of birth is July the 5th, 1915.</span> <span id="s6">And I was born in a small town about 50 miles south of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s7">The name of this town is Connellsville.</span> <span id="s8">, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s9">It’s spelled c-o-n-n-e-l-l-s-v-i-l-l-e.</span> <span id="s10">It’s just a small town right, right in the mountains, about 30, about 32 miles from, from Morgantown, West Virginia.</span> <span id="s11">That’s where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Tell me a little bit about what it was like growing up, your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Well, I grew up in a uh well it was a poor family.</span> <span id="s14">We didn’t have too much you see.</span> <span id="s15">And of course there was a lot of members of my family.</span> <span id="s16">My, my mother birthed twelve children.</span> <span id="s17">I was the eleventh child.</span> <span id="s18">Well the, it was eight girls and there was four boys.</span> <span id="s19">Now all the girls grew up to be adults except one that which was the twelfth child and she, and she died in infancy.</span> <span id="s20">Two of my brothers died in infa, two of my older brothers.</span> <span id="s21">And one brother got killed hunting when he was sixteen years of age.</span> <span id="s22">And that’s how, that’s, that’s how my family, family was set up.</span> <span id="s23">Cause my mother married when she was nineteen and my father was twenty-two.</span> <span id="s24">They had this large family which was too many children, too many children.</span> <span id="s25">But they made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What do you remember about your family life and how you lived and what you did and in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well uh of course my father was a laborer.</span> <span id="s28">He dug coal.</span> <span id="s29">He carried hod on, on construction work.</span> <span id="s30">He worked in the coke ovens there in, in uh, in my home town.</span> <span id="s31">And that’s how he made his living.</span> <span id="s32">Cause my mother she did days work for some of the families there in, in the area in which we, where we were living.</span> <span id="s33">And that’s how, that’s how we survived.</span> <span id="s34">As I said before, we didn’t have too much, but we managed to make it under the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Do you have good memories of your childhood, of some of the values that were installed in you?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well you see my, both of my parents they weren’t, they weren’t very well educated you see.</span> <span id="s37">In fact my father went, I think he went to about the eighth grade and my mother went to about fourth grade.</span> <span id="s38">And uh they didn’t put too much stress.</span> <span id="s39">There was no, was never at any time that my parents would sit down and discuss education.</span> <span id="s40">Because they didn’t have much education themselves.</span> <span id="s41">And the only thing that they were concerned about was me going to school uh keeping up my attendance in school to keep the truant officer from bothering them.</span> <span id="s42">That was, that, that was, that was their extent as, as far as my education was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: But you went forward with it.</span> <span id="s44">You were interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, well, of course, coming along, coming along in the early grades and well, of course, I, I used to play truant ever, once in a while, to, to go to the movies with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s46">And uh but we never, you know, we never got into any real, real trouble, you know, uh per se.</span> <span id="s47">and, of course, I continued to um, not to get ahead of my story, I quit school when I was sixteen.</span> <span id="s48">See back there, you know, the kids when they reached the age of sixteen, they wanted to quit school and, and go to work in the factory.</span> <span id="s49">There was a couple of factories.</span> <span id="s50">There was a box factory and there was a glass factory.</span> <span id="s51">Well I quit when I was sixteen, but I couldn’t get a job because they discriminated against blacks in the, in the, in those industries.</span> <span id="s52">So I, I, I sat around for a while.</span> <span id="s53">I guess about a year.</span> <span id="s54">And I decided well I better go on back to school.</span> <span id="s55">So I went back to school, starting in, in my freshman year.</span> <span id="s56">And then I tried to join the Navy.</span> <span id="s57">Well the Navy had a quota for, for, for blacks.</span> <span id="s58">And the quota was filled.</span> <span id="s59">And, of course I wasn’t interested in the Army at that particular time because I had a couple brother-in-laws who, who was, who had gone into the Army and, of course, they’d told me some stories that was, wasn’t too pleasant.</span> <span id="s60">So I didn’t have any interest in the Army.</span> <span id="s61">So I continued on, continued on in school.</span> <span id="s62">I completed my freshman year and my sophomore year, and then I went into the city school, cause my freshman and sophomore year, they didn’t have any athletics in the school at all, which I could participate in.</span> <span id="s63">So I went into the city school in my junior year, and I went out for football.</span> <span id="s64">Well I stayed out for football up until a week before the first game, and my mother made me quit because I was getting home too late to after pract uh football practice to take care of my chores around the house.</span> <span id="s65">So the, the line coach of the football was, was a track coach of the school and he noticed that I, I had uh quite a bit of speed when he had us running wind sprints up and down the field in our football uniform.</span> <span id="s66">So he asked me to come out for track.</span> <span id="s67">So that’s how I got started in track.</span> <span id="s68">And, of course, I, I started progressing quite well in, in uh my track activities and he told me don’t, don’t go back, go out for football anymore, because he was afraid I might get hurt.</span> <span id="s69">So that’s how I started my track career.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Prior to that had you been real active in sports in your other schools or at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, when you, I was active like on, on like we played a little sandlot, sandlot baseball uh and uh softball, those type of sports.</span> <span id="s72">I nev, I was never interested in basketball.</span> <span id="s73">I tried, tried it but I never, never could uh never become real interested in basketball at all see.</span> <span id="s74">But softball and uh baseball was the thing, was the two sports that I was quite interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You mentioned a little bit about certain doors that were closed to you as a black person.</span> <span id="s76">Did you face a lot of racism in Pennsylvania?</span> <span id="s77">Were you aware of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well there was some, it was some, there was some around that area see cause I grew up in a, in, in a, in an, in an environment where there’s all whites.</span> <span id="s79">There was only two black families, my family and another family.</span> <span id="s80">All my playmates, all my schoolmates were white kids.</span> <span id="s81">So I didn’t, well of course there was, there was, it was times when uh we’d, we’d get into fights with some of maybe one of the kids maybe called me nigger.</span> <span id="s82">And, of course, naturally, that, that was, that was a fighting word see.</span> <span id="s83">So we’d fight.</span> <span id="s84">Next day we’re friends again.</span> <span id="s85">That’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: So you were used to that banter.</span> <span id="s87">Were there other experiences, personal experiences that were difficult for you as a black person?</span> <span id="s88">At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well there was, there was, there was some, there was some, there was some difficulty in terms like in trying to get little jobs around that area see.</span> <span id="s90">They discriminated against, against the blacks.</span> <span id="s91">But that was, that was about all, you see.</span> <span id="s92">That was about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Now you got active in sports and track.</span> <span id="s94">Did you experience racism in sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No.</span> <span id="s96">No.</span> <span id="s97">Not at all.</span> <span id="s98">Not at all.</span> <span id="s99">My high school coach who, who uh who uh coached me in track was a very fine man.</span> <span id="s100">His name is Joseph Lourou.</span> <span id="s101">He was a wonderful man and he was a wonderful coach.</span> <span id="s102">And he taught me a number of things that I did, that I wasn’t taught at home, you know, about how to conduct myself.</span> <span id="s103">Of course I was doing a little smoking at the time.</span> <span id="s104">He told me to give that up, which I did.</span> <span id="s105">And he said if I, if I continued doing well in my track activities I had a chance to go to college.</span> <span id="s106">Well that was just unheard of in my family of going to college, you see.</span> <span id="s107">Because no, no, no member of my family finished high school.</span> <span id="s108">So I dropped all my little habits that I had that was, that would, would be detrimental to me achieving my goal or my goals.</span> <span id="s109">And I ended up getting a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh after I was graduated in 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: How important were sports to you?</span> <span id="s111">And why?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well it was, well, of course, at that particular time, it was very important to me because it enabled me.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: I need you to say that again, at that time sports were important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Well at that time sports were important to me and particularly the, the track activity type of sports, because that enabled me to get a scholarship to college.</span> <span id="s115">And that was the only way that I could go to college was through athletics.</span> <span id="s116">My parents didn’t have the money to send me to school.</span> <span id="s117">I fact I didn’t even have when I, when I received the scholarship at the University of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s118">I didn’t even have transportation to get to school.</span> <span id="s119">And the sheriff of my home town had his chauffeur to drive me to school.</span> <span id="s120">That’s how I got to school in the, in the fall of ’35.</span> <span id="s121">And money, I had exactly twenty-five cents in my pockets when I entered the University of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s122">That’s all the money I had.</span> <span id="s123">Cause as I said earlier I came from a poor family.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So you saw sports not just for the joy of being an athlete but as a, a way to help you further yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s126">Correct.</span> <span id="s127">And of course when I got the scholarship, and I, when I went to the University of Pittsburgh, cause I told all, all my friends at home, I said if I don’t make it, I’m not coming back to Connellsville.</span> <span id="s128">But I made it.</span> <span id="s129">I made it.</span> <span id="s130">I worked hard and I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: How good were you as a track?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well course I was the best, I was the best in high school.</span> <span id="s133">And of course when I went to Pitt I was able to beat all the athletes, all the athletes that was on the track team on my that ran in my race at Pitt in my freshman year.</span> <span id="s134">I came along very, very fast.</span> <span id="s135">My junior year in, in high school, of course my races were quite slow, but they showed progress.</span> <span id="s136">But then my senior year, I, I just bloomed.</span> <span id="s137">I just came into my own.</span> <span id="s138">Uh I, my uh main event was the mile.</span> <span id="s139">That was, that was the one the event that my coach had me concentrate on see.</span> <span id="s140">Well the first mile that I ran in high school, my junior year in high school was four minutes and forty-four seconds.</span> <span id="s141">In my senior year I ran four twenty-three four.</span> <span id="s142">I came along that fast.</span> <span id="s143">And of course when I ran that race I, I ran the second fastest school boy, school boy mile in the country, four twenty-three four.</span> <span id="s144">Al, Al Zamperine who was on the Olympic team with me, he ran four twenty-one something.</span> <span id="s145">But when I won my race in my round, my mile, when I won my mile race, I won it about a hundred and twenty yards ahead of the man who was uh ran second to me.</span> <span id="s146">Course if I had somebody to push me, it would have been faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: So you were pretty good.</span> <span id="s148">Were you thinking in terms of Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No.</span> <span id="s150">No.</span> <span id="s151">When I completed my freshman year at Pitt, that summer I had intended to go on home and take it easy for the summer.</span> <span id="s152">But my coach asked me to try out for the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s153">Course I had no idea that he wanted me to do that, you see.</span> <span id="s154">So I said okay, we’ll try out for it.</span> <span id="s155">So I tried out for it.</span> <span id="s156">I qualified in the preliminaries which they ran at the University of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s157">I qualified in the semi-finals which they ran at Harvard Stadium winning the event in the, in the, in the half a mile.</span> <span id="s158">And then at Randall’s Island where they ran the finals, I, I, I won my event there and I went to Berlin, Germany, and won my event.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: We’ll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s160">But that’s.</span> <span id="s161">So you had no thoughts about being an Olympic star?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s163">In fact I never even thought in terms of, of, of going to the Olympics.</span> <span id="s164">Never thought in terms of that at all.</span> <span id="s165">And it was the coach that uh approached me on that and said he wanted me to try out for the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So this was necessarily a dream of yours or anything</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No.</span> <span id="s168">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: When you were at the University of Pittsburgh, did racism enter into your school life at all there?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: At the University of Pittsburgh?</span> <span id="s171">Yes there was, there was a, an incident where race uh entered.</span> <span id="s172">I, when I came back from the Olympic games, the professor of my English Department didn’t want to let, didn’t want to let me enter it, enter the program cause I was a month late.</span> <span id="s173">However, I think the chancellor must have interceded and made it, made arrangements for me to get into the, get into the English program.</span> <span id="s174">And, of course, another thing that hurt me quite badly when I was grad, when I was being graduated from the University.</span> <span id="s175">They had what was known as the U, the University of Pittsburgh Hall of Fame.</span> <span id="s176">Well, I was the only athlete to bring the school international recognition, but they did not, they did not uh select me for the Hall of Fame.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And you think that’s because you were black?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s179">But I, I, I, I can only, I can only assume that.</span> <span id="s180">Because now they had, they had all American football players that brought the school national prestige, national recognition.</span> <span id="s181">I brought the school international recognition.</span> <span id="s182">They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s183">They were white and, of course, I, I was black.</span> <span id="s184">So what, the only, only, I can only assume it was because of race.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: What about in your socializing and the friends you made in college?</span> <span id="s186">Was race an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No.</span> <span id="s188">But of course I socialized only with my own kind, you know, my own race of people see.</span> <span id="s189">I didn’t socialize with anybody else other than my own race of people during the, the four years that I uh was going to the Uni, going to the University of Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: And on the, and in athletics it was a non-issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: I had no problem as, as, as a, as a, as a athlete at all because we were all, we were all on the same team.</span> <span id="s192">We were all very, very close.</span> <span id="s193">In fact the athletes participated with me even after we left the University, we, we were very, very close.</span> <span id="s194">I know it, it uh in athletics you know you become, it’s, you become, it, it’s stronger than a fraternity when you’re working with, when you’re running together, training together, trying, trying to reach certain goals in, in your, in your sport, you become very, very close.</span> <span id="s195">And I still, and I still have contact with some of the, some of the fellows that ran on the team with me even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So in sports the racial lines just fade away.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s198">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: But in everyday life you were still confronting some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s201">You were always reminded of the fact that, you know, you were, you were, you’re colored, you know, and that you there was certain, certain things you couldn’t do and certain things you could do as a result of your race.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Sports was an equalizer I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s204">And I think sports has done so much in order to make uh the country a better country in terms of, of, of social relationships between peoples.</span> <span id="s205">And that’s what the Olympics does, you know.</span> <span id="s206">You be, you become very, you become acquainted with a lot of people in particularly people on your team and, and you become very close with, to them.</span> <span id="s207">And you don’t think in terms of race when you’re dealing with them see.</span> <span id="s208">And they don’t think in terms of race uh with you.</span> <span id="s209">I know, I know in 1950 uh I went to Georgia, to Athens, Georgia, and I made contact with uh an athlete that won, that won, that won the uh high hurdles on the 1936 Olympic team.</span> <span id="s210">Uh Speck Towns.</span> <span id="s211">Well now he was, he was a, he was a coach at the University of Georgia.</span> <span id="s212">And of course back in that time you know the South was running rampant with, with uh racism and discrimination.</span> <span id="s213">So I’m when I got into Athens, I call him up.</span> <span id="s214">And he took and he told me, asked me where I was, where I was stopping.</span> <span id="s215">And I told him.</span> <span id="s216">He said no you stay right there and I’ll come down and get you and bring you out to the school.</span> <span id="s217">And that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s218">That was in 1950, 19 when, when the racism and discrimination was running rampant in (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s219">But that shows you the, the closeness you have with, with your fellow athletes you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Let me ask you before we sort of talk more about the Olympics, that of course as you know is our focus.</span> <span id="s221">When you were at the University of Pittsburgh, were you uh aware of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No.</span> <span id="s223">No.</span> <span id="s224">I wasn’t aware of any, of any anti-Semitism while I was at the University.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: How much did you know about what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No more than what was adver, no more than what was advertised in the, in the papers, you know.</span> <span id="s227">Uh we heard a lot about what Hitler, what Hitler was doing as far as the, the Jewish people were concerned.</span> <span id="s228">And you know just before the Olympics, you know he’s written a book Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s229">I didn’t, I didn’t read it.</span> <span id="s230">Uh the book that I did read was the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s231">I read, I read that some years later.</span> <span id="s232">But when we went, cause when we went to the Olympics, we weren’t interested, we weren’t interested in politics.</span> <span id="s233">We were only interested in going to Germany, participating in our events, and trying to win as many gold medals or medal as we could win, see, and come home.</span> <span id="s234">That was the, that was our interest.</span> <span id="s235">Cause see I was, I made the team when I was twenty.</span> <span id="s236">Uh and before I got to Berlin, Germany, I, I had a birthday and I was twenty-one when I actually won my gold medal.</span> <span id="s237">So we were young.</span> <span id="s238">All of us were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So you didn’t know too terribly much about the situation in Germany or that Hitler wasn’t particularly fond of blacks either.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No.</span> <span id="s241">No.</span> <span id="s242">Not at all.</span> <span id="s243">I know uh there was, there was one in, there was one instance when we had a young German athlete come visit with us.</span> <span id="s244">And we were asking him, we were asking this young athlete, he spoke English fluently.</span> <span id="s245">And we asked him uh what did the peep, what did the German people think of Hitler.</span> <span id="s246">Well they thought he was, they thought he was a great man.</span> <span id="s247">First of all his reason for making that statement was the fact that the economic situation had improved tremendously under his regime, you see.</span> <span id="s248">Because what he did, he withdrew from the League of Nations, as you know, started building up all this war armament, opened up all these factories to build all these weapons, and it made it possible for a lot of Germans people to go to work.</span> <span id="s249">And that’s why they thought that he, he was, he was great for the country.</span> <span id="s250">But they didn’t realize that they had a Frankenstein on their hands, you see.</span> <span id="s251">Because you know they attempted to assassinate him.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: When you learned that you qualified to go to the Olympics, do you remember how you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well I was very, I was very happy and very elated I was able to make the team you see.</span> <span id="s254">Course not realizing what the Olympic program was all about at that time because everything came very fast to me, see.</span> <span id="s255">But when I, when I, when I came, when my, when I came down to earth and realized what I had accomplished by making the team, then I was most elated.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: You were representing the United States in a major international.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: United States.</span> <span id="s258">That’s right.</span> <span id="s259">Um mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: That must have made you very proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: It did.</span> <span id="s262">It made all my family very proud.</span> <span id="s263">And all my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Had you ever traveled so far before?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: No.</span> <span id="s266">the furtherest I ever, I, I never even traveled as far as Pittsburgh when I went to, went to the University and we, I stayed right, right there in that small town of Connellsville.</span> <span id="s267">And the furtherest I was away from home was when I went to Pittsburgh to the University, which was 50, 51 miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So tell me a little bit about your trip over.</span> <span id="s269">What it you know what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: It was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And actually I need you to being by saying the trip over was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: The trip over was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s273">Of course we sailed on the S.S. Manhattan which was one of the better liners at that particular time.</span> <span id="s274">And, of course, they had wonderful facilities for us while we traveled by boat.</span> <span id="s275">It took us eight days before we landed in Hamburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s276">Now some of us were pretty good sailors and some of us weren’t.</span> <span id="s277">Because with many, quite a, quite a, quite a number of the athletes got sick, seasick, cause the sea was pretty rough.</span> <span id="s278">But fortunately for me I was a pretty good sailor.</span> <span id="s279">I didn’t get sick.</span> <span id="s280">So I was able to make the trip and enjoy the food.</span> <span id="s281">Because once you get seasick you don’t want no parts of food.</span> <span id="s282">But I was able to eat the food and enjoy it and enjoy the trip as a whole.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Were there training facilities on board?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s285">They made it possible, they, they equipped that ship whereby all the athletes that were participating in the various activities to be able to train while the ship was sailing.</span> <span id="s286">And of course with the, with the runners, you know, we did a lot of jogging on the port, port side of the ship, you see.</span> <span id="s287">To keep, you know, try to keep in shape that way, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Now did you stick together with the runners primarily or did everybody get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes, well most of the runners pretty much stayed, stuck together.</span> <span id="s290">Now like the weight men, those who threw the discus and the shot put and the hammer, we didn’t socialize too much with them.</span> <span id="s291">But, of course, but the runners we all had, we had more in common with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did you have a room mate?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I had a room mate, and my, my room mate uh in going over uh was uh, uh Mac Robinson, that was Jackie Robinson’s brother.</span> <span id="s294">And of course he also roomed with me in, in the Olympic village.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Was there any separation of black and while athletes on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No.</span> <span id="s297">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So all of a sudden you’ve left port and there’s no segregation anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s300">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Can you say something to that effect?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well that’s, that was the way it was, that was the way everything was set up for us you see.</span> <span id="s303">And it was.</span> <span id="s304">It was very good.</span> <span id="s305">It shouldn’t have been any segregation because we were all a member of one team, the American team.</span> <span id="s306">We all had one objective and there was, there should not have any segregation and there wasn’t any segregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: But wasn’t this, this was a slightly different experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s309">That’s true.</span> <span id="s310">It was a slightly different experience.</span> <span id="s311">But they, they, they had, there was no segregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: So you were on this boat for eight days?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And I assume this was a pretty exciting time for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: It was exciting.</span> <span id="s316">It was the first, first time I’d ever taken, taken a boat anywhere.</span> <span id="s317">And, and a, and a, and above all, a luxury liner like that you see that was set up.</span> <span id="s318">Cause that was the S.S. Manhattan was one of the, one of our big liners.</span> <span id="s319">It was the S.S. Manhattan and S.S. Washington.</span> <span id="s320">The S.S. Washington brought the team, brought the team members back.</span> <span id="s321">But the S.S. Manhattan took us, took us abroad you see to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Were you pretty excited about competing at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s324">Very excited.</span> <span id="s325">And of course I wanted to win.</span> <span id="s326">And that, that’s all, that was always my philosophy when I toed, when I toed the line on any race.</span> <span id="s327">My one objective was to win.</span> <span id="s328">In fact throughout my collegiate career I think I won about 90, 90 percent of every race I ever ran.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: That’s impressive.</span> <span id="s330">So the mood on the boat.</span> <span id="s331">What was the mood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Friendly.</span> <span id="s333">Everybody was friendly.</span> <span id="s334">Everybody had a good time.</span> <span id="s335">Everybody enjoyed themselves.</span> <span id="s336">Even those who got seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: I want to hear about your arrival and everything, but I think we’re going to change tapes first.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">(end Tape 1 0f 3) (Tape 2 of 3)</span></p> <p><span id="s339">(beep)</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: I want to backtrack for a minute.</span> <span id="s341">There was to my understanding at the time of, right prior to the ’36 Olympics, some effort to boycott the Olympics.</span> <span id="s342">How aware were you of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Not, no, I wasn’t aware of too much about it.</span> <span id="s344">I heard a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s345">The boy uh the boycott, there was some, there was some talk about the Olympics being boycotted because of what Hitler was doing to the Jewish people in Germany.</span> <span id="s346">But uh there was noth, nothing made, made too much of as far as the team members were concerned cause it was never discussed amongst, amongst the team members.</span> <span id="s347">But we heard it and we heard something about it, but we never, we never discussed it.</span> <span id="s348">As I said earlier, we weren’t interested in politics you see at all.</span> <span id="s349">We were only interested in going to Germany and winning.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: I want to ask you to say that again.</span> <span id="s351">The reason I’m asking you is because I want you to do the whole thing again without as I said earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And tell me a little bit was there talk of boycotting the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: There was some talk.</span> <span id="s355">There was some talk about boycotting the Olympics, but it wasn’t, it wasn’t something that was a, a, a matter of conversation amongst the team members you see.</span> <span id="s356">We didn’t, we didn’t uh go into any detail on it.</span> <span id="s357">So uh we didn’t bother, we didn’t concern ourselves too much about it.</span> <span id="s358">All we knew that we were we’d made the team, we were, we were on the boat, and we were going to Germany.</span> <span id="s359">That’s all.</span> <span id="s360">That’s all we were interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You weren’t interested in the political situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: No.</span> <span id="s363">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: But prior to your going over, were there articles in the newspapers, was there any conversation in the black community or in the black press about going or not going to the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: No.</span> <span id="s366">Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s367">In fact I, I don’t, I don’t recall of ever reading anything uh in the, in the newspapers, the black press or the white press concerning going as, as far as the matter of going to the Olympics was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: So there wasn’t much of a movement in the States before you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s370">Not to my knowledge anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Now.</span> <span id="s372">Back to the boat.</span> <span id="s373">You arrived in Hamburg, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Hamburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s375">That’s where the ship uh docked.</span> <span id="s376">And then we took a train from there to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: What was the arrival in Hamburg like?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: It was, it was very, it was pretty exciting.</span> <span id="s379">You know, the, the, the,</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Can you start by saying, when we arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: When we, when we arrived in Hamburg, it was, it was pretty, pretty exciting event for us, you know.</span> <span id="s382">It was a lot of people out there to, to welcome us to Germany at that particular time.</span> <span id="s383">And then and of course we appreciated, we appreciated the welcome that they were, they’re showing us at that time you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Who were those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: German people.</span> <span id="s386">German people.</span> <span id="s387">They were out to welcome us, welcome the American team to uh, to uh, to Germany.</span> <span id="s388">They knew, they knew where we were going to go.</span> <span id="s389">And they, and they, they knew the reason why we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Were they average citizens?</span> <span id="s391">Was it organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I don’t know whether it was organized or not.</span> <span id="s393">We just saw, we just saw a lot, lot of people you know, cheering us and what have you, when we, when we docked in, in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Did they have flags, was there music?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I don’t recall really.</span> <span id="s396">I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s397">All, all I saw was a lot of people and a lot of waving of the hands and what have you, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: You felt pretty good?</span> <span id="s399">And then how did you get to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: By train.</span> <span id="s401">By train.</span> <span id="s402">We went to Berlin by train.</span> <span id="s403">After we docked in Hamburg uh they put us all on a train, all the American team members on a train, and we went to Berlin to the Olympic village.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Were you welcomed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: We were welcomed at the Olympic village and, of course, they assigned, they assigned us, assigned quarters for all of the team members.</span> <span id="s406">They had little huts that we, that we lived in, see.</span> <span id="s407">And, of course, there was uh two, two men or two athletes per, per hut.</span> <span id="s408">And, of course, I roomed with uh Mac Robinson while we were, while we were in, in the Olympic village.</span> <span id="s409">That was Jackie Robinson’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What was life like in the Olympic village?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: It was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s412">Very, in, in the Olympic village it was very, very pleasant.</span> <span id="s413">The accommodations were very good.</span> <span id="s414">The food was very good.</span> <span id="s415">And uh the, the cooks from the S.S. Brahman, that was the German’s uh luxury liner, those cooks were the cooked the food for the American team, and they did a fine job.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Were there activities, were, was there a lot of camaraderie amongst the athletes?</span> <span id="s417">Tell me a little bit about what it was like spending time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Well, there was a lot of camaraderie amongst the American team members you see.</span> <span id="s419">We do, we, of course, we socialize, you know, visiting one another, visiting each, each hut you know.</span> <span id="s420">Talking about what we hoped to do at the, at the games.</span> <span id="s421">That sort of conversation.</span> <span id="s422">But that was about it you see.</span> <span id="s423">Cause you know there was nothing else you know that we could do you know under the circumstances because there was a certain amount of discipline that was exercised to make sure that uh that the team members did what they were supposed to do in preparation for their activities, their athletic ac, athletic activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: A lot of training?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes we trained.</span> <span id="s426">They had training facilities there whereby we, we trained in preparation for, for our race you see.</span> <span id="s427">And, and they had a track there that we could that, that we could run on in, in order to keep us, keep us in shape, cause you know I guess a, a lot of us got out of shape you know based on particularly those who got sick, you see, and they had to work pretty hard, had to get through their land legs back again see.</span> <span id="s428">So it, it was, they had, they had to do quite a bit of training to kind of get themself together you know for their races you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Were the training facilities separated by nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No.</span> <span id="s431">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So on the track there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: There were all, all, all nationalities who participated on the same track.</span> <span id="s434">Cause they only had one, one facility for us, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: And you’d mentioned that it was important to maintain a discipline.</span> <span id="s436">Were there rules that you remember?</span> <span id="s437">Certain things that you were told?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well uh they, they weren’t spelled out, you know, rule one, rule two, rule three, and rule four.</span> <span id="s439">It was nothing like that.</span> <span id="s440">We as athletes knew that we had a certain, certain responsibility to maintain ourselves to the best of our abilities so that we would be prepared for our, for our races, you see.</span> <span id="s441">And we took that, we took that responsibility on our own, you see.</span> <span id="s442">And uh but we, we knew that was it was understood that that was how we had to react or conduct ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Now I understand this Olympic village they created was really very, very pretty.</span> <span id="s444">Can you tell me a little bit more about what it looked like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Looked like a, like a beautiful college campus.</span> <span id="s446">Beautiful grass, laid out very, very well.</span> <span id="s447">I, I took some very nice pictures of that Olympic village which I have at home.</span> <span id="s448">Uh because I had, I owned, I had a little old box camera and I took some pictures of the village.</span> <span id="s449">But it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s450">A beautiful place.</span> <span id="s451">It was a beautiful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did you notice any discrimination once you arrived in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No.</span> <span id="s454">I didn’t notice any.</span> <span id="s455">After I. No, I did not no, I did not notice any discrimination when I arrived in Germany.</span> <span id="s456">After I’d won my race, won my gold medal, I went downtown Berlin doing a little sightseeing of the city, and the people, the German people were very, very cordial.</span> <span id="s457">They just crowded around you for autographs.</span> <span id="s458">Very friendly.</span> <span id="s459">There was nothing, I, I didn’t notice anything negative at all the whole time that I participated in those 1936 Olympic games as far as we were concerned.</span> <span id="s460">Now you’ve probably heard some stories about Hitler uh refusing to shake, shake Jesse Owen’s hand.</span> <span id="s461">Well that’s, those stories were wrong.</span> <span id="s462">They were wrong.</span> <span id="s463">One time Hitler invited some of the athletes up in his, up in, up in his uh the sections that they had established for him and his lieutenants.</span> <span id="s464">Uh Helen Stevens who won the hundred meters for the women, the America for the, she was on the women’s team.</span> <span id="s465">She and her coach were invited up that one particular time.</span> <span id="s466">And of course the, the American coaches spoke to Hitler about that.</span> <span id="s467">And informed him that if he wasn’t going to invite all the athletes up there then he, then they wanted him not to do that uh with any, any other athletes.</span> <span id="s468">And at the time that he invited these athletes up there, Jesse Owens was still competing on the track.</span> <span id="s469">So therefore he could not have gone up there at that particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So it was decided that he wasn’t going to shake anyone’s hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s472">The American, the American coaches told him not to do that because he was see if he was going to discriminate, and only have, only have certain athletes come up there, then uh they, they, they, they uh they, they said they didn’t want him to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: So what was Hitler’s decision on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Well he, he, he, he didn’t have no athletes come up there for the rest of the games.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Were you aware while you were over there, you said you personally didn’t face any discrimination, but were you aware of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No.</span> <span id="s477">Not at all.</span> <span id="s478">As I said he must have, he opened up, he must have declared the moratorium for the games because the things that perhaps he had been doing prior to the games, nothing like that took place during the games, you see.</span> <span id="s479">And of course after the games you know what happened, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: There were no traces?</span> <span id="s481">Now did you and you spent time leaving the Olympic village and the stadium and you just saw nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s483">That’s, we didn’t see anything that was, that was out of line or that was negative.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Do you remember much about this Glickman-Stoller controversy?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes, yes, we heard the story.</span> <span id="s486">You see Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were the two Jewish boys, extra boys that was, that was selected or qualified to run on the relay team.</span> <span id="s487">That was the four by one hundred relay team.</span> <span id="s488">When we, I don’t know, none of us knew who made the decision as to keep those fellows off that team.</span> <span id="s489">Jesse Owens wanted to give up his position on the team.</span> <span id="s490">And I’m sure that Ralph Metcalfe probably would have given his position up, to give Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman a chance to run, but the coaches of the American team decided they wanted Jesse and, and Ralph Metcalfe to run on that team.</span> <span id="s491">And so they, so they didn’t select Sam Stoller or Marty Glickman to run.</span> <span id="s492">And they still would have won the, they still would have won the race cause they were both very fine, very fine runners, very fine sprinters.</span> <span id="s493">But who made the, who made the final decision?</span> <span id="s494">Whether it was Lawrence Robertson, whether Hitler had something, something to say about it, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s495">We discussed it many, many times, but we never did know who made that decision to keep those two fellows from running on that team.</span> <span id="s496">And to this day, Marty Glickman is very, very bitter about it, you see, cause I knew Marty Glickman very well see.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Do you remember how you and some of the other athletes felt when this took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: We felt, we felt that they, we felt that they should have been given the opportunity to participate, an opportunity to win a gold medal and which they would have won a gold medal.</span> <span id="s499">They still would have won that relay team, regardless whether Jesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe was on it or not.</span> <span id="s500">They still would have won.</span> <span id="s501">But they didn’t give those boys a chance.</span> <span id="s502">And that’s why Marty today, to this day, is very bitter about that, about that decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Describe what it was like being at the games when you weren’t running.</span> <span id="s504">Uh the mood, the pageantry, did you see Hitler regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Well everything, we saw Hitler every day when he came out to the games, but you see, he was so far away just like myself, uh sitting in the, in the stand, he was too far away for us to even see, see the image of him, see.</span> <span id="s506">We knew he was there.</span> <span id="s507">We knew each time he came into the game because you know the German people you know, you know, naturally would create a commotion when he, when he entered the stadium, when he entered the stadium.</span> <span id="s508">But me personally, he was too far away from me to make out just, just what he looked like other than from, from those pictures that I’ve seen some, seen of him see.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Try to paint for me a picture of what it was like at the games, what it felt like, what it looked like, because I didn’t have that option?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well at the games, at those particular games in 1936, they were a very fine set of games.</span> <span id="s511">That was my first experience you see.</span> <span id="s512">That was my first experience of, of, of being in the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s513">It was very, very exciting.</span> <span id="s514">The events were run off with precision, the athletes didn’t have to wait around when their event was called, the starter started, started your event.</span> <span id="s515">You knew the Germans, you knew they’re, they’re a stick, they’re a stickler for things being done just right.</span> <span id="s516">And that’s the way they, that’s the way they ran the games.</span> <span id="s517">Because in talking with some of the old timers who had followed the Olympic games prior to the 1936 games that, that I participated in, they said they that the Berlin games were the finest Olympic games that they’d ever witnessed.</span> <span id="s518">That was the, that was the statement they made.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Was there a lot of fanfare?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: There was a lot, there was a lot of fanfare.</span> <span id="s521">There was a lot of fanfare.</span> <span id="s522">A lot of excitement.</span> <span id="s523">Lot of excitement.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Were there flags, parades, music.</span> <span id="s525">I mean, I’m trying to get, I’m trying to imagine what it was like being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Well, the flags, the only flags that, that was, that took place was when after the athlete’s completed their event.</span> <span id="s527">Now, when the American, when the Americans won, the American flags went up.</span> <span id="s528">And of course, it was, if it was a foreign country that was part of, part of the race, took third or second, whichever the case may be, or even first, their, the flags representing their nations went up.</span> <span id="s529">Those are the only flags that were waving.</span> <span id="s530">And of course in the, in the uh bleachers, some of the, some of the uh spectators were waving flags.</span> <span id="s531">Some of the Americans were waving little flags you see, showing their, their enthusiasm for, for their, for their countrymen winning or the country women winning.</span> <span id="s532">That was the type of fanfare that you saw during the games.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: A lot of cheering.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: A lot of cheering.</span> <span id="s535">That’s, that’s always the case you see.</span> <span id="s536">They do a lot of cheering.</span> <span id="s537">Although from my experience, you know, the athletes never hear it though.</span> <span id="s538">They never hear what’s going on.</span> <span id="s539">Cause they’re concentrating on what they’re doing.</span> <span id="s540">They’re concentrating on that race.</span> <span id="s541">So they don’t, they don’t hear the cheering.</span> <span id="s542">They don’t even hear what people say.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Swastikas?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I didn’t see any of that.</span> <span id="s545">Didn’t see any of that at all.</span> <span id="s546">Didn’t see any of that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Tell me a little bit about your race and how you were feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Well I had to run three races.</span> <span id="s549">I had to run the preliminaries and the semi-finals and the finals.</span> <span id="s550">The preliminary race, the preliminaries and the, and the semi-final race.</span> <span id="s551">When the race was, when the race was started I got right out in front and I stayed out there and won the race on, on both of those two races.</span> <span id="s552">On the final race, I decided well I’m going to try to exercise a little strategy to make sure that I would win the race uh by laying back in second position, and then, of course, in the waiting until I hit the last three hundred meters and then starting my kick to try to win the race.</span> <span id="s553">But the fellow, Phil Edwards, from Canada, he set a very, very slow pace.</span> <span id="s554">And, of course, he set that pace and, and we, we ran that way for four hundred meters, that’s half the race.</span> <span id="s555">When we hit the first turn of the last, the last half of the race or the last four hundred meters, the contestants or my opponents crowded right around me.</span> <span id="s556">I got boxed in.</span> <span id="s557">And the only way I could get out of that box was to stop.</span> <span id="s558">Now if I attempted to breakthrough, I would have fouled somebody and I’d have been disqualified.</span> <span id="s559">But I had enough sense to know that I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s560">So I stopped.</span> <span id="s561">So I let the, let, let my opponents proceed in front, ahead of me.</span> <span id="s562">I ran out into the third lane and I then I ran around the field and won the race.</span> <span id="s563">In fact I ran more than eight hundred meters when I won that race because I was running way out in the third lane see.</span> <span id="s564">But I won it.</span> <span id="s565">That was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s566">And of course the old timers just said they never in the history of the, of the, of the Olympics had ever seen a race won the way I ran mine.</span> <span id="s567">And you see, first of all, whenever you uh stop and you break your stride, you break your rhythm, that u, that usually finishes you.</span> <span id="s568">But I was able to pick up even though I started the race twice and, and, and still won.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What drove you?</span> <span id="s570">What drove you?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Determine, determination.</span> <span id="s572">My only objective at any time I got into a race was to win.</span> <span id="s573">And that’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: That’s what it takes?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: That’s what it takes.</span> <span id="s576">Determination.</span> <span id="s577">Lot of fire in the stomach as they say.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Were you winning for you, for your country, for</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: I was winning for me and I was winning for the country.</span> <span id="s580">Me first, then the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: When you said you won, you were very casual about this.</span> <span id="s582">This is a pretty momentous occasion.</span> <span id="s583">I don’t think you probably felt that casually.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well, it, it was a momentous occasion.</span> <span id="s585">But I didn’t realize how important it was until it was all over with because everything happened so fast, just like I made the Olympic team very fast.</span> <span id="s586">Didn’t know that I was going to be on the Olympic team, didn’t know I was going to be even try out for the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s587">Then going to Germany and winning it.</span> <span id="s588">But I didn’t realize just what achievement that I had accomplished until it was all over to receive my medal.</span> <span id="s589">Uh we weren’t, we weren’t instructed as to how we were to salute you see.</span> <span id="s590">So at one, one point I, I, I said well should I give a Nazi salute, should I give a, or should I give an American salute.</span> <span id="s591">But I was very real confused, but nevertheless I finally ended up giving the American salute.</span> <span id="s592">Cause I was nervous, very nervous and very confused.</span> <span id="s593">I was a young, young man, and of course we weren’t given any instructions on that you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: When you win a medal, what’s the process here.</span> <span id="s595">What happens?</span> <span id="s596">You win the race, everyone’s cheering.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: All right.</span> <span id="s598">When you’re up on the stand and they’re playing the Star Spangled Banner for all the Americans and of course they played the Star Spangled Banner for me winning my race, you see.</span> <span id="s599">Then they had young girls that came over.</span> <span id="s600">And the girls presented the medal.</span> <span id="s601">They presented the medal.</span> <span id="s602">And somewhere, somewhere, somewhere later they presented an oak, a little oak tree, which I brought back home and that oak tree it was about 18, about 18 inches uh in height.</span> <span id="s603">I brought it back and then I had to send it to the Department of Agriculture here in Washington cause they had to check the dirt around it for any kind of bugs that was being brought in.</span> <span id="s604">So when they, when it was sent back to Connellsville, my home town, the tree was almost dead.</span> <span id="s605">So I turned the tree over to the Botany teacher of my high school and he worked with the tree and brought it back, and they planted it on the library at, at, at the Carnegie Library in the home town.</span> <span id="s606">And then of course, they, they replanted it when they built the stadium, the Falcon Stadium is the name of it.</span> <span id="s607">And that tree is now six feet tall.</span> <span id="s608">And a lot of the acorns from that tree is being planted around different places around the United States, from, from my tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So you went to the stands, somebody escorted you to the stands.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s611">Well, you know, you know, they showed you where, where you had to go in order to uh receive your, receive your, your medal see.</span> <span id="s612">And that’s, that’s what, that’s what they did you see.</span> <span id="s613">See, I, I, I, I, I won first.</span> <span id="s614">Uh Maria Lansey from Italy was second.</span> <span id="s615">I forget the third man who, who, who uh, no Phil Edwards, Phil Edwards from Canada, he was third.</span> <span id="s616">He was third.</span> <span id="s617">Now the two runners, two, two other, two other American runners, Charles Hornsbarsel from University of Indiana or Indiana University and Harry Williamson from North Carolina University, they came in, they came in fourth and, and fifth.</span> <span id="s618">They didn’t, they didn’t uh they didn’t get a medal see.</span> <span id="s619">Cause they only give medals for the first three places.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So what was it like standing in front of a hundred thousand people accepting this honor?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Very, it was, it was a very, very exciting experience.</span> <span id="s622">As I said, I was, I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s623">I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s624">Everybody clapping their hands and cheering etc.</span> <span id="s625">It was nervous for a young man twenty-one years old, had never been so far away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: The Americans really cleaned up in these events didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s628">We did very well.</span> <span id="s629">We did very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Was there any irony or satisfaction to having won this, won this race as a black American, gotten all of this prestige and honor for your country that didn’t always treat you so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Well, of course we were a victim, being, myself personally, we were a victim of discrimination in, in, in, in the country of America for all those many years cause I’d only lived in the world for twenty-one years at that particular time.</span> <span id="s632">And we understood that.</span> <span id="s633">We didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s634">We never do.</span> <span id="s635">We never did like it and we never will like it.</span> <span id="s636">We still have racism in this country.</span> <span id="s637">This country is still full of racism as far as, as the black man is concerned.</span> <span id="s638">Things are better than they used to be.</span> <span id="s639">Much better.</span> <span id="s640">Economically speaking, blacks are getting better jobs than they got back in those days.</span> <span id="s641">They’re able to go to any, any, any, any university in the country.</span> <span id="s642">Cause back in those days you couldn’t go, you couldn’t go, you couldn’t go to University of Georgia or University of Mississippi and what you have back in those, back in those times.</span> <span id="s643">You couldn’t go to the Naval Academy back in those times.</span> <span id="s644">Well, get to tell you a little experience in that, in that regard.</span> <span id="s645">We had a track meet to run at Annapolis, at the Naval Academy.</span> <span id="s646">Now here I am an Olympic champion and they told my coach that I couldn’t run.</span> <span id="s647">I couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s648">So I had to stay home because of discrimination.</span> <span id="s649">Now that wasn’t hap, that wasn’t the situation at West Point.</span> <span id="s650">I ran at West point when I was going to the University of Pittsburgh, but I couldn’t run at, at Annapolis.</span> <span id="s651">But things are better now.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: I just want to get back to being in Germany, having lived through this and winning this medal for your country.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Now what was the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Well actually we’ve only got a minute left on the tape.</span> <span id="s655">So maybe I’m going to stop and start again.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">(end Tape 2 of 30 (Tape 3 of 3)</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You’re going to be of hundreds of athletes and that made no difference.</span> <span id="s658">That must have been a good feeling.</span> <span id="s659">That sort of inclusiveness.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">(get a little mark) (We need to hear your voice again)</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: You want to hear my voice again.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">(Beep)</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: I was asking you if there was any sort of special feeling or pride in being a black American winning the gold medal in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: There was definitely a special feeling in winning the gold medal and being a, a black man because here I, here I was doing something and particularly, this particular event had not been won by an American in 24 years.</span> <span id="s665">So and it, that was won by a white man, not a black man.</span> <span id="s666">So I was very proud of that, of that fact, very proud of that achievement, and I was very happy for myself as an individual, for my race, and for my country.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: You had started to mention something about auxiliaries.</span> <span id="s668">What’s that about?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Well after the Olympics were over, I think it came at, I think it was published, it must have been published in the Ger, in, in, in the German publication, the German newspapers, that Hitler made the remark that if it wasn’t for the black auxiliary the American would not have won the Olympics.</span> <span id="s670">That’s what I, that’s what I hear.</span> <span id="s671">I didn’t read it, but I heard, heard that that was the remark that he made, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: How did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Well it, it made me, it made me feel good because what we did, we destroyed his master race theory.</span> <span id="s674">That’s what, it made me feel very good.</span> <span id="s675">Cause you know he uh he had that master race theory that you know the, the superior race, that only, only, only the pure Germans could do certain things in this world.</span> <span id="s676">That was what he was advocating.</span> <span id="s677">But we destroyed his theory whenever we started winning those gold medals.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Tell me a little bit about your return home as an Olympic hero.</span> <span id="s679">How were you received and where did you come first?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: We came to New York and they had a big parade for us.</span> <span id="s681">After the Olympics we came home, we came home on the S.S. Washington.</span> <span id="s682">Now, of course, Jesse Owens came home ahead of us because he, he didn’t, he didn’t do any running after the Olympics outside of Dresden, Germany.</span> <span id="s683">One week after the Olympic games, Jesse ran in Dresden, Germany, and of course he was defeated by Ralph Metcalfe who took second to him in the Olympic games in Berlin.</span> <span id="s684">But he had some offers that was made, some professional offers, and of course he came back on the, on the, on the, on the Queen Mary to take advantage of those offers cause Jesse came from a poor family too.</span> <span id="s685">Most of the blacks came from poor families you see.</span> <span id="s686">None of, none of us came from any wealthy homes, or middle class homes.</span> <span id="s687">Most all from poor families.</span> <span id="s688">But many of those offers didn’t pan out for him at all.</span> <span id="s689">And of course they, due to the fact, you see he was scheduled to run in, in, in various countries.</span> <span id="s690">He didn’t run so they declared him, they declared him as a professional.</span> <span id="s691">So Jesse, his amateur days were over with after that see.</span> <span id="s692">But I ran after the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s693">I ran in White City Stadium in London.</span> <span id="s694">Then from there I ran up in Oslo, Norway, before coming home.</span> <span id="s695">But we all, we all ended up in, in New York and they had a big ticker tape parade for us in, in uh Manhattan up, up Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s696">And there was a lot of cheering and if course Mayor LaGuardia who was the Mayor of the city at the time uh gave us, gave us a, a medal uh from the City of New York.</span> <span id="s697">And then from there we all departed New York City and we went to our various homes.</span> <span id="s698">And, of course, when I got back to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, they had a big parade for me in my, in my home town.</span> <span id="s699">And which, which was the biggest parade that ev, that ever turned out for anybody in that small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: That must have felt fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: It was, it was, it was.</span> <span id="s702">I was, it was, it was a fabulous time, a fabulous occasion, and a happy time for me and for my family and for all my friends back there in Connellsville.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: How long did the euphoria last?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Well it lasted for quite a, quite a long time, you know, because you know I used to go out and, and do a lot of speaking to the young uh run uh kids after the Olympic games and, of course, I was still in school and I was still, still making records as an athlete because I won every major med, won every major er uh track meet in the country at that particular time.</span> <span id="s705">Right up until, right up until I stopped running in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did winning the Olympics open doors for you that wouldn’t have been opened otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Some, some doors.</span> <span id="s708">Some doors, cause I, I never, you know, I, I was never made, I never made any uh never uh received any fabulous offers in terms of uh making any money because see first of all I was still in school and I had three years.</span> <span id="s709">I had three years to go to get my degree.</span> <span id="s710">And when I was graduated.</span> <span id="s711">Right after I was graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, then I went to New York University and uh while I was in graduate school, I got a job at John Wannamaker’s running the elevator.</span> <span id="s712">And of course you know there was quite a lot of publicity came out about an Olympic champion getting a job running an elevator.</span> <span id="s713">And the only thing that John Wannamaker wanted to do was give me a permanent job running an elevator.</span> <span id="s714">That was all.</span> <span id="s715">Then I got a job as a social investigator for the city of New York, working with disadvantaged people who were on welfare.</span> <span id="s716">Then I, then I got a job working, working for the uh police Athletic League, director of one of their centers up in, up in Harlem, New York, working with disadvantaged kids.</span> <span id="s717">And while I was working in that job, I took examination for State Parole Officer for the State of New York and I became a parole officer, supervising parolees who were released from the New York State Reformatory, reformatories or state prisons.</span> <span id="s718">Then from that I worked for a short period of time with Shefland and Company uh advertising alcoholic beverages.</span> <span id="s719">I didn’t particularly care for that cause I couldn’t see myself making, making a permanent job pushing booze.</span> <span id="s720">So I got out of that.</span> <span id="s721">Then I got a job as special inves, uh, uh insurance agent for the Prudential Insurance Company.</span> <span id="s722">I worked a while in that job.</span> <span id="s723">Then I ended up my career with the Job Corps Program.</span> <span id="s724">You know about the Job Corps program.</span> <span id="s725">Again working with disadvantaged kids.</span> <span id="s726">I never made a lot of money, but I made a living.</span> <span id="s727">But my, but my, the compensation that I got from the work that I did was helping people.</span> <span id="s728">And I helped a lot of people, a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Did the, being an Olympic winner open doors in other ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well not uh not, not, not to my experience, not from my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: …get you access to places that you weren’t able to go into before?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: I can’t, I can’t recall just looking back on, on, on my early, early career after winning the Olympics that it opened any particular doors, being a gold medal winner.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Did you expect it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Well I expected that I had hope.</span> <span id="s735">Nut noth, nothing materialized in, in that regard.</span> <span id="s736">Now I’m sure many of the white Olympians were made offers, very fine offers, but I can’t recall any of the black Olympians making any, any, making any great offers.</span> <span id="s737">Now Jesse did pretty well.</span> <span id="s738">He got in public relations work, but when he first came back from the Olympic games, he, he, he, he, he found it very difficult to get any decent, any decent work.</span> <span id="s739">He came back.</span> <span id="s740">He ran against race horses.</span> <span id="s741">You may have heard of, heard of him running against race horse.</span> <span id="s742">He did a number of things in order to track, try to make a living for his family.</span> <span id="s743">But only in later years he, he uh he started a public relation organization there in Chicago, and he did a lot of uh did a lot of he was on a lot of speaking engagements.</span> <span id="s744">And he picked up quite a bit of money doing that.</span> <span id="s745">But uh he didn’t have any, any, any big jobs.</span> <span id="s746">He never had any real, any real big jobs, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What I was trying to get at here is it seems that after all of the excitement of winning this medal, winning this race, coming back to all kinds of parades, how long did it kind of take to come back to earth and realize that things hadn’t changed much?</span> <span id="s748">Were there any moments that kind of showed you that clearly?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s750">When I came back, when I came back to the University of Pittsburgh, they didn’t want, they didn’t want to let me into the English class because I was a month late.</span> <span id="s751">And of course I guess the chancellor straightened that matter out.</span> <span id="s752">Then when I, one, one day I went downtown Pittsburgh, and one evening, to Child’s restaurant.</span> <span id="s753">They refused to serve me.</span> <span id="s754">That was, that was one instance.</span> <span id="s755">Then when I was graduated and they had the uh University Hall of Fame, here I’d brought international, international recognition to the school.</span> <span id="s756">The All American football players like Marshall Goldberg, they brought national recognition to the school.</span> <span id="s757">They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s758">In spite of the gold medal that I’d won and bringing the school international recognition.</span> <span id="s759">So that, that let me know just what the situation was.</span> <span id="s760">Things hadn’t changed.</span> <span id="s761">But I was young and, of course, as years went on, things got better.</span> <span id="s762">And uh and to date things have gotten much better for the blacks.</span> <span id="s763">But we still have a long way to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Ask you a little bit about what was going on, what was unfolding in Germany and in Europe.</span> <span id="s765">When after the Olympics did you become more aware of what was going on and you know how did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Well, I personally became a, aware of what was going on based on, based on the, on the publications on, on what was, what was uh printed in, in the various newspapers and, and, and, and magazines of, of what was happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s767">Of course right after the Olympics, in 1039, Hitler started World War II when he marched on Czechoslovakia, that was the beginning of World War II.</span> <span id="s768">And of course we all knew what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: How did you get that information.</span> <span id="s770">How did you start learning more.</span> <span id="s771">Is that the point at which you became more aware of the atrocities and</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes, my, become aware of those atrocities and things from what, from what was printed in the, in the, in the, in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s773">Newspapers through, you know, throughout, throughout the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: After having this glorious week in Berlin was this hard to believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes it was very hard to believe.</span> <span id="s776">It was very hard to believe.</span> <span id="s777">But we knew what was going on based on the publicity prior to the Olympic games, what Hitler was doing.</span> <span id="s778">And as I said he declared a moratorium, opened up everything, made everything very pleasant, very accommodating for, for the visiting uh, uh Olympic team nations.</span> <span id="s779">But after the Olympics they went right back to the, to the things he had planned.</span> <span id="s780">And, of course, all these things he had planned was laid out in his book, Mein Kampf.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So the Olympics were really a propaganda coup.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: It was.</span> <span id="s783">He made it so.</span> <span id="s784">He made it a propaganda coup to further, to further his cause, to further his program that he had set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: When you started learning more about all the horrible things that were happening, did you think about the Olympics in context of politics at all or were you just still feeling the same way you did at age 21?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Well, I would think it was pretty much the latter, pretty much the latter.</span> <span id="s787">Cause we’d had some background on what was going on prior to the games, and of course it was brought out more pointedly after the games.</span> <span id="s788">See when after the games were over then Hitler continued with his program, you see.</span> <span id="s789">Marching on Czechoslovakia and starting, starting the war.</span> <span id="s790">And of course it was something that uh we more or less expected.</span> <span id="s791">We more or less expected.</span> <span id="s792">You know uh the world didn’t think Hitler was doing what he was doing.</span> <span id="s793">You see they should have known what he was doing.</span> <span id="s794">You know, Germany was part of the League of Nations, like all the nations were, were part of that League.</span> <span id="s795">And the, the reason that they set that league up as you know from history was to more or less keep a tab on each nation in terms of them building up war armaments to start a war.</span> <span id="s796">Now Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s797">They should have known then what he was going to do.</span> <span id="s798">But they didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s799">They didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s800">They didn’t believe what he had printed in that book, Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s801">Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of England, called him the little Corporal.</span> <span id="s802">They down played Hitler.</span> <span id="s803">They didn’t believe, believe what he was about to do.</span> <span id="s804">So therefore they, they didn’t put a curb on him see.</span> <span id="s805">They probably could have stopped World War II if they had done so at that time.</span> <span id="s806">When he withdrew from the League of Nations, if they’d of put a clamp, put a clamp on him at that particular time, there probably would have been no World War Ii.</span> <span id="s807">But they didn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Do you think if we had believed what was going to happen and had exercised a boycott, it would have made any difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Exercised a boycott of the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I don’t know whether it would have made any difference or not.</span> <span id="s812">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s813">I, I can’t, I couldn’t , I can’t answer that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: In retrospect, cause I know how you felt at the time, learning how bad things became, do you think we should have participated in the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Well in retrospect, based, based on all the training that the athletes had gone through in preparing for the Olympic games, I feel, I felt that they should have had, they should have gone on with the Olympics as they did.</span> <span id="s816">Because I think that would, that would have been a very bad thing to have taken place.</span> <span id="s817">Uh but it would been, it would have been very hurting for the athletes who had made so much preparation, who had trained so long over the years.</span> <span id="s818">Fortunately for me I didn’t train like that.</span> <span id="s819">I was more or less a gifted athlete.</span> <span id="s820">I came up very fast.</span> <span id="s821">But there was other athletes who had trained for the Olympics who had trained for years to prepare for the games, and that would have been very, very bad if they could not have gone.</span> <span id="s822">That’s my, that’s my feeling, personal feeling.</span> <span id="s823">Now there might, there might be others who felt who would feel differently about it based on the question you just posed to me, but that’s my feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: That the Olympics and politics should stay separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Let’s take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: There are a couple of specific questions I want to ask you.</span> <span id="s828">You had mentioned one incident where you had contact with a German athlete at the Olympic village.</span> <span id="s829">Did you have other contact with German athletes?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: That was the only one.</span> <span id="s831">I remember this young man that came in.</span> <span id="s832">He was young like we were and uh he came and visited with us, you see.</span> <span id="s833">And of course when we heard all this uh this information about Hitler and naturally we posed a question.</span> <span id="s834">What did they think, what did the German people think of Hitler.</span> <span id="s835">And he said they, he said they thought he was a, a very good man because of what he’d done for the country economically speaking, made it possible for all of them to work and of course you know all of them were working in the, in the, in these factories where they were making weapons.</span> <span id="s836">And that’s why they felt, cause right after World War I, you know, the Germans they really were beat down.</span> <span id="s837">They were, they were in a bad way.</span> <span id="s838">And I guess they, they were, they were, they were looking, they were looking for a savior.</span> <span id="s839">And that’s when Hitler came into, came into play.</span> <span id="s840">They were looking for somebody to pull them out of those doldrums that they were in, you see.</span> <span id="s841">And of course when he withdrew from the League of Nations, started building all, all this, all this war armament, putting all these German people to work, he was a great guy as far as they were concerned.</span> <span id="s842">But they didn’t know, they didn’t know the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did you have contact with other international athletes?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No.</span> <span id="s845">No.</span> <span id="s846">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Was there much of a bond, camaraderie that should have lasted with the other athletes after the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: With other athletes from, from other teams.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: From here.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Oh, yes, yeah there was quite a, quite a, quite a bond, you know.</span> <span id="s851">We be, we became very, very close friends and we (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s852">The other athletes on the team were very close.</span> <span id="s853">I was very close to them.</span> <span id="s854">I’m still very close to some of them that are, that are still around.</span> <span id="s855">I still make contact with them, you see.</span> <span id="s856">And uh, but of course, many of them are gone, many of them have passed.</span> <span id="s857">And as I said I’m the only one that’s left now see.</span> <span id="s858">Archie Williams who won the 400 meters, he died about three years ago.</span> <span id="s859">And he was the last of the gold medal winners, other than myself, that were still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: So there was really a special bond?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s862">Stronger than a fraternity.</span> <span id="s863">Stronger, much stronger than a fraternity because of what we go through in training and what have you, the pain, feeling of pain when we’re training, the feeling of pain when we, when we race.</span> <span id="s864">That, that, that gives us a lot of strength and a lot of.</span> <span id="s865">It’s something that we have in common with each other.</span> <span id="s866">And something that we understand.</span> <span id="s867">You see one athlete understands another athlete and what he has to go through.</span> <span id="s868">If he’s a football player, a football player understands what another football player has to go through.</span> <span id="s869">And that’s the same way with in track and field.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: When did you become friendly with Marty Glickman?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: We lived in the same neighborhood up in New Rochelle, New York.</span> <span id="s872">His family and my family live in the same neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: But you met at the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: We met at the Olympics.</span> <span id="s875">Marty Glickman and I met in the Olympics as part of the team.</span> <span id="s876">I didn’t know him before that, but I knew him after that, after the Olympics where he resided in New Rochelle and where I resided with my family in New Rochelle, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Do you remember him at the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: I used to see him on occasion, because he was a sprinter.</span> <span id="s879">And I used to see Sam Stoller also.</span> <span id="s880">Incidentally Sam Stoller, is Sam Stoller dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: From your memory of 1936, what kind of guy was Marty Glickman?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: A nice fellow.</span> <span id="s883">Very nice fellow.</span> <span id="s884">Very friendly, as all the athletes that were on the team were all very friendly, all very cordial, all very accommodating.</span> <span id="s885">Which is like one big happy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q; Was there anything that set him apart in your mind/</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: No.</span> <span id="s888">No.</span> <span id="s889">He was just another, he was just another athlete like all the rest of them that were over there to win, win a gold medal and I was very, very sorry that he didn’t get that opportunity to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you go to the closing ceremonies?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A; The closing ceremonies at the, at the, the closing ceremonies at Berlin?</span> <span id="s892">Yes.</span> <span id="s893">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: It was very, very exciting.</span> <span id="s896">The closing ceremonies were very, very exciting because I, because I witnessed the closing ceremonies on the, on the other, other Olympic games that I attended.</span> <span id="s897">But, but this one was, was much more important because I was part of it.</span> <span id="s898">And they put on quite a show.</span> <span id="s899">Quite a show.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Well the closing, well they uh had the, had the, had the, had the athletes.</span> <span id="s902">Of course one thing about the closing ceremonies.</span> <span id="s903">The closing ceremonies are not as exciting as the opening ceremonies because a lot of the athletes after competing go home.</span> <span id="s904">So not the whole team, the whole team is never there at the closing ceremonies.</span> <span id="s905">So therefore uh it, it’s not quite as exciting as the opening ceremonies when they march in, each country with their flag and of course with the Olympic flag preceding all, preceding everything, you see.</span> <span id="s906">The five ring Olympic flag.</span> <span id="s907">But uh it’s not, as I said, it’s not as exciting, but it’s, it’s still exciting for those who participated in the closing ceremonies.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Well it looked like uh a closing ceremony.</span> <span id="s910">That’s all I can say.</span> <span id="s911">I don’t know what you’re</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: I’ve never been to one.</span> <span id="s913">I don’t even know what the opening ceremonies look like.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Well the opening ceremony’s when all these various nations, all these, all these uh Olympic athletes representing all these var, various nations march in.</span> <span id="s915">The host, the host, the host country athletes march in last.</span> <span id="s916">It’s all set up you know, it’s all set, it’s all organized.</span> <span id="s917">And, of course, all these countries, it’s, it’s preceded by the Olympic flag, the five ring flag.</span> <span id="s918">And of course right after they march in and the games are, are declared open, they have pigeons.</span> <span id="s919">And they release all these pigeons and they all fly, and that’s the opening of the games.</span> <span id="s920">It’s beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: You were on the field at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: On the field.</span> <span id="s923">As part of the American team.</span> <span id="s924">We came in with our white trousers, blue jackets and straw hats, with a red, red, white and blue band.</span> <span id="s925">White shirt and, and I forget what our tie, I think our tie was, I think our tie was, I think our tie was white if I recall.</span> <span id="s926">We just, it’s been a little while.</span> <span id="s927">But I remember, I remember, I remember the hat.</span> <span id="s928">I remember the jacket and I remember the trousers.</span> <span id="s929">And of course white shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: How were you feeling marching across there?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Oh, felt good, felt good.</span> <span id="s932">You know you always, always felt good marching in a parade.</span> <span id="s933">Always did.</span> <span

<p><span id="s938">Q: Is there anything else that you remember about sort of what the stadium looked like, what the track was like?</span> <span id="s939">Was it similar to other tracks that you had competed on?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A; It was a very beautiful track, very fine track.</span> <span id="s941">It was made with some kind of red uh red dirt, red cinders or something.</span> <span id="s942">It was different.</span> <span id="s943">It was very different than, than, than the tracks here in America at that particular time.</span> <span id="s944">And when I was over there for the 50th anniversary and I got a chance to, to visit the track again, that track was still in excellent condition.</span> <span id="s945">All the facilities that the Germans built for the 1936 Olympic games, they did a marvelous job.</span> <span id="s946">A marvelous job and everything was still intact, even today, even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Did the weather cooperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A; Cooperated very well.</span> <span id="s949">We had no, we had no inclement weather at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">(end of Tape 3 of 3)</span></p> <p><span
