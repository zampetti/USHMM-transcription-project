A lot of families--about 20 families--living in one little temple waiting for a passport to go home back.</span> <span id="s42">But one evening--night rather, middle of night, the Russian Army came in.</span> <span id="s43">And they just start to wake everybody; and said, "Get up!</span> <span id="s44">Get up!</span> <span id="s45">Get up!"</span> <span id="s46">And they just took us in trucks.</span> <span id="s47">And they took us to the trains, and we were closed in.</span> <span id="s48">And that's it, until in the morning when the trains started to roll.</span> <span id="s49">So we rolled for six weeks.</span> <span id="s50">And we passed into each step of the Russian country, which was... It was cold.</span> <span id="s51">And all of a sudden, we wound up in Siberia-- where there was no... I mean, the train ended.</span> <span id="s52">This is it.</span> <span id="s53">Because in the meantime, we were so many people; and the sanitary things were so unsanitary.</span> <span id="s54">There was no place to go to the bathroom or anything.</span> <span id="s55">And we had three children got sick... My niece--my sister's daughter--at that time she was about 3 years old.</span> <span id="s56">She got also sick.</span> <span id="s57">She was among the three children.</span> <span id="s58">And by the time we stopped at the end, two children died in the train.</span> <span id="s59">And my sister's daughter, my niece, they took her off to a hospital.</span> <span id="s60">We couldn't go no place, because we were waiting for the child.</span> <span id="s61">So we were left near Tomsk, which was Siberia.</span> <span id="s62">And we worked there; and we got the rations, bread.</span> <span id="s63">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I worked...I was cutting trees.</span> <span id="s66">In order... Anybody that didn't work, didn't get a ration of 400 gram of bread.</span> <span id="s67">So, of course, every...even though I was young; but I had to go to work in order to get my ration.</span> <span id="s68">Ration.</span> <span id="s69">How do you say it?</span> <span id="s70">Ration, ration of bread.</span> <span id="s71">So I went to work in the taiga--you know, in the woods.</span> <span id="s72">And we were cutting trees, you know, by hand.</span> <span id="s73">Cutting trees, putting trees together.</span> <span id="s74">And that's how we earned our bread and water.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: How did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Well, we lived... You see, they had those wooden houses that their prisoners lived.</span> <span id="s77">So they took them someplace else, and they gave those houses to us.</span> <span id="s78">And, of course, we used to cut our own wood for heating the house--which was one house...was one big room, and like two families would live.</span> <span id="s79">So we would build, like against the wall, benches; you know, from wall to wall.</span> <span id="s80">And we slept one next to another.</span> <span id="s81">First of all, it kept warm; and it saved room, because there was no room.</span> <span id="s82">And there we would go...like we would melt the snow for cooking.</span> <span id="s83">Cooking consisted of... I mean, if you got a pound of uh corn kernels, so we used to grind it and it became flour.</span> <span id="s84">And you boiled the water.</span> <span id="s85">So...in order it should be a lot.</span> <span id="s86">I mean, it was like 20 people; and everybody should get a spoonful.</span> <span id="s87">So it got thick.</span> <span id="s88">And you know, you would just look at; and it should get thicker and thicker, you hoped.</span> <span id="s89">If you didn't add water, so it got thicker.</span> <span id="s90">And everybody would, you know, just get a spoonful and eat.</span> <span id="s91">And that's what kept us going...kept us going, with the hope that some day, you know, that the war will finish and we'll go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s92">Hoping!</span> <span id="s93">But when we got back to Poland, forget it!</span> <span id="s94">We didn't even go even to our town.</span> <span id="s95">We didn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Let's hold Poland and stay in Siberia.</span> <span id="s97">We have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s99">Well, Siberia, we worked.</span> <span id="s100">A lot of people...we didn't have any meat.</span> <span id="s101">So a lot of...when the sun went down, the light disappeared, they got blind.</span> <span id="s102">I mean, from lack of vitamins, I suppose.</span> <span id="s103">If you don't eat meat, you don't have some kind of vitamin and you get blind.</span> <span id="s104">So as soon the sun would set, they would get like...and they would walk around like mummies.</span> <span id="s105">And they would say, you know, "Please take me here..." And young people.</span> <span id="s106">But they didn't have the meat.</span> <span id="s107">They didn't have all those vitamins that one needs.</span> <span id="s108">And my brother was like this, you know; so we had to take him.</span> <span id="s109">But during the day, he was all right.</span> <span id="s110">The minute it got a little darker, forget it!</span> <span id="s111">They went blind.</span> <span id="s112">I don't know what it was...what would you call it.</span> <span id="s113">But that's what happened.</span> <span id="s114">And, of course, what, uh... You know, it was very cold there.</span> <span id="s115">And in the summer and the spring, like we would go in the woods, there was a lot of... We had to wear veils over our faces, because there were big mosquitos.</span> <span id="s116">And if you got bitten by those mosquitos, a lot of people went crazy.</span> <span id="s117">Crazy, simply crazy; because I don't know what they had in them.</span> <span id="s118">So they gave us masks, and that's how we used to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: How were you treated by the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Well, uh we were not harassed, because... Well, first of all, we were like in a camp.</span> <span id="s121">It was only people that were taken, like myself, from...you know, from Poland or whatever.</span> <span id="s122">And they put there.</span> <span id="s123">And we didn't see too many people that lived there, because all we saw is the one that .</span> <span id="s124">How do you say it?</span> <span id="s125">I forgot.</span> <span id="s126">My husband tells me.</span> <span id="s127">(Laughter).</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: The prisoners.</span> <span id="s130">Prisoners, that's right.</span> <span id="s131">So we would see the prisoners when they came from a different prison.</span> <span id="s132">And my father used to cook the water for them, you know.</span> <span id="s133">It was a job.</span> <span id="s134">The cook had water.</span> <span id="s135">So he used to cook the hot water, and he used to put them with a cup; and he used to give each one a cupful of water.</span> <span id="s136">I mean, that was the disgusting thing.</span> <span id="s137">Just that, water--to share water.</span> <span id="s138">And you would get a piece of bread, and you would soak it; and they would eat it.</span> <span id="s139">So these are the people actually we saw during the day.</span> <span id="s140">And at night, we used to be among ourselves.</span> <span id="s141">Family would always sit and dream and hope and pray that some day this will end, and some day we'll go home someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Were you all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s144">Yes.</span> <span id="s145">We were all together; and with barbed wires, of course, you could not say, "Oh, I don't like it here and I am going to go to a bigger town."</span> <span id="s146">Of course, you couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s147">We didn't run off.</span> <span id="s148">As a matter of fact, my brother did.</span> <span id="s149">My brother was very strong, young.</span> <span id="s150">And he did try to go away to a bigger town.</span> <span id="s151">They did catch him.</span> <span id="s152">They did bring him back.</span> <span id="s153">I mean, they didn't do anything to him.</span> <span id="s154">They just committed him to a crazy hospital.</span> <span id="s155">They told him that he is crazy, because he decided to run away.</span> <span id="s156">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What happened to him in the hospital?</span> <span id="s158">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well, they kept him and they gave him some medication.</span> <span id="s160">And he did play along.</span> <span id="s161">He was very smart.</span> <span id="s162">He said, "Listen, if they think I am crazy.</span> <span id="s163">First of all, it keeps me out, you know, from the taiga, from the cutting the wood.</span> <span id="s164">So let me be crazy."</span> <span id="s165">And then if... Later on, he went back to the... I mean, they let him out.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, they didn't harm him or anything.</span> <span id="s167">They didn't physically abuse him.</span> <span id="s168">No way.</span> <span id="s169">But it was not a place for us to be.</span> <span id="s170">In a..</span> <span id="s171">.</span> <span id="s172">in a way, it was good for us.</span> <span id="s173">We didn't know at that time; but, you know, fate works in different ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did you have much contact with Russian guards?</span> <span id="s175">How were you guarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, uh there were not too many guards.</span> <span id="s177">There were just only by the main gate.</span> <span id="s178">Because behind you were the taiga, were Siberia.</span> <span id="s179">You couldn't run there in the woods.</span> <span id="s180">Where you gonna go?</span> <span id="s181">You gonna die there with the wolves.</span> <span id="s182">So the only thing, you had the front; and the front was the Russian guard.</span> <span id="s183">And that's about it.</span> <span id="s184">And you had no money.</span> <span id="s185">You couldn't go no place.</span> <span id="s186">So you just had to stick to one place with everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: We were there for about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s189">And then when the war started between Russia and...and Germany, that's when they liberated us.</span> <span id="s190">And they told us we could go wherever we want to go; but they told all the young men--the Polish, we were Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s191">So they told them they could register and go with the Russian Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Army--to fight against the Germans.</span> <span id="s192">Which my two brothers did.</span> <span id="s193">And we went to Kazakhstan, which is a warm climate.</span> <span id="s194">Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan is near Iran.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Well, we... At that time, we had some...they did... The Red Cross said...being we were Polish citizens, they did send us some sugar, tea, flour.</span> <span id="s197">So, of course, we didn't need it.</span> <span id="s198">My mother sold it.</span> <span id="s199">And for this, we got money to get tickets to get out of there from Siberia.</span> <span id="s200">You know, just to get away.</span> <span id="s201">Food was... You know, food was... You know, you could get a little hungry; once you get out of the place that you don't want to be, you could always pick up something...did something different.</span> <span id="s202">So we got there in Tashkent, and we worked very hard.</span> <span id="s203">Which we didn't need any clothes.</span> <span id="s204">We didn't need any shoes.</span> <span id="s205">We didn't need anything.</span> <span id="s206">And we waited there for the war to be over and to go home again.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s208">You didn't just...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Well, there was also a big community.</span> <span id="s210">Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s211">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army.</span> <span id="s212">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much room, so many shoes.</span> <span id="s213">Because my brother once worked in a bakery; so he used to work at night.</span> <span id="s214">So we had only one pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s215">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older.</span> <span id="s216">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes.</span> <span id="s217">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes.</span> <span id="s218">So...but I used to work.</span> <span id="s219">We used to cut saxaul (ph) all day.</span> <span id="s220">Grows a certain branch over there, it's called saxhaul (ph).</span> <span id="s221">And this is like corn, you know.</span> <span id="s222">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government.</span> <span id="s223">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive.</span> <span id="s224">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to Germany, he would send a package to us.</span> <span id="s225">It was already after the war.</span> <span id="s226">So we should survive.</span> <span id="s227">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go home.</span> <span id="s228">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: You could save money?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well, we could...just for the train ride; because they wouldn't give it to you.</span> <span id="s231">So instead to buy a pair of shoes or a coat, or even something eat good, we had to have the money to get home.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What were living conditions like in Tashkent?</span> <span id="s233">Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Well, we had a..</span> <span id="s235">.</span> <span id="s236">those house... We built our own house, so to speak.</span> <span id="s237">You know, we would dig earth with straw and--yah, cow manure.</span> <span id="s238">I mean, manure from a cow.</span> <span id="s239">And you step on it...you know, with water.</span> <span id="s240">And then you make forms, and you make brick from it.</span> <span id="s241">And this would lay like maybe 4 weeks in the sun...in the sun... Being as tropical...you know, tropical climate, it dries.</span> <span id="s242">And this was...we made bricks, and we would build a house.</span> <span id="s243">And then we would make a room...a house...a room.</span> <span id="s244">That's about it.</span> <span id="s245">And then we would make a roof from the straw.</span> <span id="s246">And that's it.</span> <span id="s247">So if it got cooler, we would sleep inside; but during the summer, we would sleep outside on mats, straw mats.</span> <span id="s248">Because natives even there, that's how they live.</span> <span id="s249">The Uzbeks, that's how they live.</span> <span id="s250">They sleep outside.</span> <span id="s251">They eat on the ground.</span> <span id="s252">So we tried to imitate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Speaking of the Uzbecks, what were your relationships like with them?</span> <span id="s254">The Russians?</span> <span id="s255">What was the relationship with the Uzbeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Well, we didn't see too many.</span> <span id="s257">Not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s258">Well, the Uzbeks are... Well, first of all, we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian.</span> <span id="s259">We spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s260">They don't.</span> <span id="s261">And they are very family-oriented.</span> <span id="s262">So they were together, and they were farmers.</span> <span id="s263">And they grow over there melons, all kind of melons.</span> <span id="s264">And we lived on the melons.</span> <span id="s265">We did get a little piece of garden, and we used to grow melons.</span> <span id="s266">And uh that's how we lived.</span> <span id="s267">They showed us.</span> <span id="s268">They were very nice to us, the Uzbeks.</span> <span id="s269">And they showed us how to grow, because we didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s270">And here again, we waited to go home.</span> <span id="s271">(laughter) It was one line, but then they started... A lot of Russians came when Germany started to come into Russia, you know.</span> <span id="s272">They started to occupy Russia.</span> <span id="s273">They had a lot of Russia people coming from Kiev, [from] Moscow.</span> <span id="s274">They used to bring the women, the children; and the men used to go to the front.</span> <span id="s275">So that's when we saw a lot of Russian people there.</span> <span id="s276">But everybody was hungry there.</span> <span id="s277">Even they were hungry.</span> <span id="s278">Because there was not too much.</span> <span id="s279">There was... Everybody had to stay with that 400 gram of bread, even the people that were born there.</span> <span id="s280">And that's sad.</span> <span id="s281">So that's what it is.</span> <span id="s282">But, of course, what my husband went through... It's... You cannot... But we had, because every time like... You know, every time my sister, she would have a dress.</span> <span id="s283">And then she would see--because she was the oldest--she would see that us kids that we were hungry or something.</span> <span id="s284">So she would take off that dress and go on the market.</span> <span id="s285">And sell it, and get--sell it for bread, not money.</span> <span id="s286">And bring home a little bread.</span> <span id="s287">So then, after a year and a half, there was nothing to sell no more.</span> <span id="s288">And she got... (Laughing) You know, she was left with her petticoat, so to speak.</span> <span id="s289">But, Thank God, we all survived.</span> <span id="s290">I..</span> <span id="s291">.</span> <span id="s292">my sisters and brothers live in Brooklyn, and we are happy to be in America.</span> <span id="s293">What can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Tell me about the end of the war.</span> <span id="s295">Your parents were with you this whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes, we were all the time together.</span> <span id="s297">All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: How did they fare with all this travelling?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, of course, it was my parents were not old.</span> <span id="s300">They were older; but those years... You know, European people, they were not as old in years, but they looked older.</span> <span id="s301">It was...it was very hard, because they had to constantly take care of children.</span> <span id="s302">We were young children.</span> <span id="s303">But we tried to uh help them out as much as we could.</span> <span id="s304">Because uh, you know, they couldn't work.</span> <span id="s305">So we did work.</span> <span id="s306">We...my sisters ...my...whatever we could.</span> <span id="s307">Even to go out to dig a ditch or pick cotton.</span> <span id="s308">We used to pick cotton.</span> <span id="s309">Or do something.</span> <span id="s310">Just to earn some money.</span> <span id="s311">And like the mother: you do have respect for your mother and father, you know.</span> <span id="s312">They were home.</span> <span id="s313">Even though my father, when we lived in a place where there was a lot of Jewish people, he would teach them Hebrew.</span> <span id="s314">He would teach them Jewish.</span> <span id="s315">He spoke very good Russian, very good Polish.</span> <span id="s316">So he would [teach] the younger people... You see, we always somehow wanted to learn, no matter how.</span> <span id="s317">Not myself just.</span> <span id="s318">I think all the Jewish people are like this.</span> <span id="s319">No matter where they are, and what kind of thing, they always... something, you know.</span> <span id="s320">But among other things, you have to learn something, too--about the world, about books, about this.</span> <span id="s321">So my father had a job.</span> <span id="s322">A little job.</span> <span id="s323">Let's say, if I had a child and I wanted him to learn Jewish--because there was no facility otherwise--so I would give him a piece of bread, a pot of pickles, or whatever.</span> <span id="s324">And he would teach the children.</span> <span id="s325">So he got himself... He loved it.</span> <span id="s326">And he was very proud of it; because when he used to come home, he said, "You know, this child, he is so smart.</span> <span id="s327">He will someday be a good Jew."</span> <span id="s328">You know, he predicted it.</span> <span id="s329">And uh that's how we survived, and again hoping to go home.</span> <span id="s330">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: One more question.</span> <span id="s332">Was there in Tashkent... You're a small group of Jews.</span> <span id="s333">Did you form a sort of a mini-Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s335">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s336">We did.</span> <span id="s337">There weren't too many.</span> <span id="s338">Must have been around maybe 30 families.</span> <span id="s339">You know, but each family had 3 or 4 children.</span> <span id="s340">I mean, my father and my mother was a family; and they had 5 children.</span> <span id="s341">Or, like my brothers weren't with us because they were in the Army, you know--with the Russians in the Polish Army, fighting with the Russians against the Germans.</span> <span id="s342">But, of course, we formed .</span> <span id="s343">I was only 15.</span> <span id="s344">We formed...we were singing, we were dancing.</span> <span id="s345">I used to... I mean, I would have a pair of slippers made.</span> <span id="s346">Over there, you don't go in the store and buy.</span> <span id="s347">Somebody made a pair of slippers.</span> <span id="s348">Which is... I mean, like ballet slippers--no bottom or anything.</span> <span id="s349">But this is gold.</span> <span id="s350">I mean, this was something to have!</span> <span id="s351">And I was young, and I used to love to dance.</span> <span id="s352">So during the day, I would walk around barefooted.</span> <span id="s353">I would not use my slippers.</span> <span id="s354">But that's the slippers I would save for my...at night, to go dancing with my friends.</span> <span id="s355">We would sing Jewish, Polish--because this was my language at that... I was educated in Polish.</span> <span id="s356">And uh we would try to stick together.</span> <span id="s357">You know, you just wait and maybe... You know, and people would have some news what's going on.</span> <span id="s358">Of course, basically, you would talk about the war, what's happening.</span> <span id="s359">And then, later on, you got to know and to learn that people are being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: How did you hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: How did you hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Well, uh I don't know.</span> <span id="s364">People used to come, like the Russians with their... Now I know.</span> <span id="s365">The people that came from Odessa, [from] Kiev--the Russians.</span> <span id="s366">Because they were evacuated to us, to Tashkent.</span> <span id="s367">They brought them over.</span> <span id="s368">So they would tell us what's happening.</span> <span id="s369">A lot of the Jews was among them, and they would tell us what was happening there.</span> <span id="s370">What...no paper or anything.</span> <span id="s371">The only thing is we knew that uh if you read... I mean, there was no radio.</span> <span id="s372">There was a radio like the main radio on the street; and if you walked, you listened.</span> <span id="s373">I didn't know anybody that had a radio.</span> <span id="s374">No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Tell me about the end of the war.</span> <span id="s376">What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, the end of the war... As I said, my brother was in the army.</span> <span id="s378">And at that time, when the end of the war, he just hit Breslau, which is Wroc_aw.</span> <span id="s379">Just Germany occupied by Poland, a piece of Germany that Poland took.</span> <span id="s380">And he was there.</span> <span id="s381">And he send us tickets to go home from Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s382">Go home to Poland.</span> <span id="s383">Uh we should come home.</span> <span id="s384">And, of course, we did go home.</span> <span id="s385">I mean, you know, it took us a long time.</span> <span id="s386">Months and months, by the time we get a visa.</span> <span id="s387">But being my brother was in the army, so they kind of had a little of respect for it.</span> <span id="s388">And when we got there, my brother was... Uh, we wanted to go to Poland where we were born; but along the way, you found out there is nobody there.</span> <span id="s389">My brother wrote us a letter that there is nobody there.</span> <span id="s390">"Don't even go there.</span> <span id="s391">You will just get sick.</span> <span id="s392">Don't go there."</span> <span id="s393">And he [was] stationed in Breslau.</span> <span id="s394">So he got us an apartment, and he... That's where we came, to his...to his apartment.</span> <span id="s395">From Russia to there.</span> <span id="s396">But along the way... I mean, we stopped coming from Russia to Kiev because we had...because this was Ukraine.</span> <span id="s397">Then we went...from Kiev we went to Lemberg [NB: Lwów].</span> <span id="s398">And uh we waited on the trains, you know; because you had to have clearance to go through.</span> <span id="s399">So you have to get some water.</span> <span id="s400">And the trains... I mean, it was not the trains...trains... It was a very uncomfortable trains.</span> <span id="s401">So if I would go down for water, to get from the pump some water... First my father would go down.</span> <span id="s402">And my father wore a beard--Jewish--so he encountered some unpleasant, you know, talk about him.</span> <span id="s403">So they decided, being I looked more like a Christian, not a Jewish... So I was sent out, and I would hear... They would say, "Well, Russia is giving us Jews and we are giving them coal."</span> <span id="s404">You know Russia took out all the coals from Poland, and they send in the Jews to Poland.</span> <span id="s405">So we decided this is it.</span> <span id="s406">We are going to go to America.</span> <span id="s407">And my mother had a brother...a sister here.</span> <span id="s408">And we started to find out where she was.</span> <span id="s409">And finally, we did.</span> <span id="s410">And with God's help, we came here.</span> <span id="s411">And I love every minute of it.</span> <span id="s412">God bless America!</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Tell me about how you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Oh, when I got here in July... Of course, he had to go to work right away to get something.</span> <span id="s415">I went to work, and then... I don't know.</span> <span id="s416">Must have been fate or something.</span> <span id="s417">I decided to go to a school, where he lived near the school.</span> <span id="s418">I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s419">On 90th Street [and] Broadway.</span> <span id="s420">And I lived in the Bronx, and I worked in Manhattan; but I went to school to 90th Street.</span> <span id="s421">Why?</span> <span id="s422">I don't know what made me do it.</span> <span id="s423">So I went there.</span> <span id="s424">And, of course, he was in a different class and I was in a different class.</span> <span id="s425">We were young, and we got to know one another.</span> <span id="s426">And that's how love started.</span> <span id="s427">(Laughter) Something, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s429">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: You're quite welcome.</span> <span id="s431">Thank you.</span> <span id="s432">Nice meeting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0131 page \* arabic4</span></p></body></html>
