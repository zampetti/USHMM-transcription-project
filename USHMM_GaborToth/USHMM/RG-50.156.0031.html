LANDGREN</span></p> <p><span id="s2">BY RHODA LEWIN</span></p> <p><span id="s3">January 26, 1987 Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is Rhoda Lewin, interviewing Bill Landgren, on January 26, 1987, for the Holocaust Oral History Project.</span> <span id="s5">Your name is William Landgren, and were you born here in Willmar?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: No, I was born in Ft. Dodge, Iowa.</span> <span id="s7">I’m seventy years old, now.</span> <span id="s8">I went to Iowa State College - in those days - it’s Iowa State University now and graduated in agronomy.</span> <span id="s9">Got a job with Pioneer Hybrid Corn Company, and worked with them until I retired here, back about five or six years ago.</span> <span id="s10">While I was working for ‘em, of course, the war came about, and I was drafted in February, 1942.</span> <span id="s11">That’s always one date I can remember.</span> <span id="s12">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Were you in Willmar then?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: No, I was in Des Moines.</span> <span id="s15">I was working for ‘em in Des Moines.</span> <span id="s16">So I was drafted out of Des Moines.</span> <span id="s17">Of course, when I was at Iowa State I took ROTC for two years in the field artillery, so I had some little background on field artillery when I was drafted.</span> <span id="s18">They interview you, and try to decide where they’re going to place you, and so I thought, “It’s a cinch I’ll get in the field artillery, which won’t be so bad.”</span> <span id="s19">So they interview you and then they pack you on a train, and they won’t tell you where you’re going, and so we were sitting in the train until after it got started, and then the sergeant walked down the aisle and I got ahold of him, and pulled his shirt sleeve and I said, “Where are we going, Sergeant?”</span> <span id="s20">He says, “You’re going to Camp Forrest, Tennessee.”</span> <span id="s21">And I says, “Is that where the field artillery is?”</span> <span id="s22">He says, “You’re in the infantry now, brother.</span> <span id="s23">You’re in the infantry, now.”</span> <span id="s24">(Laughs) So I was a “gravel agitator” all during the war.</span> <span id="s25">At Camp Forrest I had the opportunity to go to Officers’ Candidate School in Georgia so I took that, so I was a 90-day wonder and graduated as a second lieutenant in the infantry in 90 days, went to Camp Clayborn, Louisiana, and was there for six months or so, and then I volunteered for overseas duty, so I was sent overseas.</span> <span id="s26">That was in 1943 sometime, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And that was to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: We were just a group of replacements.</span> <span id="s29">So we went to South Africa, Casablanca, and then from there I was assigned to the 45th Division, which was in Italy at the time.</span> <span id="s30">So that’s where I started, in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So you fought in the Italian campaign.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Through the Italian.</span> <span id="s33">I was in five campaigns.</span> <span id="s34">through the Italian, and then we made an amphibious landing on Anzio - I was with the 45th Division which landed on Anzio - and spent three months there, and broke out of there, went to Rome, took Rome, and then we went back in a rest area, and then we were in on the southern France invasion.</span> <span id="s35">So we came into southern France in the amphibious landing, and worked our way on up to the time when we went into Munich, and then the war ended shortly after we went into Munich.</span> <span id="s36">And of course, going into Munich, we went through Dachau, and that’s how that happened.</span> <span id="s37">After we got in Munich - of course, there was very little resistance there - and they were shuffling troops around, they sent our company back to Dachau to spend a week or ten days until they could decide when we’d get to go home.</span> <span id="s38">I spent about a week there at Dachau.</span> <span id="s39">Just looked around.</span> <span id="s40">During the campaign I’d picked up an old camera - I’ve got it in here, a beat-up old thing - and we ran onto a boxcar with German photograph supplies.</span> <span id="s41">it was just all coincidence, and I picked up fifteen, twenty rolls of 35 mm film that they were using.</span> <span id="s42">They had to leave it and couldn’t move it.</span> <span id="s43">So I got a lot of pictures.</span> <span id="s44">I took quite a few pictures in Dachau and in the war in general, the last part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: I’d like to see some of those pictures when we’re done talking.</span> <span id="s46">Before we talk about Dachau, when did you join up with the troops that had come in on Omaha Beach on D-Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: We didn’t join up with them.</span> <span id="s48">We went up along southern France, along Switzerland, across the Maginot Line - there wasn’t nothing to that - then to Austria and Germany.</span> <span id="s49">We went through Nuremberg and in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Would you like to tell me now what you found when you went to Dachau?</span> <span id="s51">When did you arrive in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: It must have been in May of ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: How many days before you arrived had it been liberated?</span> <span id="s54">Were you the first soldiers in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I was in there about a half hour after it was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: What kind of reception did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: The first thing we saw when we came in was a train.</span> <span id="s58">It must have been thirty-five or forty box cars - coal type cars and enclosed box cars - full of dead.</span> <span id="s59">As I understand it, the Germans, as our troops were coming along, were trying to keep these people up ahead so that we wouldn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s60">That was really a pitiful sight, and I have pictures I can show you of that train and the bodies.</span> <span id="s61">They’re all dead and there had been a snowfall the night before, and some of them were covered with snow.</span> <span id="s62">It’s kind of a gruesome sight.</span> <span id="s63">Then we just followed that track into Dachau.</span> <span id="s64">And I’d just guess it was probably an hour or so after it fell.</span> <span id="s65">There wasn’t much fighting.</span> <span id="s66">The security guards didn’t put up much of a battle.</span> <span id="s67">When we came in there, we ran into a cluster of German dead, the guards, then there’d be another little cluster of ‘em, up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Who had killed the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: The troops that came in, and as I understand, there was a work detail of inmates working outside the wire enclosure and when the troops came in, they grabbed rifles from them and did a little shooting themselves.</span> <span id="s70">Now, that’s just what I heard.</span> <span id="s71">I didn’t see it, and I didn’t know for sure if it happened.</span> <span id="s72">It was possible.</span> <span id="s73">But they were all back on the other side of the wire, and I’m sure they knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Can you walk me through the camp?</span> <span id="s75">Can you describe what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I didn’t get inside the wire.</span> <span id="s77">They wouldn’t let us inside the wire.</span> <span id="s78">But the crematorium was several hundred yards away from the camp, and as we came in, as I told you, we saw these German security guards dead there, and we just walked on down to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s79">Outside the crematorium was a huge pile of bodies - I suppose twice the size of this room - and I have pictures of those I can show you, too, and they were all dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Twice the size of this room.</span> <span id="s81">I’m thinking, how big is this room?</span> <span id="s82">It’s about 12 by 15, and it has maybe a ten foot ceiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Some of these photos were starting to fade a little bit, so I’ve been keeping ‘em in the dark.</span> <span id="s84">Here, you can look at them.</span> <span id="s85">That’s the train I told you about seeing.</span> <span id="s86">You can see how long it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: There they all are, just in there dead.</span> <span id="s88">Fifty box cars of dead, May, 1945.</span> <span id="s89">And there they are, piled up outside.</span> <span id="s90">You’ve written here, “Russians, Poles, Dutch, Belgians.</span> <span id="s91">Ministers, priests, political prisoners.”</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: There were some Jews there but that was really not where they were concentrated.</span> <span id="s93">There were plenty of Jews there, but not as many as in some of the other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s94">Here’s the dogs that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And here are the pictures, you brought people from the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s97">There was a town of Dachau.</span> <span id="s98">I’d say it was two or three miles away, and of course those people claimed they didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s99">So they brought them out here and made them bring their wagons and their horses and teams.</span> <span id="s100">Inside the crematorium there was also a room full of bodies and they were starting to deteriorate.</span> <span id="s101">You can see how thin they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s103">Just skeletons.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: And one of them was using an ice tongs to pick them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: There’s the picture of the ice tongs that they used to pick the bodies up.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: And then they made them, with their wagons, parade through the town of Dachau with them and then I think they were buried in a mass grave outside of town.</span> <span id="s107">That’s the shower bath.</span> <span id="s108">At Dachau, they did not gas them.</span> <span id="s109">They were et up to gas but they didn’t ever use it.</span> <span id="s110">This old fellow here - this is inside the crematorium.</span> <span id="s111">I think there were six of these ovens.</span> <span id="s112">And this guy stayed.</span> <span id="s113">The rest of them all took off; they put ‘em back inside.</span> <span id="s114">But anyhow, he stayed, and just kept right on.</span> <span id="s115">That was his job, to cremate the bodies.</span> <span id="s116">He just kept right on doing it, and I says, “Can I take a picture?”</span> <span id="s117">He came down there and he stood by the door and he showed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You mean they were still burning bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s120">He was the only one, but...(laughs) This is what they fed ‘em.</span> <span id="s121">I understand they got a third of a loaf of bread two times a day.</span> <span id="s122">That’s the train that’s going to Dachau.</span> <span id="s123">Now here’s a shot of the inmates.</span> <span id="s124">Here’s one standing right by the gate there.</span> <span id="s125">He’s standing back there talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Could some of them speak English?</span> <span id="s127">Or could you speak some German?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s129">No, I couldn’t speak any German.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: So you didn’t talk to any of them.</span> <span id="s131">But you could see what had been going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Actually, Bill Borth said I was a liberator, well actually I was not a liberator, because I just came in after it was taken care of, and got these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: You said you were there for a couple of hours, and then you went away and then you came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No, we just came in there.</span> <span id="s135">I was commander of a machine gun, a warrant platoon, or heavy weapons company, in the 179th infantry regiment, in the first battalion.</span> <span id="s136">The riflemen are first and then we follow behind.</span> <span id="s137">So they were in first and took it, and I just came in with my company after.</span> <span id="s138">I understand it took about a half hour to liberate the camp, to get everybody inside, so there wasn’t too much fighting.</span> <span id="s139">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: When you came in were the inmates just milling around?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: They were all by the fence looking.</span> <span id="s142">I suppose they’d calmed down some.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did you look in any of the buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: They wouldn’t let me inside.</span> <span id="s145">This fellow in Atwater, (Glen Stranberg), didn’t he get inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s147">He was a medic.</span> <span id="s148">Did you try to give them anything to eat or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, we didn’t because there was an army unit that took care of all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s151">They’d come in already.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, that was when I’d come back.</span> <span id="s153">We went through Dachau and went on to Munich, and when that fell, and everything was taken care of, I suppose maybe a day, two days later, my company was sent back to Dachau, and we were billeted in these rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Where did you stay then?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: We stayed right outside the camp.</span> <span id="s156">See, I sent these films home to my folks at the end of the war, and when I got home I sorted them out the best I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: You didn’t stay in any of the camp buildings, you stayed in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: No.</span> <span id="s159">We stayed in kind of an apartment building.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: But you did stay there for one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah, I suppose it was about half a mile from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did you have any contact with the camp or with the prisoners then when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s164">All we were there was in case they had any problems, we were to help control them.</span> <span id="s165">Well, there was no problems, and so what I did, some of these pictures I took as we went through, and a lot of these, of course, I took after we came back.</span> <span id="s166">See, that’s the crematorium there.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So you sent these films home.</span> <span id="s168">Were you married then?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Your mother and father you sent them to.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: In Fort Dodge.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, when I got back, they gave me the pictures.</span> <span id="s174">They got ‘em all right, so they took ‘em down to the photographer and told him to develop them; they didn’t know what was on them.</span> <span id="s175">The photographer developed them and when he saw what they were, he made a display in his window, and had them stuck up there.</span> <span id="s176">(Laughs) He asked my mother if he could hold them for a few days and just put ‘em up there.</span> <span id="s177">So that’s what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Did your mother ever tell you how the people reacted to these photos in Fort Dodge?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s180">Fort Dodge is a pretty good sized town.</span> <span id="s181">No, she never said anything, but of course, she wouldn’t even look at ‘em, after she saw what they were.</span> <span id="s182">She didn’t want to look at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: That’s an understandable reaction.</span> <span id="s184">That’s one of the things I wondered.</span> <span id="s185">When you came back from the war, did you talk about these things, and show these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I had no interest, I made no conscious effort to remember what I saw, and when I got back I didn’t try to forget what I remember.</span> <span id="s187">For a good many years - I was married shortly after I came back - I was involved with my work and my married life and I was happy and I never thought about this for quite a few years.</span> <span id="s188">We moved frequently, and this book followed along with us, and I knew for a long time it was upstairs in the attic, and then I got to thinking, so I went up and got it and I thought, “Boy, I’m lucky all these things haven’t faded out and are gone.”</span> <span id="s189">So about seven or eight years ao, I suppose, I had it down here and I’d show it to some of the people who would come and visit - our friends around here.</span> <span id="s190">Dr. Hanson, the dentist up here, was on the school board, then.</span> <span id="s191">I think he was president of the school board, and he got ahold of Bill Borth and told him, “I bet he’s got some film there, some pictures that you’d like to see.”</span> <span id="s192">So Borth got hold of me, and we got together, and I showed him these pictures.</span> <span id="s193">He had one of the prosecutors for the Dachau trials with him, an attorney, a lawyer that was involved.</span> <span id="s194">Did you know about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Well, there’s a Bob Matteson who was there.</span> <span id="s196">And I think this was somebody named Hanson, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I believe that’s right.</span> <span id="s198">His name was Hanson.</span> <span id="s199">So they came and looked at them, and he wanted to know if he could take the book, so they made some slides from some of these pictures, and that’s what Bill Borth is using, in his class.</span> <span id="s200">And I’ve got slides here that he had made.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: You have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you ever talk to your wife and children about these things?</span> <span id="s204">Did the kids ever find the picture book?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span> <span id="s206">I’ve showed it to the oldest boy.</span> <span id="s207">I don’t recall that they had showed any interest in it.</span> <span id="s208">I never showed it to the kids.</span> <span id="s209">I didn’t care about talking about it, or going out of my way to discuss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: That’s understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I tried to keep in contact with a couple of my friends that I knew in the army and I did see one of ‘em here seven or eight years ago, he was at Rochester.</span> <span id="s212">He lived in Ohio and he was down in Rochester, he had trouble with arteries in his legs, and he had surgery down there.</span> <span id="s213">We always sent Christmas cards every year, so he called from there and wanted to know if I’d be home.</span> <span id="s214">And I said, “You bet your life I’ll be home.”</span> <span id="s215">So when he got in town, he gave me a ring and I was out working, but I came in and met him, and he stayed overnight and I showed him this book.</span> <span id="s216">He's in here, in some of these places, and we had a nice talk and we enjoyed it, and I’m glad he came, because he died at Christmas time that same year.</span> <span id="s217">I suppose that was three or four months after he left here, and he was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: You were in the service with Jewish soldiers, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes, I can remember one young Jewish soldier who was a medic.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: How did Dachau hit him?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: That boy, I knew when we were on Anzio.</span> <span id="s222">I also knew a Jewish officer, but I didn’t know him too well, and he was captured, but I think he came out of it all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Then you weren’t in Dachau with any.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Jewish soldiers?</span> <span id="s225">No, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s226">I’m sure there were some, but I didn’t know ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Do you ever think about, or try to explain to people or explain to yourself, how something like this could happen, or why it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Well, it’s hard to understand.</span> <span id="s229">When I got in there, I suppose it was almost three years that I’d been in service and I’m used to seeing dead soldiers from battle, but when you come into something like this, the train kind of hits you, you know.</span> <span id="s230">When you look at that train and they’re sitting there and you know darn well they didn’t have a chance, they had nothing to eat; they apparently starved to death.</span> <span id="s231">That’s what it looked like.</span> <span id="s232">That hits you.</span> <span id="s233">And then you see those bodies piled up there, and then there’s one here that looked like it was a little girl’s head sticking out of a pile, and that was one of the slides Bill Borth took, and he had blown it up so just the head showed, with the rest of the bodies around it.</span> <span id="s234">And it looked just like a little girl, but I didn’t think there was any children at all in Dachau.</span> <span id="s235">It all looked to me like they were adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: That’s why all the people who survived are all about the same age now, because if you were under fourteen they usually killed you right away.</span> <span id="s237">And of course, if you were over twenty-five or thirty you didn’t survive, for the most part, so it tended to be the older teenagers, and the young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Here it is.</span> <span id="s239">Doesn’t it look to you like it’s a girl?</span> <span id="s240">It may not be.</span> <span id="s241">But they blew it up and they were showing it in the entrance way, when they had the big doings here.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: That was in October, when you had the Holocaust program.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: In October, that’s right.</span> <span id="s244">And I’ll tell you, they turned them away.</span> <span id="s245">(Laughs) Thousands, you know.</span> <span id="s246">And Bill Borth came to me and asked, “Would you mind saying a few words?</span> <span id="s247">We’re just gonna get the parents together, there’ll be a few there, and maybe they’ll ask you some questions.”</span> <span id="s248">So I said, “Yeah, sure, I wouldn’t mind doing that.”</span> <span id="s249">It just got built up and built up, and he says, “Well, we’ve kind of opened it up to the public.</span> <span id="s250">Anybody who wants to come, that’ll be all right.”</span> <span id="s251">So they didn’t expect that many, but they came and they were standing outside, they couldn’t get in the auditorium, they were standing along the sides, they were standing everywhere, and a lot of people just turned around and went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Now, Willmar’s a town of 23,000 but is a much larger trading area.</span> <span id="s253">You’re the center for a big area.</span> <span id="s254">But why would that many people be interested, do you suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, I tell you, a lot of it is due to Bill Borth.</span> <span id="s256">His kids are really interested in it.</span> <span id="s257">He’s an excellent teacher.</span> <span id="s258">He’s just excellent.</span> <span id="s259">And they are very interested.</span> <span id="s260">In fact, his students more or less ran this thing.</span> <span id="s261">He turned it over to them and they took care of a lot of it and they were very enthusiastic and did a nice job on it.</span> <span id="s262">They’d go home and they’d tell their parents about it and their parents talked to somebody else, so quite a few people in town knew who Bill Borth was and that he taught this Holocaust class.</span> <span id="s263">So I think Bill Borth is the one that’s kept it alive and got people thinking about it, and he got me more interested in it.</span> <span id="s264">I did a little more thinking about it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Do you get any feedback from people.</span> <span id="s266">Do they say, “Say, I heard you talk?”</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s268">By the way, there is a Jewish family here - when you get to my age, you start forgetting names - but I know him real well, and he saw me on the street - this is several years ago - I think he heard it from Doc Hanson or somebody - he says, “Can I look at ‘em?”</span> <span id="s269">I says, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s270">So I let him look at the book.</span> <span id="s271">He brought it back, and he was real impressed.</span> <span id="s272">He thought it was awful and I can see why, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: But, now, Dachau was not all Jewish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No.</span> <span id="s275">They were in the minority.</span> <span id="s276">Dachau was the first concentration camp that was made.</span> <span id="s277">it was supposed to be a model for the rest of them.</span> <span id="s278">There was Jews in there, yes.</span> <span id="s279">But not like in Auschwitz or - what were some of those others?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Treblinka, Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s282">Those were probably mainly all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Those were extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: But this looked like an extermination camp, too.</span> <span id="s285">(Laughs) It’s really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So then, after you were discharged, you went back to Iowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I went back to Des Moines and started working.</span> <span id="s288">When I came back I thought, “I’m gonna take three months off and just horse around and have a good time.”</span> <span id="s289">So I went back home to Fort Dodge.</span> <span id="s290">My mother and father were by themselves, my sister was gone, and I was there about three days, and I thought, “This isn’t going to go.”</span> <span id="s291">So I called down to Des Moines, and of course that’s where my girl was - she’s now my wife - and I called her and I said, “I can’t take this much longer, so I think I’ll call down there and see if I can go to work.”</span> <span id="s292">So I called down and told the boss, and he says, “Yeah, if you wanna come ahead, we’d be glad to have you come back.”</span> <span id="s293">So I came back, and I didn’t spend much time at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: When did you move up here to Willmar?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What brought you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, I was a research station manager, and I was trained at Des Moines.</span> <span id="s298">They have a big research spot there.</span> <span id="s299">When I joined Pioneer, they were just kind of getting going.</span> <span id="s300">It was established by Henry Wallace; it was his plant.</span> <span id="s301">So when I came back from the war, they had a station in Pozyville, Indiana, and they needed somebody to go there.</span> <span id="s302">The guy that was there left and moved out and so I took it.</span> <span id="s303">We moved down to Pozyville and I didn’t like Pozyville, it was such a little dinky town so I moved down to Princeton, Indiana, which is way down right along the Ohio River, just across from Kentucky.</span> <span id="s304">So I was there for two years.</span> <span id="s305">And then they’d opened this station at Olivia; they had a research station there, and the fellow they had there, he didn’t like it, he said he was used to giving orders, and he couldn’t take orders from headquarters, so he quit and they wanted to know if I was willing to come back and I says, “I sure would,” because I didn’t like the climate down in southern Indiana.</span> <span id="s306">So we moved up to Olivia, and just like in Indiana, Olivia was too small and kinky, so I moved up here to Willmar, in 1950, and it’s been here ever since.</span> <span id="s307">That’s where I finished off.</span> <span id="s308">For a good many years I carried this book around and never mentioned it to anybody.</span> <span id="s309">But Bill Borth got me interested in it, and I thought he was doing a fine job.</span> <span id="s310">You know, if it wasn’t for Bill Borth, the town of Willmar by this time would’ve never even thought about the Holocaust, and wouldn’t know what it was probably.</span> <span id="s311">Some of these kids would know, he’s keeping it going.</span> <span id="s312">A lot of these young people are leaving this town and know all about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Is there a significant German population in the Willmar area?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: It’s mostly Scandinavian, but of course you know the state of Minnesota is more German than it is Scandinavian.</span> <span id="s315">There are German people here.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Have any of them said anything about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, Kamboldt, I think that’s German, they’re friends of ours.</span> <span id="s318">But actually, you can’t blame the German people of today, because they had nothing to do with it, and they think it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s319">After I retired, my wife and I took a tour of Germany and Austria and so on, and when we came into Munich, why the first thing when we were taking the city tour - we had a German woman taking the tour of Munich - and so when the tour was ending and she was standing outside the door and we trooped off, I walked up to her and said, “I would like to go out to Dachau, where the concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s320">I was out there during the war, and I’d kind of like to see what it looks like.”</span> <span id="s321">She says, Nothing out there.</span> <span id="s322">You’re wasting your time by going out there.</span> <span id="s323">All there is is a little plaque that says something about it.</span> <span id="s324">It’s all gone.”</span> <span id="s325">So I thought, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s326">So we went back home and we were visiting my son and his wife in Edina, and his wife’s sister was over in Germany - she’s a nurse, she was in Arabia for six months, and she was over in Germany for six months - and I don’t know how the subject came up.</span> <span id="s327">We were sitting around the kitchen table and I says, “When I was in Germany I kind of would have liked to have seen Dachau but they tell me there’s nothing there.”</span> <span id="s328">She says, “What do you mean there’s nothing there?”</span> <span id="s329">She says, “I was out there.</span> <span id="s330">They’ve got the barracks.</span> <span id="s331">In fact, there’s a museum out there, the whole thing.”</span> <span id="s332">Here are some of the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: She gave you the pictures she had taken at the museum and a whole booklet about the memorial site, the concentration camp of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: It tells all about it there.</span> <span id="s335">Have you seen that?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: You can have that if you can use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s339">It explains what’s in the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: You can make a copy and send it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: I’ll make a copy and give it back.</span> <span id="s342">And there’s the gate, where in German it says, “Arbeit mach frei” - “Work makes you free.”</span> <span id="s343">So you didn’t get to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I didn’t get to see it.</span> <span id="s345">Here’s the Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s346">There’s the division I was with.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: You were with the 45th Division, 511 days of fighting.</span> <span id="s348">I’ve heard other people say it, too.</span> <span id="s349">By the time you had fought through that much of the war, the impact of the concentration camps was not as great as it was for some civilian coming in new because you’d seen so many people get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I have the regimental history book, too, that they printed up, and I bought.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Does your regiment have a reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: The 45th Division has a reunion every year in Oklahoma, but I’ve never gone.</span> <span id="s353">One of my friends in South Carolina was the president of it, and he keeps yakking at me.</span> <span id="s354">I’ve seen him once since the war, and that was seven or eight years ago.</span> <span id="s355">it’s always at a bad time.</span> <span id="s356">It’s in August and that’s when I’m busy out here in the cornfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Are you working still?</span> <span id="s358">Or is this a hobby now?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s360">I was in Florida working in their winter nursery.</span> <span id="s361">The reason they do that is it takes so many generations of inbreeding on this corn before you can get the lines to cross to make the hybrids.</span> <span id="s362">So by growing a crop here and then harvesting it early and taking it down to Florida and planting it and doing the work there, pick it and bring it back here, you get two of those generations in one year, and so that speeds the process up.</span> <span id="s363">So about every other year I’d get to go down there, when I was working as a station manager, and spend three weeks down there.</span> <span id="s364">You get paid, and your expenses are taken care of, and after you’re through you have a few days to do what you want to do.</span> <span id="s365">Now they’re having a little problem; there’s so many of them around, the computer’s in and everything, there sits an administrative manager, so a lot of them don’t feel as though they’ve got the time to go down there.</span> <span id="s366">They send the corn down there but they have other people work on it.</span> <span id="s367">That’s one reason why I’m retired, but still, I’ve been going down there every year since I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Before I ask you another question about corn, I should ask you the last question I always ask.</span> <span id="s369">What did I forget to ask you?</span> <span id="s370">Is there anything else you would think about, something you saw, something you thought a out, some feeling you’ve had, some people you’ve met?</span> <span id="s371">Connected with this whole idea of the Holocaust and Dachau and people treating fellow human beings this way?</span> <span id="s372">Or just anything, just the smell, or some sights you saw there.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Well, what got to me was when I was watching them take those bodies out and the guy had to use an ice tong to pick ‘em up because they were so badly decomposed.</span> <span id="s374">It really is ugly to see the person must have suffered a lot; I mean, there was nothing but bones and skin on most of them there.</span> <span id="s375">It’s a different sort of death than what you see in general life.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Or even on the battlefield.</span> <span id="s377">Very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: The 45th Division, they were sent overseas and their first action was in Sicily.</span> <span id="s379">They were in the Salerno and Italian rout, which was a real battle there at Salerno.</span> <span id="s380">They thought they were going to be run off.</span> <span id="s381">And I joined the 45th when they were right around Naples.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So the 45th was basically, originally the Oklahoma National Guard and you were part of the replacement troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s384">The replacements come in and when they wound up - they were mostly from Oklahoma when they started - when they ended, there were very few Oklahomans in it left.</span> <span id="s385">They’d either been sent someplace else, to be with another outfit or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Or they’d been wounded or killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s388">So it was entirely different.</span> <span id="s389">It was made up from every place.</span> <span id="s390">There was quite a few from Massachusetts, and a few from Iowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: The reason I asked is because the Oklahoma Historical Society is doing an oral history project with survivors of the 45th Division who were liberators of Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s392">I have talked several times to Joe Todd who is working on that, and it’s a very small world.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Is that right?</span> <span id="s394">Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: You were telling me about 1939.</span> <span id="s396">You went down to Argentina.</span> <span id="s397">And you worked with some hybrid corn crops.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah, growing a winter crop of corn there, and this Graf Spee incident I was telling you about, those sailors were all interned in Buenos Aires, and they hung out in the Maxim Cafe, and I’d go in there, when I went into Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s399">I’d go there for dinner, and it was a big restaurant with a lot of tables and they’d be sitting there and a couple of sailors would come in and it was “Heil Hitler,” and then they’d sit down at the table with their friends, you know, “Heil Hitler,” “Heil Hitler,” all around.</span> <span id="s400">So I saw them a lot during that period.</span> <span id="s401">It was just the past and I just went on and never gave it a thought, until I got started here in the last few years.</span> <span id="s402">Well, like that German guide I told you about who said there was nothing at Dachau.</span> <span id="s403">But they’ve really had enough of it and they get sick and tired.</span> <span id="s404">This gal, I’m sure she was maybe three years old or maybe she hadn’t been born yet, when this all happened.</span> <span id="s405">So it’s kind of hard for them to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Have you read any books about the Holocaust or seen any films about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I read a couple of books down here at the library.</span> <span id="s408">Bill (Borth) got me interested in it.</span> <span id="s409">They have some good books.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: You can’t remember titles or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, I just looked under Dachau in the card index.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Oh, they have them catalogued that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And they were all in one section of the library.</span> <span id="s414">The war, and they got ‘em on other concentration camps, too, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s415">It’s a little section over there, and I just looked under “Dachau” and “concentration camps.”</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: That is unique, I think, among small communities, to have a teacher and a library that’s interested.</span> <span id="s417">Are there any other people around the Willmar area that you know of, besides you and Don Dean...?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, there isn’t.</span> <span id="s419">If I knew any I’d sic ‘em onto Bill Borth because I know he wants to get ahold of them.</span> <span id="s420">Not too many people were lucky enough, or I won’t say lucky enough, but fortunate enough, to have a camera when they were in there.</span> <span id="s421">Everything just broke right for me.</span> <span id="s422">I’ll show you that weird camera.</span> <span id="s423">it’s kind of old, a beat up thing.</span></p></body></html>
