location.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I have -- People, some of the people know me by four different first names.</span> <span id="s21">Why?</span> <span id="s22">How did it happen?</span> <span id="s23">When I was born, I was born in Lithuania, in a city called Vilnus.</span> <span id="s24">My parents were Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s25">They named me in Yiddish, which was -- the name was in my birth certificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish, began with the name Labe.</span> <span id="s26">Labe in Yiddish means lion.</span> <span id="s27">It’s a typical, Jewish sounding name.</span> <span id="s28">So, when we came to China, I was three years old and I -- when I was about five, I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian language and all the other subjects.</span> <span id="s29">I -- I didn’t want to say that my name was Labe, because it sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and other things, I didn’t want to be outstanding.</span> <span id="s30">So when they asked me what my name is, I said, “My name is Lowah or Leve, which in Russian means lion.</span> <span id="s31">That’s how I went through the Russian school.</span> <span id="s32">Then, when I was 17, my -- my father told me, said -- advised me -- suggested that I go to studying in a British school in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English language, which he said is important in order to get a job, in order to go ahead in life.</span> <span id="s33">So I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school.</span> <span id="s34">I didn’t want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name, because it doesn’t sound good.</span> <span id="s35">So I said my name, I became Leo, which means, in English, lion, same thing as the other two names.</span> <span id="s36">And that’s how I stayed, for many, many, many years, until, in 1948, beginning of ‘49, we had to leave for Israel.</span> <span id="s37">When I came to Israel, I was drafted into the army and when they asked me what my name was, I said, “Leo.”</span> <span id="s38">They said, “Well, you have to change your name, this is not a Hebrew name.”</span> <span id="s39">He said, “You, from now on you will be Arie,” A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion.</span> <span id="s40">So, that’s the same name and that’s how I stayed and I said, “I don’t want to change it any more.”</span> <span id="s41">When I came to America, Arie, my social security is Arie, my driver’s license is Arie, everything is Arie.</span> <span id="s42">Some people suggested, “Go on, change it, become Leo.”</span> <span id="s43">I said, “No.</span> <span id="s44">Enough of that.”</span> <span id="s45">I had some problems by the way, when I was working on my visa to come to the United States, I was in Tokyo -- I will tell you about it later.</span> <span id="s46">So, the -- the lady who was asking me questions, her name was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the American embassy, said, “What is this, how can one man has to have four names?”</span> <span id="s47">I explained to her, she says, ah, they don’t -- she didn’t -- I said, “I tell you what.</span> <span id="s48">I’ll bring you a letter from the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say that these four names mean the same thing in different languages.”</span> <span id="s49">That was acceptable.</span> <span id="s50">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s51">That’s how my name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And yet we know you as Leo?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s54">But I -- M-My documents, my checks, my social security, everything, everything I have is Arie.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: But do your -- What do your children call you?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What did your wife call you?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Leo.</span> <span id="s59">Leo, Leo, Leo.</span> <span id="s60">Sometimes when -- My wife also spoke Russian, it was -- it was Leve [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: So it’s all right if I call you Leo?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Of course it’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So if -- if you don’t mind, if we could just back up a little bit and name your mother and even her maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And where she was from.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Your father and any brothers or sisters that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s69">My mother’s name was Rachel, her maiden name was Rachel Schwartz.</span> <span id="s70">She was from a small place somewhere in Uk -- in Bela -- in Belarus, in -- in -- in -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s71">My father’s

[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s88">And now let’s go to your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: My children all were born in China.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And your wife, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: And my wife.</span> <span id="s92">My wife, Rebecca, she was born in -- in China also, but not in the same place where we lived, Shanghai.</span> <span id="s93">She was born in Harbing, which is another city in China.</span> <span id="s94">Her father, who -- he died very, very young.</span> <span id="s95">He was a soldier in the Russian army and they lived in Siberia first, in Russia, then when he died, they moved to China.</span> <span id="s96">And that’s where I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: She was Jewish also?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh yes, Russian Jewish, her background.</span> <span id="s99">Her name was Rebecca Lubarski, Interesting how I met her.</span> <span id="s100">She was a pretty young girl, about 14 or so, I was 17 or 18 and during the high holidays -- in Shanghai at that time, there was no synagogue -- during the high holidays, the Jewish community, our older people, got together and rented an apartment where they conducted the prayers for the Jewish high holidays, New Year and the Day of Atonement.</span> <span id="s101">And I -- I used to attend those services.</span> <span id="s102">At that time I was already working in an importing firm in -- they -- they gave me a job.</span> <span id="s103">I clerk in the office to learn the business.</span> <span id="s104">They were importing from England, from Germany, from Poland, textiles.</span> <span id="s105">Woolen textiles, there was a big market in China for textiles.</span> <span id="s106">And from England they imported some artificial silk, printed with beautiful red flowers.</span> <span id="s107">And it -- it was nice red flowers and I remember it.</span> <span id="s108">And then when I went to these services one day, I saw a -- a young, pretty girl in a dress with a red -- that material that we imported.</span> <span id="s109">That was such a surprise.</span> <span id="s110">And I looked at material and I said, “That’s our material.”</span> <span id="s111">Then I looked at her.</span> <span id="s112">I said to a friend of mine, I says, “That’s the girl I like to meet.</span> <span id="s113">I think I’m going to marry her.”</span> <span id="s114">And I did, six years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Was a very interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Did you go over to her that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, no, I didn’t go with her that day, I met her later in a -- in a organization for young Jewish people.</span> <span id="s119">We met and then I started to take her out to the movies, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s120">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: You had a courtship for --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Oh yes, for a long time, about six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Six year courtship, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I was 17.</span> <span id="s125">Because in 1933, or ‘34 -- ‘33, the firm that I was working for -- that’s the beginning of another series of events which brings me to Japan, you see?</span> <span id="s126">They send me to Japan in 1937, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: China to Japan, to open an office there.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: With your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, I wasn’t married yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No, wait a minute, 1936 they send me, I was married next year.</span> <span id="s133">‘36 -- beginning of 1936, I went to Japan.</span> <span id="s134">I got married later in 1936, came back to Shanghai, married and took my wife to -- with me to Japan.</span> <span id="s135">The reason why the-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it was a different Japan in those days, they started copying the British and the French textiles.</span> <span id="s136">They used to get samples from overseas and copy them in the Japanese factories and prices were much cheaper, so they said, “We want to import from Japan.</span> <span id="s137">Go to Japan, open an office.”</span> <span id="s138">I was only what wa -- what was it, ‘36?</span> <span id="s139">19 - 13 - 23 years old.</span> <span id="s140">I opened an office, I decided I have to learn Japanese because I’m dealing with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s141">I used to get samples, which I would bring to different manufacturers and they would copy it.</span> <span id="s142">Then I would export this merchandise to China.</span> <span id="s143">And then that was -- that was that period, that was ‘36, then my -- my -- we corresponded with my girlfriend -- my -- my Rebecca and then she said, “Well, it’s about time we got married.”</span> <span id="s144">Whatever.</span> <span id="s145">So I came back to Shanghai, got married, took her with me to Japan in 1936 and continued with my job.</span> <span id="s146">In 1937, after nine months of marriage, my son was born.</span> <span id="s147">Now, my wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was very concerned to give birth in Japan, she didn’t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she was used to her mama, you know.</span> <span id="s148">And mama was in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s149">So she told me, “I’m going to go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child.”</span> <span id="s150">I said, “Well, if that’s the way you feel,” I wa -- she was afraid, I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s151">I send her to Japan and there our es -- our son is -- early in 1937, March 29th, was born.</span> <span id="s152">She was in Shanghai, I was in Japan.</span> <span id="s153">And that’s -- And that comes another very interesting cycle in my life.</span> <span id="s154">Always in ways, my life is cycles.</span> <span id="s155">I was -- Because that brings me to -- to the Fuguclan.</span> <span id="s156">You know the book Fuguclan, you read it, didn’t you?</span> <span id="s157">Oh, the story of the jap -- of the Jewish refugees in Japan, what I was doing there.</span> <span id="s158">You know about that, don’t you?</span> <span id="s159">If not, there is an article here.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: I want you to -- to tell about it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Well, we’ll come back to this.</span> <span id="s162">I used to go to a small restaurant to eat over there, in Kovay, in Japan, 1937.</span> <span id="s163">And I needly -- I knew mostly all the foreigners that live at that time in Kovay, was a small city.</span> <span id="s164">Small, foreigner communities, some British, some American, some Germans, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s165">And I knew by face and by acquaintance, mostly all of them.</span> <span id="s166">I belong to the clubs, you know.</span> <span id="s167">So, I used to go to the small Japanese restaurant called Kovay kitchen.</span> <span id="s168">And I was there, one day I see new faces.</span> <span id="s169">Never seen these people before in my life, they are in Japan.</span> <span id="s170">It really was very rare that foreigners would come in those days, first of all.</span> <span id="s171">In those days you had no planes, you had to go by boat and as -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Was there a Jewish community in Kovay?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: A very small Jewish community which was established in 1939, two years later, I’ll tell you about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: But not when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Not when I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: There was a synagogue wh-which I attended.</span> <span id="s178">I used to be quite religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: There was a synagogue when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: But not -- You see -- You know what the Ashkenazian Jews are and the Sephardic Jews are?</span> <span id="s181">There were about 50 Sephardic Jewish con -- Jewish people living in Japan in those days, in Kovay.</span> <span id="s182">Jews from Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, North Africa, and a very few our people, which we call Ashkenazi Jews.</span> <span id="s183">You know, some Russian -- mostly Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s184">And we didn’t get organized -- we used to -- I used to go to their -- to the -- to the Sephardic synagogue every Friday.</span> <span id="s185">They were organized better than we there, because we were -- very few of us.</span> <span id="s186">Anyway, so, as I told you, I was in that -- in that restaurant and I saw three new faces.</span> <span id="s187">I sat not far from them and as I was listening to their conversation, they were talking among themselves Yiddish, which was a very rare thing.</span> <span id="s188">I got very surprised, and very excited, I came up to them.</span> <span id="s189">I speak Yiddish, I talk to them and, “What do you doing here, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s190">They said, “Well, we came here to open an office.</span> <span id="s191">We are from Panama.</span> <span id="s192">We have an office in Panama.”</span> <span id="s193">They’re exrom -- originally from Romania.</span> <span id="s194">They’re now in Panama and interesting again.</span> <span id="s195">You know the name Curaςao of course, the visas that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s196">They had an office in Curaςao, they had an office in Panama.</span> <span id="s197">And they were going to open an office because they were starting to buy a lot of merchandise.</span> <span id="s198">Business was really good over there.</span> <span id="s199">I said, “You’re going to open an office, what -- do you speak Japanese?”</span> <span id="s200">“No.”</span> <span id="s201">“Do you speak English?”</span> <span id="s202">“No.”</span> <span id="s203">“How are you going to operate an office?”</span> <span id="s204">“We speak Spanish, and of course, Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s205">I said, “Look, I can speak Japanese, I can speak English.</span> <span id="s206">I will help you to open an office, to hire people.”</span> <span id="s207">“Oh.”</span> <span id="s208">We’ll -- Became good friends.</span> <span id="s209">I was not -- not busy.</span> <span id="s210">We became very, very friendly and I helped them to establish an office.</span> <span id="s211">Of course, I didn’t want -- they offered me some money, I -- I refused.</span> <span id="s212">And we became very close friends.</span> <span id="s213">Three months later -- I think it was three months later, yeah, May, my wife sends me this -- a telegram, “I’m coming home with my s -- with our son.”</span> <span id="s214">That’s fine.</span> <span id="s215">So I came to the boys, I said, “Look, no more going around the nighttime to the nightclubs and then doing things which we were doing, young fellows.</span> <span id="s216">My wife is coming home with my son.</span> <span id="s217">Goodbye, good luck.”</span> <span id="s218">My wife came and I didn’t see them any more, from 1937 to 1939.</span> <span id="s219">In 1939, my firm transla -- transferred me back to Shanghai, with my son, my wife, went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s220">He was three years old, went to Shanghai and I was working there, in the office in Shanghai and one day I have a telephone call.</span> <span id="s221">The guy speaks to me o-on the telephone, he speaks to me Yiddish.</span> <span id="s222">I said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s223">He said, “Don’t you remember me, we -- y-you -- we were in Japan, we went together.</span> <span id="s224">My name is Max.”</span> <span id="s225">“Oh, how are you Max?</span> <span id="s226">What are you doing in Shanghai?”</span> <span id="s227">You know, in those days, this was not so simple.</span> <span id="s228">You couldn’t fly by planes, 30 days by boat.</span> <span id="s229">It was -- It was a different wor-world.</span> <span id="s230">He says, “Look, I’m here already three days and I -- I would like you and your wife to come.</span> <span id="s231">I’m in the Park Hotel,” which is one of the best hotels, “I’m here buying merchandise,” which he was shipping to -- somebody shipping to -- to - -to Panama, to Curaςao, “and I want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s232">“Okay.”</span> <span id="s233">“Come with your wife.”</span> <span id="s234">I say, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s235">Came with my wife, I [indecipherable] long talk, talk, talk.</span> <span id="s236">He says to me, “You remember there were three of us when you met us in -- in Kovay?”</span> <span id="s237">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s238">“Well, the third guy who was with us, was my cousin.</span> <span id="s239">He was managing our office in Japan.</span> <span id="s240">He was having a hard time, he didn’t know any English, he didn’t know any Japanese and he decided to go out on his own, to make his own business.</span> <span id="s241">We need somebody to run our office.</span> <span id="s242">Would you like to come and work with us in Japan?”</span> <span id="s243">1939.</span> <span id="s244">War in Europe just -- just -- just started.</span> <span id="s245">I said, “I’m not -- I have a good job here, I’m not intention -- I have a small baby.”</span> <span id="s246">So he smiled.</span> <span id="s247">Max was his name.</span> <span id="s248">He was about 20 years older than I was, a more seasoned guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: His last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Max -- Max Becker.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Becker, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: He puts his hand in his pocket, like this, I remember, in his pocket inside his jacket.</span> <span id="s253">He takes out a paper.</span> <span id="s254">It was an agreement, made by a lawyer, with me.</span> <span id="s255">He knew so well that I’m not going to refuse his offer.</span> <span id="s256">When I opened the agreement, I -- I -- I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s257">It was about five times as much money as I was making.</span> <span id="s258">It was tremendous offer, I got excited.</span> <span id="s259">Besides, all may -- sou -- may -- my expe-expenses in Japan, paid by the office.</span> <span id="s260">A car and a driver and a cook and the apartment, everything, beautiful.</span> <span id="s261">I said, “Shake.”</span> <span id="s262">He says, “One condition.</span> <span id="s263">I’ll shake hands with you, cause you see, this a contract between me and you.”</span> <span id="s264">I say, “Yes, what is the condition?”</span> <span id="s265">“Can you write Yiddish?</span> <span id="s266">All our correspondence has to be in Yiddish, because we don’t know English, we don’t know Russian, we don’t know Japanese, you don’t know Spanish.</span> <span id="s267">So there is only one way we can correspond, Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s268">I said, “Yeah, I know how to translate.”</span> <span id="s269">“You got a job.”</span> <span id="s270">And three months later, I left my other job, I took my wife, my son, Kobe.</span> <span id="s271">Kobe --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: That was you -- you went to Kobe now?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: That was in 1939.</span> <span id="s274">That’s the time -- you questioned about the Jewish community, we got organized in 1940 or so.</span> <span id="s275">I am working for Max, he’s teaching me buying, really tremendous amount of merchandise.</span> <span id="s276">Had about 20 Japanese, an office and -- was a beautiful job, easy, but responsible situation.</span> <span id="s277">The name of the firm was Curaςao - Panama Trading Company, because there was -- we were shipping goods to Panama, to Curaςao, to Peru, to Chile.</span> <span id="s278">South American countries with [indecipherable] everywhere.</span> <span id="s279">You know, it was a different Japan in those days, it was not a -- the time of wa -- Japanese radios, television sets, cars, etcetera.</span> <span id="s280">It was toys and textiles and shoes and -- and underwear and -- and -- and blankets and tablecloths.</span> <span id="s281">All those things we were shipping there.</span> <span id="s282">And he says, “I’ll stay with you two months, I’ll teach you.”</span> <span id="s283">Of course, I didn’t -- I didn’t know that merchandise, the pricing and everything.</span> <span id="s284">He stayed with me and that was the time, beginning of 1940, when the refugees -- the story of the refugees you know, they were coming with the Japanese transit visas, started to come in.</span> <span id="s285">So, my good friend -- later, I was working for him in Japan, Mr. Ponvy, he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: You worked for Mr. Ponvy and the same company?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes -- na -- at that time, no.</span> <span id="s288">I worked for Ponvy after the war.</span> <span id="s289">In ‘51, I came to -- back to Tokyo, that’s another story.</span> <span id="s290">He was a very fine man, a leader, an organizer.</span> <span id="s291">And one day he came to me on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s292">H-H-He needed a secretary in a Jewish community to -- of course, he didn’t know any English correspondence where we thought our organization, he says we’re going to get organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Where was he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: He was born in Russia.</span> <span id="s295">His name was Ponivairski.</span> <span id="s296">In 1941, beginning before the war, he emigrated to the United States and he changed his name from Ponivairski to Ponvi.</span> <span id="s297">Mr. Ponvi -- Anatole was his first name -- was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s298">A real leader, a real organizer and I was his secretary.</span> <span id="s299">I mean, not paid of course, just in the community.</span> <span id="s300">He says, “We have to organize the Jewish community.”</span> <span id="s301">There were about 20 our people, Russian speaking Jews.</span> <span id="s302">We made a meeting, we got together, we organized.</span> <span id="s303">[indecipherable] organize, the first thing to do, you have to rent a place -- a place of worship.</span> <span id="s304">That’s the first thing you do, and have an office.</span> <span id="s305">We’ve got to organize.</span> <span id="s306">Ponvi, he organized every -- he was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s307">I think one day, on a Sunday, I remember, he was -- he came to my house with a telegram in his hand in English.</span> <span id="s308">This was the first telegram signed by six names from Lithuania -- from Kalmus, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s309">German sounding names.</span> <span id="s310">“We German Jews in Kalmus, Lithuania need Japanese transit visas.</span> <span id="s311">We are on our way to Argentina.</span> <span id="s312">The consul here told us --” the consul was this man, Sukihara, “told us that we can -- he -- he can give us transit visas if Jewish community in Kobe will guarantee our stay here.</span> <span id="s313">Financial support, political standing, etcetera, etcetera.”</span> <span id="s314">That was in 1940, be -- be -- middle ‘40.</span> <span id="s315">So, I went with him into the police station.</span> <span id="s316">The -- We -- They were taking care of all our affairs.</span> <span id="s317">And we told them, here is a telegram, we -- they said, “Will you guarantee?”</span> <span id="s318">“Yes, we guarantee, we --” We had a stamp.</span> <span id="s319">We -- Already we’re organized, had a stamp.</span> <span id="s320">We guarantee.</span> <span id="s321">These people came.</span> <span id="s322">After about two weeks or so, they came with Japanese transit visas, but they had visas -- final visas to go to Argentina.</span> <span id="s323">I never met these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Now, these would be signed by Sukihara?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes, this -- these were the first visas Sukihara signed.</span> <span id="s326">Then, the Polish situation started when Poland, in 1939 was invaded by Russia from one side and by Germany from the other side.</span> <span id="s327">Many Jews from Poland, many from Warsaw, Krakow and other cities escaped.</span> <span id="s328">They were afraid of the Germans, they were afraid of the Polish and where could they go?</span> <span id="s329">Lithuania.</span> <span id="s330">At that time, up north in Lithuania, Lithuania was an independent country.</span> <span id="s331">And where you find Jewish community there who could -- who -- they knew that they would take care of them.</span> <span id="s332">And they started smuggling themselves over from oc -- places occupied by the Polish one side or by the German on the other side.</span> <span id="s333">And they went -- That was before Germany attacked Poland -- Russia.</span> <span id="s334">They -- It escaped to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s335">And then they started this Curaςao visa story.</span> <span id="s336">You know the Curaςao visas, on the strength of which, the Japanese consul Sukihara was giving them transit visas, which we started getting telegrams, 10 people, 20 people, 100 people.</span> <span id="s337">Eventually we brought, with those visas, over 3,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Now, before we go too far, I’m trying to weave in your own family life, alongside the story of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, my wife was -- we -- w-we -- when the Jewish committee was organized, of course, I was busy.</span> <span id="s340">After office, I used to go there and there were telegrams, letters, we had to -- I was the only one who could speak and write in English.</span> <span id="s341">There was correspondence, with Jewish organizations all over, and people started to come from Poland.</span> <span id="s342">And they knew -- especially the religious people -- there were about a thousand religious people, rabbis and students, rabbinical students, organized in different groups.</span> <span id="s343">They would come for all their problems.</span> <span id="s344">They would come to me, because I was the only one who could understand them.</span> <span id="s345">Young as I was, they would come to me and I’ll tell you some other stories which are very, I wouldn’t say comical, but interesting, because they had their own problems, in spite of the fact they were refugees.</span> <span id="s346">Well, then our women, our wives, including my own Rebecca, got organized and they started to help the refugees, they had children.</span> <span id="s347">Children used to get sick, you had to take them to the hospitals, they spoke Japanese.</span> <span id="s348">So, they were helping them.</span> <span id="s349">Also, they started collecting clothes.</span> <span id="s350">Some people came naked, nothing on them.</span> <span id="s351">They started to collect clothes and give it to them and this was -- in -- in the evening.</span> <span id="s352">Then, when we got organized, under Mr. Ponvi’s guidance and instructions, we got together and we rented a home, which we came -- on the ground floor was a synagogue, on top was offices and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s353">We hired some people, our women taught the Japanese chefs how to make good food, etcetera.</span> <span id="s354">And we were going there almost every day, especially the women, to play Mah Jong and to play cards and that was a social --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Was it kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No, it wa -- it wasn’t kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Now -- Now, in this same time period, did you have more children?</span> <span id="s360">When did your children come?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: My -- The next children, my -- my -- my daughter was -- was number two, was born during the war.</span> <span id="s362">I was in Shanghai already.</span> <span id="s363">I will tell you how it happened that I went back to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Now, as I told you, the firm I was working for, Max Becker, was Panamanian.</span> <span id="s366">It was a foreign company under Panamanian flag.</span> <span id="s367">And I used to talk to Max and -- when he was t-teaching me how to -- mainly to buy the goods and the qualities and you know, [indecipherable] a lot of merchandise.</span> <span id="s368">And he says, “I’m going, you are ready.</span> <span id="s369">I ca -- You can take it over.”</span> <span id="s370">Then one day I said to him, “Max, wh-where is your family, where is your family?</span> <span id="s371">Where is your father, where is your mother?</span> <span id="s372">You have any?”</span> <span id="s373">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s374">I says, “Where are they?”</span> <span id="s375">He says to me, “They are in Romania,” in Bessarabia, which is part of Romania.</span> <span id="s376">I said, “Max, bring them over here.</span> <span id="s377">I mean, look what’s going on.</span> <span id="s378">Hitler is marching all over the world.”</span> <span id="s379">That was before Russia was attacked by Germany, 1941 -- June of 1941.</span> <span id="s380">He says, “My father is an older man,” I don’t know how old he was.</span> <span id="s381">“He’s very Orthodox, he lives with my mother and my two sisters and I asked him many times to leave Romania, Bessarabia and to come and we’ll work something out.”</span> <span id="s382">He says, “Where will I go?</span> <span id="s383">I don’t know any languages.”</span> <span id="s384">Shows me letters, he corresponds with his father, in Yiddish, of course.</span> <span id="s385">“Where shall I go?</span> <span id="s386">My home is here, my business is here.”</span> <span id="s387">“What kind of business --” He was buying and selling some cows and -- and -- and -- and what do you call, sheep.</span> <span id="s388">And -- And I said, “Max, the ground is -- is burning under the -- under the [indecipherable] under the legs of our people.</span> <span id="s389">They’re Jews.”</span> <span id="s390">He says, “Look, I’m asking them to leave, they said they can’t go.”</span> <span id="s391">I said, “Tell them to come here to Japan, same way the other refugees are coming.</span> <span id="s392">I will take care of them and we’ll work something out, but get them out.”</span> <span id="s393">He says, “Look, I --” and he shows me letters he writes to them, was about six weeks before he left.</span> <span id="s394">He says to his father, “I still insist and I want you to leave with Mama and the two sisters, 15 - 16, and come here to Japan.”</span> <span id="s395">Well, so he -- His father writes to him, “You -- I think you ha -- must have gone out of your mind.</span> <span id="s396">I should go to Japan, an Orthodox Jew like me?</span> <span id="s397">What am I going to do there?”</span> <span id="s398">You know.</span> <span id="s399">I said, “Max, tell him, if he decides to leave, let me know.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t know how, what we -- I will do, but I will -- we’re bringing thousands of Polish Jews, we’ll bring them out somehow.</span> <span id="s401">And then wa -- I -- I don’t want to worry about what’s going to happen then.</span> <span id="s402">But get out from - -away from the Germans.”</span> <span id="s403">He writes the father, his father a letter, he shows me the letter.</span> <span id="s404">He says, “If you decide to leave, let Mr. Hanin know about it and then he will -- he will see his way to -- to bring you over here.”</span> <span id="s405">And he left.</span> <span id="s406">He left back to Panama and I was standing there and then Germany attacks Russia, in 1941.</span> <span id="s407">Russians occupy Romania, which at that time was independent country, Bessarabia, under Soviet occupation.</span> <span id="s408">I get a telegram from Max’s father.</span> <span id="s409">It’s in Yiddish, but of course, English letters.</span> <span id="s410">I’ll never forget it as long as I live.</span> <span id="s411">“The book that Max wanted to send me, I need it very urgently.”</span> <span id="s412">I understood.</span> <span id="s413">Well, how am I going to get him out of there?</span> <span id="s414">It’s already under Soviet occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: This is tape one, side B, Leo Hanin.</span> <span id="s417">-- Going to make a little diversion and --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, you can -- you can change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Focus on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Now go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: -- the family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: -- we go back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Second child.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: -- 1942, when the war started, ‘41.</span> <span id="s425">Have I told about that, I don’t remember?</span> <span id="s426">Anyway, I -- if I repeat myself, it’s alright.</span> <span id="s427">During -- 1941, December the eighth, Pearl Harbor, I was in Kobe with my wife and my son.</span> <span id="s428">I was working for the Panamanian firm, I remember I told you.</span> <span id="s429">When Panama declared war on Japan, the military came to my office, it was a Panamanian, enemy firm.</span> <span id="s430">I was not -- I was a stateless immigrant without any documents, without any citizenship.</span> <span id="s431">I had my permit to come to Japan because I was working there.</span> <span id="s432">Every six months I had to renew it and it was no problem.</span> <span id="s433">My son, who was born in China, but also stateless.</span> <span id="s434">My wife was stateless person.</span> <span id="s435">Anyway, in 1942, when Panama declared war on Japan, the firm became enemy firm.</span> <span id="s436">The military came and they put stamps on the safe, whatever merchandise I had there, whatever money, everything was arrested and I was left with-without my payment, without money, without anything, because, you know, it was -- it was running.</span> <span id="s437">And they said, “Look, you are not an enemy subject, but the firm you are working for is enemy, so we have to -- to take these steps.”</span> <span id="s438">They put seals on the safe and whatever.</span> <span id="s439">And they said, “You can do what you want.”</span> <span id="s440">And that was in December of 1942.</span> <span id="s441">In February, things were getting very difficult.</span> <span id="s442">Food was hard to get.</span> <span id="s443">Everybody was rationed, not only foreigners, Japanese also.</span> <span id="s444">And I remember so well there were rumors, fish is going to be distributed.</span> <span id="s445">So I remember so -- twice, I got up at four in the morning, run to get in line for the fish.</span> <span id="s446">By the time my turn came at seven o’clock, no more fish.</span> <span id="s447">It was a hard time.</span> <span id="s448">My wife, my child, who was -- Israel was at that time, ‘37, three years old -- four years old.</span> <span id="s449">So, I had family at that time in Shanghai, my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s450">My wife’s mother and her sister and other family members were in Shanghai, so they wrote us letters coy -- thing was more or less normal, it was just the beginning of the war, before Japan was bombed and all that.</span> <span id="s451">And we decided we’re going to go.</span> <span id="s452">I decided I have nothing -- I have to make a living somehow.</span> <span id="s453">I took my wife, my son, and we went to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: We lived -- My sister’s -- My wife’s sister had a -- lived in a very large ho -- house.</span> <span id="s456">And she just -- There was for her -- her husband, who was -- he was a French guy.</span> <span id="s457">And she had rooms there and we -- she invited us to stay there, sharing all the expenses, whether it was rent and food and everything, and that’s where we lived.</span> <span id="s458">And making a living was pretty -- you know, it wasn’t -- jiha -- it’s hard to explain, it was an open market, an open black market.</span> <span id="s459">You could get any merchandise from this guy -- this guy had this, you could sell it.</span> <span id="s460">And this is how we made a living, buying, selling, and it was going on all right.</span> <span id="s461">Organized life was pretty good, the Jewish community was pretty good and strong.</span> <span id="s462">We had our club, we had our synagogues, we had our libraries, hospitals.</span> <span id="s463">It was okay.</span> <span id="s464">And then my s -- my daughter -- my daughter Miriam was born in 1943, during the war.</span> <span id="s465">My wife said, “Let’s have another baby.”</span> <span id="s466">I said, “No, it’s hard, war-time.”</span> <span id="s467">She wanted it.</span> <span id="s468">Okay, she was right.</span> <span id="s469">Of course, sh-she is the apple of my eye now.</span> <span id="s470">She is looking after me, my daughter.</span> <span id="s471">The women are always more attached to their fathers than th -- th-than the men are.</span> <span id="s472">My sons are also good to me, I’m very grateful.</span> <span id="s473">Anyway, Miriam was born, we call her Mimi for short, in 1943 and then the war was over.</span> <span id="s474">Then we were -- we just managed.</span> <span id="s475">There was no clothes, there was a little bit of a -- I don’t know if you read about, or heard about it, the -- on the -- Ja-Japanese were allies with Germany.</span> <span id="s476">Under German influence, the Japanese military were probing -- were thinking of, under German influence and pressure -- there were about 20,000 Jews that escaped from Germany, Austria and Poland, came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s477">They could come there without any visas, they just would came -- be-before the war, including the 3,000 Polish Jews that we saved, brought to Japan and then they came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s478">And they -- the Japanese, under the pressure from the Germans, decided to take all these stateless Jewish Germ -- who came out in ‘37, and they put them in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s479">You heard about this?</span> <span id="s480">In Shanghai ghetto?</span> <span id="s481">They didn’t take us, they only took those that came before -- after ‘37.</span> <span id="s482">The reason for this, I still don’t know if it -- 60 years went by and why did the Japanese hesitated to do to us what the Germans did?</span> <span id="s483">After all, the Germans were already getting ready for the Holocaust you see, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And why -- why do you think 1937?</span> <span id="s485">How did they choose that date?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Who?</span> <span id="s487">Why did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: How did they choose the date, 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Who choose the date 1937?</span> <span id="s490">Oh, why the Japane -- because that’s -- that’s the date when -- when the Japanese and the Germans signed their military alliance, number one, and number two, many, many Germans, Jews and Austrians were allowed to come openly to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s491">They came by boats and they came -- except those that came by Japan, that we took care of, you see?</span> <span id="s492">And they put them into ghettos, from 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s494">So we’re in ‘43 and you’re in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: And that’s where you were when -- when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: I-In ‘45, when the war ended, we were in Shanghai, yes.</span> <span id="s500">And when the war was over, we were, of course, happy and relieved because some American planes bombed Shanghai.</span> <span id="s501">Not where we lived, but where the German Jews lived, in the honque Japanese areas.</span> <span id="s502">But that’s where they ja -- I thing American military thought, or whatever it was, I don’t know the reasons that they had some factories that were making materials for the war effort.</span> <span id="s503">Anyway, a few bombs fell in those areas and they killed a few hundred Jewish refugees, the American bombs.</span> <span id="s504">That was one of those war stories.</span> <span id="s505">And 1945, the war was over, the Americans came and I had in my mind all the time, China is a huge country.</span> <span id="s506">Now, there’s no more Japanese occupation, it will open up and there’ll be a lot of business to be done.</span> <span id="s507">So, I knew where my -- Max Becker and -- had an office in New York.</span> <span id="s508">I knew [indecipherable], and then five years went by.</span> <span id="s509">And I said, “I’m going to write him a letter,” telling him possibilities of doing business in Shanghai, and I suggest that we send this and this and this kind of merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: You had not been working for a company all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: I was only for myself [inaudible] with my father and my father was in the -- in the -- in textile retail business, he was selling people suitlinks for wearing -- woolen textiles.</span> <span id="s512">So, the first American plane I remember, with American pilots came, about 30 of them.</span> <span id="s513">I don’t remember -- they had a special name.</span> <span id="s514">They landed in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s515">We were so excited, Americans are here.</span> <span id="s516">And the Japanese were surrendering.</span> <span id="s517">We would rather they surrender to the Americans than to the Chinese, because we didn’t know what’s going to be with the Chinese.</span> <span id="s518">Communists were fighting Hatsunists, you know.</span> <span id="s519">Was a ver -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s another world.</span> <span id="s520">I wrote a letter to them i-in New York and I couldn’t mail it because there was no communication.</span> <span id="s521">So I mi -- took my bicycle -- in those days, w-we all had bicycles because cars were not -- expensive and not available.</span> <span id="s522">I pedaled to the hotel where I knew the American flyers were and I came in there.</span> <span id="s523">There was a big sergeant,, I remember so well.</span> <span id="s524">“Hello, Sergeant.”</span> <span id="s525">“Yes, sir.</span> <span id="s526">What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s527">I said, “Look, here is a letter.</span> <span id="s528">I have to mail it to New York.</span> <span id="s529">I can read it to you what I write there, because it’s in a foreign language,” it was in Jewish.</span> <span id="s530">He says, “I don’t care, the war is over.”</span> <span id="s531">I said, “I can’t mail it because there is no -- no mail yet, no communication.”</span> <span id="s532">He says, “We are leaving tomorrow for Honolulu.</span> <span id="s533">I’ll mail it for you.”</span> <span id="s534">I said, “Sir, thank you, how much this is?”</span> <span id="s535">“I don’t want any money.”</span> <span id="s536">Anyway, he took the letter, I was very grateful and then about three, four weeks, I get a telegram from New York.</span> <span id="s537">Already communication started to -- excuse me -- and he says, “[indecipherable] we received your letter and don’t worry.</span> <span id="s538">We’re old friends and we’ll send you the merchandise and you’ll be all right.</span> <span id="s539">We’ll send you and I will give you credit,” and etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s540">Anyway, to make a long story short, from 1946 to 1948, Max send me a lot of merchandise, open account.</span> <span id="s541">And business was fantastic.</span> <span id="s542">Was making a lot of money.</span> <span id="s543">Then one day, he came to check out.</span> <span id="s544">Of course he was sending me a lot of merchandise, I owed them a lot of money.</span> <span id="s545">Of course, I paid everything, everything was all right, under control, I had papers.</span> <span id="s546">Well, he wanted to see what’s going on and I don’t blame him, it was his money.</span> <span id="s547">He came, I met him and I don’t know if I said so -- if I said that in the old tape, about his parents, what happened to them, did I say that?</span> <span id="s548">You recall?</span> <span id="s549">Q: Th-They were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: They were killed by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: He -- He knew about it, he came, and that’s another story.</span> <span id="s553">Anyway, business was good and he says -- we continued it with the business and he went back to Panama and I stayed in Shanghai and everything was going fine until the rumors.</span> <span id="s554">First of all, the Americans left.</span> <span id="s555">The Shanghai international concession in those days, was partly occupied by the American Marines, by the British army.</span> <span id="s556">They left.</span> <span id="s557">And we knew that the Chinese are fighting, the Communists and the Nationalists.</span> <span id="s558">And we -- The newspapers, we got information that the Communists were winning the war and they were advancing toward Shanghai.</span> <span id="s559">No, in 1948, beginning of 1948, I was working and I was conta -- connected with one of the refugees that we helped to come from -- I made quite a few friends in those that we helped, you see?</span> <span id="s560">And somehow, they wanted to pay me back, I think.</span> <span id="s561">One guy asked me to work for him and they didn’t offer me any money, of course.</span> <span id="s562">If they did, I wouldn’t have taken it.</span> <span id="s563">And one was -- I was working for him, he couldn’t speak a word of English, but he was a very bright man.</span> <span id="s564">And he says to me one day, “Things are getting worse and worse, you know, the ja -- the -- we hear the Communists are advancing.</span> <span id="s565">They’re already in Nanking, which is six hours from Shanghai.”</span> <span id="s566">And they were all leaving.</span> <span id="s567">He comes to me and he says, “What about you?</span> <span id="s568">Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s569">I said, “I don’t want to go anywhere, I like it here.”</span> <span id="s570">I was making good money, I have a wonderful apartment, my wife, my -- my three children.</span> <span id="s571">He says, “You are going to go to America.”</span> <span id="s572">I say, “What?”</span> <span id="s573">And, in my mind --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Who said this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: One of the Polish refugees that I was helping him in doing his business, cause he didn’t know any English, there was -- he says to me -- and he -- he says, “You are going to go to America.”</span> <span id="s576">I sa -- I say, “I -- I -- I’m not going to go to America, I mean, I -- I don’t want to go anywhere, I’m here.”</span> <span id="s577">He said, “You are going to go to America, we’re all leaving.</span> <span id="s578">This one is going to Israel, this one is going to Australia, thi -- I’m going to America, I --” he says, “Come with me.”</span> <span id="s579">I say, “Where?”</span> <span id="s580">“We go to the American embassy.</span> <span id="s581">He took me in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: What year was this?</span> <span id="s583">A: ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: He took me in the car to the American embassy, it was still operation -- before the Communists occupied Shanghai and I got there application for a visa to go to America, which I filled it up and gave it to them.</span> <span id="s586">Then, the Communists started advancing and we were all talking, what shall we do?</span> <span id="s587">Business is finished, stopped.</span> <span id="s588">The Chinese are fighting each other.</span> <span id="s589">What to do?</span> <span id="s590">19 -- In May of 1948, the state of Israel was established and we were, of course, very happy, we were celebrating and then everybody’s leaving.</span> <span id="s591">They were -- were -- My wife says, “Leo, we -- we got to do something, we got to leave and -- three children.”</span> <span id="s592">I say, “Where are we going to --”</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Oh wait, wait.</span> <span id="s594">You didn’t mention the third child.</span> <span id="s595">When -- When did he come?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Oh, he was born in ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: In Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: In Shanghai.</span> <span id="s599">Yeah, in nine -- beginning of 1948.</span> <span id="s600">So -- And then our people got together and they said, “We were going to -- the state of Israel is established, we’ll -- let’s send a telegram to the newly established government there, telling them that we would like to emigrate to Israel, because nowhere else we can go.”</span> <span id="s601">We were stateless people, without any nationality.</span> <span id="s602">And we send them a telegram.</span> <span id="s603">And sure enough, they send a man, by the name of Mr. Yowell, he was a consul and they started registering us, organizing us, who wants to go to Israel?</span> <span id="s604">So, we went the first.</span> <span id="s605">My wife, myself, we went, registered ourselves and about 800 of us got together and they send a ship after us, the Israeli government.</span> <span id="s606">It was a Panamanian ship, under Panamanian flag.</span> <span id="s607">United Nations somehow got involved with the state of Israel and the United States, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s608">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Remember the name of the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s611">Wooster Victory.</span> <span id="s612">And we’re going, packed everything.</span> <span id="s613">And the Communists are still not in Shanghai, they came six months later.</span> <span id="s614">But things are terrible.</span> <span id="s615">Mobs of Chinese, hungry, no business, and demonstrations, all kind of things.</span> <span id="s616">I said [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Who was demonstrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Chinese people.</span> <span id="s619">They were poor, they had nothing to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Against?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Against themselves, against us, against foreigners, demonstrating.</span> <span id="s622">They were yelling in Chinese, I don’t know what they were yelling.</span> <span id="s623">Someone’s -- Banks had to close.</span> <span id="s624">Everything became very disorganized.</span> <span id="s625">There was -- Nobody’s in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Chaos.</span> <span id="s628">Nobody’s in charge.</span> <span id="s629">So, the Wooster Victory came and we were allowed to take out anything we had.</span> <span id="s630">I remember packing the piano and the carpets and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So, it was the United Nations that paid for the passage of everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: I think United Nations or was it Jewish or Jewish organizations, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s633">I know the flag was Panamanian flag with the -- with a -- captain was a Greek, the crew was Italian.</span> <span id="s634">It was a nice ship, but one of those ellessgees that was -- became a -- that could carry people.</span> <span id="s635">800 people it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And the a -- the -- most of the people were of what nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: It was the -- About 90 percent were German and Austrian and Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s638">The rest were us Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s639">And we -- we -- we went from that ship, the first ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: So you felt very lucky to have that?</span> <span id="s641">A: We were very lucky just to get out, just to get out.</span> <span id="s642">Also, another thing I had in my mind, I knew the relationship -- it was during McCarthy time, I think -- before McCarthy time, and I was Russian born.</span> <span id="s643">I wasn’t kosher, as far as the American government was concerned, because -- I also -- there was a time when I had a Soviet passport.</span> <span id="s644">I took out a Soviet pass -- because I had no papers, nothing, which I gave up when I came to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: You’re talking about the reason that maybe you didn’t get a visa to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I thought that if I stay back and become under Communist occupation, maybe at that time there will be difficulties to get a visa to go to America, they will ask me why.</span> <span id="s647">Why did you stay?</span> <span id="s648">Maybe you were sympathizing with them.</span> <span id="s649">In those days, it was a different way of thinking.</span> <span id="s650">I say, “We are going.”</span> <span id="s651">So we came to Israel.</span> <span id="s652">It took us about 52 days in that ship, Wooster Victory.</span> <span id="s653">We couldn’t go by Suez because there was war between Egypt and Israel.</span> <span id="s654">We had to go to Singapore.</span> <span id="s655">From Singapore the ship went to South Africa, Cape Town, West Africa, Dakar, Italy -- Italy, Marseilles, France.</span> <span id="s656">We were picked up by a Jewish ship by the name of Negbar, Israeli ship came and picked us up in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: That’s Marseilles?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: In -- In Negbar, in Italy.</span> <span id="s659">In -- In -- What was this, na -- not in Naples.</span> <span id="s660">Got a city in a -- in Italy.</span> <span id="s661">I forgot.</span> <span id="s662">They came after us, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: From Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: From Israel, a ship, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: So they met your ship in --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: They didn’t meet the ship.</span> <span id="s667">We came on -- on the -- on the -- the -- on that United Nations ship, the Wooster Victory, to Italy.</span> <span id="s668">And we had to get off the ship and the Negbar was already waiting for us.</span> <span id="s669">There was -- Somehow there was communication between people on the ship and they were there.</span> <span id="s670">They’re waiting for us.</span> <span id="s671">And in general -- I think it was in general.</span> <span id="s672">Anyhow, we came to Israel in 1949.</span> <span id="s673">Was it ‘49 or ‘48?</span> <span id="s674">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s675">‘49, I think.</span> <span id="s676">End of ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And may I ask you how you were treated as a refugee from China?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: They -- The -- That was the time where thousands of thousands of Jews were coming to Israel from -- those people who were remnants of the -- of the camps in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: That’s [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Ships were coming full every day, were coming from all ar -- and it was -- it was a -- most -- now, the Israeli government that time, just green and new, young, they were treating everybody the same way and they were just say -- they organized certain camps in tents by the thousands.</span> <span id="s683">They would put people over there and I don’t know about the food, because I didn’t want to go to the camps.</span> <span id="s684">I had enough money, I had small children.</span> <span id="s685">And we went to a hotel, stayed in the hotel and then we went -- I had some friends there who were there 10 years ago, went from China to Israel as -- as a -- pioneers They met us, they were friends [indecipherable] and the guys I went to school with.</span> <span id="s686">They helped us out and I had -- as I said, I had the money.</span> <span id="s687">And stayed in a hotel and bought a condo in Haifa and was -- took about three months that year it was built.</span> <span id="s688">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So, you lived in a hotel for three months?</span> <span id="s690">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Expensive, but had no choice.</span> <span id="s693">And one of my friends, he was a truck driver and he said, “Look, I have a good idea.</span> <span id="s694">A lot of refugees are coming in from Europe, from Germany, from Poland, fra -- those that remained alive and they need storage facilities, for they’re bringing with them -- they stayed a year or two in -- back and they were buying furniture and goods and machinery.</span> <span id="s695">And th-th-they’re coming in, they can’t put it into camps where they -- where they had the -- the -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s696">Tents.</span> <span id="s697">They have to take storage somewhere to keep it and we will organize a storage company.”</span> <span id="s698">And trucking and storage, I -- I liked the idea.</span> <span id="s699">He says, “I have a truck, you have the money, we’ll put it all together.”</span> <span id="s700">And we rented a hou -- a -- a warehouse and we started working.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Did you have a direct connection with Zionism at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Israel was -- is -- is a Jewish state, there was no need.</span> <span id="s705">I mean, the parties, you mean?</span> <span id="s706">The -- The -- The -- The political parties in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: I’m just asking a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: No, no, you know, you come to Israel, you are a Jew, you are an Israeli, y-you don’t have to become to any political, unless it comes to vote, you vote with this party or for that party.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: You didn’t feel pressured to be one thing or another?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s711">Nobody would -- pressured me, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s713">You had a very different experience, I think, from -- from a lot of people, that’s why I’m asking this from you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I see.</span> <span id="s715">Here again, you know, it was interesting.</span> <span id="s716">My time when I was helping some of these Polish immigrants, Jews from Poland, when they came via Japan, eventually, on my rone road, they would -- somehow I would meet some of them and they never forgot how kind we were too them, how good we were to them.</span> <span id="s717">And one of them is instrumental, I’ll tell you this story in a minute.</span> <span id="s718">I don’t know if I told this already.</span> <span id="s719">If I did, how I -- why did I --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: I’ll tell you, if you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Why did I have to leave Israel and go to Japan, in ‘40 -- in ‘51?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Ah well, before we leave Israel, is there -- is there anything else about your personal experience?</span> <span id="s723">I know you had lots of friends who helped you and you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No, they didn’t help me, because I had the money and I had -- I needed contacts and -- and [indecipherable] by the way, when I came to Israel, the first thing I did, I went to the American embassy.</span> <span id="s725">And I said, “I applied for a visa in 1948, would you please contact, and --” No, before I left Shanghai, I went there and I said, “I’m leaving for Israel.</span> <span id="s726">Would you please send my file to Tel Aviv, to Israel?</span> <span id="s727">They did.</span> <span id="s728">I came to Tel Aviv one day after we came there.</span> <span id="s729">It was there, and they asked me, “Do you want to continue on your work on the visa?”</span> <span id="s730">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s731">We’ll let you know, and that was it.</span> <span id="s732">I didn’t see them any more, until later.</span> <span id="s733">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Before we leave Israel, I wanted to ask you -- I know you have a -- a strong sense and had a strong sense of being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: But, how about the religious aspects of your faith?</span> <span id="s737">Did this contribute to a strong sense of your belief, your faith?</span> <span id="s738">Your spiritual life?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s740">I wasn’t really very religious, I mean I was what you call my heritage -- my -- growing up at home, in a Jewish home, big -- be -- my wife was a very for -- come from a very, very assimilated Russian family.</span> <span id="s741">She didn’t know anything about Judaism, very little.</span> <span id="s742">Kosher, forget about it, she was not interested and I was also not so much -- course, I knew, my children had to have Bar Mitzvah and that I followed all the way through, and -- but the big holidays, I used to take my wife, my children, we go to the temple.</span> <span id="s743">But at home, you know, in America, when you think about Judaism, I’m sure that you are aware of the fact that there are Orthodox Jews, Conservative Jews and Reform Jews.</span> <span id="s744">In those days in Israel, there was no such a thing.</span> <span id="s745">There was Orthodox.</span> <span id="s746">And for me it was a little strange, those people with the long beards and the -- I didn’t believe the -- I didn’t believe I belonged to them, because I was -- I didn’t ever wear a hat and -- and I didn’t keep kosher at home.</span> <span id="s747">I know my father would have been upset with me if he found out, but that was my life, [indecipherable] busy.</span> <span id="s748">Anyway, in 19 -- we were working, we had that warehouse and wa-was making -- making a living and until in 1951, after two years working, ‘49, ‘50, ‘51.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Living in --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s752">In what?</span> <span id="s753">A house?</span> <span id="s754">A condo, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Haifa.</span> <span id="s756">No, a condo -- in a condo.</span> <span id="s757">Things are not doing so well and I speak to my friend, my -- my partner.</span> <span id="s758">I says to him, “We’ve got to do something, because we are not making enough for a living.</span> <span id="s759">He says, “I tell you what we do, we have to go and buy a truck, another truck.</span> <span id="s760">And we’ll hire a driver and things will be all right.”</span> <span id="s761">I was in charge of the warehouse, he was in charge of the transportation, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Do you have any idea why, as you look back on it, why things were not going well?</span> <span id="s763">For everyone, or just for your business?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: It was beginning of a state that starts it to build itself up.</span> <span id="s765">And first of all, I didn’t know the language too well to go and get a job, you see, if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s766">I didn’t know Israel -- Hebrew too well at that time.</span> <span id="s767">Why didn’t go well?</span> <span id="s768">The economic situation was not so very good and people -- it was a different -- a different way of living in those days.</span> <span id="s769">Everything was -- food was very strictly rationed.</span> <span id="s770">You have to be a professional man in order to get a good job, an engineer, a doctor.</span> <span id="s771">I wasn’t -- I was a businessman.</span> <span id="s772">That’s why, I think.</span> <span id="s773">But, I was still hoping that things will be all right.</span> <span id="s774">Now, in the meantime, we were living in Haifa.</span> <span id="s775">In Tel Aviv -- I used to go there, about two hours by -- by car, once in awhile to visit with my friends and so forth.</span> <span id="s776">And one of my friends, whom I helped him in Japan.</span> <span id="s777">Very int -- I have to tell you this story, I don’t know if I told that, but it’s a very -- he’s responsible for me [indecipherable] yesterday.</span> <span id="s778">His name was Yaglem.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yaglem, a Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s781">When I was in charge -- when I was secretary of the Jewish community in 1940 - ‘41, when the refugees would come in --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: In Kobe.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: In Kobe.</span> <span id="s784">The Japanese police gave us strict instructions that refugees, they allow them to come for two weeks, transit, but we extend it afterwards, their visas, that they were not to have their documents with them in order not to allow them to travel if they wanted to go by train to another city, see?</span> <span id="s785">In Japan.</span> <span id="s786">And so, I had to have -- in my office, in the community, I had a big safe and all the documents, I -- we insisted when they come from the ship to surrender them, I would register them and I was looking through them.</span> <span id="s787">One day I look, Yaglem, Yaglem.</span> <span id="s788">We used to import merchandise from Poland from Yaglem when I was in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s789">And there he is, the same Yaglem?</span> <span id="s790">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s791">I started to check, “Where is Mr. Yaglem?”</span> <span id="s792">They said, “Oh, he’s -- he’s not on the -- this -- the community supervision, he’s a well-to-do man, with his wife and children.</span> <span id="s793">They’re in a big hotel and they are there.</span> <span id="s794">I say, “I’m going to go and see him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: This is Tel Aviv?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: No, that was in Japan.</span> <span id="s797">When they came to Japan, where we brought them from Poland, Lithuania, Poland, Japan, that was Yaglem among the refugees.</span> <span id="s798">Am I making myself clear?</span> <span id="s799">When I saw the name Yaglem, he was a refugee from Poland in Japan.</span> <span id="s800">I went to see him in a hotel.</span> <span id="s801">I came to the hotel, Oriental hotel, and there, I said, “Where is Mr. Yaglem?”</span> <span id="s802">“There he is.”</span> <span id="s803">And I see it’s a man, well-dressed, his wife, children.</span> <span id="s804">I came up to him.</span> <span id="s805">I said to him, “A-Are you Mr. Yaglem?”</span> <span id="s806">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s807">I says, “When I was in Shanghai, we used to go -- import goods from Yaglem.”</span> <span id="s808">“Oh,” he says, “that’s my factory.</span> <span id="s809">You imported from me.”</span> <span id="s810">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s811">“Oh, very good.”</span> <span id="s812">He started to cry.</span> <span id="s813">I said, “Mr. Yaglem, what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s814">What are you crying?”</span> <span id="s815">He said, “I lost everything, they took my factory away, and --” I said, “But look, you’re here in a hotel.</span> <span id="s816">That means to say that you have means.</span> <span id="s817">You are on your way somewhere, I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s818">You can tell me about it and if there’s anything I can do to help you, with paperwork, with permits, just let me know.</span> <span id="s819">I’m the secretary of the Jewish community, I can help you.”</span> <span id="s820">He s -- He’s -- We spoke and we became very close and he says, “I need to extend my visas for 10 days.”</span> <span id="s821">I said, “Give me your documents and I’ll take your documents.”</span> <span id="s822">And I went and I extended it for -- for a whole month and I did very good.</span> <span id="s823">Anyway, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s824">Then the war came.</span> <span id="s825">I’m talking now about 1940 -- ‘41, you see, when I met Yaglem in Japan.</span> <span id="s826">Then, he left.</span> <span id="s827">I understand he was in England during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Leo Hanin, conducted by Ginger Miles on January 22nd, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Okay, now?</span> <span id="s831">So, when we came to Israel, in 1949, I found out that Yaglem, whom I last saw in Japan in 1940 or ‘41, is also in Israel.</span> <span id="s832">I went to Tel Aviv -- it’s a small country, very easy to find people, I found him.</span> <span id="s833">When he saw me, he didn’t know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s834">“I’m here.</span> <span id="s835">I have a factory, a woolen factory.</span> <span id="s836">It’s already doing well.”</span> <span id="s837">He says, “If there is anything you can do --” I said -- he says, “Look, you helped me.”</span> <span id="s838">I said, “Oh, it’s all right, for -- don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s839">He says, “No, no, you’re here.</span> <span id="s840">If there is anything you can do, you’re a refugee.</span> <span id="s841">I’m doing well, I’ll help you.”</span> <span id="s842">I said, “Fine, fine, fine.”</span> <span id="s843">And every month or so, I used to go to see him in Tel Aviv and we were good friends.</span> <span id="s844">He [indecipherable] his family.</span> <span id="s845">Then one day I get a telephone call from him, from Tel Aviv to Haifa.</span> <span id="s846">He says, “Leo?”</span> <span id="s847">“Yes?”</span> <span id="s848">He called me Leo.</span> <span id="s849">He says to me -- we spoke Russian -- he says to me, “Do you have a partner by the name of so and so, Danny?”</span> <span id="s850">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s851">I never told him about it.</span> <span id="s852">He says, “Come [indecipherable] Tel Aviv, I have to talk to you about something very serious.”</span> <span id="s853">I said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s854">He calls me from Haifa to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s855">If he says, I am going.</span> <span id="s856">I came.</span> <span id="s857">He says, “Look, I have bad news for you.”</span> <span id="s858">I said, “What’s the bad news?”</span> <span id="s859">He said, “Did you people buy a truck just recently, you and your partner?”</span> <span id="s860">I said, “Yes, how do you know?”</span> <span id="s861">“Well,” he says, “how much you pay for this truck?”</span> <span id="s862">I said so much and so much.</span> <span id="s863">He says, “Your partner stole from you 600 pounds.”</span> <span id="s864">I say, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s865">He says, “How much did you pay for the truck?”</span> <span id="s866">I says, “3,600 pounds.”</span> <span id="s867">He says, “Well,” he says, “I was in a cafe in Tel Aviv and I heard three people talking between themselves and they mentioned your name.</span> <span id="s868">When they mentioned your name, I am there.”</span> <span id="s869">I said, “Look, you’re talking about Mr. Hanin, he was in Japan, he helped me and the whole story.”</span> <span id="s870">He says, “Yes, we heard about him, that he is a fine man and all that, but this partner bought a truck from us for 3,000 pounds and he asks us to make the receipt for 3,600 pounds.”</span> <span id="s871">And 600 pounds, which was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s872">In those days I needed a hundred pounds for a -- living a month for the whole family.</span> <span id="s873">He says, “Your partner is a thief.</span> <span id="s874">He stole from you 600 pounds.”</span> <span id="s875">My heart went down.</span> <span id="s876">I’m new in this country, just started a business, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s877">And I went back home to Tel Aviv -- to Haifa, I told this to my wife.</span> <span id="s878">“What shall we do?”</span> <span id="s879">I said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s880">I cannot work with him any more, he’s a ga -- he’s a -- he’s a thief.</span> <span id="s881">A partner, a friend.”</span> <span id="s882">Anyhow, to make a long story short, he was a smart guy.</span> <span id="s883">He found out that my face, he could read my face if something was wrong.</span> <span id="s884">I didn’t want to talk about it, I didn’t know what to do, until finally he says, “You must tell me what happened.”</span> <span id="s885">I said, “Danny, what are you asking me questions.</span> <span id="s886">How much did you pay for the truck?”</span> <span id="s887">He says to me, “Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s888">I said, “You stole from me 600 pounds.</span> <span id="s889">You’re a thief.”</span> <span id="s890">“How do you know?”</span> <span id="s891">And he ran away.</span> <span id="s892">I ran after him.</span> <span id="s893">I said, “Don’t run.</span> <span id="s894">Come, we’ll work it out, we’ll talk it out and we’ll find a way.”</span> <span id="s895">“No.”</span> <span id="s896">He came back, he says, “Don’t tell anybody that I did that.</span> <span id="s897">If you tell them that I s-s-swindled you -- some of our friends, I am going to report you to the police, that you changed some money on the black market.”</span> <span id="s898">Which I did.</span> <span id="s899">It was very strict in those days.</span> <span id="s900">I changed, you know, I had to live, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s901">He says, “I’ll put you in jail,” and it was very strict.</span> <span id="s902">I says, “You’re not going to do that.</span> <span id="s903">You can’t do that, that’s blackmail.”</span> <span id="s904">He says, “I’ll put you in jail, then.”</span> <span id="s905">I got scared.</span> <span id="s906">I closed the office, I ran to an attorney.</span> <span id="s907">I said, “What shall I do?”</span> <span id="s908">“Well,” he says, “you have any papers?</span> <span id="s909">You signed any papers with this man, your partner?”</span> <span id="s910">I said, “No, we did it by sh-shaking hands, we are good friends.”</span> <span id="s911">He says, “You’re a fool.</span> <span id="s912">You don’t do such things in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s913">You have to come to a lawyer, then you’re covered.”</span> <span id="s914">He says, “I’ll see what I can do.”</span> <span id="s915">And in about six months after he ne-negotiated with him and we [indecipherable], I closed the office, everything is finished, I’m go -- I go -- I ga -- I went and I got a job in the Israeli customs, I was a customs brok -- customs agen -- not a agent, emp-employee in the office in bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s916">Had nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s917">And the lawyer is advancing, talking to his lawyer and fi-finishing.</span> <span id="s918">Finally, he says we have an offer.</span> <span id="s919">Calls me up and he says that, “I can make a deal between you two.</span> <span id="s920">He keeps the truck, he gives me 600 pounds.”</span> <span id="s921">That was -- The trucks was worth 3,000 pounds.</span> <span id="s922">He’s stealing again.</span> <span id="s923">I said, “Finish, I don’t want to have anything to do, my headache is -- pay him off, let him pay me, whatever he’s do -- finish.”</span> <span id="s924">He says, “I do it.”</span> <span id="s925">And he gave me -- he signed six promissory notes, 100 pounds each, to cover it all up.</span> <span id="s926">I went to the soo -- this -- this promissory notes went to the bank.</span> <span id="s927">I had them discounted because I had to pay to the bank, I borrowed money for the truck.</span> <span id="s928">Anyway, it’s -- it’s an involved story.</span> <span id="s929">I’m sorry I’m giving you so many details.</span> <span id="s930">I hope it’s all right, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Oh, it’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: And I’m working on the customs, I -- I -- I left my house, we went on -- to live in another place, a small village next -- not far from Haifa, because friend of mine had there a washing machine.</span> <span id="s933">He was washing clothes for other people, he wa -- six machines and they needed somebody to iron the clothes, the pants and the shi --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: And wh-what -- what happened to the customs job?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: I was still working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Bookkeeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Bookkeeping, my --i-in Haifa --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: In Haifa?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: -- my wife is working on the -- on the ironing machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: In the Laundromat?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: I-In a -- We had our own place called Magaleah, which means -- these friends of mine were washing and if somebody wanted their clothes to be also ironed, they would come to us and pay for it and my wife would sit down at a [indecipherable] machine and ironing the pants and the shirts and the underpants, whatever.</span> <span id="s942">Making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: During that time of making a living, when your wife -- was she working full time in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: She was working the Magaleah in that -- in that ironing place.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: She was helping me.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And was there a special place for the children to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Well, we -- we had in a house, we -- we -- I bought a house in Haifa, in a place na -- in a small village next to Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: So they just stayed at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: They stayed at home and my oldest son was in school and my other kids were still too young, one was very young.</span> <span id="s951">Anyway, we were making in disin -- decent living, wa -- kind of a hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Working hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: I wa -- I had two jobs.</span> <span id="s954">I was working in the customs and in the evening I would go to the post office, checking the packages and I -- I -- I calculated the duty, because a lot of packages were coming from all over the world.</span> <span id="s955">And I’m working in the customs and one day, this -- I got the letter from the bank that I discounted six promissory notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: You what?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I discounted the promissory notes I got from my partner.</span> <span id="s958">I -- I gave them to the bank and they gave me the money against -- against interest, you know?</span> <span id="s959">Against me -- Against the promissory notes.</span> <span id="s960">And he was supposed to pay for these, because they were -- they were broken down to one per month.</span> <span id="s961">So I got a telephone call from the bank that the first one, which was due on February the first, or whatever it was, it was paid.</span> <span id="s962">The other ones not paid.</span> <span id="s963">I see and say, “I finished with the guy, he stole all my money.”</span> <span id="s964">So, I’m sitting and working in my office and he comes in, my partner, who I don’t -- I didn’t see him for all this time.</span> <span id="s965">He comes in with a guard, a guard brings him in because in customs, you had to have a permit to go and see [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s966">He comes in and he says to me, he says, “I paid for the first bill, but I’m not going to pay any more.”</span> <span id="s967">I say, “What do you mean you don’t pay any more?</span> <span id="s968">We made a deal, we finished with it -- a lawyer.”</span> <span id="s969">He says, “If you say one more word, I’ll go to your boss and you’re working for the government now, and I will tell him that you changed money on the black market and I’ll put you in jail.”</span> <span id="s970">I got so mad, I was -- I -- I told to the guard, “Take him out of here.</span> <span id="s971">I don’t want to see him any more.”</span> <span id="s972">And I don’t know what am I going to do.</span> <span id="s973">In the meantime, already, I am working on a permit, exit permit, because my friend Mr. Ponvi is in Japan in 1951.</span> <span id="s974">He heard that I’m having problems in Israel.</span> <span id="s975">He send me a letter, he says, “If you want to come and work with me in Tokyo, I’ll have you any time.</span> <span id="s976">I’ll send you a visa.”</span> <span id="s977">But I had to get an exit permit -- ‘51, my friend, Mr. Ponvi, who has established a store in Tokyo, he came back from America in 1949, to Japan, to Tokyo, as an American citizen already.</span> <span id="s978">He opened a big store on the main street in Tokyo, Ginza.</span> <span id="s979">Only a few foreign firms, American, British, French, were allowed to import goods in those days.</span> <span id="s980">Japanese were not allowed yet.</span> <span id="s981">It was before the peace treaty was signed in 1955, I believe.</span> <span id="s982">MacArthur.</span> <span id="s983">And so he -- he needed someone to help him there and he -- he s -- he send me a telegram.</span> <span id="s984">He says, if you want to come and work for me in Tokyo, you’re welcome, I’ll send you a visa.</span> <span id="s985">Which he did and I -- in ‘51 -- at the same time, my youngest son, Danny was a very sick child.</span> <span id="s986">He had asthma.</span> <span id="s987">He was two years old -- no, he was three years old already.</span> <span id="s988">And he was a very, very sick boy and I show him to the doctors and the doctors said, “The climate in Israel, the sand, the heat, is very bad for him.</span> <span id="s989">If you don’t take him away to Switzerland or somewhere to breathe fresh air, he’s going to die here.”</span> <span id="s990">Well my -- my wife, myself, we were very, very upset.</span> <span id="s991">And it so happened my wife had a sister who was married to a Swiss guy and they lived in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s992">So I send a telegram, I said, “Look, my wife has to come to Switzerland for about six months while I go to Japan.”</span> <span id="s993">And they came back and they said come on down and my wife and my daughter -- she took my daughter and Danny, the little guy, to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s994">She also wanted to take my -- our oldest son, who was at that time ‘37, ‘47, 16 -- fif -- 16 years old, but they wouldn’t let him leave, because in a years time he had to go to the army.</span> <span id="s995">That was a rule in Israel.</span> <span id="s996">So she left to Switzerland with the two children.</span> <span id="s997">I went to Japan to work for Mr. Ponvi and Israel stayed behind with my wife’s mother, she looked after him until he had to go to the army, which he did.</span> <span id="s998">He was in the 56 year war.</span> <span id="s999">He became an officer in the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s1000">I came to Japan and there, working for Mr. Ponvi’s store, was Mr. s -- [indecipherable] was Mr. Sukihara.</span> <span id="s1001">Mr. --</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: This was a department store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes, a very large department store.</span> <span id="s1004">Only foreigners who could pay in dollars were allowed to buy, the Japanese are not allowed, because that was before the peace treaty was signed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And what did you do in the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I was in charge of it -- manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Of the entire store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Almost.</span> <span id="s1009">[indecipherable] boss together.</span> <span id="s1010">They were importing textiles again and I’m a textile man.</span> <span id="s1011">And I was w-watching wh-which goods to buy and helping with the Japanese stopit, talking to the American [indecipherable] because most of the customers were GI’s -- that was during the Korean war -- who would come on R and R from Korea to Tokyo and before they go to -- report to go home, they would huf -- we also had jewelry department and silks and textiles.</span> <span id="s1012">And they would come and buy jewelers and textiles and pay in dollars.</span> <span id="s1013">That was the only way that they were al -- they call is script in those days, do you know what a script is?</span> <span id="s1014">There were no dollars in those days, the army used to pay them in special papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: And the name of the -- the department store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Ponvi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Was Ponvi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Ponvi, Ponvi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: On Ginza, on the main street in Tokyo, very beautiful store.</span> <span id="s1021">And we worked there and I met Sukihara over there.</span> <span id="s1022">And I -- I -- I -- he spoke perfect, perfect Russian and perfect German and perfect English.</span> <span id="s1023">And [indecipherable] face, a very interesting man.</span> <span id="s1024">And I tried, I tr -- He was in charge of all Japanese employees, there were about 25 of them.</span> <span id="s1025">Taxes and you know, relations and all that.</span> <span id="s1026">Yeah, that’s Sukiharason.</span> <span id="s1027">Yeah, that’s him.</span> <span id="s1028">A few times I came up to him and I said, “Let’s go and have lunch and I want you to talk to me about what you did.</span> <span id="s1029">I understand you did --” He wouldn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s1030">I pushed and I pressed, I was interested.</span> <span id="s1031">I was, “Well why, why did he do it?”</span> <span id="s1032">Til today I don’t know why he did it.</span> <span id="s1033">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Why he was aloof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Why he was giving those visas after he was instructed by the foreign office to stop giving the visas.</span> <span id="s1036">I don’t know if you read the book, it’s called, “In Search of Sukihara.”</span> <span id="s1037">Try and get it, it’s a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1038">Dr. Hela Levine made a complete research.</span> <span id="s1039">He went to Japan and he spoke to his children and he spoke to his widow and -- very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1040">And only one day, he finally, after I was pushing him -- he was really aloof.</span> <span id="s1041">He was never friendly with his own Japanese people.</span> <span id="s1042">This a -- you know, the man was a diplomat.</span> <span id="s1043">The man spoke so many languages.</span> <span id="s1044">The man -- I think what was in his mind -- he lost his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: For what he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: For what he did.</span> <span id="s1047">Why did he do it?</span> <span id="s1048">I wanted to find out.</span> <span id="s1049">He told me once, I will never forget this, he says, “It was the finger of God.”</span> <span id="s1050">I say, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1051">“Well, I saved those people because I had an inspiration I must save them.”</span> <span id="s1052">I say, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1053">I says -- “I -- I -- I don’t want to talk about it.”</span> <span id="s1054">He never, never, never talked to me about.</span> <span id="s1055">I hope when they make the exhibition, I can give them some information which it might be of interest, you know?</span> <span id="s1056">Anyway, ‘51, I am in Japan, I went to the Japanese -- to the American embassy in Japan, and said, “My file is in Tel Aviv, bring it over here, I’m now in Tel Aviv -- i-in Tokyo.”</span> <span id="s1057">A few months later I’m getting a call, “Your file is here.”</span> <span id="s1058">I went.</span> <span id="s1059">And that was about three years they were asking me questions.</span> <span id="s1060">It was during McCarthy times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Who was asking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: A lady in charge, Miss Pinard was his name.</span> <span id="s1063">She was in charge of the visa section.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: In Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: In Japan, in Tokyo.</span> <span id="s1066">American lady and they work in the American embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: “Why -- How come y-yo-you speak Russian?”</span> <span id="s1069">I said, “I was born there.”</span> <span id="s1070">“Are you a Communist?”</span> <span id="s1071">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1072">“Prove it to me.”</span> <span id="s1073">You know, she was a -- well, she was doing her job.</span> <span id="s1074">And Miss Pinard was her name, very nice lady, but I understood, it was [indecipherable] her job.</span> <span id="s1075">“Come again, we’ll talk to you again.”</span> <span id="s1076">And again and a -- and I’m not in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1077">I have a good job -- of course I -- my mind is, my son, my oldest son is in the army in Israel and then if I stay in Japan with the younger children, having a har -- easy time, I’m making good money, a good living.</span> <span id="s1078">When he’s finished with the army, I want him to go to college, I want him to study, and my children also.</span> <span id="s1079">There’s nothing to do in Japan, I have to go to America.</span> <span id="s1080">Where else would I go to give my children an education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Did your family from Switzerland come back?</span> <span id="s1082">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1083">My wife was in Switzerland with the two younger children and then, after six months or so, I brought them to Japan, to stay with me.</span> <span id="s1084">I was working in Ponvi, she came with the children.</span> <span id="s1085">We had a very easy life, very good life, very comfortable life.</span> <span id="s1086">And finally, Miss Pinard, every month or so, a telephone call.</span> <span id="s1087">“Mr. Hanin, I want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s1088">“Okay.”</span> <span id="s1089">“Are you a Communist?”</span> <span id="s1090">“No,” I said, I -- then I got a little upset, I said, “Miss Pinard, you know, if I were a Communist and if I want to go to the States, would I tell you that I am a Communist?</span> <span id="s1091">Let’s change places.”</span> <span id="s1092">She says, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1093">I said, “I am not a Communist.</span> <span id="s1094">I tell you what I’ll do.</span> <span id="s1095">I’ll swear on the Torah,” you know what a Torah is -- “that I’m not a Communist.</span> <span id="s1096">Is that good enough for you?”</span> <span id="s1097">She says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1098">I said, “Anytime.</span> <span id="s1099">I have a lot of good friends.”</span> <span id="s1100">And -- But she says, “Well, come again.”</span> <span id="s1101">And I’m not in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1102">I-I’m working, I’m still young.</span> <span id="s1103">I -- I -- We’re doing all right, making good money, putting it away.</span> <span id="s1104">Finally, one day, after this interrogation, I came to a lunch -- we used to get together, some of the boys, some business people, friends of mine, in a nice hotel.</span> <span id="s1105">I came there and who comes in?</span> <span id="s1106">Maury Sprung.</span> <span id="s1107">Maury Sprung was a major in the United States Air Force during the war.</span> <span id="s1108">After the war was over, he was an attorney.</span> <span id="s1109">And, when the war was over and they had a -- a -- a -- a court case against the Japanese criminals, you know, military, also some of the industrialists were taken to be investigated and Maury was their attorney.</span> <span id="s1110">And he helped them to get -- get off the case.</span> <span id="s1111">And he was a good -- n-now -- now he started his own practice.</span> <span id="s1112">Where did I meet him?</span> <span id="s1113">I met Maury in the synagogue, he was a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s1114">He was a major, [indecipherable] without uniform.</span> <span id="s1115">And we’re sitting here with lunch and he comes in.</span> <span id="s1116">“Hello, hello Maury, didn’t see you for a long time.”</span> <span id="s1117">He says to me, “What’s the matter with you, you are so upset?”</span> <span id="s1118">I say, “Maury, don’t talk to me.”</span> <span id="s1119">He say, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1120">I said, “You Americans, you make me sick.”</span> <span id="s1121">He said, “How can you talk to me like this?</span> <span id="s1122">What’s the matter with you, are you crazy?”</span> <span id="s1123">I said, “Maury.”</span> <span id="s1124">“Where do you come from?”</span> <span id="s1125">he says to me.</span> <span id="s1126">“I just came from the American embassy.”</span> <span id="s1127">“What were you doing in the American embassy?”</span> <span id="s1128">I say, “I am applying -- I am working on a b -- am -- on a visa to go to the United States, and this lady over there is asking me so many questions.</span> <span id="s1129">Am I a Communist and this and that.”</span> <span id="s1130">He started to laugh.</span> <span id="s1131">He says, “Leo, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1132">I’ll take care of everything.</span> <span id="s1133">You need a good lawyer.”</span> <span id="s1134">I say, “I don’t need any lawyers.</span> <span id="s1135">This is clear.”</span> <span id="s1136">He says -- Am I repeating myself, I didn’t tell this story.</span> <span id="s1137">I say, “Maury, I don’t want to talk about it, I’m so upset, she’s asking me all these questions every time.”</span> <span id="s1138">I say, “Well, she’s doing her job, what can I say?”</span> <span id="s1139">He says to me, “Wait for me, I’ll let you know.”</span> <span id="s1140">Couple of months go by, he calls me up at home -- and he used to come to my house for dinner sometimes, my wife -- we’re very good friends.</span> <span id="s1141">Says, “[indecipherable] will be in this little nightclub over there, American owned nightclub.</span> <span id="s1142">You come there with your wife, with Rebecca, 10 o’clock at night and leave everything to me.”</span> <span id="s1143">I say, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s1144">He says, “Just come.”</span> <span id="s1145">I said to my -- “Well, Rebecca, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s1146">We came there at 10 o’clock, he’s standing outside, in winter, waiting for us, drunk.</span> <span id="s1147">Takes us around, brings us in, it’s dark little bar.</span> <span id="s1148">And there were people sitting there, nobody’s in uniform.</span> <span id="s1149">And he’s doing a lot of legal work for the American occupation, for the military, that’s what I understood.</span> <span id="s1150">“General So and so,” he says to a guy sitting there, “I want you to meet my very good friend, Leo and Rebecca Hanin.”</span> <span id="s1151">[indecipherable] They’re all sitting there, nobody’s eating any food [indecipherable] party, it’s a nightclub.</span> <span id="s1152">And another general, say, “How do you do, General?”</span> <span id="s1153">And Miss Pinard is there, the lady from the embassy.</span> <span id="s1154">He says, “Miss Pinard, I want you to meet my very good friend, Leo and Rebecca Hanin.”</span> <span id="s1155">“Hello, Miss Pinard.”</span> <span id="s1156">She says, “Oh, I know him.”</span> <span id="s1157">And he walks away and she comes up to me and she says, “Why didn’t you tell me that you’re a friend of Mr. Sprung?”</span> <span id="s1158">I said, “Miss Pinard, you never asked me about my friends, I have many friends.</span> <span id="s1159">All you were asking me is about -- you know what you were asking me.”</span> <span id="s1160">I said, “By the way, we are at a nightclub, we are at a party, let’s go and have a drink and talk about anything else.</span> <span id="s1161">I know you were doing your job, please don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s1162">She was upset.</span> <span id="s1163">But anyway, we went, we danced, we talked, social.</span> <span id="s1164">Three days later she calls me.</span> <span id="s1165">I got the visa.</span> <span id="s1166">It’s -- It’s who you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Even then.</span> <span id="s1168">I -- I want to -- Before we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: And I got my visa and we came to America.</span> <span id="s1170">Thank God for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Before we leave Japan, I just wanted to ask you, did you ever meet Mrs. Sukihara?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: In ja -- In -- In Los Angeles, yes.</span> <span id="s1173">Not in -- in Tokyo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: So that was recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yes, just about three years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Okay, so we’ll g -- we’ll go to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: I met his son, a young boy that time, in ‘51, who used to come with his father to the store once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1178">And I reminded it to him now and we had a big laugh over it.</span> <span id="s1179">I told him which fruits he used to buy with his father, I used to go with them sometimes.</span> <span id="s1180">Anyway, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Your son was in Israel in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: He was still in the army and -- and then, well, he was close to be si -- I’m in -- in the States, we came to the States in 1956, I got my visa.</span> <span id="s1183">My -- My -- My quota visa, everything is okay, I took my wife,

id="s1186">A: President Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: President Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: And who was president during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Oh, at that time, president, who was president at that time?</span> <span id="s1191">Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Eisenhower?</span> <span

then take a -- took a train, came to Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: In San Francisco lived my wife’s brother.</span> <span id="s1202">He was -- came to America many, many, many years ago, so we stayed with him for a couple of days and then we took a [indecipherable] to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1203">Friend of mine from Japan advised me.</span> <span id="s1204">I meant to go to New York, because, you know, some -- some of my friend were there.</span> <span id="s1205">He says, “Go to Los Angeles, it’s a new area, start a business importing and you know the importing, you have some money.”</span> <span id="s1206">And I listened to him, and thank God I did.</span> <span id="s1207">Anyway, then my -- my mind is all the time, I have to bring my older son here, because when he becomes 21, that was in -- he was born in ‘37 -- ‘47, ‘57, ‘58.</span> <span id="s1208">I’m here, I came here in 1956.</span> <span id="s1209">In 1958, when he becomes 21, he’s no more under my quota, he’s under his quota.</span> <span id="s1210">In those days it was very serious with quotas.</span> <span id="s1211">And he was born in China.</span> <span id="s1212">Chinese -- Whites -- What they call it, Aryan quota was very hard to get.</span> <span id="s1213">I knew if I don’t get him earlier, [indecipherable] he’s 21, he will fall under Chinese quota and then who knows.</span> <span id="s1214">And in the meantime, he’s still in the army, he’s finishing up.</span> <span id="s1215">I wrote him a letter, he wrote some -- he got his permits.</span> <span id="s1216">And, by the way, when I got my visa, I -- Miss Pinards, the lady in -- in Tokyo, I told her my son is still in Japan -- in Israel and I don’t know if -- I mean, it was going to be difficult to get a visa.</span> <span id="s1217">She says, “When -- When the time comes for you to bring him, after he’s finished with the army, just let me know.</span> <span id="s1218">I will take care of everything.”</span> <span id="s1219">And she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: She wrote a letter to somebody, I don’t know to whom.</span> <span id="s1222">My son got a visa like this.</span> <span id="s1223">And he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: In --</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: We brought him here in 19 -- he was before 21.</span> <span id="s1226">‘37, ‘47, ‘58.</span> <span id="s1227">End of ‘58 he came here and we as -- advised him to go to UCLA, and he went to UCLA and he started to work there and to study there and he’s a -- he’s a very, you know, because he’s my son, he’s a brilliant young boy.</span> <span id="s1228">He’s a Ph.D. now, you know.</span> <span id="s1229">He met a beautiful, wonderful girl, Lida.</span> <span id="s1230">They got married.</span> <span id="s1231">He graduated pharmacology in UCLA and our government send him -- the UCLA send him to Sweden to study -- research on the Alzheimer disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: And your work for your own self, what did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: I started importing business, because this is the only thing I knew.</span> <span id="s1234">And I looked around the stores, there were Japanese this and Japanese that.</span> <span id="s1235">I know Japan, I am starting importing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And you spoke fluent Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Not fluent, but enough to -- to -- to -- to get along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: To do business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: And things were not doing so well, I just didn’t know how to do business in America.</span> <span id="s1240">I -- It was a -- It wa -- It’s another world, you know, and about two years later, I had some customers who used buy from me.</span> <span id="s1241">They had a store on -- on Fifth Street an-and Broadway in those days.</span> <span id="s1242">I’m talking about 1961 - ‘62, a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: In Los Angeles?</span> <span id="s1244">A: Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1245">I became good friend with them and they had a big store and on the Eighth -- Eighth and Broadway.</span> <span id="s1246">I went to see them and then I -- I got a -- things were no good.</span> <span id="s1247">I got a -- a -- a -- a call from a friend of mine in New York.</span> <span id="s1248">He says, “Leo, I hear you’re having problems in business.</span> <span id="s1249">I don’t know if things -- I got a lot of friends.”</span> <span id="s1250">I say, “Yes?”</span> <span id="s1251">“Would you like to go back to Japan and -- for a year?</span> <span id="s1252">We have a special job for you.”</span> <span id="s1253">I say, “What kind of a job?”</span> <span id="s1254">He says, “We have some customers that are here now.</span> <span id="s1255">They’re from South America, from Chile.</span> <span id="s1256">They are survivors of the Holocaust, Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1257">They don’t speak any language but Jewish and Spanish.</span> <span id="s1258">You speak Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1259">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1260">“They come, they want to buy goods to export to Chile, they live in Chile, in a place called Arika,” which is on the border of Uruguay, I think.</span> <span id="s1261">“Would you like to go there and work with them?”</span> <span id="s1262">I said, “How much you going to pay me?”</span> <span id="s1263">We made a deal.</span> <span id="s1264">And I told my wife, I said, “Honey, I’ve go to go, that’s the only way we can continue.”</span> <span id="s1265">She says, “Well, if you have to go, go for a year.”</span> <span id="s1266">And I went.</span> <span id="s1267">And I worked with these guys and -- and wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: And you lived again in Japan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Together with whom?</span> <span id="s1270">No, my wife was here, in Los Angeles, I left her here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: No, you lived again, again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Again in ‘50.</span> <span id="s1273">I lived in a hotel, that was in 1959 and 1960, two years.</span> <span id="s1274">And then my mind is working.</span> <span id="s1275">In ‘61, I have to become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1276">Five years I have to live here.</span> <span id="s1277">I have to be in -- in America in ‘61 to get my citizenship, that’s what I want.</span> <span id="s1278">And I made a deal with my friends.</span> <span id="s1279">I was working for a year in Tokyo with these people who were buying merchandise for Chile, but in ‘61, I have to go back to get my citizenship.</span> <span id="s1280">I want to be an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1281">They said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1282">And one of my customers were two guys who had a store on Eighth and Broadway and I was really friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1283">I had some merchandise left over, I came to see them, I said, “Fellows, I’m going to Japan and I have some merchandise.</span> <span id="s1284">I’ll leave it with you.</span> <span id="s1285">When you sell it, pay my wife.”</span> <span id="s1286">It was about 17,000 dollars worth of merchandise.</span> <span id="s1287">They said, “Well, what -- what do you mean you’re going to Japan?”</span> <span id="s1288">I said, “Well, I got a job.”</span> <span id="s1289">“Don’t go, we’ll open a store here, you’ll be -- you’ll [indecipherable] our partner.”</span> <span id="s1290">I said, “No, no, no.”</span> <span id="s1291">I already -- I had to go, m-my mind was very -- was under terrible pressure.</span> <span id="s1292">Anyway, I look around their store, I see Japanese goods, Japanese goods, Japanese goods.</span> <span id="s1293">In those days it was, you know, radios and tape recorders.</span> <span id="s1294">I said, “Where do you buy all this?”</span> <span id="s1295">“Well, we buy this from the guy in San Francisco and this from the guy in New York.</span> <span id="s1296">This from the guy in Chicago.”</span> <span id="s1297">I said, “Look, I know in Japan where to buy all these things.</span> <span id="s1298">I will save you a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1299">I’ll buy it for you.”</span> <span id="s1300">And I looked at this guy, Al was his name and he looks at me and I don’t think he trusts me.</span> <span id="s1301">I’m telling him because I know what I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s1302">He says, “Well --” I said, “Look, before you say yes or no, only one condition I’ll do it for you.”</span> <span id="s1303">“What’s the condition?”</span> <span id="s1304">“You come to Japan.”</span> <span id="s1305">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: This is tape two, side B, Leo Hanin.</span> <span id="s1307">Continue the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: So he says, “I’m going -- You -- You want me to come to Japan?”</span> <span id="s1309">I say, “Yeah, you can save so much money, because you don’t have to buy from local importers.</span> <span id="s1310">I’ll -- I’ll show you where to buy these goods.</span> <span id="s1311">I know.</span> <span id="s1312">I know Japan.”</span> <span id="s1313">He says, “Well.”</span> <span id="s1314">I said, “Don’t say well, just come to Japan and leave everything to me.”</span> <span id="s1315">And he came.</span> <span id="s1316">And we started a wonderful relationship which eventually wound up that I came back from Japan to America, to get my citizenship, which I got and they offered me a job to work with them, these two friends of mine here, Allen and Abe, which eventually developed to become a very large company, Lloyd’s Electronics.</span> <span id="s1317">I was one of the directors.</span> <span id="s1318">For 25 years I worked for them.</span> <span id="s1319">My main job was developing -- I used to go to Japan, to Korea, to Taiwan, to Hong Kong, cause I knew how to deal with these people.</span> <span id="s1320">And also, I used to go to South America to develop South American markets.</span> <span id="s1321">Panama, South Africa, Venezuela, Chile and this was my job fo-for 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: When -- Would you like to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: No, I’m fine.</span> <span id="s1324">I’m finishing.</span> <span id="s1325">Unless you have any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Oh, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Now, ask me direct questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: All I wanted to ask you, when you came to America, were you aware of any anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s1331">A: No, I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s1332">I -- I wasn’t exposed to it and I wasn’t ever -- oh, I was -- I’m -- I -- I’m a great reader, I read a lot of books and -- an-and television, watch television and newspapers and I knew what was going on, but I personally did not experience any anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: And after the war, as you look back on -- on your relationships as a Jew with Japanese and Japan, did you know when Japanese American were being held in camps in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: I -- I read about it when I came here, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: And how did that make you feel?</span> <span id="s1336">What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: I -- I -- I didn’t think it was right to put American citizens -- they were American citizens, that’s what bothered me, to be put into special camps, because they were not a Japanese, even though they were suspected of being spies and all whatever.</span> <span id="s1338">But I felt legally, they were not -- they had no right to do that to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1340">Did you know that there was talk that Japanese were sympathetic to Nazism, did you ever hear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: When?</span> <span id="s1342">Which -- In which period of time?</span> <span id="s1343">Well, they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: In any period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: -- they were allies.</span> <span id="s1346">The Japanese signed a -- a three [indecipherable] Japan, Italy and -- and Germany, they signed that -- what they called an axis arrangement, it was in 19 -- when was it, I think in 1938 - ‘39.</span> <span id="s1347">That was a military alliance signed by Japan and Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Oh, but that didn’t make you -- that didn’t bother you or you didn’t worry about their --</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: At that time, my thought was that this -- all this political and military arrangements were against Russia.</span> <span id="s1350">See Japan was always -- considered herself an enemy of Russian communism.</span> <span id="s1351">It was no idea it would become a Pearl Harbor situation.</span> <span id="s1352">No, no, not -- not -- never enter -- came into my mind.</span> <span id="s1353">I -- I know they admired the Americans, they liked the Americans.</span> <span id="s1354">They -- They -- They -- They emulated them and all that, but whatever they were doing political, I think it was all against Russia.</span> <span id="s1355">That was my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Did you see Max Becker, once you got into the United States, again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yes, I saw him in -- in Venezuela many years later,

this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Yes, that -- that story was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: That’s the time I saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: That’s a beautiful story.</span> <span id="s1363">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Beautiful story.</span> <span id="s1365">He died.</span> <span id="s1366">He recently died.</span> <span id="s1367">But, that was a very interesting, very emotional story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: And when did you wife pass away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: 10 years ago, in 1988.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Here, in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: She passed away of

did you move from your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: I sa -- We [indecipherable] in -- We lived in -- in Encino, in a -- in a -- in a condominium which we bought.</span> <span id="s1384">Last place, rather and I stayed there for myself, by -- by myself for awhile, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Mendacino?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Encino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Oh, Encino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: For about four or five years, until my children started to tell me that it’s no good any more to stay alone, cooking and washing and doing, in a big house.</span> <span id="s1389">And besides, it has to do also with finances.</span> <span id="s1390">I didn’t -- I wasn’t a rich man, but if I sell this condominium, I would have some money to be able to make my own decisions what to do next.</span> <span id="s1391">And I listened to them and I’m glad I did.</span> <span id="s1392">We moved here, in Woodland Hills.</span> <span id="s1393">I am living in a retirement hotel.</span> <span id="s1394">Not an old age home, a retirement hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Yeah, just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Has about over a hundred people.</span> <span id="s1397">Not a very interesting life, but at least I’m about five minutes away from my daughter and her husband and they’re so good to me.</span> <span id="s1398">My daughter calls me every day.</span> <span id="s1399">“Hello Dad, how are you?”</span> <span id="s1400">And the-they’re good people, good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: And your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: My grandchildren of my daughter’s side -- there -- there is a doctor, as I told you, and Eddie is on the computers, they live in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1403">My -- My grandson graduated Yale.</span> <span id="s1404">His wife also graduated [indecipherable] Yale, she’s also a doctor.</span> <span id="s1405">They live in Connecticut, Westport, Connecticut, that’s where they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: And the other grandchildren, my son’s grandchildren, Adam is working for a Compaq computer company in Houston, Texas.</span> <span id="s1408">His wife is a chemist.</span> <span id="s1409">She’s now involved in working for a manufacturer who makes medicine against that’s terrible sickness --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: AIDS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: AIDS.</span> <span id="s1412">She travels to South America, to South Africa; among people there, there’s a lot of AIDS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Did your children marry Jewish?</span> <span id="s1414">A: My children, yes, but one of my grandsons, Eddie, who is with the computer, he married a Catholic girl.</span> <span id="s1415">She didn’t convert, he didn’t convert.</span> <span id="s1416">Good, nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1418">So you have no strong feelings about that, one way or the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: I -- I -- I’m not very excitably happy about it.</span> <span id="s1420">I would rather him married a Jewish girl, but life is life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Tell me, why -- why do you think that’s important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Why do I think that’s important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Let me read you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: It’s on my 85th birthday in -- in a magazine printed in Tel Aviv, in Israel.</span> <span id="s1427">“Leo is a devoted family man.</span> <span id="s1428">Proud, justly so, of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1429">Throughout his life, Leo had been a committed Jew, a leader in the Jewish community, a devoted friend of Israel, a generous person, a faithful friend.</span> <span id="s1430">In a way, always ready to respond to the needs of others.”</span> <span id="s1431">I mean, i-it’s not a matter of -- I was not -- I told my -- my Eddie, my grandson that married a Catholic girl, a very nice girl, Michelle.</span> <span id="s1432">And I told my children, if it’s going to be a wedding in a -- in a -- in a church, if he’s going to convert, this grandpa is not coming.</span> <span id="s1433">“Why?</span> <span id="s1434">Eddie will be bra -- ba -- heartbroken.”</span> <span id="s1435">I said, “Look, I cannot, just --” So they arranged, they had an interdenominational wedding and she is a lovely girl and they live well together and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1436">This is America, I understand.</span> <span id="s1437">I am not that old-fashioned to -- to -- to -- to be so, how shall I say, crazily -- I understand.</span> <span id="s1438">My mind is open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: I wonder if your children understood what was happening in the Holocaust, since you were not directly there.</span> <span id="s1440">Did you tell them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: I -- You know, the first tape that I made in -- in the museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: I played it to the children and to the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1444">There is another tape, which was made by the Wiesenthal Holocaust Museum, here.</span> <span id="s1445">I played that also.</span> <span id="s1446">And the children know.</span> <span id="s1447">Th-They read, especially the grandchildren I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1448">They were brought up in -- in -- not in a very Orthodox Jewish way, but you know, th-they know -- th-they know.</span> <span id="s1449">I don’t know if they’re as -- as committed as I would have liked them to be, but this is America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: And when you -- when you say, this is America, do you mean it’s a mixed bag, there’s all sorts of religions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: We -- We -- No, I say -- That’s right, we have to be open minded, we have to understand that America, and I’m not saying this because I’m [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1452">To me, America, there’s no other place in the world like America.</span> <span id="s1453">And I think I understand many things that are happening here good and bad.</span> <span id="s1454">I’m not going to talk about what’s going to happen, what’s happening today, it’s -- it’s -- has nothing to do with my life.</span> <span id="s1455">But I understand all that and sometimes it hurts.</span> <span id="s1456">But sometimes I -- I have to say to myself, “Well, this is America.</span> <span id="s1457">Thank God the Jewish people in America have a good life.”</span> <span id="s1458">There is some anti-Semitism here, I know.</span> <span id="s1459">Farrakhan is here and other things are happening, but no country in the world has been so good, so open and so understanding, with all the other problems that America has been and for this I am grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: I wonder if you are a member of any Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: You’re very -- You’re considered a friend of Israel and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Well, yes, we have an organization here, a small organization called American Far Eastern Society of Southern California.</span> <span id="s1464">All ex-residents of China, la -- an-and already their children got together here.</span> <span id="s1465">There is an organization here, San Francisco, New York, Brazil, Hong Kong, Japan.</span> <span id="s1466">And the main purpose is to get together and to make some drives and collect some money to help our older people who are destitute out in Israel.</span> <span id="s1467">We send it to them and New York sends it to them and -- and there is about 200 people in Israel, ex-residents of China, Jewish people, who are completely out.</span> <span id="s1468">They’re in old age homes and they are supported by us.</span> <span id="s1469">We have to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: A question I’m asking everyone is, do you think that the founding of Israel has a particular, special meaning for Holocaust survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s1472">I think that -- of course, I didn’t speak to many Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1473">I didn’t speak to them, but I read a lot about it, all these stories, “Schindler’s List” and all the other movies, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1474">And I think that many Jews, survivors of Holocaust had nowhere to go, only to Israel.</span> <span id="s1475">No other country -- America accepted some, Australia accepted some, but mostly they came to Israel.</span> <span id="s1476">And where -- where would they have gone if it wasn’t for the -- for -- for Israel?</span> <span id="s1477">That’s the way I look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: I have a list of events that I’m also asking people that we interview in America.</span> <span id="s1479">If you will just mi -- look at it and I think that the thing that I heard you talk about the most was the era of Joseph McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: And how it affected you, but I’m wondering if your experience as a Jew during this time, was as strongly -- also, did you -- were you able to relate it to any of these events that happened, mainly in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Japanese concentra -- Japanese -- Do we want me to go through all of them?</span> <span id="s1483">Q: Oh, just whatever you relate to, not -- not -- not all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Well, we spoke about Japanese concentration camps, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: The Cold War.</span> <span id="s1487">The Cold War is -- was strictly war -- Cold War between American democracy and Communism, which had to be resolved, there was always the danger of -- of -- of war, only the na -- Russians were accumulating all these nuclears weapon -- nuclear weapons, with which they -- America was for them an enemy.</span> <span id="s1488">That was -- That’s the way I looked at it.</span> <span id="s1489">And when Soviet Russia became no more, I think -- I think it’s a good thing that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: In a -- In a -- I guess what I’m talking about is -- it -- were you -- were you directly affected by any of these?</span> <span id="s1491">If not, then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: That’s really the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: The era of Joseph McCArthy and the Red scare.</span> <span id="s1495">Well, the only thing I can -- I was never told that it was because of Joseph McCarthy’s s-situation that my visa was delayed for so long, but it was part of life, an ex-Russian, speaking Russian, must be a Communist.</span> <span id="s1496">You know, it was -- I think it was implanted in the -- in the heads of the -- of the United States embassy employees, tha -- to -- to -- to cro -- to check it out, because Rosenberg’s -- at that time the spies, the Jewish spies that were co -- there were two who were executed.</span> <span id="s1497">It was a -- it’s a difficult situation, whether this should have been or not, I cannot make my opinion, because I am not -- first of all, I was not at that time an American citizen to really understand what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: And as far as the Civil Rights movement, did you have any particular identity with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: When I was here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: The way Blacks were treated in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Well, in -- in -- in Los Angeles and where we lived here, we didn’t see that much anti-Black, what do you call it, attitudes.</span> <span id="s1502">We saw it on television.</span> <span id="s1503">We saw it -- what happening the southern states and the marches that organized by Martin Luther King and th-the dogs that were put on them and the people that couldn’t work, people -- Black people couldn’t drink water and go to the bathroom and all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1504">It -- It -- It -- It bothered me, but I didn’t -- I don’t know the Black people too well, to really understand what’s -- what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1505">Cause I think the Blacks that are in the south are different than what they are here.</span> <span id="s1506">They’re here, they are more integrated, don’t you think so?</span> <span id="s1507">It’s -- It’s a difficult problem.</span> <span id="s1508">You see, I’d like to say to myself that after all my experiences and all my life, that I am an American, but I am not, really.</span> <span id="s1509">I co -- I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1510">I wasn’t born here, I didn’t grow up here, and I sometimes listen to my children, to my grandchildren, the way they talk.</span> <span id="s1511">I see they are Americans.</span> <span id="s1512">I am still -- who am I?</span> <span id="s1513">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1514">Russian, Jewish, Japanese, Chinese, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1515">My head is mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: How many languages do you -- did you once and do you now speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Five.</span> <span id="s1518">I start with Russian, Yiddish, English, Hebrew, some Japanese and -- not fluent, some Chinese, not fluent.</span> <span id="s1519">And I picked up some German in school and when I was dealing with the Polish refugees, I picked up some Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: This is way back to something that you -- you said, which I’m very -- I think would be a -- a curious -- an interesting thing to know.</span> <span id="s1521">At the time, you couldn’t talk about the Black Market, about the kind of activities --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where, where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: When your partner threatened you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yes, in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: It was in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Could you tell me, was that a typical kind of under the table business that was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: A -- A lot of people that came from abroad in those days, knew -- knew immigrants that had dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: American dollars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yes, American dollars, in -- in -- not in their pockets, cash, but in accounts.</span> <span id="s1531">I’m talking about Jews from China.</span> <span id="s1532">They all -- We all had accounts in America, in New York, in the States Bank, or National City Bank, whatever branches they had in China.</span> <span id="s1533">And in those days, if you changed the dollars at the official rate of Israeli exchange, you had to pay -- when we came, two dollars and 80 cents for one Israeli pound.</span> <span id="s1534">Because Israeli pound at that time, was equivalent to the British pound.</span> <span id="s1535">Two dollars and 80 cents.</span> <span id="s1536">Within six months, it became a dollar for a dollar for a pound.</span> <span id="s1537">In other words, if I change a thousand dollars, I used to get -- at 280, let’s say, three -- 300 pounds, but then, if two months or three months later, if I change a thousand dollars, I get a thousand pounds, which is a big difference.</span> <span id="s1538">It was a very, very difficult situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: And so how did you -- How was it considered Black Market, what you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Th-This is what we call Black Market.</span> <span id="s1541">I mean, you had some people who had a lot of local money, cha -- Israeli money and they wanted to transfer them into American money, but they couldn’t do it officially, to go to the bank and buy dollars, it wasn’t allowed.</span> <span id="s1542">Today, you can.</span> <span id="s1543">So, there was -- and we needed -- I needed pounds to -- to -- to -- to -- Israeli pounds to live on.</span> <span id="s1544">So, if I would go and change a hundred dollars and get Israeli pounds, I would give my check on -- on -- on -- on the -- on the bank, wherever I had my account and he would give me the Israeli pounds, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: I -- I -- I -- You want me to look through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Yes, the -- the presidencies in particular, the different presidents --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: The presidents?</span> <span id="s1549">The presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, fo -- ooh.</span> <span id="s1550">Yes, what is the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Let’s talk about Truman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Truman?</span> <span id="s1553">Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1554">We knew that Truman recognized, one of the first ones.</span> <span id="s1555">He was the second one.</span> <span id="s1556">The first recognition was given to Israel by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1557">Then Truman recognized the state of Israel and promised to help.</span> <span id="s1558">I mean, the president of -- the first president of -- of Israel, Dr. Weissman, came here and do you know -- did you ever see the picture he brought in the Torah, as a picture?</span> <span id="s1559">Did you see that?</span> <span id="s1560">No?</span> <span id="s1561">It was an interesting picture, I mean we appreciated that.</span> <span id="s1562">Truman accepted it with thanks and congratulated him.</span> <span id="s1563">And you know what Weissman told him?</span> <span id="s1564">He says President Truman -- that President Truman told him, “Congratulation Mr. President.”</span> <span id="s1565">So President Weissman says to him, “You see, there is a big difference Mr. President Truman.”</span> <span id="s1566">“What’s the difference?”</span> <span id="s1567">He says, “You are a president of 200 and what -- how many million Americans?</span> <span id="s1568">60 -- hundred million Americans.</span> <span id="s1569">I am the president of a -- a million presidents.”</span> <span id="s1570">Everybody in Israel thinks he’s a president.</span> <span id="s1571">That was Truman’s story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: So Truman, you feel was -- was very supportive of the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Y-Y-You know that -- whether it was support the Jewish people, whether it was oil interest, we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Whether it’s against Russia, I don’t know, it’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s1576">American politics, sometimes th-they -- they come connected -- interconnected to something else.</span> <span id="s1577">I’m trying to learn all this now, especially with -- through the Clinton story, to understand what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1578">It’s -- It’s politics, it’s oil, it’s business.</span> <span id="s1579">American business is business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: And before we leave, I also wanted you to tell me about the documentary that you’re going to be a part of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: Well, the Israeli -- a group of Israeli, I think they’re very religious people -- seems most of the refugees that brough -- were brought from Japan, about 3,000 Jews, of them about a thousand were rabbis and -- and -- and -- and Yeshiva -- you know what Yeshiva is?</span> <span id="s1582">Ha -- You know, rabbinical schools -- were over a thousand of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: In Japan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Yeah, among those 3,000 Jews that we saved.</span> <span id="s1585">And I was involved very much with -- with their problems, they had so many different problems, so many unworthy, I mean to discuss it, but they had to be solved.</span> <span id="s1586">I don’t know if I ever told the story about Passover, no?</span> <span id="s1587">Huh?</span> <span id="s1588">You heard -- You heard this story.</span> <span id="s1589">Til today I remember it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: It’s a wonderful story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: They are making now, the Israeli company, religious Jews are making a documentary about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Who is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Some group of people who are owning -- owning a documentary film.</span> <span id="s1594">And they -- they send a group of people to Japan and to China, and before they went there, they talked to me about it, because they knew that I was involved in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1595">And they’re going to make a documentary and I told them a few stories about this Passover and about this thing.</span> <span id="s1596">And, I don’t know if I ever told -- if I ever told this before, but anyway, a few years ago, the Sony -- do you got a Sony here?</span> <span id="s1597">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: This?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: The other -- The other NHK, the Japanese film company called me up from Japan, was about five years ago.</span> <span id="s1600">And they said that they were making a documentary on Mr. Sukihara, in Japan and they want to come to talk to me, would I talk to him?</span> <span id="s1601">I say, “Yes,” I’ll be glad to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1602">And they came with a young lady from Brooklyn, who spoke perfect Japanese, was very interesting girl.</span> <span id="s1603">And I told them I speak Japanese, but I would rather -- “You might ask me some question,” I said, “which I will not be able to explain myself so well, because my language is a little narrow.”</span> <span id="s1604">So they ask me a lot of questions, this, that and the other.</span> <span id="s1605">Finally, “Why do you think Mr. Sukihara did what he did, gave visas?”</span> <span id="s1606">I said, “You know something, I’m not a -- I’m a Jew, but I’m not a very Orthodox, very deeply religious Jews.</span> <span id="s1607">At -- “First of all,” I said, “I want you to get it off the camera, I don’t want to tell you to be on the camera, what I’m going to tell you.”</span> <span id="s1608">“All right.”</span> <span id="s1609">I said, “You know why he did it?</span> <span id="s1610">He did it because God directed him to do it.”</span> <span id="s1611">“Wh-Wh-What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1612">I said, “You see, he saved over a thousand rabbis and -- and rabbinical students and by doing that, the -- the Jewish story, the -- the -- the teaching of Torah, Jewish religion, Jewish Orthodox religion, has not been lost.</span> <span id="s1613">It’s beings taught all over the world because of these people that remained alive.</span> <span id="s1614">That’s why God did it.”</span> <span id="s1615">“Ah, so.”</span> <span id="s1616">Then they asked me a few question, “What’s a Torah?”</span> <span id="s1617">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1618">So I have a five books of Moses in English, I gave it to them for a few days, they read it.</span> <span id="s1619">Came back, asked me some questions.</span> <span id="s1620">And I still believe that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1621">H-His -- Just recently I had a meeting with his son and a lady.</span> <span id="s1622">They -- They wrote a book, it’s called, “Visas for Life,” did you hear about that visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Called what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: They’re going to make a be -- a documentary about Sukihara.</span> <span id="s1625">There’s a book that was written by Sukihara’s son and another lady, I forgot her name, Japanese lady, which is called, “Visas for Life.”</span> <span id="s1626">Very interesting book.</span> <span id="s1627">And they invited me a couple of times through some of the exhibitions they made in temples and other places, I would go.</span> <span id="s1628">They would introduce me and this and that, because I met their father when he was 11.</span> <span id="s1629">Oh, the questions they asked me, I was -- I was -- inside of me, I was laughing.</span> <span id="s1630">You know, th-they -- they’re -- they’re making money, they’re making a living out of him, God bl -- help them, I mean, I don’t care, it’s none of my business.</span> <span id="s1631">“Do you think,” he asked me, Sukihara, “my father was pro-American or pro-German?”</span> <span id="s1632">You know, Sukihara was a spy and there is no ca -- there is no -- there is no secret about it.</span> <span id="s1633">He -- Well, you read this book, get this book.</span> <span id="s1634">It’s called, “In Search of Sukihara.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: What did your -- What did you answer [indecipherable] to his son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: I said, “I don’t think he was pro-German and I don’t think he was pro-American.”</span> <span id="s1637">“What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1638">I said, “He was pro-Japanese.</span> <span id="s1639">He was doing what the ji -- he want -- he thought a good Japanese should do?”</span> <span id="s1640">“Why?”</span> <span id="s1641">“If your father was alive today, and I would ask him this question and he would give me an answer, I’m sorry to tell you, I still wouldn’t have believed him.</span> <span id="s1642">There’s so many thing that are behind it, I cannot figure it out.”</span> <span id="s1643">Why?</span> <span id="s1644">The Japanese people who were so -- in those days, who were so departmental.</span> <span id="s1645">Orders are orders, you know.</span> <span id="s1646">There was no such a thing as argue against your bosses.</span> <span id="s1647">His was the foreign minister, what’s his name there -- forgot his name, the one who signed the -- the treaty with -- with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1648">Japanese foreign minister, anyway, his boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Sukihara’s boss?</span> <span id="s1650">A: Sukihara’s boss told him not to issue any visas.</span> <span id="s1651">I mean, they off -- the -- the -- the -- the telegram came -- I’d like to -- how long you going to be here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Til Monday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: I’d like you to read this book, I’m [indecipherable] lend it to you.</span> <span id="s1654">Can I deliver it somewhere?</span> <span id="s1655">I think where [interruption] -- that’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: I’d just like to know before we finish, if there anything else about those years of your experience that you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: I like to say this, that my -- my participation, whatever I did, was minuscule, it wasn’t very -- that very important.</span> <span id="s1658">I-I-I-It played a certain part, but not in a very large scale.</span> <span id="s1659">I say to this, I was in the right place at the right time and I did to my opinion, was the right thing what I did.</span> <span id="s1660">I didn’t know at that time that the Holocaust was coming.</span> <span id="s1661">You know, ‘40 - ‘41, we -- we didn’t know there was a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1662">We knew there was anti-Jewish situation in Germany, but you didn’t know that there would be such a terrible thing like a Holocaust, six million Jews killed in such a systematic way.</span> <span id="s1663">It was un -- it [indecipherable] found out this after the war, it was mindboggling.</span> <span id="s1664">So if I did something to help to save these few thousand Jews, thank God for that.</span> <span id="s1665">That’s all I can say.</span> <span id="s1666">The right place, the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1669">Thank you for asking all these questions.</span></p>
