and, it was very assimilated.</span> <span id="s30">The way the Jews really lived was that we had – the Judaism was more in the house.</span> <span id="s31">I mean we lived in the country, so it was more in the house and, and not outside.</span> <span id="s32">So, I don't know how to explain it, we, we didn't go with – nobody went with beards or with peyos.</span> <span id="s33">Something like that, we didn't see it.</span> <span id="s34">But life was very nice in Holland.</span> <span id="s35">was not antisemitism.</span> <span id="s36">Was no antisemitism, and my parents had a hotel.</span> <span id="s37">They had a kosher hotel, and they had the only kosher hotel in the state where we lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:02:00 Like Holland is all divided in states, and it was the state of Overijssel; and so a lot of Jewish people came to our hotel because we had also – it was a small hotel.</span> <span id="s39">It was on a cattle market; and we lived – a part of – most, most the business came from the cattle market, as is typical in Europe.</span> <span id="s40">It's not so much here.</span> <span id="s41">And so we had a lot of Jewish salesmen.</span> <span id="s42">They slept over in our hotel.</span> <span id="s43">So it was a lot of Judaismic, and Jewish people came always to the hotel.</span> <span id="s44">And also when there was a kosher, wedding party or something like that came, that was always catered in our hotel.</span> <span id="s45">So a lot of Jewish life went on in our hotel.</span> <span id="s46">My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s47">My father was not that religious; but we had to be religious because we had a kosher hotel and that goes together with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">1 earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Hebrew)</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: , and you went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I went to school, the elementary school; and then I went to high school.</span> <span id="s51">And the war broke out when I was not even eighteen years old.</span> <span id="s52">So I finished high school, and then, was – that was the end because right away we were not allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s53">We were not allowed to go work.</span> <span id="s54">We were not allowed to do anything.</span> <span id="s55">That was, that was the first thing what the German did in Holland, to take us out from, from learning and anything.</span> <span id="s56">I started working, in a hospital, in the hospital, because I, I couldn't sit home and do nothing.</span> <span id="s57">And I start working in the beginning in the hospital, and cooking for Jewish patients.</span> <span id="s58">But that was, after a short time that was also was not allowed anymore.</span> <span id="s59">Like in '41, that was not allowed anymore.</span> <span id="s60">So, then I started helping all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s61">I remember in that time we had already a star – we had to wear a star.</span> <span id="s62">And, I went to another – I took the star off.</span> <span id="s63">I always was a little bit against.</span> <span id="s64">And I took the star off, and I went with the train to another town and helped an older family, an older couple, what they were not allowed to have any help anymore from not- Jewish people.</span> <span id="s65">And we were not allowed to do really anything at all.</span> <span id="s66">So, that was a very short time.</span> <span id="s67">Also my, my, my father died on a heart attack in 1941; and on May the 10th the war broke out in Holland.</span> <span id="s68">The Germans came into Holland on May the 10th, and the war was only five days.</span> <span id="s69">I had two brothers what were in the, in the army.</span> <span id="s70">And it was a very nervous atmosphere, because we had a lot of Jewish people in the hotel because a Friday – from Friday or Saturday the war started and they stayed–there were a lot of Jewish people would stay overnight–and they stayed in our hotel, and everybody was tremendously – was panicky.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">01:05:00 Very panicky right away, and because they know what was in Germany happened.</span> <span id="s72">It was next to the, the border was next to where we lived.</span> <span id="s73">You know, Holland is very small.</span> <span id="s74">And so, they, they, they run away and some–we have a lot of water in Holland – the Ijssel was a big river, and they left the car in the water.</span> <span id="s75">They drove them in the water, and they went farther together; because they thought that the German cannot take it.</span> <span id="s76">So it was a big panic.</span> <span id="s77">And after five days – well, there was a lot of traitors in Holland so the war didn't took long in Holland.</span> <span id="s78">After five days the war was over.</span> <span id="s79">And they didn't start right away, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">They did it very slowly on; because they know that they cannot do it like it was in Poland, right away, and in Germany perhaps.</span> <span id="s81">But they did it very slowly on, and very often – very – they did it in a way that no – nobody felt really that there was something going on and it would happen something, serious things.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What happened, with the hotel, or what did you begin to notice?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: In 1941, there was a club in Holland, and it was a men's club.</span> <span id="s84">Very sophisticated, for lawyers; and, and the German right away took that building.</span> <span id="s85">So one of the head of the police and the owner from that men's club came to my mother and say, you know, "Why don't you go out of the hotel, so the Germans don't take it.</span> <span id="s86">And we take your hotel and that you will save."</span> <span id="s87">And my mother was very upset, of course.</span> <span id="s88">They really– my father died, what I told you – they really built that hotel by themselves, really built it.</span> <span id="s89">And to leave everything, just to go out what you have in your hand, was very hard.</span> <span id="s90">So I don't remember exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s91">I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother had to go out of the hotel and could just take with her–they talked her into it, perhaps it was the best–they could just go out of the hotel.</span> <span id="s92">And there was another Jewish family in our home town what, had a little house, very poor little house in a very poor area, and, we moved in that little house in.</span> <span id="s93">But I have to tell – yeah – it was already – we moved into the hotel in and in that little house in, and, and it was horrible.</span> <span id="s94">There was no hot water and there was no bathroom and it was a very poor neighborhood and I really hated it, I remember; and it was a very difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already walking through your door.</span> <span id="s95">And also one day the German took all the people what went over to another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over to the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews what went over to the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s96">So they didn't know – they picked my mother and my two brothers and me.</span> <span id="s97">My oldest brother was married.</span> <span id="s98">I, I come from a family from four children and I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s99">I had three older brothers.</span> <span id="s100">And they took us already to the German border.</span> <span id="s101">But in Holland was a Jewish Raada Jewish group of people.</span> <span id="s102">What they say they help the Jews going to, Poland and Germany, but they went after it and they know that they made a mistake and we were already one or two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s104">Can you just go back and explain why were you taken?</span> <span id="s105">01:09:00</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Because that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s107">It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that the, the Wynberg, that boy, that he was it.</span> <span id="s108">They thought that we were it.</span> <span id="s109">It was a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">And it – because we had the same name.</span> <span id="s111">And so they sent us already – and always we had a little backpack staying by the door because everybody knows already that it would be perhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that – Enschede was the city.</span> <span id="s112">We went to Enschede.</span> <span id="s113">It was on the German border.</span> <span id="s114">And when we were there the Dutch Jewish organization, the Jewish Raad was there – I don't know how it is in English.</span> <span id="s115">They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to Zwolle, where I lived.</span> <span id="s116">And I remember when we came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And how did they get you back?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I don't know, exactly.</span> <span id="s119">They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the wrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy what he went over to the Catholic religion and not we.</span> <span id="s120">We were Jews, and, and that's the reason, they got us back.</span> <span id="s121">They went after that they said they had the wrong people.</span> <span id="s122">But that was just a postponing of a time.</span> <span id="s123">And so we went – I remember we came back and all the</span></p> <p><span id="s124">2 Council (Dutch) people were standing on the street and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and, and everybody came to our house and congratulated us.</span> <span id="s125">That's the reason it's so in my memory, that thing, that way.</span> <span id="s126">But, it didn't help much.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: What happened when you did go back?</span> <span id="s128">A: Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s129">We just–</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What was your life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Our life was – we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting.</span> <span id="s132">It was very strenuous and it was very nervous.</span> <span id="s133">And, and the men had to go already to, work camp but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so.</span> <span id="s134">And, the men had to go to work camp.</span> <span id="s135">And I remember my brother was – one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a work camp.</span> <span id="s136">And they starting already talking; they say, "Oh, when somebody goes to a work camp, then my father will be sent away.</span> <span id="s137">So you better come out of the hiding place."</span> <span id="s138">So my brother came out of the hiding place and her father – they would have sent away anyway – my – you know, the rumors go around.</span> <span id="s139">You didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s140">And so my brother came out.</span> <span id="s141">And the men went to working camps, but they were allowed to go weekends home; so nobody saw something difficult in it, not so serious in it.</span> <span id="s142">They thought, "Oh, they have to go there for helping, doing things," and they came weekends home.</span> <span id="s143">So in between, also, there were things going on in, in my home town.</span> <span id="s144">That a young group of men didn't have anything to do.</span> <span id="s145">They're all – everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and they put Volk–, traitors what went with the Germans–they put in these businesses.</span> <span id="s146">So the men didn't have anything to do.</span> <span id="s147">And we were not allowed to go out of the house after five o'clock at night; we have to stay in.</span> <span id="s148">So these men, eight young married men, came together and played card.</span> <span id="s149">And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, "You know, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card."</span> <span id="s150">And they took these eight men and sent them to Poland.</span> <span id="s151">So that was going on a lot.</span> <span id="s152">It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people, what were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say anything.</span> <span id="s153">I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to Apeldoorn and helped–and that's a little town not far from my hometown–and helped an older family, an older couple.</span> <span id="s154">But it was after a very short time also very dangerous.</span> <span id="s155">And there was not much what you could do.</span> <span id="s156">I remember one day I was walked in my street, and in the street where I was, was a big house and there was a Catholic priest lived in there.</span> <span id="s157">And the Catholic priest came to me and he say – he start talking to me, and he said, "How do you think that you can save your life?"</span> <span id="s158">And I say, "The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when not-Jewish people take us in."</span> <span id="s159">And, the same evening he came to me and he say, "I have a house for you.</span> <span id="s160">I have a place for you where you can go.</span> <span id="s161">And be ready tomorrow morning at five o'clock, six o'clock," I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning, "with your bicycle, and a little bit what you can take with you on the bicycle, and I will bring you there."</span> <span id="s162">And that what I did.</span> <span id="s163">I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers, and I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s164">That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family.</span> <span id="s165">And, we went to Utrecht, and I went to, a family – no, a woman, what she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s166">She came also from my hometown.</span> <span id="s167">I went to her house and, I stayed with her a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">01:15:00 And that was very, a very nice place with this woman to live; what she was the whole day gone and I was the whole day alone.</span> <span id="s169">And, then she had another family what she want to take in, and I went to another family's house.</span> <span id="s170">A very large house with, a lot of room, and I was there the maid.</span> <span id="s171">I had to clean the house, and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s172">I was not allowed to go open the door ever.</span> <span id="s173">I was not allowed to go out of the house; and there was no food in the house and it was very hard already, food in Holland.</span> <span id="s174">Holland – they suffered tremendous in the war.</span> <span id="s175">They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have much, it was very difficult; and these people, they really didn't have anything in the house.</span> <span id="s176">I remember they cooked the bones ten times to make soup and they had the cat's plate already with it.</span> <span id="s177">It was very awful fam– it was a very awful time for me to be there alone.</span> <span id="s178">And, I, I didn't I didn't get much to eat there.</span> <span id="s179">I remember I stole sometimes an apple, or I put in a sandwich under my pillow that at night when I came to my bed that I had something to eat– because there was, really nothing to eat there.</span> <span id="s180">These people – when I was there a few months, they had another Jewish family and they took in; an professor it was there–I met his wife, and they came upstairs and they want to use me also as a maid.</span> <span id="s181">I didn't let it.</span> <span id="s182">They had, they wanted I cleaned the oven and things like that, and I didn't do that.</span> <span id="s183">Because I was so very lonely and so unhappy, one day they told me that not far from them is another Jewish family hidden; and, I want to go and visit them.</span> <span id="s184">And I was very happy that I could talk with somebody.</span> <span id="s185">So after three months being alone in, in that, locked up in that house and not really having to talk with anybody.</span> <span id="s186">And they were very Christian.</span> <span id="s187">They really tried me to get over to their religion too, but, you know, it was very – it was not very pleasant time.</span> <span id="s188">I went, to this family, and the moment that I came into this family's house, the police came.</span> <span id="s189">And, I was very sure that I was safe because I had a passport and it was – every Jew in Holland had to have a passport with a “J” on it, and the underground took my “J” out of the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Well, I didn't know that you hold it to the light that you can see the J, so I came there and I – and when the police came.</span> <span id="s191">There were also police what were with the German.</span> <span id="s192">Dutch police that went over to NSBas they called them; and when police came I say I'm a nurse and have come to help these people.</span> <span id="s193">And so they took my passport and hold it to the light and they saw the “J” and that was it.</span> <span id="s194">So there wasn't – there was a family hidden there, a lawyer.</span> <span id="s195">And what I didn't know, the people where I was hidden were traitors.</span> <span id="s196">That what I heard when I came back.</span> <span id="s197">Twenty-eight Jews are caught after that I, after that I was the first one what was hidden there; and nothing happened to the people what lived in the house.</span> <span id="s198">Always when the German found Jews in an house, they took the whole family – most of the time the whole family, but sometimes just the men.</span> <span id="s199">And there never was happen something to these people, but I didn't know.</span> <span id="s200">I heard it all after the war.</span> <span id="s201">These men went to jail, but because I didn't know, after the war I, I testified for that they saved – that what I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">3 National Socialistische Beweging (Dutch); National Socialist Movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">01:19:00 Later on I heard what was happened to them.</span> <span id="s204">So anyway, the police tried to get to know from me where I was hidden, but I didn't want to tell because I thought I know there was another Jewish family there, and they have a chance then to, to get away.</span> <span id="s205">And so I didn't tell them; and the people where I was caught told them.</span> <span id="s206">So in the evening I had to go back to the place where I was hidden and they went to my room.</span> <span id="s207">I was in the attic.</span> <span id="s208">I had a room in the attic.</span> <span id="s209">And they opened the bed and they found that sandwich what I told you what I put sometimes under my pillow what I was very hungry.</span> <span id="s210">And they say, "See!</span> <span id="s211">Look what the Jews did!</span> <span id="s212">You know – see, you give them to eat and still she steals from you!"</span> <span id="s213">I remember that very – there's not many things that I remember, but that I remember.</span> <span id="s214">So anyway I don't remember what I took with me or how, but I remember I had to go back to the police station in Utrecht.</span> <span id="s215">I was a week in the police station in Utrecht.</span> <span id="s216">I could have got away from there.</span> <span id="s217">I had a brother what was married and he was hidden in Utrecht, and I visit him and I didn't get along with my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s218">I still – she's still alive.</span> <span id="s219">I don't get along with her.</span> <span id="s220">Anyway, the, the kids were very small; and it was very dirty and it was very poor.</span> <span id="s221">And I thought, "When I have to go to my brother…."</span> <span id="s222">I, I just didn't want to.</span> <span id="s223">So the, the police asked me in Utrecht – they know that I could get away, so there was an underground already what I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">That was already 1942, October 1942.</span> <span id="s225">I didn't know that there was the underground already in Holland, very strong.</span> <span id="s226">And, when I and – I say “no.”</span> <span id="s227">I did – my mother didn't give me any money.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't have any money; and I thought when you have no money, where do I go?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">You know, you have to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s230">So I didn't, go away, and, that – I remember that, many times they tried to get me out, so in 19– then I went, from there I went to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s231">In Amsterdam I was, in jail.</span> <span id="s232">I was three months in jail in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s234">How did you get to Amsterdam?</span> <span id="s235">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And– 01:21:48</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s238">I was together in Utrecht in jail with this family.</span> <span id="s239">I don't remember much about it.</span> <span id="s240">I remember they had a police, they always – I was young – I was nineteen, in between – young, good looking at that time, and the head of the police tried to get me also– something that he wants to take me to his house and – I don't know, there was something not so good.</span> <span id="s241">So, I don't remember how we came to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s242">I think by truck, or with a bus; I have no idea, I don't remember that at all.</span> <span id="s243">I came – I remember we came to Amsterdam in – was in jail.</span> <span id="s244">I was three months in jail.</span> <span id="s245">I remember my family I had in Amsterdam knew about it, and they sent me some – sometimes things to jail, but, I do – I was in a cell with, seven – several – eight, nine women.</span> <span id="s246">We didn't get much to eat, every – everybody – we were with a professor's wife, and a doctor's wife, and a girl from, beautician, and somebody else from the street; and I, I, you know, it is really very worldly.</span> <span id="s247">It was the first time that in my life I met really people what told me things about the world, when I was brought up in a very small town, a very – confined to a smaller group, area.</span> <span id="s248">Anyway, we were three months – I remember once I was laughing.</span> <span id="s249">There was – the girl, the woman what opened, what gives us our food, was, was a very mean German woman.</span> <span id="s250">And I started once laughing, and she say, "Do you have a brother that work in so and so hotel?"</span> <span id="s251">And my brother was in a hotel school, and he had to work in a hotel; and she was their maid.</span> <span id="s252">So she remembers my brother.</span> <span id="s253">And after that we got better food and we could share that together with the girls in the room.</span> <span id="s254">I remember also – I smoked in that time – and I had cigarette and I had no matches.</span> <span id="s255">I remember I was sitting hours hold my cigarette on the lamp perhaps it started making fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">But it didn't work.</span> <span id="s257">So I give the cigarettes on this, on this woman, what was, she was very happy with.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">01:24:00 There was also one woman what I remember was very beautiful and had very blond long hair.</span> <span id="s259">And she came from – her fath– her husband had an, factory from hats; and she smuggled out all these little papers and she put it in somewhere and she got it out and she got money in and she was really a, a very rich woman.</span> <span id="s260">I remember I came in, and we went after there to another concentration camp; and she was already together with the head of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s261">So I was three months in that ca– in, in the jail in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Were they all Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yeah, they were all Jews.</span> <span id="s264">They were all Jews.</span> <span id="s265">I was over Christmas there till beginning of January; I think the first or the second of January.</span> <span id="s266">And it, it was a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s267">We went also out.</span> <span id="s268">They took us out every day and we had to walk around, so like you see in movies, we had to walk around, and – but they didn't, didn't hit us.</span> <span id="s269">They didn't do any, punishments to us; but we didn't get much to eat.</span> <span id="s270">And it was – you didn't know what was happen, what would happen to you.</span> <span id="s271">After three months we had to go out, and I remember we went to an office and we were standing there with a whole bunch of Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s272">Girls from my age, seven, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old.</span> <span id="s273">I was already along between twenty years old then.</span> <span id="s274">Getting a little bit older.</span> <span id="s275">So, we were standing there.</span> <span id="s276">I remember one girl was singing, that song, a German song, that – what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s277">I – we met there also one of the girls what was a survivor, Ursula, Ursula Stern – Ula Stern – and we, we somehow stick together.</span> <span id="s278">Mimie Katz was one of the girls' name, and we somehow stick together from that point on.</span> <span id="s279">We went together to another concentration camp in Holland, Ought.</span> <span id="s280">That was the – just the opening from the concentration camp when we came there.</span> <span id="s281">It was 1943 and we were one of the first people what came there, because we didn't have any blankets and it was in January.</span> <span id="s282">We didn't have any blanket.</span> <span id="s283">They didn't have much food there, and, there were only wo– women were separate from the men.</span> <span id="s284">The men was in the other camp, a other part; and we were in one part.</span> <span id="s285">The men had it very difficult.</span> <span id="s286">They right away shaved the hair from the men, that they didn't get to eat.</span> <span id="s287">They had to work very heavy labor, and they got punished very badly.</span> <span id="s288">Because when I went later to Westerbork I went together with these men and I met them.</span> <span id="s289">We – I was very lucky, again.</span> <span id="s290">there was a man what recognized me, what he came to our hotel, and he said, "Do you like to have a good job?"</span> <span id="s291">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s292">I – he said, "Would you like to be the head of the laundry?"</span> <span id="s293">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s294">I didn't know anything about laundry, but I thought everything is better then; perhaps it looks good.</span> <span id="s295">So I worked in the laun– laundry, and I – to assort clothes, and they were sent out.</span> <span id="s296">And most of the time the half didn't come back, so it was not so good.</span> <span id="s297">It was – everybody was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s298">We, we – the, the – what I told you the girls what we met in jail, somehow we stick a little bit together.</span> <span id="s299">I don't know why, but, we know – when we went to Westerbork, we, we also came together in the, in the same co– sitting together in the train.</span> <span id="s300">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about the, concentration camp before you – ?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: No.</span> <span id="s303">What I don't remember much.</span> <span id="s304">It was three months long.</span> <span id="s305">I know we didn't get much to eat, and I had to work there assorting clothes.</span> <span id="s306">And I, I remember the bathrooms were together and they were very – a lot of older people and, and, I don't even remember if there were showers.</span> <span id="s307">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s308">I know we didn't get much – there was no salt, and we had to eat the food without salt; and I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s309">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s310">I really don't remember much about that camp.</span> <span id="s311">I remember only that the men had it very difficult.</span> <span id="s312">But somehow I, I don't remember much.</span> <span id="s313">I may – that's – I don't – it was a very short time.</span> <span id="s314">I remember more that week what I was in, in Westerbork – where we went to with the train to Westerbork, and I was sitting together with one of the young men from my home town.</span> <span id="s315">And he was always very good looking, and I remember he was mar– he was in love with a married a woman, and he – they were sitting together and he looked awful.</span> <span id="s316">I mean he – you could see he didn't get to eat and he – he looked horrible.</span> <span id="s317">And, and, and with his wife, with his, girlfriend, what was his – and we went together to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s318">And when I came to Westerbork I remember that, we – they, they tried to get me out of the barrack where I was in, because – they couldn't get me out, because I was, hidden.</span> <span id="s319">And, and they couldn't get me out because of that, so my fa– I had – there came a brother from my mother.</span> <span id="s320">Was there for a long time, with five little children; and she was already a long time – they were already a long time in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s321">Westerbork was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s322">Westerbork was a camp, but it – what you could stay in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s323">It was safe.</span> <span id="s324">That was a camp where only people went through.</span> <span id="s325">A lot of people stayed there, and stayed there for a long time; and was very good eating and it was entertaining, and it was like a little village.</span> <span id="s326">And when you could stay in Westerbork, you were safe for your life; but when I, I couldn't stay there because I was hidden, and I was punished because of that – because – I had no chance to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: What do you mean by you were hidden?</span> <span id="s328">01:30:30</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I was hidden in, in Holland; and so I – when you, you had no chance.</span> <span id="s330">I was hidden in Holland by these not- Jewish people.</span> <span id="s331">And I – what's the word for it?</span> <span id="s332">I forget it – I write it always down, this word, and I forget always that word.</span> <span id="s333">When I speak to people I write the word down, but I forgot.</span> <span id="s334">I had no chance to come out of there, because I was punished because I was hidden in Holland.</span> <span id="s335">When you – when, when I wouldn't have been hidden; they would have taken you out of your house, you, you could have perhaps stayed there longer.</span> <span id="s336">So this uncle tried to get me out of the barracks, but we couldn't – they couldn't me out, this uncle.</span> <span id="s337">we stayed there a week, and somehow like Ula, Ursula Stern, and Mimie Katz and other – the other five girls, seven girls where we–I forgot the names from the other ones, because they went right away later to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s338">So we, just a few girls what I stayed in Sobibór with, I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s339">So we, we were in Westerbork and we were not allowed to go out of this barrack and, that was in – that was in already April.</span> <span id="s340">I was three months in Vught.</span> <span id="s341">And in April, beginning of April I think – I don't remember the date exactly; but it is – statistically, you can find it out.</span> <span id="s342">We, one morning they give us some food and we had to go a freight car; and we had to go in this freight car.</span> <span id="s343">I remember also not so much about Westerbork either.</span> <span id="s344">I don't know, you know, forty years long we never talked about anything.</span> <span id="s345">And when I – when we talk to people I tell them more about – not about this – I tell more about....</span> <span id="s346">So I don't remember much about that, the little episodes.</span> <span id="s347">I remember they didn't do us any harm, and there were no German.</span> <span id="s348">Only there was all Jew what we saw, what worked with us in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s349">And you didn't see – I didn't see any German.</span> <span id="s350">There were Germans more outside and, you know, in different places.</span> <span id="s351">But in the camp were only Jews – in so, in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s352">I, I remember now that we had to go into the train.</span> <span id="s353">This uncle what was in Westerbork went with the same transport to Sobibór as I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">01:33:00 We went in the first – that was the first transport what went to Sobibór in freight wagons.</span> <span id="s355">till now they all went in pass – in regular trains, passagiertrein, and I was the first one that went.</span> <span id="s356">We went the first one that went in freight trains.</span> <span id="s357">The freight trains, they put some straw on the ground and there was a barrel for the toilet in the corner; and I don't remember – I think it was open but I don't remember exactly, what we had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s358">So – and now we were so, about 60 people they put in the train.</span> <span id="s359">And it was very, scary feeling.</span> <span id="s360">I remember we were all very nervous.</span> <span id="s361">We did – these young girls; we stick together also like we stick together in Westerbork, we stick together and we sat together in that train, in the train.</span> <span id="s362">I think we got some food, because I don't remember they were hungry.</span> <span id="s363">But, the – there were – in that time we say all Germans were standing outside in Westerbork; and when the train got closed with the door, and the lock on it, and there was just a little window on top, we were very afraid and we were very scared.</span> <span id="s364">There were a lot of older people in the train, and, and everybody wants to look through this window; but we were afraid because the Germans were shooting later on.</span> <span id="s365">When we went away, we stopped many times.</span> <span id="s366">The train stopped many times.</span> <span id="s367">And many times was always shooting on the outside and they were with dogs on the outside, and we could see through this little windows and we could see that people did like that to us.</span> <span id="s368">And we didn't know what it was, what it means.</span> <span id="s369">We thought just antisemites.</span> <span id="s370">You know, they want to have us dead.</span> <span id="s371">We went farther and farther.</span> <span id="s372">And the farther we went – see, we come from Holland and Holland is a little like America; it's small, very sophisticated, little town and you still see more poor, poor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">4 Passenger-train (Dutch)</span></p> <p><span id="s374">01:35:00 And the farther we came, the poorer the poor people looked, and, and after three days they – we thought we were in Russia.</span> <span id="s375">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s376">Also, we didn't have – and I thought I go to my mother.</span> <span id="s377">The only thing also in Utrecht, already I thought, “I want to go to my mother and my brothers.”</span> <span id="s378">But I forgot to tell you when I was hidden the, the woman – the man what brought me to Utrecht was my English teacher; and his wife came to me when I was in – hidden in, in Utrecht, and she's told me one day that my mother on the way out of the house – she was planning to go hide somewhere – somebody told the Germans that my mother wants to go and hide somewhere and they caught my mother.</span> <span id="s379">And they send my mother already to Poland, and my brothers too.</span> <span id="s380">My two brothers, and one brother was just married also.</span> <span id="s381">And so, so I, I wanted to go to my mother.</span> <span id="s382">That's the all what I thought about it; also when I was in Utrecht, I wanted to go to my mother.</span> <span id="s383">That's the only thing what I thought about.</span> <span id="s384">And so I didn't want to go, really, hide somewhere because I didn't know there was the underground already that you that you had a chance to save a– somewhere that somebody would take you in.</span> <span id="s385">And, so when I went to, was in Westerbork I thought the only thing what I could, go to my mother; and that was that's that we all thought, the girls that were together with me what had already the family were, were, away, thought also they go to their family.</span> <span id="s386">So we had no idea that Holland – in Holland was, was no antisemitism.</span> <span id="s387">We didn't grow up with antisemitism.</span> <span id="s388">We didn't grow up to be afraid, that you say something and, and, and it would something happen to you.</span> <span id="s389">And so, we had no idea what would happen to us.</span> <span id="s390">So after three days and three nights, we, we came to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s391">What, what were – yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I was just going to say – can you recall anything else about the train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I just can recall about the train ride that it was very scary.</span> <span id="s394">And how farther we went, how more the people did like that when we were fighting always what who can look outside; so when we could look outside we were very happy.</span> <span id="s395">And, and then when we saw these people, what they did to us – we had no idea and that's also what I recall, that – I don't recall that we were hungry.</span> <span id="s396">I remember we didn't have anything to drink.</span> <span id="s397">That I remember – we were very thirsty, what was already very hot – I think was very hot – I don't know – we were very thirsty.</span> <span id="s398">And we didn't have anything to drink and I think there had to be – and I remember there was a barrel and I think it was hidden because I don't – we were – all the people and, and we couldn't – everybody was sitting on the ground.</span> <span id="s399">We had nowhere – nowhere else to sit and in, in the straw, but that's all that I remember, that it was very scary, that we know where we go.</span> <span id="s400">Well, we had no idea where we went.</span> <span id="s401">I remember that we came out at Sobibór.</span> <span id="s402">They opened the, the doors; and then we heard screaming and with the whips throwing, and we heard, "Raus!</span> <span id="s403">Raus!</span> <span id="s404">Raus!"</span> <span id="s405">That we had to go out of the train with whips and, and hitting us already, and, and everybody stumbled over each other.</span> <span id="s406">And I remember there was a trolley.</span> <span id="s407">You know, was a trolley, little kipcarthat goes over.</span> <span id="s408">And we saw all the people what couldn't walk, throwing in them; and little children went in that trolley.</span> <span id="s409">And it was very 5 Get out!</span> <span id="s410">(German) 6 Dump cart (Dutch) confusing, you know, and we had to throw away our baggage, that little package what, what, backpack what we had.</span> <span id="s411">We had to throw that in, in, in a place.</span> <span id="s412">I remember vividly also that one woman throwed away her package and her baby went, and, and, she said to German, "Oh, my child!</span> <span id="s413">My child!"</span> <span id="s414">And he had a whip and said he, and he hit this woman and saw blood from her face coming and said, "We will take care of this baby.</span> <span id="s415">You go!"</span> <span id="s416">So then we went farther and we stick somehow together with these young girls.</span> <span id="s417">And we passed all these Germans.</span> <span id="s418">The – all, all the SS's were standing there on the side, and we passed all these Germans; and they say, "You're out.</span> <span id="s419">You're out."</span> <span id="s420">And they pull us out, and we settled on the side.</span> <span id="s421">When I was in jail in Amsterdam, one of the girls–one these women what I told you about the blond hair–say she wants to go always with a German to bed and she thought when she get pregnant perhaps she can get out of jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">01:40:00 So I didn't know really what she means what she say.</span> <span id="s423">But I say to the girls – we didn't know what had happened to us – we stay on the side; and I say to the girls, "What will happen to us?"</span> <span id="s424">"One shower," she always say, "one bath, and it is all over."</span> <span id="s425">I remember I say to the girls, "One bath and it is all over."</span> <span id="s426">I didn't know even what she was talking about.</span> <span id="s427">So we standing there together and we didn't know what's happened to us, if the Germans will use us – we had no idea.</span> <span id="s428">We were just standing there on the side.</span> <span id="s429">I think, I think we were ten or twelve or twenty – I don't know exactly how many girls.</span> <span id="s430">That's the first transport that took young girls, Dutch, Dutch young girls out.</span> <span id="s431">We were the first Dutch people, and we were standing on the side and when we saw the trans– we saw all the people passing by.</span> <span id="s432">We saw the – I think the women went first, and then the men went at last.</span> <span id="s433">But I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s434">I remember – saw them walking already that side to the to the gas chamber, that they had to take their clothes off.</span> <span id="s435">And I remember that also that I, we heard them speaking to the group of us standing there, and say, "You came to Sobibór, and everything will be okay,” and we– “Here is a little card.</span> <span id="s436">You can write home that you are here in Sobibór and that you are – you go to a work camp.”</span> <span id="s437">And we have to take a shower because the – it it's better for you that you take a shower; so we can, we will give you other clothes."</span> <span id="s438">That I remember – that they were talking to them.</span> <span id="s439">What, what they say exactly, I perhaps remember what I read later about it.</span> <span id="s440">But I remember that they talking to them, that they say, "Here is a card.</span> <span id="s441">You can write to Holland."</span> <span id="s442">For us, we were standing on the side and they brought us to Camp One.</span> <span id="s443">Sobibór was divided in–</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: How long did you stand on the side like that?</span> <span id="s445">01:42:00</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: So long that the people came and they were gone.</span> <span id="s447">So the men was on the right side – of the men went first, and then that was nobody there.</span> <span id="s448">Was nobody there anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Where did they all go?</span> <span id="s450">All the–?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: We couldn't see it.</span> <span id="s452">We were standing on a spot that I – they were already going to the gas chamber, because Sobibór was a death camp.</span> <span id="s453">They – everybody went straight to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s454">There was just a very small camp.</span> <span id="s455">When we came, there was a very small group of people just what was living and, and working in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s456">So all the – I don't remember – all the two thousand people that we came with went straight to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s457">So the one group went already to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s458">We went then to where we slept.</span> <span id="s459">The camp was divided in three parts.</span> <span id="s460">One camp part we slept, and one camp part we worked and one part was Lager DreiOne – Camp One, Camp Two, Camp Three.</span> <span id="s461">We called "Lagers."</span> <span id="s462">Lager Drei was the death camp.</span> <span id="s463">When you were once there, or even looked at there, you never came back.</span> <span id="s464">So we – they brought us to Camp One.</span> <span id="s465">When we came on in Camp One, I saw people from my home town.</span> <span id="s466">I saw boys what I grew up with, as far back as their father and mother were my best – my parent's best friends.</span> <span id="s467">And I remember I saw one boy what, what, what, stayed with us in the hotel–in the wartime, in 1941–because he had to go out of his house.</span> <span id="s468">The German took his house, and he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s469">And I was so happy to see them.</span> <span id="s470">I said, "Hi, how are you?"</span> <span id="s471">And I waved to them.</span> <span id="s472">He was just standing there and he didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s473">And they were very scary and they didn't answer us.</span> <span id="s474">So they went to work first, and, then we went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">01:44:00 And we came to a barrack, and we had to assort clothes.</span> <span id="s476">We had to assort clothes.</span> <span id="s477">We had to do, first quality, and second quality; and we had to look after what was in the pockets we had to take out.</span> <span id="s478">And we had to empty, the knapsacks we had to empty.</span> <span id="s479">You know, I didn't know what I was doing.</span> <span id="s480">I had no – that I remember vividly – I had no idea that thinking that it was from people that that what came on.</span> <span id="s481">It was very stupid, but I didn't – I had no – I remember that we all assorted the clothes.</span> <span id="s482">And then after, four or five o'clock, I had to assort even the clothes.</span> <span id="s483">I remember that there was also the clothes from this uncle, from the man with the five children, was also in this transport.</span> <span id="s484">I – at five o'clock we had to go on a roll call, go out on a roll call, and we were brought to Lager One where we slept.</span> <span id="s485">And we came to Lager One, we had to dance for the Germans.</span> <span id="s486">There were some Jews what, what had instruments, what were already longer in camp and they had some instrument.</span> <span id="s487">In between the fire was burning and you could smell, you know, the – from bones and the hair – and the fire was burning and there was – that was like over, over the whole camp.</span> <span id="s488">Was very big, very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">And we had to dance.</span> <span id="s490">The Germans were standing there laughing and having fun and some – I don't know exactly, but some of the Jews had an instrument.</span> <span id="s491">They were playing the music, like a sub-distance from the Germans and it was an order that we had to dance.</span> <span id="s492">And Chaim, my husband, asked me to dance; and that was the first time that I met Chaim.</span> <span id="s493">I remember he looked terrible.</span> <span id="s494">He had no hair and had some hat on, and strange pants he wore.</span> <span id="s495">He wore always two pants because, when they hit him then it didn't hurt so much.</span> <span id="s496">So he had another pants on, and, and I – it was very strange.</span> <span id="s497">I, I, I don't remember much about that dancing really, but I remember we had to dance.</span> <span id="s498">When I went away from that I met these Dutch boys what I remember from my home town.</span> <span id="s499">And they told me, "Do you know what that fire 7 camp three (German) means?"</span> <span id="s500">And I say, "No."</span> <span id="s501">And they, they were all married and all the wives went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s502">And they cried, and they told me.</span> <span id="s503">And it was very upsetting.</span> <span id="s504">I still, I still couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s505">I think it took me a long time to think about it; that with all these people I came with, that they were dead and – you know?</span> <span id="s506">So, after that we talked together, we got very close.</span> <span id="s507">They, they were very hungry.</span> <span id="s508">They, we didn't get anything to eat in, in the camp.</span> <span id="s509">They didn't work with the barracks.</span> <span id="s510">They worked some place else.</span> <span id="s511">I was lucky that I start working with assorting clothes; so I had a chance to steal food from the, from the backpacks what the Dutch people brought when there was transport.</span> <span id="s512">They didn't have a chance to, to get anything.</span> <span id="s513">So after a very short time, there was a German, German Jew, and he was a traitor.</span> <span id="s514">Chaim, my husband, always say, "He wants to be holier than the Pope," this guy.</span> <span id="s515">And he told the Germans that the Dutch men– there were seventy-two Dutch men in camp–that they want to run away.</span> <span id="s516">We never know if it was truth or if it was just a lie.</span> <span id="s517">We really never know, but after a very short time that we were in camp – and I don't remember have long contact with the Dutch, young men – I remember they had to go on, on roll call.</span> <span id="s518">They had to, Ap– on Appelland they – I remember one of the boys – Zeehandelaar was the last name, Maurits Zeehandelaar – he had a little piece of butter and he brought it to me; says he, "When I come back, save it for me."</span> <span id="s519">So he give me the little piece of butter and he – they were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Seventy-two Dutch boys were shot, so they never came back.</span> <span id="s521">So I don't remember much talking to them.</span> <span id="s522">So that was a very short time that we was – after I was in camp that they got shot.</span> <span id="s523">I, I remember we didn't get much to eat.</span> <span id="s524">In the morning we got some black water and bread.</span> <span id="s525">It was for the whole day.</span> <span id="s526">It was like clay.</span> <span id="s527">It was very sour and you couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s528">I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s529">And were – and I remember that from the beginning the Dutch people always tried to get that bread; and we, I gave it to them because, we could we could eat some, we could steal and we had together with us some – we could make some food.</span> <span id="s530">So, they were very hungry.</span> <span id="s531">Later on we get more Dutch people in camp.</span> <span id="s532">Later on there come more Dutch.</span> <span id="s533">I somehow the Dutch were always, came to us and they wanted to have some food from the others.</span> <span id="s534">We had a little group of people.</span> <span id="s535">Some – later on came also, a cousin of mine came to camp, to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s536">And so I, we – and Mimie Katz was another Dutch girl what I was with in camp, and Ula.</span> <span id="s537">We had – we shared our food in the evening when we came together and we helped each other when we got sick and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">01:50:30 We – most of the time we worked assorting clothes.</span> <span id="s539">When there came no transport, we had to work in the woods and clean the woods.</span> <span id="s540">Just there was no work there in that camp.</span> <span id="s541">Or we had to clean the railway, rail, railroad.</span> <span id="s542">Or we had to throw out the ashes from the – what we got.</span> <span id="s543">We didn't get it.</span> <span id="s544">They brought it.</span> <span id="s545">In the fields, and we had to assort – throw it in the fields for, fertilizing, the ashes.</span> <span id="s546">So I got typhus.</span> <span id="s547">I got sick on typhus.</span> <span id="s548">So there's a big part in Sobibór what I don't remember, because I got typhus.</span> <span id="s549">And you was not allowed to be sick in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s550">Everybody what was sick went straight to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s551">I remember what I was sick and one day I stayed in, in the barrack.</span> <span id="s552">The barrack had no toilet.</span> <span id="s553">We were not – we had there was a pail and that was our bathroom; and we slept in two rows, three rows, three.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">8 roll call (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s555">The floor and three rows, and we all with the lice a very short time, and there was –once there was another animal but also red and that was full and that little bit food what was sometimes had to put under the pillow and, and were the mice.</span> <span id="s556">I remember one day I put a pillow up and it was all mice with little babies under my pillow with that what – and we were already – I remember I was so upset from the first lice what I had that Chaim – I was on already – Chaim fell right away in love with me, so that was a big help for me too; you know, that, that the time in Sobibór was not so difficult if I would have been alone.</span> <span id="s557">But Chaim was already six months longer in camp.</span> <span id="s558">Now Chaim was really a girlfriend with somebody else, with Esther Raab – what was interviewed here – and I think she was jealous.</span> <span id="s559">Chaim right away fell in love with me, so he was a big help for me and all the time in the camp, because I don't think when I wouldn't have Chaim, I wouldn't have made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Ultimately, definitely not out of camp.</span> <span id="s561">But when I was sick Chaim took me to the bathroom and made me walk and, he brought me, I think, food.</span> <span id="s562">I don't remember much from the time when that I had typhus because I was very sick and you had to go to work.</span> <span id="s563">And because of Chaim, and also because of the girlfriends what I had – I say they helped me through this time because that I remember.</span> <span id="s564">Later on they told that I fell sometimes asleep and they hide me when we had to clean the woods, so they hide me some where that I was sleeping.</span> <span id="s565">And also one day, Frenzelcame out.</span> <span id="s566">Frenzel was one of the worst SS's in camp; and he came to the camp, Camp One, and he went, with the whip he went in the barrack in and everybody was sick, had to go out and had to stay on the middle and I remember so vividly, was also a boy that I know from Assen, from another town, from the Zionist organization, and he was standing there and, and they all was standing on a long time in the middle on the camp and they all got shot, right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">01:54:00 When I – then he screamed and, and I came out and he recognized me; and I don't remember if it was Wagneror Frenzel – now one of the two – I mixed it up – he say to me, "Go back to work!"</span> <span id="s568">So I could go back to work.</span> <span id="s569">Just luck.</span> <span id="s570">Frenzel picked me out, too; and Frenzel somehow always picked me out.</span> <span id="s571">When I had a very heavy work – I don't know why – just luck.</span> <span id="s572">He picked me out and give me easier work.</span> <span id="s573">We had sometimes to go in the woods and picking mushrooms for the Germans, some of the girls.</span> <span id="s574">I remember I put everything, the mushrooms, I put them in my bra and in my underpants, and when we came home we cooked them in a little something what, what the Polish girls had; and then we had to go out and picking blueberries sometimes, but we were not allowed to eat them.</span> <span id="s575">So when we came back then we had to show our tongue if we had one.</span> <span id="s576">And we were very hungry in that time.</span> <span id="s577">When there came no transports, we were very hungry, because you couldn't save the food because the mice and the and the rats, they, they took away under your pillow.</span> <span id="s578">So we were very hungry.</span> <span id="s579">Somehow Frenzel, when I had very heavy work – we has also to go in the woods and cutting trees and bringing from one place to the other, or filling up these trolleys, what the people came in, with sand.</span> <span id="s580">And that we had to do on the – they were the Germans, 9 Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel 10 Oberscharführer Gustav Wagner also the, the Kaposwith the whip in back of us, and they – we had to put it somewhere.</span> <span id="s581">You know, when there didn't came transport.</span> <span id="s582">So we were terrible.</span> <span id="s583">We are like animals already, because we were happy when there came a transport; because we know when it comes in a long time no transport, we go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s584">And when there come already transport, when they coming, then we were happy that they came.</span> <span id="s585">When there came transport from Holland, everything went very smoothly.</span> <span id="s586">And there came also transports from Poland, and when there came transports from Poland, was – we were locked up in our area and there was always shooting.</span> <span id="s587">There came also a transport from Belzec – my husband will tell that story from Belzec, that transport.</span> <span id="s588">I remember that we got locked up in our things and we thought, “that's the end of us.”</span> <span id="s589">There was shooting and there was screaming and there was – it, it was very scary; and that was from Belzec.</span> <span id="s590">They didn't want to go to the gas chamber, so they shot them on the spot.</span> <span id="s591">And many times when transports came from, from Poles – Polish Jews, they didn't want to go to the gas chamber because they know they went through the gas – that they went.</span> <span id="s592">So they just shot them on the spot.</span> <span id="s593">So, it was also many times we had to stay on roll call the whole night because an animal walked on one of the mines; because Sobibór was with, mines three times or two times and sometimes an animal walked on there – I don't know what kind of an animal – and then we had to stay the whole night on roll call.</span> <span id="s594">And we always made so out that, Chaim and I, that we stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">01:58:00 You know, he always made sure that we always – when also once what is that there was, some Jews ran away.</span> <span id="s596">Two Jews ran away.</span> <span id="s597">They made it, too.</span> <span id="s598">And we had to go back and we stayed on roll call.</span> <span id="s599">And Chaim, Chaim had – the men had to stay separate and the women had to stay separate.</span> <span id="s600">And we stayed in Lager One on roll call, and they cut, they picked out every tenth person.</span> <span id="s601">So okay, imagine how what a nervous wreck I was – they picked out every tenth person, so it could have been Chaim.</span> <span id="s602">Chaim was number nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: They're going to change the tape.</span> <span id="s604">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: They're going to change the tape.</span> <span id="s606">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 11 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s609">[Technical conversation] 02:00:27</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Where did we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: You were talking about standing in line and how they selected every ten people, and your husband–</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s613">Yeah.</span> <span id="s614">And he was number one – nine.</span> <span id="s615">He was number nine, and, and they were all shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">I remember so vividly, there was one woman, and one man was number ten and his girlfriend or his wife was there.</span> <span id="s617">And she say, "When he goes, I go with him."</span> <span id="s618">So she went also with him and they got shot.</span> <span id="s619">You hear, you hear the shooting.</span> <span id="s620">Shooting was – killing was nothing.</span> <span id="s621">You know, you live with the minute.</span> <span id="s622">You live with the second.</span> <span id="s623">I mean somebody died or somebody could – I mean you lived in such a fear, every minute of the day, that you don't know one day of the other, you know.</span> <span id="s624">And, and every time when I saw Chaim or if he saw me, we were happy that we were still alive.</span> <span id="s625">We were always together.</span> <span id="s626">They called us bride and "bruidegom," because we were always together.</span> <span id="s627">We tried always be together.</span> <span id="s628">So and you know, I, I was like a tomboy.</span> <span id="s629">I was always the only girl from four, from four children; and I grew up and I was the youngest so I grew up with my four brothers.</span> <span id="s630">So I remember that Chaim always calmed me down.</span> <span id="s631">And he was always sure that, that nobody really knows us, that we went and so, you know; he calmed me down.</span> <span id="s632">I stole a lot of food always from the packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">02:02:00 And what was very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s634">When they would caught us, they shoot me right away, straight.</span> <span id="s635">And, and I remember, once the they, they killed some people in the woods.</span> <span id="s636">There were – a group of men had to work in the woods and cutting trees; and they had a plan to run away.</span> <span id="s637">And when they were in the woods they, they killed some from the Ukrainians, what were also what take care of them.</span> <span id="s638">And they, they were Polish Jews, not Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s639">Dutch Jews, they didn't think about running away.</span> <span id="s640">Because we know we didn't – where could we run?</span> <span id="s641">We don't know Polish, and where could we run?</span> <span id="s642">So they didn't – but they were the Polish Jews, and they killed and they ran away.</span> <span id="s643">And some got alive out.</span> <span id="s644">But most of the Dutch Jews, they shot a bunch and they caught them and they put them, they brought them back.</span> <span id="s645">And we had to stay on roll call, and we – I had a lot of food in my coat.</span> <span id="s646">I remember I put it in a coat.</span> <span id="s647">I don't how, how come that I had a coat – something over my arm.</span> <span id="s648">I remember.</span> <span id="s649">And one woman was crying when her husband – it was a Dutch woman – who got killed and I know they wouldn't do anything to her.</span> <span id="s650">So I say, "Will you take my coat?"</span> <span id="s651">And she took my coat; because I know for sure they wouldn't do, they wouldn't look over her</span></p> <p><span id="s652">12 bridegroom (Dutch) if she would have some food when she was crying.</span> <span id="s653">And they had sometimes, you know, some feeling for the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s654">And they too – didn't take me to look over my clothes, but they took some of the other people look if they had food with them.</span> <span id="s655">After that we had to go on roll call on a big place, and we were standing.</span> <span id="s656">And again Chaim and I were standing next to each other; and they took a bunch of people and we had to stand 10 or 20 people–I don't remember the amount–and they had to stand farther up, and they will shoot them.</span> <span id="s657">They were planned to shoot them.</span> <span id="s658">My system was always– and was perhaps because I do a lot now when we see a movie where we don't want to see, we take it away right away – I never looked, so they shoot these 10 people.</span> <span id="s659">We had to stay all on roll call together, the whole camp; and we had to look what will happen to you when you do things like and they all shoot them.</span> <span id="s660">I didn't look.</span> <span id="s661">I saw them later that the Germans went again and shoot them again, that I that I remember, but I didn't see them falling.</span> <span id="s662">I remember one person seeing falling of that, that what I think I saw; but I remember that they went back and they all shot them again.</span> <span id="s663">And there were all because they want to show us what will happen to us if we will do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s664">Also I remember vividly that one boy opened a can of sardines, and they, they almost killed him.</span> <span id="s665">His, his arm was almost – he was almost dead.</span> <span id="s666">They put him on a piece of wood, and we had to also trade – and the whole– everybody what worked in the barracks had to go on a roll call and we had to watch this boy, and that was Wagner said, "That will happen to you.</span> <span id="s667">When you open a can of sardines, or you eat anything from the things what coming on.</span> <span id="s668">That will happen to you!"</span> <span id="s669">So, I remember this boy laying there and we know this boy.</span> <span id="s670">You know, some of the things stays in your mind what, what happened to people.</span> <span id="s671">I remember also once a man was standing and he did something wrong, and Wagner took a shovel and cut his head in two pieces.</span> <span id="s672">You know, and I see him also standing there, this man, and then he dropped dead.</span> <span id="s673">Once was a Kappa.</span> <span id="s674">He was laying in bed– a young boy from 15, 16 years old, and he was a very nice kid and– Pim was his name, I think, Pim, and Frenzel – Wagner came in and say, "Out!</span> <span id="s675">Up!</span> <span id="s676">Up!</span> <span id="s677">You have to go up!</span> <span id="s678">You have to go on– there comes a transport.</span> <span id="s679">You have to go out and work!"</span> <span id="s680">And he put with his whip, like that– out, as a joke.</span> <span id="s681">He, he was asleep, and Wagner took him out and shot him.</span> <span id="s682">You know, your life was, was nothing.</span> <span id="s683">You know, that I think what I remember, I remember that when we go from work and we had to go home, we had to sing, and we had to go down and up.</span> <span id="s684">There was a punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">02:07:00 You had lay down, "hinlegen und aufstehen" it was in German.</span> <span id="s686">You had to lay down and you had to go up, and you had to lay down on the order from the Germans.</span> <span id="s687">All punishment.</span> <span id="s688">We had to sing very nice.</span> <span id="s689">Many times we had to sing on the inside of the hall where were slept.</span> <span id="s690">We had to walk around, in – 10 people together– like in the Sing Sing when they – and it was – I think I saw movies from the Sing Sing, as a child, and I remember always like a Sing Sing.</span> <span id="s691">And it was beautiful singing.</span> <span id="s692">When there were already Russian Jews came, the Russian transport came already and also the Polish Jews; and we had to walk around and sing, Russian and Polish songs, and German songs.</span> <span id="s693">I was six months in, in camp.</span> <span id="s694">When I 13 Lay down and get up!</span> <span id="s695">(German) look back, it I can't remember that it was six months; because I was a long time sick so there was a big part what I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: How long were you sick?</span> <span id="s697">02:08:00</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s699">I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s700">But I was sick.</span> <span id="s701">a week, six weeks.</span> <span id="s702">Chaim always covered up for me, a lot of times.</span> <span id="s703">And also my girls, the girls – the–Ula, Ursula Stern–what I did from the beginning for them when they was sick, or we could help each other.</span> <span id="s704">You have to have somebody what covers up for you in a camp, if not you couldn't live.</span> <span id="s705">You lived – I slept together with Mimie Katz – she came from Holland, Haarlem – and Ula, where I slept in the middle.</span> <span id="s706">So when something, we, we could help each other, that's what we did, so, after the – I don't – I, I remember that the camp got bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s707">More people from, Minsk, from the Minsk – was a ghetto in Minsk.</span> <span id="s708">And people from Minsk came over, and we made big barracks, the building – big barracks in Sobibór and we all were very scared because there came no transports.</span> <span id="s709">They didn't come transports, and so we didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s710">And then, when the Minsk transport came these guy from Ger– from Russia, Sash, Sasha, Sash – he just died not long ago.</span> <span id="s711">he came with a group of Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s712">And I didn't talk with these, all these people, because, we Dutch people were, were like – they think did the Dutch – the Polish Jews hold together tremendous, and some of the young girls, had friends with the, with the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s713">So, Katty Gokkes, she was also a Dutch girl, and she had – with one of the Kapos she was friendly.</span> <span id="s714">She was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s715">The German, the Polish Jews thought she was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s716">And she had friendship with one of the Polish Jews and so that's the reason, she knows everything; and she could tell Ula.</span> <span id="s717">But so, when you didn't have a Polish friend – the, the Polish stick tremendous together.</span> <span id="s718">They spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s719">We didn't speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s720">In Holland, they didn't spoke Yiddish; so we spoke German but not Yiddish, so, we were goyim, we were not Jews.</span> <span id="s721">In the eyes from, from the, from the Polish Jews, we were not Jews.</span> <span id="s722">We were Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s723">We were at Sobibór.</span> <span id="s724">But we were not, we were – they they didn't understand that we didn't speak Yiddish, and they stick tremendous together, so when the whole thing from the uprising, we didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s725">The Dutch Jews didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s726">Ula was lucky that she knows this other girl that was also a survivor.</span> <span id="s727">It was lucky because of Katty Gokkes that she knows.</span> <span id="s728">Katty knows about that, she had a relationship with one of the Kapos.</span> <span id="s729">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s730">So, when there was already something going on and then they built very big barracks; so we went also, came in the big barracks.</span> <span id="s731">And I remember – I don't remember much about it.</span> <span id="s732">I don't remember much about it that I came to the big barrack; but I remember what it was a little bit better, what it was in that big barrack.</span> <span id="s733">There was a very big and much nicer, and I remember there was another girl – Viool was her name–that she came to Sobibór with her father and two sisters and they could sing very beautiful, and they were and they were always singing.</span> <span id="s734">And so she got also typhus and she was very sick and she had also a, a boyfriend and he left her there.</span> <span id="s735">He didn't take her – he ran away by himself.</span> <span id="s736">And there was another Dutch man – not a – from Czechoslovakia, he's alive – Kurt Thomas, and he was friendly with Katty Gokkes.</span> <span id="s737">That was his girlfriend; and when they run away and they were in the woods, he say, "Where's Katty?</span> <span id="s738">," he says.</span> <span id="s739">"I have no idea where Katie is.</span> <span id="s740">You should know.</span> <span id="s741">You should have taken her with you like Chaim did."</span> <span id="s742">So Katty Gokkes also died.</span> <span id="s743">I, I, I'm – almost everybody died.</span> <span id="s744">But anyway, I didn't know anything what was going on from the uprising.</span> <span id="s745">So one day – it was, it was very dangerous also.</span> <span id="s746">It was like a war.</span> <span id="s747">Like in, in like there is a war, just a few people know about it; so nobody – there was just a very small group know about the uprising in Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">02:12:30 And one day Chaim tells me, "Try to get some clothes.</span> <span id="s749">I tried to get some boots; and dress yourself up."</span> <span id="s750">I was already a little bit better.</span> <span id="s751">It was – I, I was already much better, and so I – there is a barrack – all the boots, all the clothes went to different barracks, different tents, big tents.</span> <span id="s752">The boots were together.</span> <span id="s753">The clothes were together.</span> <span id="s754">Oh, yeah – one thi– one day – also, my mother knitted a lot and all my clothes was always knitted.</span> <span id="s755">Especially when I go to Poland, my mother put sure that in the backpack was all warm clothes.</span> <span id="s756">And Ula, Ula Stern, was a big person and I was a big person.</span> <span id="s757">One day she couldn't find any clothes, so she went to the barrack and she – coincident, she took one of the dresses what my mother knitted.</span> <span id="s758">And she came to, came to the barrack; and I remember that she had my dress on.</span> <span id="s759">I was very upset of course, it was my mother's dr– made that, so....</span> <span id="s760">But, so it was all barracks that were over, that were sent, that were sent to Poland; where they make bundles out of it.</span> <span id="s761">There were other people again what worked there.</span> <span id="s762">Other people what worked and organized everything to separate.</span> <span id="s763">And it went in the trains what went back; what when the Jews came, the trains went back with all clothes what went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s764">And that went also, before the people went to the gas chamber, the men had to go and cut their hair; and that also went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s765">Everything, also the gold; and, we had to separate gold, and many times when we had to assort the clothes we found diamonds and gold in it, and I remember once I found a whole handful of diamonds and the German saw it and he took it.</span> <span id="s766">The Germans when they went on vacation to Germany, they took the backpack full with ger– with gold and with silver and with, with everything what, what they could grab; what was, what the Germans really want for the army.</span> <span id="s767">You know?</span> <span id="s768">So, when you, when you found that you have to give it up.</span> <span id="s769">I had to assort the clothes.</span> <span id="s770">And I was not so clever, really, that I thought about that the German and they take the gold; but a lot of people took it and hide it.</span> <span id="s771">I, I always cut out all the clothes what I had assorted.</span> <span id="s772">I, I cut it in pieces, when I saw that's the only sabotage what I can do.</span> <span id="s773">You know, to cut the clothes.</span> <span id="s774">And Chaim, and when I found something what nobody could see, I give it to Chaim.</span> <span id="s775">The fireman what had to burn all the pictures and all the documents what were burned in Sobibór – Chaim, that was Chaim's best friend.</span> <span id="s776">Szmuel was his name.</span> <span id="s777">And so Chaim many times put money under it, in the bottom and that went to him and he hide that in the ground.</span> <span id="s778">That was hidden in the ground, so I when we run away, Chaim makes sure that he got some of the money.</span> <span id="s779">So, so we, we– I didn't know anything, what was the uprising or anything what was, going– absolutely had no idea.</span> <span id="s780">So when Chaim told me try to get some warm clothes; then he told me, "Take some warm clothes," and he told me that what the plan is to do.</span> <span id="s781">Then he told I was not allowed to tell it to anybody, absolutely– and that's my always and guilt feeling.</span> <span id="s782">I had a cousin there, and I didn't tell her; and the same day she say, "I will make some food," when she work in the where the laundry for the Germans and she had a chance to cook something.</span> <span id="s783">And I didn't tell her, and she didn't come out.</span> <span id="s784">And I always feel guilty that I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s785">So, I went to a barrack, and there was one German that was sometimes good.</span> <span id="s786">He didn't get also not much punishment, and he give me a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s787">And I had a lot of clothes on, what was very dumb, because when the German would have seen me with so much clothes on, he would have asked, "Why do you have so much clothes on?"</span> <span id="s788">So Chaim told me, "On four o'clock be by a big place."</span> <span id="s789">That is– and also the, the medicine, all the medicine the Dutch people brought a lot of medicine and that went also in one big place where, where they put the, the medicine, so the medicine was in that big place.</span> <span id="s790">And there he say, "Come there at four o'clock."</span> <span id="s791">So I make sure that I walked there at four o'clock.</span> <span id="s792">Everybody was working.</span> <span id="s793">Everything – nobody knows anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">02:17:00 Everything – just a very small group of people what were involved in this in this uprising.</span> <span id="s795">So everything went through normal.</span> <span id="s796">I went walked – I don't know how, how I came to that, was allowed to walk there.</span> <span id="s797">Anyway, I walked there.</span> <span id="s798">I remember also in camp, once before the uprising, that I walked somewhere and I heard that the Germans spoke to the whole group of transport people; and I saw the rabbi and the cantor from my home town, sitting there.</span> <span id="s799">And I, you know, I just – I was planned just to run to them or – but I couldn't have done anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Also, many times I saw people from my home town walking.</span> <span id="s801">There was a little window, and I saw people from my home town passing this window; and I was afraid that they would see me, you know, I made almost sure.</span> <span id="s802">Whole families I saw walking to the gas chamber, many, many times.</span> <span id="s803">And, and I couldn't say anything when even – was no way, nothing that I could do.</span> <span id="s804">Nothing that I could do.</span> <span id="s805">So I walked to Chaim, and on four o'clock, and I come there.</span> <span id="s806">I remember I walked in there, and one of the Kapos – Wieszubski was his name, yeah.</span> <span id="s807">He killed already a few Germans, and he was very nervous.</span> <span id="s808">And I say, "Take a pill for it, something for your nerves to calm down;" and he took it, and I remember and it was bitter and he spit it out.</span> <span id="s809">Says he, "I don't need it."</span> <span id="s810">So I met Chaim on the end, and there came – there wasn't – Chaim was not involved in the uprising, but somehow he say to me, “come there” and from there we will always go somehow in the area for roll call.</span> <span id="s811">So he want to be sure that we are together when there is a roll call.</span> <span id="s812">And there was a boy standing there and he was involved, he was in the uprising involved, and he had to kill one German.</span> <span id="s813">Together with the Kapo, with Wieszubski, and he say – I was standing together with him and Chaim – he say, "I'm afraid to go."</span> <span id="s814">Said Chaim, "You have to go."</span> <span id="s815">And said he, "I'm afraid."</span> <span id="s816">Said Chaim “there's no way back.”</span> <span id="s817">What we know already there was one young boy what had a chance to go walk around in camp and he knows already there were ten dead.</span> <span id="s818">So there was – we know already now, you know, there was – we know it is our death.</span> <span id="s819">When we, when we get caught now, that's the end.</span> <span id="s820">So the, the electricity was already cut off and the telephone was already cut off; so there was already, you know, was already not a connection anymore.</span> <span id="s821">So Chaim had no choice.</span> <span id="s822">He run inside and took a knife, put it in his boots; and he walked to this, office where Beckmanwas his name, was and in between the Kapo was already there.</span> <span id="s823">And he had no choice, Chaim.</span> <span id="s824">And he – I remember that he was gone.</span> <span id="s825">I was inside to take 14 Scharführer Kurt Beckman the knife or something like that, and I didn't see him going away to the barrack; and I went looking for him.</span> <span id="s826">I said, "Where's Chaim?</span> <span id="s827">Where's Chaim?"</span> <span id="s828">Oh, I got so panicky, when I know already there was an uprising and there was something going on there, and I couldn't find Chaim.</span> <span id="s829">And then one of the boys, he say that, “I say Chaim is in that barrack.”</span> <span id="s830">And I went looking where Chaim was and I hear screaming, like somebody killed a pork.</span> <span id="s831">Was screaming, this man – the SS man was screaming, of course; and they were killing him with knives.</span> <span id="s832">When it was – we couldn't, we couldn't use guns or anything because nobody was allowed to hear, hear that we were – that they were killing Germans because they were all over, the Ukraines were standing there and the, and the Poles were all around.</span> <span id="s833">So I went back to the spot; and I went, went there for the roll call because it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s834">I know when I was standing there when just one German would walk around and if an Ukraine would see me there – I know that I went back to the, to that barrack and was the roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">02:21:30 I went in the roll call, and then we walked back to the – then there was the roll call, and it was already a little bit unorganized.</span> <span id="s836">It was, that was already, you know, with the, the main – you could see already it was unorganized; and then we started walking.</span> <span id="s837">And finally Chaim comes out, and he, he was bleeding.</span> <span id="s838">When he, when that knife slipped out of the head from this German and he got a cut in his arm.</span> <span id="s839">And he was all over blood; and I remember I thought, "God forbid we come somewhere and he sees this blood."</span> <span id="s840">And you know, I had no idea what will happen and what will happen now.</span> <span id="s841">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s842">We're running away or just was very –I, you know – so, I cleaned him up from this blood a little bit.</span> <span id="s843">So in the time that we were walking, and I think I had a handkerchief and I put a handkerchief on his arm.</span> <span id="s844">And it was bleeding and, and we were walking to Camp One, that we go home.</span> <span id="s845">In, in between more people came off, on all side people came; and, you see, I remember there were came a Ukrainian on a bicycle and they just killed him like nothing.</span> <span id="s846">Somebody had taken an axe or something, a knife or a who knows, and everybody start coming there together, what I remember; and then everybody say, "Hurrah!"</span> <span id="s847">or something.</span> <span id="s848">And then we started running, and we were lucky we were running to the entrance where the Sobibór comes in.</span> <span id="s849">And I remember that then Frenzel starts shooting.</span> <span id="s850">I hear guns starting already; the, the Germans knows what was going on.</span> <span id="s851">Because in between that we started walking and I cleaned Chaim up, a truck came.</span> <span id="s852">And it was one of the Germans was on this truck; and the Kapo what Chaim killed the back of it, he killed already a few other ones and he went on this truck.</span> <span id="s853">He jumped on this truck and tried – and then I don't know what's happened, but he never came out so I think he got killed on this truck.</span> <span id="s854">That was an family – an older man.</span> <span id="s855">He had three sons.</span> <span id="s856">He had three brothers and the father was there.</span> <span id="s857">I have to tell you later that I've met the father in Israel.</span> <span id="s858">There was there three boys, all the three boys were Kapos, and nobody came out.</span> <span id="s859">Nobody came out of this, out of the camp.</span> <span id="s860">So when we start running, Frenzel was already shooting and he had something in front of him.</span> <span id="s861">I saw it.</span> <span id="s862">And every – it was a little house and everybody stopped for that little house.</span> <span id="s863">So Chaim took my hand and, and he say, "Come," when it is no use that we stay there.</span> <span id="s864">And then everybody start running, and people start – and then we walked to this door, to this gate and everybody was falling around next to us.</span> <span id="s865">Everybody – you hear mines going and people dropping dead, you know, on the mines, and you only you didn't see much.</span> <span id="s866">You just run.</span> <span id="s867">You just run.</span> <span id="s868">I remember I had a necklace full with Jewish emblems; and, and I thought, "Oh, when I come in a non-Jewish area I better take that off."</span> <span id="s869">So I – that was the first thing what I took off and throw away.</span> <span id="s870">And then I had to run and run and all the clothes slowly on.</span> <span id="s871">I took all the clothes off and I just had on what normally had on, because I couldn't run with all those clothes on.</span> <span id="s872">So I was running and running; and when I run I remember, when I'm very nervous, I get diarrhea and I had to stop all the time.</span> <span id="s873">And I was very nervous, of course, when you had to run; and then we heard shooting already in back of us, and we heard, screaming.</span> <span id="s874">And we're running and running and running till we came – and that was dark.</span> <span id="s875">Went to four o'clock, five o'clock, started be dark already.</span> <span id="s876">We're running and we're running, we're running and there come away a whole bunch of Jews.</span> <span id="s877">We stayed there together.</span> <span id="s878">People from Sobibór.</span> <span id="s879">And I saw also Kurt Thomas, and he asked me, "Where's Ula?"</span> <span id="s880">No.</span> <span id="s881">Where is his girlfriend, Millie.And I told him, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s882">You have to take her."</span> <span id="s883">I say, "Yeah, I had to run."</span> <span id="s884">So he – Chaim was the only one what took his girlfriend, what took, took his Dutch girl.</span> <span id="s885">He was the only one from all the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s886">See how lucky I was.</span> <span id="s887">And we run and there we come together with a bunch of these Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s888">And Chaim say to them, "Can we stay together?"</span> <span id="s889">And one had a gun, a large gun; and he wants to shoot Chaim because he was afraid for me because I don't speak Polish.</span> <span id="s890">And, and right away they're, you know, they're afraid.</span> <span id="s891">So I jumped in front of Chaim, and he didn't shoot Chaim.</span> <span id="s892">And we went away, the two of us.</span> <span id="s893">We left all of them, and we went away, the two of us.</span> <span id="s894">We had – Chaim had some money, some gold pieces and some diamonds and we thought it was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s895">I have no idea how much it was.</span> <span id="s896">We both don't remember.</span> <span id="s897">He had in – where you put the glasses in – a case, he had filled with diamonds and gold and you know.</span> <span id="s898">And so we came; and he thought that and that was what we thought we can save our lives with.</span> <span id="s899">Was his brains, not mine.</span> <span id="s900">I wouldn't even think about money.</span> <span id="s901">So we went to a farmer in a little village, and we asked if we can stay for the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">And he say, "Yes."</span> <span id="s903">Chaim give him a gold piece, a gold dollar.</span> <span id="s904">I don't know how much it was.</span> <span id="s905">And we stayed in the attic for the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: How did you find this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: We just saw somebody with a light on, and we walked in.</span> <span id="s908">We had a lot, that was just luck.</span> <span id="s909">We – just the lucky stuff.</span> <span id="s910">So I thought we didn't find them.</span> <span id="s911">It was just a little house and in the same village, the same day, we stay at night.</span> <span id="s912">We hide at night.</span> <span id="s913">In the same day, the Germans came and they went a lot of houses and they killed all the Jews.</span> <span id="s914">All the Jews what, what they could find, they killed all over; and they skipped this house where we were in, I think.</span> <span id="s915">But the same village that they went in houses in, so when it was started to be dark – I remember there was no bathroom, of course, and I had to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">02:28:30 We were hidden down in the attic, and I'm still ashamed of what it was, it was terrible, it was 15 Also referred to as Mimie Katz.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">terrible.</span> <span id="s918">Anyway, I walked in water and my shoe got too small, my boots got too small, so I took off my boots.</span> <span id="s919">I couldn't get it on anymore.</span> <span id="s920">So I had to walk all the two weeks on the side of my boots.</span> <span id="s921">Chaim had to cut it open with a knife, and I had to walk on the side of my boots; on one, on one boot when I couldn't get it on anymore.</span> <span id="s922">So we walked and we were wet and it was raining and we walked at night and I was very scared, and we walked through the woods.</span> <span id="s923">And every tree I looked “Frenzel.”</span> <span id="s924">Frenzel wore always in, in cape, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">And it, and sometimes the tree looks like that.</span> <span id="s926">I remember Chaim say once to me, "Now you have to stop saying things like that.</span> <span id="s927">You make me scared too."</span> <span id="s928">And once we went through a woods, and there was a body where we went through woods – very big where we walked for days.</span> <span id="s929">It – and there was a body laying there.</span> <span id="s930">We had to – you know – and it was very scary, you know.</span> <span id="s931">I came from a little town, and you know you come from after Sobibór but still it was just – it was very scary.</span> <span id="s932">We walked at night.</span> <span id="s933">When it's turned daytime we tried to hide.</span> <span id="s934">We tried to hide in houses, but most of the time they didn't want to take us.</span> <span id="s935">Sometimes they took us for money but most of the time not.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">02:30:00 We slept in the woods, and we and when we walked near to an other town.</span> <span id="s937">We walked on the stars, on the stars; on the WagenI think, on the Wagen.</span> <span id="s938">That was Chaim's part.</span> <span id="s939">We walked on the Wagen.</span> <span id="s940">So that's – Chaim want to go to the farmer where he worked before the war.</span> <span id="s941">Now in the war, he worked by a farmer; and he thought he goes to the farmer where he worked and perhaps this man will hide us.</span> <span id="s942">So we walked on the stars and we walked two weeks.</span> <span id="s943">One night we, we, we couldn't find somebody, and we were hidden in a hayloft, in a hayloft.</span> <span id="s944">And we were hidden there; and little kids were, were playing outside and they go, they climbing all on there and we were hiding under this, this hay.</span> <span id="s945">Well, how much can a kid have come up you?</span> <span id="s946">And they saw us and they run off saying, "Jews!"</span> <span id="s947">; when everybody knows of course of the uprising so we jumped out of there.</span> <span id="s948">And we started walking in daytime and there came two farmers with a wagon and they say to us, "Would you like to go with us?"</span> <span id="s949">And Chaim say, “yes,” that we go with them.</span> <span id="s950">So Chaim went in one car and I went in the other.</span> <span id="s951">There were two men what belonged together; and Chaim understand Polish, but the people didn't think perhaps we had understood them.</span> <span id="s952">But they were planning to kill us and take our money and Chaim say, "Selma, jump!"</span> <span id="s953">And I jumped and he jumped, so then we walked farther.</span> <span id="s954">Was very dangerous, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s955">I remember once I was very thirsty, and it was a very beautiful farm.</span> <span id="s956">And I asked the woman if I could have some water, and she say, "No, Jew!"</span> <span id="s957">And she, you know, was sitting there.</span> <span id="s958">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s959">She was very nice dressed, and with a little baby, and next to her; and it was, you know, it was very – it is comparing with the Polish Jews went through, is it nothing but it was very – you were a nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s960">We walked many times, and there came a dog in back of us, and you were scared for everything and sometimes you saw an, an animal with eyes.</span> <span id="s961">You so used to eyes and you was laying there in the woods, it, it was a very scary time.</span> <span id="s962">We didn't have to eat.</span> <span id="s963">We walked two weeks.</span> <span id="s964">We ate the, the carrots what we saw in the fields and, and we 16 wagon (German); “Der Große Wagen”or “The Big Wagon” is a colloquial German term for the constellation Ursula Major.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">were wet.</span> <span id="s966">And you couldn't wash yourself, and we were on the lice and we were dirty and I had, scabies and, and skin disease, what is a very – I had it worse than Chaim.</span> <span id="s967">He never that problem.</span> <span id="s968">That came always to me.</span> <span id="s969">And you were very dirty.</span> <span id="s970">It was – so we walked two weeks long and we couldn't find anything.</span> <span id="s971">One night we came to a farmer and Chaim asked him if he could hide us, and the farmer say – and we sleep, slept in the hay – he say, "I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s972">Where I sleep are too many people around, but my brother lives very separate somewhere.</span> <span id="s973">Perhaps he can do it."</span> <span id="s974">What was wonderful, this man had a wagon and he put Chaim on the wagon and put bushes on top of it so nobody could see it, and he dressed me like a Polish woman with a handkerchief and clothes from his wife on.</span> <span id="s975">And he brought us to his brother, what was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s976">When they would have caught him, they would have killed his family.</span> <span id="s977">They would burn down his whole farm and it was a very dangerous thing to do.</span> <span id="s978">Very – we, we give this man perhaps of course some money, but not much.</span> <span id="s979">I don't know, I have no idea, but we give him some money.</span> <span id="s980">He brought us to his brother.</span> <span id="s981">But his brother – we came to his brother, Adam Nowak and his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">03:34:00 And they – we in the evening we were allowed to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s983">Now Chaim had this money hidden in a bandage on his leg and so when he was washing himself I think the farmer saw there was a lot of money, that's what I think.</span> <span id="s984">I, I definitely – he did it for the money.</span> <span id="s985">He was too dumb to do it for something else, and we say to him, "We give you all the money what we have.</span> <span id="s986">We give you everything we have.</span> <span id="s987">Can we stay here?"</span> <span id="s988">So we give him all the money what we have.</span> <span id="s989">I have no idea how much it was.</span> <span id="s990">And he hide us over the war.</span> <span id="s991">We stayed there nine months.</span> <span id="s992">What was – what I told you before, was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s993">We stayed in an attic.</span> <span id="s994">And we slept on hay with beams and it was a roof also from hay, with straw, and it was little holes in.</span> <span id="s995">We couldn't – we're not allowed to talk and we're not allowed to walk.</span> <span id="s996">The only thing what we could do was looking through this little hole where what we could see.</span> <span id="s997">And in the summer it was so hot that you couldn't – the mosquitoes and the flies – you can imagine the, the cows were under us.</span> <span id="s998">They came on top of us so we laid nude to save the little bit clothes what we had because we – I had these scabies and it was very, very contagious.</span> <span id="s999">And the woman put our clothes in, in an oven, so everything got really burned what, what – so we didn't have much clothes.</span> <span id="s1000">That little bit what we had we saved so, we, we didn't wore it so much; and there was, there were full with flies so that so we didn't do anything then shaking the fly, and in the winter it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s1001">They gave us a, a blanket.</span> <span id="s1002">We had a blanket, to put over.</span> <span id="s1003">We got very little food when it was just – they were allowed it to bring us only once a day food, so they brought us a little bit bread, and we put it sometimes between our head and, at night the rats came to take it away.</span> <span id="s1004">We, we were full with lice.</span> <span id="s1005">I had this, abscess under my arm and Chaim too in his neck from lice.</span> <span id="s1006">Once in a while we could, wash ourself, but when she saw that we had so scabie and she was afraid, to bring us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">02:37:00 She was, she was afraid that also that one day that we didn't give her all the money; so, we had to go out of the place where we slept at night.</span> <span id="s1008">Sometimes also she let us in the living room and that we washed like I told you.</span> <span id="s1009">So that was later on not anymore because we didn't walk so we could, I couldn't hardly walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1010">I was very under-nourished.</span> <span id="s1011">And we had to sleep with the pigs a few nights, what they smelled terrible and it was – I was – that was horrible.</span> <span id="s1012">I remember, I remember there was a cuckoo flying over us, and Chaim say, "Selma, be quiet.</span> <span id="s1013">That brings us luck."</span> <span id="s1014">He was such a good guy.</span> <span id="s1015">He always helped me up.</span> <span id="s1016">I was very depressed and very upset about this time.</span> <span id="s1017">I didn't know that I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1018">I was – I didn't get heavier because I was laying.</span> <span id="s1019">We were not allowed to walk, and I was, I didn't have my period all these months; not, also not in camp, not at all, and I was, when I came to camp, very heavy from all the water retains in your body.</span> <span id="s1020">And I didn't know I was, pregnant, and we both didn't know and, so we and so had liberty for.</span> <span id="s1021">So I was very, very upset and very depressed, and I had a little diary and, Chaim say, "Write in your diary."</span> <span id="s1022">And that helped me.</span> <span id="s1023">That helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1024">I had a little pencil.</span> <span id="s1025">You cannot read it any, almost not anymore, because it was just written with a pencil.</span> <span id="s1026">And, we had a pail in the middle from us, and that was our bathroom and once a week they cleaned it and I remember when we had, some kind of a kale.</span> <span id="s1027">It was such a smell that, you could almost not inhale.</span> <span id="s1028">you could almost not live, such a smell was there from the pail, and there was no cover on.</span> <span id="s1029">till now we eat not that kind of a kale.</span> <span id="s1030">so when were out, they put us back in the same place.</span> <span id="s1031">We were hidden there.</span> <span id="s1032">And the rats run around us.</span> <span id="s1033">We didn't have anything to do.</span> <span id="s1034">I – and from the beginning I was knitting.</span> <span id="s1035">She made her own linen on the spinning wheel; and I was knitting for her.</span> <span id="s1036">But the kid – it was a little boy – wore that clothes.</span> <span id="s1037">And the neighbors say, "How you got that nice clothes from?"</span> <span id="s1038">So I couldn't knit anymore either, because, the neighbors were, were suspicious.</span> <span id="s1039">There was, storks there settled on the farm, and we could see them.</span> <span id="s1040">So we didn't have anything to do and we were watching these storks.</span> <span id="s1041">So one, one day the storks went away, so the farmer comes to us and say, "You have to go.</span> <span id="s1042">Could not one of you, have you any more – you have to go."</span> <span id="s1043">And we say, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1044">Because when storks go away that, that brings, then there is something going on, there's a supersti– superstition and he say, "Do you watch the storks?"</span> <span id="s1045">And we say, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1046">"Have you stopped watching the storks?"</span> <span id="s1047">Thank God the storks came back!</span> <span id="s1048">Also when she find out that I were pregnant, she want to send us away; and we say, “No, I'm not pregnant.</span> <span id="s1049">I'm just...,” and we didn't know either.</span> <span id="s1050">"It's not true," and you know; we talked her into it, so she let us stay.</span> <span id="s1051">But she was still planning to send us away.</span> <span id="s1052">Also, we one day we hear some maybe shooting and we asked her why they're shooting, and he say, "They're shooting a, a Jew.</span> <span id="s1053">They shot a Jew because he had such nice boots on, and the people want to have his boots so they shot the Jew."</span> <span id="s1054">Also Chaim's best friend, what was the fireman in Sobibór, he went to a farmer and he say, "I have a lot of money with me.</span> <span id="s1055">Will you hide me?"</span> <span id="s1056">And the farmer say, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1057">And at night he came with a hayfork and killed him.</span> <span id="s1058">So we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s1059">Very lucky.</span> <span id="s1060">So in July 1944, we heard the war coming near to us, the Bug.</span> <span id="s1061">We hear, the, the Germans going back.</span> <span id="s1062">We heard the war and you hear them coming.</span> <span id="s1063">You hear them coming already.</span> <span id="s1064">So one day a little boy from the neighbor's saw a bird going up where we are, and he was running after this bird, and he saw us.</span> <span id="s1065">By luck the Germans were already fly – running away.</span> <span id="s1066">You could see it, the Germans running away, from that little hole what we had and it was very open field all around; and the little boy– so they let us stay.</span> <span id="s1067">So, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: About that little boy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Oh, that little boy came over, so then we hear the war coming nearer.</span> <span id="s1070">We hear the war coming nearer, and so we were lucky that this boy came just in the right time.</span> <span id="s1071">The – one day Adam came to us and say, "I think the war is over."</span> <span id="s1072">And the airplanes coming over already, then you couldn't hear, so we went out.</span> <span id="s1073">I remember Chaim went out by himself.</span> <span id="s1074">I think, "Oh, God, he doesn't come back!"</span> <span id="s1075">But he came back.</span> <span id="s1076">And then I went out and I was in the sixth months pregnant.</span> <span id="s1077">We had to hide in the in the fields, in the fields because the airplanes came over and it was war going on, and that took a day– I don't know how long it took.</span> <span id="s1078">It was a very short time.</span> <span id="s1079">After that we stayed a few days, but we were very under-nourished and we stayed a few days and we were sitting in the field and Chaim helped the farmer a little bit in the field with the hay.</span> <span id="s1080">And then he heard – they were talking in the village that they want to kill us, the Jews.</span> <span id="s1081">They want to kill us.</span> <span id="s1082">So the farmer took us and brought us to Chelm, and when we came to Chelm, we thought we were the only Jews left.</span> <span id="s1083">And we came to Chelm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">We found some more Jews.</span> <span id="s1085">Because we thought every concentration camp was like Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1086">So we thought, you know, there were no Jews left.</span> <span id="s1087">So we came to Chelm, and there came all the Jews what were left.</span> <span id="s1088">Was one house where one Jewish family, and, and we went to that – where there were more Jews and we went and we stayed in there.</span> <span id="s1089">We had no clothes.</span> <span id="s1090">We had no money, absolutely no money.</span> <span id="s1091">And there were about hundred Jews in that room.</span> <span id="s1092">We, we, had no, nothing, absolutely nothing, just what we had on.</span> <span id="s1093">And we came and I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1094">That was what my husband never liked to hear – he doesn't want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">He thinks that's terrible.</span> <span id="s1096">We, we, we didn't have anything, so I started sewing, even for Esther Raab.</span> <span id="s1097">I started sewing by hand, and we, we had nothing, no clothes to put, no blankets to put over us at night and we slept up the ground.</span> <span id="s1098">There was one small bed; and because I was pregnant, they give us that bed, I remember.</span> <span id="s1099">And so Chaim had to go in the army.</span> <span id="s1100">He had to go in the army and I didn't speak a word Polish.</span> <span id="s1101">I didn't speak almost no Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1102">And I spoke German, but the Jews what, what they couldn't understand me; not some, most of them not.</span> <span id="s1103">And we had no money, and he had to go in the army.</span> <span id="s1104">He had to go fight for – with the Polish army, so, so he – some – we spoke with somebody, and he could start working in a hospital as nurse and they thought, we thought that he doesn't have to go in the army this way.</span> <span id="s1105">So he worked as nurse.</span> <span id="s1106">Chaim cannot see blood and there came once – I remember was a train and all people died almost, and he had to help and all these sick people cutting off the legs; and they're very primitive there still in that time.</span> <span id="s1107">I don't know how, now.</span> <span id="s1108">And so – maarafter a while he made – I don't know if he made money but we know – yeah, he had to make some money.</span> <span id="s1109">Of course, we had to eat; and I start cooking for all these people.</span> <span id="s1110">I remember I start cooking and I didn't know how to cook Polish.</span> <span id="s1111">When I was Dutch and in Holland they, they cook like in America a little bit, not, not like Poland, Pole.</span> <span id="s1112">And I burned myself and I burnt my leg.</span> <span id="s1113">It was very deep wounds and there was no doctor.</span> <span id="s1114">And, ach, it was a mess.</span> <span id="s1115">And, and I started sewing, so after a while we heard that Chaim had to go in the army anyway and also Chaim start selling gasoline.</span> <span id="s1116">I don't know, he started doing something.</span> <span id="s1117">I don't remember exactly what he did but he made a little bit money and also he got to know some people and the people went back to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1118">When they hide, so many</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">17 but (Dutch) Jews hide money in the ground in Sobibór, and they went back to Sobibór to get the money.</span> <span id="s1120">They started killing each other there in Sobibór because they start fighting.</span> <span id="s1121">That, what I, I saw – "That's my money," and "That's your money."</span> <span id="s1122">So I said to Chaim, "You don't go back to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1123">We brought it this far, and we will make it without this money."</span> <span id="s1124">So he didn't go back.</span> <span id="s1125">So somebody came and had some money and the money was rotten and the money – because it was moisture in the ground and the number from these dollars was gone.</span> <span id="s1126">So said Chaim to him, "You know, I know somebody."</span> <span id="s1127">Chaim got to know some people.</span> <span id="s1128">My husband is very honest.</span> <span id="s1129">"I can perhaps change that money for you."</span> <span id="s1130">It was a hundred dollar bill.</span> <span id="s1131">We put that hundred dollar bill under our pillow at night, under our clothes.</span> <span id="s1132">We had not a pillow.</span> <span id="s1133">Under his head, and somebody stole it at night away from him, and we had no idea who – just everybody knows there from each other.</span> <span id="s1134">There's just a few Jews what was left there.</span> <span id="s1135">So the man say, "You have to give me that money."</span> <span id="s1136">So if Chaim made a little bit money he paid him off.</span> <span id="s1137">Right away, you know, he paid him a little bit money.</span> <span id="s1138">I have to tell you a story what was 20 years later.</span> <span id="s1139">We lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s1140">Twenty years later we lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s1141">I come back to the other 20 years later we lived in Israel and all the Jews from Sobibór came together.</span> <span id="s1142">And we had to go there too.</span> <span id="s1143">And I see this man what I, what wanted the hundred dollar bill from us, and I say, "Do you remember the hundred dollar bill?"</span> <span id="s1144">I opened my big mouth.</span> <span id="s1145">"That he stole it under our head, and it was your hundred dollar bill."</span> <span id="s1146">He said, "Yes, I remember."</span> <span id="s1147">The next day he came to us in Beth Yitzhak, where we lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s1148">He said, "He owe me hundred dollars."</span> <span id="s1149">We give it to him.</span> <span id="s1150">What Chaim say that, “This man comes to us and makes himself that low, he needs the hundred dollars.”</span> <span id="s1151">So anyway we lived – we went away from there and there came somebody what he also was a survivor from Sobibór, and we told him the story.</span> <span id="s1152">We don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1153">Chaim had to go in the army and I'm – “What will I do?”</span> <span id="s1154">And he say, "You know what you do?</span> <span id="s1155">You go to this village where I live, and I give you – and you change your name, and grow a mustache and make yourself five years older and you don't have to go in the army anymore."</span> <span id="s1156">So that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1157">So we drove from one village, in between we, we, we went already from Chelm, and we met this man somewhere on the way and we drove in freight wagons and we were hitch hiking and we were sitting in the freight wagons and we went from one place to the other and I couldn't walk and it was just – and we slept on the floors and we were very – we didn't have anything and we were – it was in a horrible time.</span> <span id="s1158">Anyway, we went from one place to the other; and finally we met this guy and he said, "You come to that in that village," and we went to that village.</span> <span id="s1159">It was Parczew.</span> <span id="s1160">Very small village.</span> <span id="s1161">And we came in there and there was a Jewish woman, she had a little grocery store and she say to us, "I have a little apartment.</span> <span id="s1162">You can live there.</span> <span id="s1163">A real apartment, a Polish apartment."</span> <span id="s1164">And we went in there and there was no, no was no water and there was no bathroom and we stayed in that apartment and – yeah – we stayed in that apartment.</span> <span id="s1165">And Ula – Chaim had to go away and make some money, so Chaim went where the Germans pulled away.</span> <span id="s1166">He bought some stuff – I don't know – what he could sell by us.</span> <span id="s1167">I don't know what he bought.</span> <span id="s1168">Shoe, shoe laces, and shoe cream and little bit money what we had, perhaps ten dollars, fifty.</span> <span id="s1169">And that he bought up, and it was far away; and then he brought it back where we lived, and he could sell it at a profit.</span> <span id="s1170">From that profit we lived.</span> <span id="s1171">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s1172">And I was all alone in Parczew, and I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1173">In between it I got the baby, I think – yeah – I got the baby.</span> <span id="s1174">And was terrible, and I had to go a – I didn't know how you got a baby, and he didn't know how you got a baby, and we didn't know why the pain started and I don't....</span> <span id="s1175">Anyway, we had to walk five miles or two miles or three miles to the school where I got the baby; and they were all antisemites there.</span> <span id="s1176">And laying there and I didn't know and it was – I was six months, six months laying flat so it was very difficult birth and it was a first child.</span> <span id="s1177">So I was laying there five days and five nights in labor–that I remember exactly–in labor; and Chaim was not allowed to come because he wasn't, he had – I don't know – was – I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1178">Anyway, we had a little boy and we went back to the he picked me up with the wagon – that's a big story – any way he picked me up with the wagon.</span> <span id="s1179">You want to know?</span> <span id="s1180">This is terrible.</span> <span id="s1181">You know, first of all, they, they came – the doctor came to me and said to me, "If you don't stop screaming, we'll throw you out on the street."</span> <span id="s1182">Because they don't give me anything.</span> <span id="s1183">They didn't give you anything for the pain; and they didn't give me anything and it was the first baby and it, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1184">And I didn't know what to do, and, and how to handle this pain; and finally after five days, one of the people what was laying Polish not-Jewish people was laying around.</span> <span id="s1185">They say, "You had the showing, so perhaps it's time."</span> <span id="s1186">And so they came, and I had to walk to a room; and in two minutes the baby was there, of course, after five days laying there.</span> <span id="s1187">And then have to walk back to the other room, and I was laying in bed and they didn't want to touch me, the doctors, because I was full with these scabies and I had lice.</span> <span id="s1188">No.</span> <span id="s1189">I didn't have lice.</span> <span id="s1190">I had also scabie.</span> <span id="s1191">I had not also the scabie – a little bit of scabie, but it was almost gone.</span> <span id="s1192">It was almost gone, but they didn't want to touch me because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1193">Well, not-Jewish doctors, and they looked under the bed.</span> <span id="s1194">When they saw no blood under it, they say, "Oh, everything was okay."</span> <span id="s1195">So I say to Chaim, "I have to get away from here.</span> <span id="s1196">I don't want to stay here a minute longer."</span> <span id="s1197">So he came with a wagon and he picked me up and he brought us to that apartment, the baby and me.</span> <span id="s1198">I didn't, I didn't have anything for this baby.</span> <span id="s1199">In between from my own little bit what I had, I made some – sewed by hand some clothes for this baby.</span> <span id="s1200">You know, when I was a teenager I didn't see many babies, so I really didn't know what babies was wearing.</span> <span id="s1201">So from my imagination I made – I was very handy always with doing things by hand, so I made – sewed clothes from Chaim's little bit what he had; and from my little bit what I clothes on, I sewed clothes for the baby, so that little bit we had and I think we got from people a bed where we could put a baby in.</span> <span id="s1202">Now Chaim timmereda bed we made from – made himself a bed what we stole wood from old houses in the village; and he also made a bed where we could sleep on in that village.</span> <span id="s1203">But we still had our own clothes what was our blanket, and it was cold already.</span> <span id="s1204">It was October the baby born.</span> <span id="s1205">No, the baby was born in October – yeah – the baby was born in October.</span> <span id="s1206">And the apartment, the windows, there was the windows, it was openings there as big as your hand.</span> <span id="s1207">In the morning when you woke up, it's ice.</span> <span id="s1208">Everything was ice in the, you know, the, the – from your breathing, everything was ice.</span> <span id="s1209">And so we couldn't let the baby sleep by themself.</span> <span id="s1210">It would freeze to death right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">So finally the other Jews what lived in this village heared about us, and they give us some feather bed.</span> <span id="s1212">Before already the baby was born.</span> <span id="s1213">But the feather bed was full with fleas.</span> <span id="s1214">I never forgot.</span> <span id="s1215">Ah was horrible.</span> <span id="s1216">At night you could almost not sleep from the fleas, so I remember I hang it – Dutch people are very clean, and I was very clean and very proper, you know.</span> <span id="s1217">So I put – cleaning and scrubbing, that was my – we had nothing, but that apartment where we lived was so clean; so I hang it always outside.</span> <span id="s1218">I thought it will kill the fleas, in the</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">18 built (Dutch) freezing will clear the fleas.</span> <span id="s1220">But it don't.</span> <span id="s1221">They go inside these feathers and when it gets warm, they're getting out.</span> <span id="s1222">So anyway, this would be the – that was not the worst we – you know, the loneliness that I was there and I still was isolated from everybody.</span> <span id="s1223">I couldn't talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1224">What could I talk with the baby?</span> <span id="s1225">I couldn't even go to the doctor with the baby, because there wasn't nothing.</span> <span id="s1226">I never went off with the baby to the doctor.</span> <span id="s1227">And I cried so much that there was neighbors that, that the walls were very thin, that the neighbors made the same sound already from my crying.</span> <span id="s1228">Because I felt it was worse than camp almost because I had not to talk with anybody, and just that I was sitting with this baby.</span> <span id="s1229">Maar Chaim had to go away to make some money, that the only way that he – I don't know.</span> <span id="s1230">That was the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Was this towards the end of the war?</span> <span id="s1232">A: This was already – the war was over.</span> <span id="s1233">Q: The war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: That the war was over.</span> <span id="s1235">When we went down from where we were hidden, the war was over.</span> <span id="s1236">When we went down, where the farmer – and we went down, the war was – that was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1237">We saw the two Russian walking.</span> <span id="s1238">And I remember I went to him and I kissed him, and I say, "Oh, you freed us!"</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: You kissed...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: The Russian, the Russian soldiers, because they freed us.</span> <span id="s1241">They didn't do anything to us.</span> <span id="s1242">They were also, not to the farmer.</span> <span id="s1243">They didn't do anything in Poland to the people what they freed.</span> <span id="s1244">In Germany, they started doing that, but not to the Russian soldiers when they came to Poland, they didn't do anything to us.</span> <span id="s1245">Because the Poles suffered, too.</span> <span id="s1246">But the Russians suffered tremendous from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1247">What's – how many got killed in, in Russia, in Stalingrad, and Leningrad; and so they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1248">So in 1943, in July, the war was over.</span> <span id="s1249">We were freed.</span> <span id="s1250">19– 1944.</span> <span id="s1251">1944, July.</span> <span id="s1252">1943 we run away.</span> <span id="s1253">October 14th we run away from concentration camp and nine months later in July, I think July – nine months later – June or July, we got freed in ....</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s1255">A: 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: And what happened between the end of the war and '57?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: We, when we were in that village, one night we heard that, we heard that they want to kill all the Jews in that village – partisans, the not-Jewish partisans in the woods.</span> <span id="s1258">So middle of the</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">19 but (Dutch) night we went to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1260">We rented a – or somebody took us with a truck.</span> <span id="s1261">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1262">I think somebody with a truck what also ran away, went to Lublin, and we stayed in Lublin with Podchlebnikalso survivor from Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1263">That was one of the survivors what run away from Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1264">And we stay – and he was already a long time and he was already a big shot.</span> <span id="s1265">He made already a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1266">So when we were there Chaim met some Dutch people, and they told him that they're planning to go over the land to Russia.</span> <span id="s1267">They organized some Dutch people – was also a Dutch captain – they organize all the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s1268">Chaim say he was Dutch.</span> <span id="s1269">In between Chaim say he was Dutch, and he went – we went over Romania, Hungary, and we took three months in freight wagons with 140 people, with two – they made two layers out of it.</span> <span id="s1270">We slept down with the baby, with a sick baby in between.</span> <span id="s1271">I got dysentery, and the baby got dysentery;
