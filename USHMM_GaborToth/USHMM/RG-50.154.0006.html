he was the administrator of the French hospital in Midan (?)</span> <span id="s33">and, um, survived the whole war without… of course, we didn’t have enough to eat.</span> <span id="s34">We all know that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We did have a place in the country and the farmer’s wife did manage to give us extra things, but even so it was very tight.</span> <span id="s37">And during the exodus, mother and I walked for miles and miles and miles, trying to get to Brittany to take a boat back to England and, um, Germans caught up with us somewhere near Chartres, which had been bombed.</span> <span id="s38">And the German soldiers were very young and very arrogant.</span> <span id="s39">Here were all these refugees, old people, sick people in wheelbarrows, small babies, and they rode their bicycles and their motor scooters, whistling modern tunes in the most arrogant, high-handed manner in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">And the German captain who was leading them marched into the cornfield and urinated, really, in a brutal sort of way.</span> <span id="s41">It was a brutal manifestation.</span> <span id="s42">And we were forced to turn back as soon as the Germans arrived.</span> <span id="s43">We had to turn back and walked about 350 kilometers.</span> <span id="s44">And now we were in Paris and, um, I continued with my career.</span> <span id="s45">I continued to go to class with Madam Privachenska and I continued, I danced at the, in the theater at Champs Elysee in the ballet Avila as a French citizen, because I was married to a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s46">And, um, my mother… but before that happened, my mother was taken in a concentration at Berzencon on the Swiss frontier and life was very hard for her.</span> <span id="s47">They had to stand in line for soup at mid-day, up to their waists in snow many times, and the blood from the French wounded had not been cleaned from the walls or…</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: May I just ask you a question, please.</span> <span id="s49">Your mother, of course, was there because she was English?</span> <span id="s50">She was not Jewish, was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: No, she was English.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s53">That’s why the Germans arrested her.</span> <span id="s54">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: And when they arrested her, they didn’t just know on this portier, this estate in the country.</span> <span id="s56">They kicked in the door.</span> <span id="s57">Sort of like trying to kill a butterfly with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s58">And when she was released from the camp, it was because she was so ill and we were given no warning she was coming back and she had to walk all the way from the railway station in Mont all the way to Gayville (?)</span> <span id="s59">which was miles and miles and miles, and she was very ill.</span> <span id="s60">And so we, we survived the war, but many of my Jewish, Russian, White Russian friends, well, just disappeared, and, um, some escaped and I have many stories of how they ran through the woods and they returned to Paris under aliases.</span> <span id="s61">A very, very beautiful woman, the mother of my best friend, she was from Tartary, a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s62">The Germans came, tore all the wallpaper from her flat, trying to find secret things and she was never seen again.</span> <span id="s63">Such a lovely woman.</span> <span id="s64">And mother and I lived in this flat for a long time after that with no water and no utilities, very little food.</span> <span id="s65">Well, Remy Blum, the impresario of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, came to my… the house of my father- and mother-in-law, and I signed a contract with him to perform for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and we were very sad, because a week after that he was taken by the Germans and I think it was about a year later that he died in the camp.</span> <span id="s66">He was such a wonderful, wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">Could you tell us a little bit about… evidently you were reasonable free in your career; you could pursue your career.</span> <span id="s69">But you mentioned it was not entertaining, it was just dancing and classical dance.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: It was classical dance in Avignon, in the Theater de Champs Elysee and…</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: But your observations perhaps, of what French people did to Jews, what they did…</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: They were very helpful, very compassionate.</span> <span id="s73">Once we were into this terrible thing, several refugees from the Germans ran into the theater and the dressers and all of us would hide them and we had never seen anyone when the Germans came, looking for them, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You mentioned that you were hiding people, who tried to escape, in the theater and you said that you never knew that anyone was there when the Germans came looking.</span> <span id="s75">So, obviously, it was successful in trying to keep the Germans away or fool them enough that they didn’t search the theater and the people that you were helping at the time, were they resistance fighters, or Jewish people?</span> <span id="s76">Who were they and where did they escape to and could you just elaborate?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: To the best of my knowledge, they were resistance fighters and they may, indeed, have been Jewish.</span> <span id="s78">But I had no knowledge of that.</span> <span id="s79">But my Jewish friends were all White Russians and they were all involved in dance and the arts.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: White Russians means they escaped the Bolshevik Revolution and came to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And they were Jews.</span> <span id="s83">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: And a great many of them, they were artists.</span> <span id="s85">And, um, all those families disappeared.</span> <span id="s86">And I’m glad to say that some of the young people escaped.</span> <span id="s87">They had breathtaking stories to tell of running through the woods in Germany and finding nothing to eat, and coming through Alsace-Lorraine, and some of these young people appeared back in Paris with false papers.</span> <span id="s88">False papers was the thing to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: How did people obtain false papers under these circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Through the Underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: The Underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: They did that, evidently, in many countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And then when these people returned with false papers, could they go along reasonably freely in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: They went freely in Paris, but I don’t know how they could earn a living.</span> <span id="s97">Other families helped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Just prayed that the war would end.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s101">Could you perhaps tell us a little more about the… you said that your father-in-law wore the stay, but by some miracle was saved and his Christian wife, out of solidarity, wore it too.</span> <span id="s102">Both of them were somehow saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Right.</span> <span id="s104">And then a friend of ours, a young man who was in the resistance, his father was a medical person and he was taken out and shot.</span> <span id="s105">And he wrote a beautiful letter which I can show you, with his photograph, and said that the Germans had prayed with him in the prison before he was…</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: …killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: And he asked his parents to forgive him for all the sorrow he had caused and to forgive the Germans that were his jailors.</span> <span id="s108">It’s not their fault that he was taken out and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Well, what was his… why was he arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: He was Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: A Resistance fighter, I see.</span> <span id="s112">Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I only mention that…</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Now would you please tell us about what happened to your husband who was evidently in the French army?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: At 19 he was taken into the French army and he came home on a leave two times, and then we heard that he was taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s116">And then we never heard anything after that; we could never find out anything.</span> <span id="s117">It was such chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Was this prior to the war’s end?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: That was prior to the war’s end.</span> <span id="s120">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Now, in the period that you’re now describing, how much longer did the war last and what happened with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: After two years my mother became so ill that they released her from Berzencon.</span> <span id="s123">She found her own way; we were not given any notification that she had been released.</span> <span id="s124">She walked on for miles and miles and miles and she was almost comatose by the time she fell on the doorstep.</span> <span id="s125">And we picked her up and put her to bed.</span> <span id="s126">She never really did recover herself after that.</span> <span id="s127">Of course, being a British subject, they, as well as a concentration camp could be, they were as humane as others.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Because she was British and she was also a Christian, of course.</span> <span id="s129">But nevertheless they persecuted her also?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes, because she was English.</span> <span id="s131">They were at war with England.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Yes, I understand.</span> <span id="s133">And now that the war continues, would you like to speak towards the end of the war, towards liberation—how you felt and some of the things that you’ve experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Those were intoxicating days when the French army and the American armies were approaching Paris.</span> <span id="s135">And it was my experience that the buildings were mined, the Concierge and all the big buildings, Hotel de Ville, they were mined.</span> <span id="s136">Hitler had given the order to blow up Paris.</span> <span id="s137">The German general in charge…</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s139">Can’t remember his name?</span> <span id="s140">I can’t either.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: It was ________, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Well, whoever.</span> <span id="s143">Go ahead as to what his plans were that you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: He deflected.</span> <span id="s145">It was planned, very cleverly, just to, very stubbornly and doggedly…</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: This was a German general?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: A German general.</span> <span id="s148">He was not about to blow up Paris, but we all thought, through our connections with the French Underground, that everything was going to be blown up.</span> <span id="s149">And then there was intensive bombing and, naturally, every time the planes come over, you think you’re going to be hit this time.</span> <span id="s150">So, it wasn’t just joy and hope; it was sheer terror.</span> <span id="s151">But the French came in and General LeClair, very French, with his blue casquette and marching very correctly.</span> <span id="s152">La croix, la France, cheering crowds and all those flags waving.</span> <span id="s153">It was very exciting and then the Americans came in and there were still Germans in some of these strongholds.</span> <span id="s154">There were Germans in L’Ecole Militaire and in Les Invalides and they were shooting anybody who crossed the Square and the French had set up barricades and people were shot.</span> <span id="s155">Not, of course, too many.</span> <span id="s156">I just don’t think I should…</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: After the liberation of France and your mother’s survival and your survival, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, we returned to England and, in the course of time, I met an Englishman who was a nationalized American.</span> <span id="s159">He was a doctor with the American army, stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s160">So we lived in Garmishpartenkirchen and I attended the war trials and visited Buchenwald and went skiing.</span> <span id="s161">And we met a number of Jewish people who were still displaced persons, who still had difficulty getting visas, and we tried to help with the children and things like that as best we could.</span> <span id="s162">And from Munich we went to Venice, I mean to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Could you…</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: And eventually back to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: To the United States.</span> <span id="s166">Could you tell us something about your encounters with Germans after the war—some of their points of view, some of their thoughts about the war?</span> <span id="s167">Did you have experience with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, I was awfully astounded in Munich.</span> <span id="s169">We met so many manufacturers and they denied that the camps were anything but humanitarian and hygienic was the word they used in connection with Goering’s running of the camps.</span> <span id="s170">Hygienic, that was a word that startled me.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: And they said that if we had listened to them, we would not be having this trouble with Russia, that they had told us all along that the Russians were a real menace.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: They evidently at the time were trying to cover up some of the things that the Germans had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Conscious or unconscious; had they consciously blocked their own minds and intelligence?</span> <span id="s175">How could they have expected us to believe it?</span> <span id="s176">How could they expect us to believe it?</span> <span id="s177">In Europe, we’d been hearing these things since 19--, since the 1930s.</span> <span id="s178">Everyone knew what the Germans were up to.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s180">And when you came to Vienna, what did you find the Austrians… ?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I found them a little more civilized about this, but not much.</span> <span id="s182">They still believed that none of these terrible things had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: This was immediately following the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: 1946, 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: And what were your feelings when you attended the trial, the war crimes trials, as a person who had suffered some persecution in France and being a British subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I was horrified to meet the finality of evil face to face.</span> <span id="s187">Absolutely stupefied.</span> <span id="s188">I really can’t find any words to have these monsters stand up and then pretend to be innocent and it was never their fault.</span> <span id="s189">They were always under orders.</span> <span id="s190">They were a German soldier and they had to follow orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Evidently the jury didn’t quite believe them, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Of course not.</span> <span id="s193">And the lawyers were wonderful, wonderfully ethical.</span> <span id="s194">Everything was aboveboard and fair.</span> <span id="s195">Everybody was very controlled.</span> <span id="s196">The lawyers were very controlled.</span> <span id="s197">There was nothing…</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Well, everything you feel was run properly in the legal system during the trials and obviously the guilt of these people was established and…</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Terribly, terribly sick.</span> <span id="s200">They were terrified.</span> <span id="s201">These people who could do things to other people without compunction.</span> <span id="s202">When they themselves were confronted with death, they were terrified.</span> <span id="s203">They were groveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Well, that is something.</span> <span id="s205">I’m very glad that you bring that out.</span> <span id="s206">It’s very important to know.</span> <span id="s207">Well, thank you very much for giving us some of your time and we really appreciate it and hopefully all this will help to teach future generations that it will not happen again.</span> <span id="s208">Thank you so much for the courtesy and your hospitality.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: My pleasure.</span> <span id="s210">I hope that you’re very successful with this endeavor.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
