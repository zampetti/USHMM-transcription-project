denistry in France for two years but then my parents were afraid she fell in love, not Jew you know, so my father, I don't remember, met her in Berlin, in Prague, Czechoslovakia and took her to a beautiful resort in Czechoslovakia in Marienbad so was a time I wasn't even born when my mother, my older sister stayed with the grandparents, she went too.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">What was her

about?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Sure, sure, sure like I said, we had one old apartment house and maybe you heard about, he was an artist Arthur Shick.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">His parents lived in our, the other apartment house.</span> <span id="s22">We had a beautiful picture when the Jews going out from Egypt and one of the women in the picture was his wife.</span> <span id="s23">We left everything, you know, because my parents ran away, I will tell you later what happened so his wife survived here and when I came here I read about in the Times magazine she showed me ______________[29] all his art you know how beautiful he was painting.</span> <span id="s24">His parents used to be very wealthy but then I read not long ago during the revolution in Russia in l905 they burned his father's eyes.</span> <span id="s25">I saw him when he was an elderly man, you know.</span> <span id="s26">The Polish workers, maybe Germans, because there were many Germans in our city and during the war they named our city Littsmanstadt.</span> <span id="s27">Did you know about</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Did you talk some people from Lodz that you know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Yes, yes we've worked with a number of people.</span> <span id="s31">Could we go back a little bit to your childhood.</span> <span id="s32">So you completed high school, you went to high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Yes to high school.</span> <span id="s34">Our grades were different.</span> <span id="s35">Till 8th grade, then we graduated to get Matura, Polish Maturan came from the government, sent two men and we had written and oral tests.</span> <span id="s36">Otherwise we couldn't go to university, anyway we couldn't go for everything so it was a very hard thing from all the subjects they asked questions.</span> <span id="s37">My older sister was very bright and my younger sister too.</span> <span id="s38">She is now in the Jewish home.</span> <span id="s39">I'll tell you later.</span> <span id="s40">So from there then my sister married the doctor and after school I was a secretary for my father Olov hashalom "may he rest in peace" and because we had 2 apartment houses in Poland everybody had to be registered special books and if someone came from other country, how many papers had to be filled out so I helped my father, you know, till I met my husband.</span> <span id="s41">We had for a while a business like electric bulbs and like when you build apartment houses all those, you know, pipes, everything, we had for this for about, till the end of l938.</span> <span id="s42">Until I met my late husband.</span> <span id="s43">He came around to our business and I was there and I used to know his uncle.</span> <span id="s44">His uncle used to have a business for dentists and technicians.</span> <span id="s45">Everything they brought from Germany, you know to bring, because was the best from Germany.</span> <span id="s46">And my father sent me to business something to pay.</span> <span id="s47">In Poland there were no checks, _____________________[60] but this was not for ____________________[60] immediately, it took months to get the money and on the way I met again my future husband and he recognized me and ____________________[63] and my father sent me to this businessman and the same evening we went, this was in the summer, and the beautiful - we had dancing outdoors and shows and I met him late _____________[66] and became acquainted and you know, today is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Can you describe a little bit how Lodz, how it looked there?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Lodz, it wasn't as though like trees and this, yeah we had parks but every summer we used to go to the country, not far, and we were there in l939, the men used to come on Friday afternoon, like I read about here from New York, and stay until Sunday.</span> <span id="s50">My husband came to pick up our things, I still lived with my parents for the summer, they gave me a beautiful apartment in our apartment house.</span> <span id="s51">In l938 they sent from Germany, Hitler, Polish Jews, who were not citizens of Germany, I just read about too, so l7,000 came back and one family came, young people from Germany, rented an apartment house in our building and he told us his wife used to go to Switzerland and smuggle money out, I don't know, so they had some money and the Jews in Poland who helped him a lot, my parents - my father was very active Zionist, they opened even a clinic, you know.</span> <span id="s52">My brother-in-law was the main doctor, a few doctors, a dentist so for a $l.50 they could get a doctor and prescriptions.</span> <span id="s53">They had small stores you know, they not so poor and one time, one time from Germany, Berlin, he came outside on the street and came running up, I think they had one child, and said the Gestapo was looking for my father, Olov hashalom.</span> <span id="s54">We had two entrances, so he came from the back and my father ran to the fifth floor, the 4th floor had, you know, the water pipes; I was only with my mother.</span> <span id="s55">I think my sisters and my brother went to a smaller town.</span> <span id="s56">You know, the Gestapo came every day and we didn't know what they wanted.</span> <span id="s57">My late father had his own study and there was a big desk and they went and looked and looked and didn't tell us what and we had a big safe and they told my mother to open up and my mother was shaking.</span> <span id="s58">But I knew the secret and I opened up and they looked and looked and we didn't know for what they looked.</span> <span id="s59">They said the next day, my father would have to come to the Gestapo so you can imagine what we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Before we get into that, can we back up just a little bit.</span> <span id="s61">Were you involved also in the Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Not so much, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Did you have any other interests, sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">In school yes, we had a gym, this was a private Jewish school.</span> <span id="s65">We had a horse, but I was ______[l04].</span> <span id="s66">I saw my grandson, how he jumped, he could go up, he was 7 years old; we had a gym, then we had arrhythmic [ph] [l07] dances with a teacher playing the piano, you know, and in the summer we could play basketball, outside we had a special place and it was l/2 block from where we lived so we all went, only my brother and my older sister started to go to the other school, the best schools.</span> <span id="s67">It was expensive but my parents could afford to pay for 5 children not at once, my younger sister was only l3 years old.</span> <span id="s68">Can you imagine what we went through until my father came back.</span> <span id="s69">The Germans told us to give back all our radios, we could hear from Russia, from Budapest, we had to give them; I don't think the Poles gave them away because when I ran away from Warsaw we used to know what's going from the Poles - we didn't know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Mostly Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Not Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">No, I didn't know much Yiddish but after the war in the camp Lithuaina Jews eating in the kitchen getting the food because we didn't have nothing, they heard us speaking Polish they said no, only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s74">But in Miami Beach, many people been coming on the beach, my husband (not my first husband) he knew Russian because they lived in Russia so I learned to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s75">I speak German because from school I speak German.</span> <span id="s76">My late brother-in-law _______[l27] he was from Vienna, so when I came he spoke only German, didn't know English at all, I never went to school here, none of us.</span> <span id="s77">My younger sister went to high school, then went to Maryland University and worked for almost 20 years Social Security here.</span> <span id="s78">She stayed with my brother-in-law's uncle.</span> <span id="s79">They were Viennese.</span> <span id="s80">He was a dentist in Vienna and she stayed with them; she didn't have where to stay and through them she met her future husband.</span> <span id="s81">He was in the war too.</span> <span id="s82">He was in India and Salaam [ph] [134], my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s83">He worked for the Labor Department here and he been teaching in Montgomery College in Takoma Park I think twice a week, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s84">I think it was business administration.</span> <span id="s85">One son's a professor in New York University.</span> <span id="s86">The other works for the Government.</span> <span id="s87">He was for a while in Israel - can I tell you the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Sure, maybe we can do it later.</span> <span id="s89">I'd like to now back up and maybe you'd like to tell what year did you get married for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Almost l939.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Do you remember when the Germans invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s93">Like I said, my two sisters and my brother went out in the city, I had an apartment in our apartment house, we heard on the radio, at that time we had a radio, that the Germans are on the way to our city because we had so many Germans in factories, the Germans had factories, so my mother sent me and my younger sister to a store to buy whatever we can buy; not to a Jewish store because we know everything is sold out so we had half a block we crossed to a Polish store we heard conversation, the Poles, and we were standing in line, it was so close to where we lived, a women with dark hair wearing big cross the Polish women said to her, "you get out" and she was wearing a cross and they didn't touch my sister and not me and we were so close leaving but we came to the store and not much was left.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Was this because you had Aryan features?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Yes, because my sister, she was tall, blond and blue eyes and we were so close and this women said I am not Jewish and they wouldn't let her stay and throw her out and when the Germans came they were not far from us, some Jews they hung them and who would go there to look at it, you know.</span> <span id="s96">And then, when my father went to the Gestapo they had statues of the organization, so my late father sent me to the lawyer in a nice neighborhood - I walked when two Germans grabbed me, this was already cold, maybe November, l939, to go to work.</span> <span id="s97">I was wearing a fur coat but in fact I was wearing a rain coat over it and took me to a school for Germans they brought from the Russian part of Poland to clean for them.</span> <span id="s98">The Russians brought us some bread and I started to clean and then I went to one of the Germans, a civilian, and I said "listen, (in German) I have a little baby home, please let me go, let me go."</span> <span id="s99">But my younger sister, she was still l0 years, she was grabbed, she had to sign she would come every day to clean the apartments for the Germans.</span> <span id="s100">But then they went away.</span> <span id="s101">And then my parents, my late father-in-law was in business with his brother, they sold merchandise for dentists, he was arrested, the older brother.</span> <span id="s102">They came to the store; it wasn't a store, it was in an apartment they had the business, they asked the maid, the Polish maid "where are the tepia".</span> <span id="s103">Tepia are carpets, rugs.</span> <span id="s104">So she sent them to us, to my father because she knows that he lives with us because he run away and they came, two military men, we had two doors on both sides, locked so no one would run away and they slapped my father-in-law until we knew what they wanted.</span> <span id="s105">I showed them where they lived.</span> <span id="s106">They lived on the second floor and I said "come, I show you we don't have the tepia, the rugs, the carpets because we're going away".</span> <span id="s107">You know, we had to duck, you know, in case there were no rights, and I grabbed the soldier, I don't know maybe he was Gestapo, and I said see I'm telling you the truth in German.</span> <span id="s108">I thought now he will hit me in the face what I did, I grabbed him, but he believed him because we had the suitcase.</span> <span id="s109">I said, we need the carpets?</span> <span id="s110">Go to the maid, she took them."</span> <span id="s111">So my father was responsible for my father-in-law he wouldn't run away.</span> <span id="s112">So we ran away.</span> <span id="s113">Because every day, like I say, the Germans came to us because the owners of the apartment house and we had a picture maybe of the grandfather, the little boy and the Rabbi asking questions and they looked and looked and we left everything.</span> <span id="s114">We had a typewriter, I remember my father put it on the 5th floor because we thought the war would go only 6 months.</span> <span id="s115">Because my parents remember the Germans from WWI.</span> <span id="s116">It was all different, the Germans, were nice to the Jews, were friendly, but we had to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Do you remember what month that was and where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">To Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Was this in the Fall of l939?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Yes, in the end of this and in the border we had to show them - we couldn't go, we could go only by bus, we had to go in our city bus and the busses were there going to Warsaw and we took somethings with us and my late first husband he did manufacturing of machinery but we didn't take it.</span> <span id="s121">I didn't know we could write letters and my father-in-law knew, he came later to Warsaw then we and he brought this and they been looking and everybody had machines and you know they needed this, from cotton made; they used live before the war, WWI, in the same building.</span> <span id="s122">When we came to Warsaw, we were wearing white - no we were wearing golattas, here and here, in Warsaw, the Jews saw it and they tore off from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">The yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Yes, the yellow star.</span> <span id="s125">Because in Warsaw, they wore armbands, the Mogen Duvid, but not in Lodz because this was a German - they called Vitmanstack {ph} {l43}, they changed the name.</span> <span id="s126">This was a German city because so many Germans lived in this.</span> <span id="s127">So we stayed a few days with my father's aunt, used to be very wealthy in a beautiful neighborhood, but at that time still wasn't the ghetto.</span> <span id="s128">Another cousin came too with the children, you know, ran away from Lodz, so we had to look for an apartment.</span> <span id="s129">We could get a room, for 4 people.</span> <span id="s130">Because then the Germans took everybody from the small towns they sent to Lodz and to some close to Warsaw because it was easier then to send to Treblinka, you know.</span> <span id="s131">And it was so bad.</span> <span id="s132">My father-in-law, he didn't look like a Jew, like a Polish aristocrat.</span> <span id="s133">And that time no ghetto, he was making business with Polish companies so he was selling to the dentists and technicians what he thought he could buy some food and there was nothing to buy.</span> <span id="s134">Yes, the Poles been showing in the streetcars who is a Jew; never touched him.</span> <span id="s135">You know, he was tall, with moustache so he didn't look like a Jew so he used to bring food there.</span> <span id="s136">I remember something from Russia he brought, olives, but I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s137">The Russian Jews, they liked them, green olives.</span> <span id="s138">My late husband he spoke with them Russian.</span> <span id="s139">He didn't know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s140">_____________{l66}.</span> <span id="s141">When one broke out, they went back to Russia.</span> <span id="s142">Why?</span> <span id="s143">Because my late father-in-law had money in a bank and they came after the war in l970 and lived for a while in the same apartment house later lived there and then they moved to Lodz because to get at the business.</span> <span id="s144">So it was in November, I don't remember the date, we decided to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s145">And then my father-in-law came too and 4 people lived in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">So, what was it like in Warsaw and were you there when they started putting up the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Yes.</span> <span id="s148">Was so bad.</span> <span id="s149">One time, before the Ghetto was closed and this was the ghetto where we lived.</span> <span id="s150">One time was no ghetto, a gypsy came up, we were standing in the kitchen, she took my hand and said Jacob is thinking about you - she could say other Jewish name - can you imagine.</span> <span id="s151">So I was his ____________{l76}, I used to work with him, you know was secretary.</span> <span id="s152">So then, we decided to get out.</span> <span id="s153">It was so bad, we didn't want to leave them, you know, but for one thing we couldn't stay anymore and then it was still not ghetto in the smaller towns.</span> <span id="s154">My brother-in-law the doctor ran away with his wife and two children, two sons like I said one is the brain surgeon and one is an architect.</span> <span id="s155">And so we found a woman, dressed like a peasant, a Jewish women, and she said she has papers and showed us something and we had to pay her.</span> <span id="s156">We went and the ghetto was closed This was just you and your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Yes, me and my husband and we went, a Polish policeman was standing there we said we would give you money, open the wooden was closed, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s158">She did, gave her money and I was the first to go out.</span> <span id="s159">This was May.</span> <span id="s160">The first days of May, I don't remember exactly and I was taking some winter clothes because I knew how will I get this from Warsaw and a rucksack carrying on my back and a Polish young man stays there and said "if you won't give me money, I'm going to the Germans".</span> <span id="s161">"We will give you money, bring duriska" this means horse drawn like carriage.</span> <span id="s162">I said yes, we gave him money, we came to the train station and the women, the peasant, she bought the tickets.</span> <span id="s163">This was in the evening.</span> <span id="s164">Jews and Poles were not allowed after 8 o'clock to be on the street.</span> <span id="s165">Did you hear about, a year before I went to see my parents from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s166">The ghetto wasn't closed.</span> <span id="s167">My late cousin was killed.</span> <span id="s168">She was from Switzerland, married in Lodz.</span> <span id="s169">She went with me to the Germans because she spoke, to get me like a visa to go by train I was wearing a armband, I took off my coat and no one recognized me and this was during the day and I found where my parents lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">In the train, I was standing - nowhere to sit - so many Poles, you know they were making business running around from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s171">So I was standing and my late husband didn't look like a Jew, he looked like a tall, skinny, light complexioned, and the Germans, the military came to me and asked me something.</span> <span id="s172">Even if I know __________{286}, only the Jews know German and the Germans who lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s173">The Poles when they went to highschool, it was public but the Jews couldn't go, seldom, so they took French so I didn't answer and we came and it was maybe l0 o'clock at night and we didn't know where to go because this was at night and we heard the Germans walking, you know, with those boots, how they go walking.</span> <span id="s174">And I don't know, intuition, I went home and I told this story and she said GOD must have brought me to this street where my parents lived - tiny - after six rooms.</span> <span id="s175">We had 2 maids, a Polish and a cook, Jewish.</span> <span id="s176">So I called out and my father came down, it wasn't so late and so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s177">We found a room in some place and not long they closed the ghetto and was very bad there too.</span> <span id="s178">We found a man because we didn't have money to live we had to live on - - - , who had Turkish passport.</span> <span id="s179">He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s180">He was going to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s181">We gave him address and he brought some clothes from us and he brought for the dentist too.</span> <span id="s182">You know, we paid him.</span> <span id="s183">For a while he could go.</span> <span id="s184">One time he said, they robbed him on the street, I don't know the Poles, the Turks are dark and he was dark and he had papers.</span> <span id="s185">So he used to bring but then it stopped.</span> <span id="s186">And then they sent us to the city, I think it was l94l, to the city of ____________{324}, my late brother-in-law, the doctor, he was born there.</span> <span id="s187">We went from Warsaw to this town where my parents were too.</span> <span id="s188">My late husband became semi-retired policeman because typhus was terrible you know what was going on in the summer but things got better.</span> <span id="s189">We lived in the same place where the Germans took over the offices.</span> <span id="s190">Dentists had to move out somewhere else and there were the Jewish offices and we had two rooms.</span> <span id="s191">And my younger sister meantime got married and her husband, his mother and his niece, we had two rooms, 8 people maybe.</span> <span id="s192">And one time the Germans came to the Jewish offices and they been looking to get the Jews to send out from the city but we were hiding with some of the people.</span> <span id="s193">They thought that this belonged to the Jewish offices and they didn't come to out apartment.</span> <span id="s194">Otherwise we would be sent out and killed.</span> <span id="s195">So we saw them.</span> <span id="s196">But before, I will tell you, my late husband, my second husband told me, he was my second cousin; his mother was spechenleh {ph} {346} and my mother spechenleh {ph} {346}.</span> <span id="s197">After the war, I did know him in Lodz but not so much, he found me in the came; someone told him that me and my sister were under the British; he was in a sanitorium - he was sick.</span> <span id="s198">So he told me that in Lodz they took out the young women, children to the outskirts of the town - they killed them, in Lodz.</span> <span id="s199">But he couldn't do nothing and he was by himself in the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s200">He found me and we got married in l947 and my son was born in l948.</span> <span id="s201">He was l0 months old when we came here to the United States and we sent him to the Hebrew Academy.</span> <span id="s202">I worked and I paid.</span> <span id="s203">Here, the Russian Jews, they don't pay for 2 years.</span> <span id="s204">After 2 years they take out the children from the Charles Smith School (I heard about) but I worked and I paid for his school because we wanted him to have a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s205">He went to Blair High School because Hebrew Academy goes only to l0th grade.</span> <span id="s206">So he had to go to a public school if we lived in Washington.</span> <span id="s207">I remember when I started to work and he went to Hebrew Academy they came from the public school, he went to kindergarten, and asked me why I'm not sending him.</span> <span id="s208">I said I have to work and I have to send him to a private school and we have to move there and after school, he went to Ohr Kodesh and took more Hebrew.</span> <span id="s209">I have to ask him how many times a week, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s210">He is teaching Hebrew now in Bowie and my daughter-in-law too, in Sunday school.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Can we go back then?</span> <span id="s212">We've skipped now over between now and after Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Yes.</span> <span id="s214">After Warsaw they sent us to _____________ {373).</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Can you spell the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">I will write down.</span> <span id="s217">There are 2 _________________ {375} but one time they took us out</span></p> <p><span id="s218">The Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Yes, sure, they took us out.</span> <span id="s220">We had to throw all the clothes we had they took away from us.</span> <span id="s221">My husband and me and my brother, we were sent to a factory.</span> <span id="s222">Part went to a glass factory, I have __________{383} I have the paper here, the book.</span> <span id="s223">My brother, during the war he write and her father was the like the president of the gemeinde for the Jews.</span> <span id="s224">And I read here, I didn't know, he said his son, my sister-in-law's brother, he was a Communist.</span> <span id="s225">He went to Russia before the war.</span> <span id="s226">But during the war, he parachuted but the Germans caught him.</span> <span id="s227">But he wanted ______ {39l} they were Jews working but they shot him, killed him.</span> <span id="s228">My sister-in-law, all gone.</span> <span id="s229">My brother had only one son, graduated Harvard University, worked for international company.</span> <span id="s230">Business administration too, like my brother started in Germany.</span> <span id="s231">_______{395} 26 years old, 3 years later he lost his wife.</span> <span id="s232">He lives in Wheaton, he works for Morton, since he came here before l950, he still works.</span> <span id="s233">What will he do?</span> <span id="s234">My brother doesn't look like a Jew, too, he was tall, blond.</span> <span id="s235">So what was I going to say --- they took us out, we went to one factory (this was before, I just read because I didn't know) clothes, materials they were making, now the Germans opened, wood they needed, for instance airplanes in the summer outside standing women connecting like all when it was colder made boxes for ammunition they needed.</span> <span id="s236">The director, he was a German, you know, Gestapo, he lived in a place was house of the Jews, even I read the names, and he had a dog and I read the dog's name, and the toilets were outside.</span> <span id="s237">We walked with Poles and you know, they looked at us Jews what we had to do.</span> <span id="s238">On one side the men had the toilets and we had primitive toilets.</span> <span id="s239">He told the dog "Mensh, nem den hunt" which means, like "men, take the dog".</span> <span id="s240">He said this to the dog.</span> <span id="s241">The dog was like the man and they were the dogs, the Jews.And sometimes by mistake, we were scared because we went out to rest for a few minutes and they were biting, I read about, - terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s242">The young man, what he did, he took from the kitchen from the bone so we thought the dog would bite them to give them the bone.</span> <span id="s243">So we went there until l944.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">So where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">It was ________{432}.</span> <span id="s246">We had bunks, everybody, in one room, the husbands and wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">It wasn't a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Not yet.</span> <span id="s249">But it was, listen.</span> <span id="s250">One time they said, it was on a Saturday, if we will wash the floor, we would go ________{436}, so I decided.</span> <span id="s251">You should have seen the Poles, the women, standing and looking at us - saying what the Jews are now, washing the floors.</span> <span id="s252">I'm telling you.</span> <span id="s253">My late husband used to bring me, I used to work from 2 until l0 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s254">They needed it.</span> <span id="s255">He didn't want to go to fight so he took work there and we saw one time came ________{443} and there was a big place where they sold the horses and they came to the factory and they allowed them to work, elderly women, Russian, so he talked with some Russian.</span> <span id="s256">We still had with my brother and sister-in-law one room, we stayed there.</span> <span id="s257">They wanted to attack.</span> <span id="s258">They saw young women, they want to rape them.</span> <span id="s259">Cossacks, I don't know who they were.</span> <span id="s260">Luckily, Jewish police who were standing would not allow them to go.</span> <span id="s261">This was in the factory, yes.</span> <span id="s262">Then they sent us to Germany.</span> <span id="s263">They said to take everything because we were going to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">This is still l944?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">l944, yes.</span> <span id="s266">They said we would work.</span> <span id="s267">Then they sent my mother from the other factory, my parents came.</span> <span id="s268">Yes, one time I could see my parents.</span> <span id="s269">My late brother-in-law, I have to get the papers.</span> <span id="s270">He saved so many Jews, should be in the Holocaust here, saved_______{468}.</span> <span id="s271">So, he came like a horse strong, this was the factory the last belonged before the war to a German company but they treated them bad already too, so he took me one time to my parents and my father had a stroke that time and I don't know where he was took but they took us at the same time and we had to walk to the train and my mother and my father but they separated us from the men and took us by train in how many days, nothing to eat, nothing and they brought us to Ravensbruk.</span> <span id="s272">One woman told me she walked, she didn't have railroad.</span> <span id="s273">She was from Lodz.</span> <span id="s274">I met her in Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s275">They took us there, in a field.</span> <span id="s276">Everything they took away from us.</span> <span id="s277">And you know what?</span> <span id="s278">The women who were there before us, they were looking we don't have gold or diamonds, you hear.</span> <span id="s279">We have to give them everything and they gave us like, winter coats, a schmata, you know what a schmata is?</span> <span id="s280">The next day they took us to work.</span> <span id="s281">There were hundreds of pieces of clothing, whatever, they took away, and we had to sort.</span> <span id="s282">In Poland, in Pershka {ph} {496}, we had the same because they sent to Germany, those good things.</span> <span id="s283">And here too, we had to sort.</span> <span id="s284">In the beginning.</span> <span id="s285">And then we had to carry from the kitchen, coal or potatoes, two women, one in front.</span> <span id="s286">From this I don't have tissues in my spine.</span> <span id="s287">From hot.</span> <span id="s288">Only maybe once he allowed us to stop.</span> <span id="s289">We had to go to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s290">I had this coat and the pockets were so low so sometimes I could take a potato but they were looking, they were checking us but those they didn't check or something.</span> <span id="s291">I now asked to rest.</span> <span id="s292">So one time I couldn't do it, my hands, you know.</span> <span id="s293">It was 3-4 years of war, we didn't have to eat for a week, especially we came from Warsaw, you know how bad it was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s294">In the smaller towns, they still went out before the ghetto to the Poles in the country they could exchange, not money they didn't want, for other things, get some food.</span> <span id="s295">So I found some from iron, so I put this to carry, maybe this made me {?}</span> <span id="s296">{5l9}.</span> <span id="s297">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s298">Till one day came, my younger sister worked in like a hospital, HOSPITAL!</span> <span id="s299">so I had to help her to get out the dead persons so the Germans started to ran away.</span> <span id="s300">So what did they do?</span> <span id="s301">They took the women, strong, I mean, tall ones.</span> <span id="s302">They didn't touch me because I'm short but my younger sister, wanted to take to take care of their luggage but I told them she worked in the hospital so they let her go.</span> <span id="s303">And we went and were sitting in this stone floor, wet, we had to wash this, and we noticed that the Germans were running away.</span> <span id="s304">I didn't tell my sister nothing.</span> <span id="s305">I went out by myself, I couldn't walk anymore, and sit down on the ground when the British came, and announced in German "no more war".</span> <span id="s306">So I went back.</span> <span id="s307">I thought I would . . . .</span> <span id="s308">They went to get cattle for food.</span> <span id="s309">You know, they were Hungarians went on the Germans side so if someone came by themselves, not with the cattle, they been shooting them.</span> <span id="s310">The Hungarians.</span> <span id="s311">I came back and one of the liberators was todays President _________{546} Herzl {?}</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">He went in l987 back there to ________{547}.</span> <span id="s314">I didn't see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Let me stop for a minute and I'm going to switch the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Side B started with counter started at zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Ok, so you were just telling me, you were in Ravesnbruck, so where did you go from Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">To Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">You were taken to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Yes.</span> <span id="s321">We were taken to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s322">There we didn't work.</span> <span id="s323">But I'm telling you there were French - - my older sister knew French so she was DeGault's niece, she told her and they treated them even worse than other French women and sometimes they did something, stole something, I don't know, how they were beating the French women, terrible, terrible, in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Did you ever experience any - -Beating?</span> <span id="s325">No, only in Pietrocv where I worked, because I am short.</span> <span id="s326">It was l0 o'clock so maybe we were standing, not working, talking, a German, not military, who lived there with a big stick, he came and he wanted to hit so I, you know, I never got hit otherwise, sure we were beaten, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">How long were you in Bergen-Belsen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Till we came - I don't remember, it was already maybe in the Spring of l945.</span> <span id="s329">I think so, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s330">Or maybe still it was winter, I think, yes.</span> <span id="s331">And then we didn't work, we just were dying there.</span> <span id="s332">We were lying on the wet floor, you know.</span> <span id="s333">And the food, the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Did you have any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Nah!</span> <span id="s336">One time I went out and someone gave me some food so I had for my mother, you know to give her something.</span> <span id="s337">I saw pictures.</span> <span id="s338">They were beating the men, Jews beat other Jews.</span> <span id="s339">The Germans forced them to beat the other Jews, for what I don't know.</span> <span id="s340">We saw this.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">This was in Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s342">And your parents were there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s344">I don't know when I find ________{62}.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">When did you lose track of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">My mother died - She was with us two days after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">So she was with you during all of these deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s349">And in Ravensbruck {ph} {64}, we were not there, my older sister, they wanted to take us to carry, you know, this _______{65} I don't know, I wasn't there, but my older sister said she would work for my mother so let her go.</span> <span id="s350">In Ravensbruck we had to work - yes.</span> <span id="s351">They said the Polish women were young.</span> <span id="s352">It was a big place.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">We had to dig the sand.</span> <span id="s354">How the Polish women, the young women, how they treated us and for what, I don't know for what they made a big hole, that time in Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s355">This was the oven - I saw the oven in Bergen-Belsen; after the war we went there and I don't know I wasn't on the list the I survived, my younger sister too.</span> <span id="s356">Because they took me after the war like a hospital.</span> <span id="s357">They took me to the kitchen and a nurse washed me and powdered and I kept my eyes closed.</span> <span id="s358">I opened my eyes and I saw a German military man with a monocle.</span> <span id="s359">I thought it was still war.</span> <span id="s360">The British took me and they wiped me and took me back to the place.</span> <span id="s361">My sisters were not there.</span> <span id="s362">Later I found out where they were, you know, in a room in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s363">Then we found out, there was a list, that my late brother, the doctor, survived and his two sons.</span> <span id="s364">The little one worked as a shoemaker and the other too.</span> <span id="s365">One time my brother-in-law told us after the _________{8l} in Buchenwald, he was liberated, he had to work like any other worker, came a German military man and asked who was the doctor.</span> <span id="s366">Everybody was quiet, because they thought it was the intelligence to kill.</span> <span id="s367">But finally my brother-in-law said he was the doctor.</span> <span id="s368">So he had a girl from the ward, he took him there, he helped and so he didn't work no more because of this.</span> <span id="s369">He survived in a way.</span> <span id="s370">After the war we found out and we found him in Buchenwald and he worked as a doctor there and thanks GOD the two sons survived and then he went ________{89} with his family to Switzerland because they opened.</span> <span id="s371">At first they wouldn't allow the Jews, they had a hard time to come to Switzerland, you know.</span> <span id="s372">I read that the Orthodox Jews in Switzerland got some Jews to Switzerland because when they came to the border they sent them back.</span> <span id="s373">My sister, she was in the nursing home, she lost her husband.</span> <span id="s374">He was from Vienna.</span> <span id="s375">During the war he ran away.</span> <span id="s376">He wanted to go to Portugal, no, so he went to the Alps.</span> <span id="s377">He helped other people.</span> <span id="s378">He came to France.</span> <span id="s379">They caught him there, they sent him to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s380">Thanks GOD he survived, he was never married and he fell in love with my sister, got married.</span> <span id="s381">My nephew is here.</span> <span id="s382">He works for Merrill-Lynch.</span> <span id="s383">He went to Maryland University and the same like my son in l970 he received $l0,000.</span> <span id="s384">A good student but he went to Israel and worked for a while in Israel.</span> <span id="s385">He sold his car, what he had, but he came back.</span> <span id="s386">I always say his father is watching; he was six years old when his father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">So you lost your first husband during this -- in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">We don't know nothing about, we don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">After Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">After Ravensbruck we went to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">And he wasn't - - ?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">No, No.</span> <span id="s393">Maybe he was with us but then the men they took away but we don't know.</span> <span id="s394">My father, he had a stroke immediately.</span> <span id="s395">My older sister in New York, she established what date the Rabbi told her for Yahrzeit Zeidt, you know.</span> <span id="s396">For my mother we know because 2 days after the liberation on the l7th of April she died.</span> <span id="s397">So we know.</span> <span id="s398">My second husband found me in the camp.</span> <span id="s399">We didn't have no one.</span> <span id="s400">In l947.</span> <span id="s401">He was in a sanitorium, he was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">In Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">He was close where I was, not far,________{ll5}, I was living there and you know what, Hitler was there sitting in jail when he wrote "Mein Kampf".</span> <span id="s404">My younger sister and her husband one evening, we lived in one room - I wasn't married yet - a policeman came said they were arrested because they weren't allowed to be outside at that time after the war and they were taken to the jail in Lansberg-Amesh {ph} {ll5} so I didn't have food and I went to them and got from them food and I went to the jail and I had to walk there and then I found out later that Hitler was there.</span> <span id="s405">There were 2 other friends there after the war but they came back and my brother-in-law was there too.</span> <span id="s406">________________________{l24, I wasn't out with them, otherwise I brought them some food to jail and then I found out Hitler was there in jail, he wrote "Mein Kampf".</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Once you were liberated and recuperated, you lived in this town in Germany, what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">I started to learn how to do sewing, you know, because I knew maybe we go to the United States, before I even got married because I could work in a office but I wanted to learn a trade, you know.</span> <span id="s409">I met my husband.</span> <span id="s410">He lived in a smaller town, this was like a resort, Bart Verishofen (ph),{l3l} so my son was born there.</span> <span id="s411">When my son was born, I used to go to the doctor there.</span> <span id="s412">It was like a hospital.</span> <span id="s413">It was close.</span> <span id="s414">My husband was standing all the time till my son was born.</span> <span id="s415">Luckily, we heard that they were killing the mothers or the children, the Germans because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s416">How many Jewish doctors survived?</span> <span id="s417">So luckily, he was standing all the time, luckily the doctor allowed him to stay in the room.</span> <span id="s418">So that's my husband, after the war I married him.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Mr. Roth.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Yes - No.</span> <span id="s421">His name was Rothkopf like Schwartzkopf.</span> <span id="s422">But it was a German name because the Jews, you know, lived in Germany but in the l2th century or the l4th century, a Polish king, Casimir the Great {ph} {l42}, heard how the Jews were doing very well for the Germans, he invited them and you know how many Jews lived in Poland?</span> <span id="s423">Not even 5,000.</span> <span id="s424">Only the elderly people, the young left.</span> <span id="s425">We had an apartment house in Warsaw from my grandparents but my cousin's wife after the was war was sent to Sweden so he came back and he sold it.</span> <span id="s426">He's dead too.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">l949.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">How did you arrange your passage?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Passage - When President Truman -- We don't have any relatives, only my late husband, he had an uncle in New York.</span> <span id="s431">He told me, he came here in l9ll, he didn't like it, went back, got married and I don't remember exactly what, came back here and lived in Brooklyn because we used to go to ________{l54} later on and his daughter she wrote something about President Kennedy because she went to school here, maybe she was born here - I don't remember - so he sent her a letter, I saw the letter, he thanked her how nice she wrote about him.</span> <span id="s432">So we came here to Washington, my younger sister and my other sister, he had a uncle so he sent in the papers.</span> <span id="s433">My sister came from Switzerland, my younger sister.</span> <span id="s434">I have a picture</span></p> <p><span id="s435">of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Through them, the uncle of - - - he was a dentist in Vienna, she met her future husband.</span> <span id="s437">See I know, in Florida, she sent me a letter, a card, because he had quadruple heart surgery.</span> <span id="s438">They go now every year.</span> <span id="s439">He was very, very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">So we came here and in the beginning the Jewish ----------{l66} helped us some money, you know, till my husband got a job, you know.</span> <span id="s441">He had ten jobs.</span> <span id="s442">I couldn't work, my son was ten months old.</span> <span id="s443">Not all jobs he could have because he was sick after the war and the doctor said not with paint, he wasn't allowed and Mrs. --the one here he was her husbands relative.</span> <span id="s444">We used to go to the doctor, he told me one time a women sitting and she said, I was in the office, she brought many relatives here.</span> <span id="s445">We didn't have no relatives.</span> <span id="s446">Sometimes, his uncle sent him a suit, a few dollars, you know, so we could make it because it was very, very hard when we came here like I said no relatives.</span> <span id="s447">He was not a wealthy man.</span> <span id="s448">So my brother-in-law told him to go to the Washington Post Saturday night to put, you know, all those papers in for Sunday and in night he was coming very late and finally he got the job with the Giant.</span> <span id="s449">And he worked in so bad neighborhoods, you know, Washington.</span> <span id="s450">Finally in l96l, we were already here l2 years, he learned to drive and we bought an old junk car, we had only problems.</span> <span id="s451">So in the Giant he used to come l0 o'clock, eat dinner l0 o'clock but when my son went to Hebrew Academy, I went myself, in Washington I knew where to go, and filled out for social security card and went and got a job in the Hecht Company.</span> <span id="s452">I had to fill out in housewares.</span> <span id="s453">This was the hardest job - sending the address, you know how many kinds of bills I had to fill out beside cash.</span> <span id="s454">Like banks, they throw in the metal.</span> <span id="s455">But 8 hours and my husband worked too.</span> <span id="s456">Next to us in another building a Christian family, they had a girl, a little older than my son but they played together and when I was home giving lunch I'd give lunch.</span> <span id="s457">I used to pay her $2.00 a week.</span> <span id="s458">Her husband in a coffee house as a baker and every day he waited for my son when the cab brought him home from school but I had a hard time.</span> <span id="s459">Why?</span> <span id="s460">Because -----------------{l97 - l99} (the tape fades out with nothing on it) the --------{20l} wouldn't let me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">I had to run the next block and I was afraid, 9:30 I had to be at work.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">This is very interesting but for our purposes I wonder if there is anything else you remember from the war period that made an tremendous impression, any incident or any episode that you haven't told me about?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">About the Germans came twice to our house with my father-in-law and hit him in the cheek.</span> <span id="s464">My father was responsible so he wouldn't run away, so I went with the Germans downstairs.</span> <span id="s465">Our apartment had 6 rooms that time and I showed him, "see _______ {2l0} the carpets?"</span> <span id="s466">I grabbed him by the lapels and I said, now he will hit me, what I did, a Jewish women, but he behaved nice to me.</span> <span id="s467">He came up, my father was responsible.</span> <span id="s468">My parents left because every day the Gestapo, the Germans, used to come because of the_____________{2l4} and because my father was the president of this organization for the poor Jews, doctors, dentists, this was a secret organization so they wanted the papers so they grabbed me on the street when I went to the lawyer so everybody had to run away, we couldn't stay.</span> <span id="s469">But my brother had hidden like the pictures we got from the janitor hidden some in gold.</span> <span id="s470">I had a gold heart when I was a teenager.</span> <span id="s471">My initial E.B.</span> <span id="s472">In Polish they gave me a remembrance and a bracelet I had and whatever, some things.</span> <span id="s473">And I had a beautiful handbag but I don't have it here, you know, that my late first husband gave me.</span> <span id="s474">And the diamond ring we had to sell it in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s475">We were eating horse meat, you know.</span> <span id="s476">The Jews were selling horse meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Unless there is anything else you wanted to say, I think we can stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Yes, I come from a very wealthy family, you know.</span> <span id="s479">Money was not a problem.</span> <span id="s480">We used to go to resort.</span> <span id="s481">We used to go to resort in the mountains and the Jews from Krakoff, they spoke only Polish and had payes {ph} {233} and it was in l936, we went there and I found in a book about this town, Krakoff, a Pole who had a big drugstore still in the ghetto,in Krakoff, he knew many Jews.</span> <span id="s482">I don't see the book, maybe someday I'll find the book.</span> <span id="s483">I want someone to read about how the Jews spoke Polish, not Yiddish, you know, beautiful.</span> <span id="s484">He said what he wrote the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">My late husband, my second, he had dreams sometimes, he screamed at night, you know.</span> <span id="s486">He had terrible dreams.</span> <span id="s487">And me, when I think - -, My younger sister who was in the camp - - the Jews who had real estate in our city, we had Jewish banks, we had organizations.</span> <span id="s488">So in Poland, people who live in apartment house gave us like wechsel like here --- Like a promisor note?</span></p> <p><span
