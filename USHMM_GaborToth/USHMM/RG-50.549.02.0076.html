January 8th, 2004.</span> <span id="s19">I am Paul Strassman who was born in Trencin, January 24, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: I’d first like to ask you to tell me about your early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: The earliest that I remember of my childhood was the -- the rituals of the family that revolved around Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s22">The peak holiday was, of course, always Pesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the dishes had to be changed.</span> <span id="s23">And lots of cooking took place.</span> <span id="s24">I always ran errands for my mother, helping her out.</span> <span id="s25">And I remember, perhaps as early as at the age of four or five, I learned how to pull the dough to make a streudel-thin dough.</span> <span id="s26">These are all trivial examples of what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Tell me more about those family traditions and rituals, o-other observances, birthdays, religious holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: The Jewish community in Trencin consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a population of about 19,000, so it was a very large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s29">The Jewish community was centered around the school, which was a parochial school, and the synagogue.</span> <span id="s30">The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me to prayers on Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s31">There was regulated holidays that had to be kept, and my mother maintained originally, during the 30’s, before the trouble started, she maintained a kosher home.</span> <span id="s32">It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn’t make much sense to me.</span> <span id="s33">What particularly didn't make sense to me is that all the praying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn’t understand a word of it.</span> <span id="s34">They never tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant.</span> <span id="s35">As a matter of fact, my father, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to be highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that people could understand.</span> <span id="s36">So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a very formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the -- which was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association with the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist organization, who was, at least mildly speaking, anti-religious, socialist, communalist, and totally rejecting the existence in the -- in the -- in the -- in the -- in the Slovak environment and totally focused on everybody getting out and moving to Palestine, and to live in a kibbutz in a communal Utopian environment.</span> <span id="s37">And as time went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a community that made lots of sense.</span> <span id="s38">The songs were very good.</span> <span id="s39">The -- the s-singing in the synagogue was always wailing.</span> <span id="s40">The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer Hatzair was very zippy.</span> <span id="s41">Subsequently I found out that much of the communist singing was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong.</span> <span id="s42">I always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best songs and the ugliest girls.</span> <span id="s43">But the songs were great, and the entertainment was great, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization -- r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on us, already starting in ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Now, you were only seven when you joined this organization, so obviously it was with your full family blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, I wouldn’t say so.</span> <span id="s46">My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly disapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti-religious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of dragged me in.</span> <span id="s47">And also, one of the teachers in the Jewish school was a -- a rebel.</span> <span id="s48">He turned out to be, subsequently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of course, they shot him afterwards in the anti -- anti-Communist purges.</span> <span id="s49">But -- so there was a very lively environment going on, a tremendous amount of change, and a great deal of debates about the future and ideas.</span> <span id="s50">So I was exposed to ideas like that very early in my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s52">How much older than you was Ella?</span> <span id="s53">What -- when would she have been born?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My sister Ella was born in 1925, so she was four -- almost four and a half o -- years older than me, and I’ve been always very, very close to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And what is her full name?</span> <span id="s56">A: Her full name is Ella Fabian.</span> <span id="s57">And she married a -- a -- just about the only eligible Jewish boy who was left in Trencin after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s58">He survived being put behind a false brick wall, and two bricks were removed from time to time to feed him and take the soil out.</span> <span id="s59">And he never regained his health, but she married him anyway, and they have two beautiful children.</span> <span id="s60">They are both medical doctors and I visit them quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And the grandparents you spoke of, would they have been your -- were they maternal?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Well, my maternal grandmother is a lady of particular distinction that I talk about very much.</span> <span id="s63">She was the local marriage broker.</span> <span id="s64">Did I ever tell the story about here?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: No.</span> <span id="s66">I would love to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Oh, Grandmother Emma was really something very special.</span> <span id="s68">She was married to my maternal grandfather, Alexander Weiner, who was a master cabinetmaker.</span> <span id="s69">It was apparently a deep love because during the first World War, when he went to war, and no, he didn’t write for a couple of years, everybody thought that he died, and she got very, very sick.</span> <span id="s70">At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a very small store selling embroidery.</span> <span id="s71">And this was embroidery patterns.</span> <span id="s72">So when the little girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to Emma’s little shop and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns.</span> <span id="s73">And in those days, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age of five.</span> <span id="s74">I mean -- I mean, if you didn’t get married by the time you were 19, you were really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you.</span> <span id="s75">At any rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come in and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the girl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for recommending somebody.</span> <span id="s76">So my maternal grandmother, Emma, apparently was known very widely in the whole community as absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that -- that never made a mistake.</span> <span id="s77">And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker, as well as a -- as a seller of embroidery.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So this would be done quite formally.</span> <span id="s79">People would pay for her advice?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s81">Marriage brokers were paid, and of course the other thing was that my grandfather Weiner made -- was known for making chests which were inlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabinetry.</span> <span id="s82">This was inlaid wood veneer.</span> <span id="s83">And so, usually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were starting to get on the queue with my grandfather Alexander, to start making a chest.</span> <span id="s84">Well, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, and so the delivery on these chests was always uncertain.</span> <span id="s85">But he was a fun guy.</span> <span id="s86">He was always singing, he -- he -- he was really -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more c-care of me than anybody else in the family, because he had the time.</span> <span id="s87">And I was then apprenticed to him at the age of 11, and he taught me how to do inlaid veneer.</span> <span id="s88">So I worked for him for awhile.</span> <span id="s89">So it was a very colorful kind of an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And very loving.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s92">My father was a very tense person.</span> <span id="s93">And -- and there was always a question -- course, I was -- I was a -- a child that caused trouble.</span> <span id="s94">I-I was known as the troublemaker.</span> <span id="s95">I-I had a reputation as being a particularly rebellious child.</span> <span id="s96">And years later some people tell me about kind of the pranks that I used to pull, and my father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the line and very often I didn’t.</span> <span id="s97">But the rebellion was there to begin with.</span> <span id="s98">My mother was a very loving woman, but she was really the brains behind the business, we ran a big business, my father had a big business.</span> <span id="s99">She was the cashier.</span> <span id="s100">She was the peacemaker am-among the employees.</span> <span id="s101">She was very charitable.</span> <span id="s102">She was actually the head of the WIZO, which was the women’s Zionist organization, in Trencin.</span> <span id="s103">Everybody loved her, a-although there were some women who wore a grudge against her because she stole the best man in town.</span> <span id="s104">And i -- years later, a woman who survived told me that she could have been my mother.</span> <span id="s105">She was a -- she had her eye on -- on my father, except for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother.</span> <span id="s106">So that’s -- that’s -- these are the kinds of stories that one -- I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What would be the kind of things that you would get up -- up to, and where did that rebelliousness come from, I wonder, in your case?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Where does the rebelliousness come from, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s109">I was not considered to be a bright child.</span> <span id="s110">I was not considered to be one of the leading scholars.</span> <span id="s111">I mean, there were kids who were -- had better grades than I did.</span> <span id="s112">I was always looking at things.</span> <span id="s113">I-I must say that one of the memories that I have was that in the third grade -- so I must have been eight years old, maybe less, I became very interested in condoms, which was a no-no thing in those days.</span> <span id="s114">I mean, that was totally out of -- out of bound for everybody.</span> <span id="s115">And I did not know exactly what it was, but I was told this is really hush-hush.</span> <span id="s116">Well, what happened is that through some arrangements, I got hold of a pack and brought them to school.</span> <span id="s117">Now, that was considered to be -- I was badly beaten up.</span> <span id="s118">You know -- in those days, you know, the kids got physical punishment.</span> <span id="s119">I had to stretch my hands, and I got caned over my hands.</span> <span id="s120">Now why I did it, I don’t know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it.</span> <span id="s121">Particularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot.</span> <span id="s122">And he didn't hear well, he didn’t speak well, didn’t see well.</span> <span id="s123">He was in his last year before retirement, and I think I just had to get at him one way or another.</span> <span id="s124">So -- so, discipline was always a problem with -- with me, including some really bad st-stunts that I pulled on girls, but it’s -- it’s history.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: We’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Now, tell me the full names of your maternal grandparents and then I’d like to ask about your other grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yeah, the maternal grandfather was Alexander Weiner, my mother’s -- she was born Weiner, Frances Weiner.</span> <span id="s129">Her -- Alexander’s wife was Emma wa -- she died quite early, in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s130">And -- and they really mer -- wro -- ma -- had a major imprint on -- on -- on my sensibility and understanding and -- and -- and -- and care.</span> <span id="s131">By the way, I just want you to know i-is that Grandfather Weiner was a diabetic, which mean he had to eat early, and he -- he had to eat more frequently than anybody else.</span> <span id="s132">He made a mean garlic soup.</span> <span id="s133">I mean, really strong garlic soup.</span> <span id="s134">To this day, a garlic soup, to me, is the best soup you can eat.</span> <span id="s135">And my whole family is still kidding me about the fact that I will eat anything as long as it has garlic.</span> <span id="s136">But it’s in memory of my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: And your paternal grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Well, the paternal grandfather, Filip was a sick man, he had angina.</span> <span id="s139">He was a very withdrawn kind of a person, never talked too much.</span> <span id="s140">He was no fun.</span> <span id="s141">The -- the -- he married a woman from a family that -- that had lots of aunts.</span> <span id="s142">Oh, it was a huge, huge family.</span> <span id="s143">And my paternal grandfather’s wife Anna was very small and she always liked to give me food that I didn’t get at home.</span> <span id="s144">So her specialty was baked potatoes with lots of onions, garlic and when you render goose fat, the skin -- sh-she mixed that in.</span> <span id="s145">And so for years I ate on that and of course when I came home I didn’t have an appetite, for which I was always punished, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: By the way, of your maternal grandfather, does any of his furniture survive, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I recognize some of his pieces in the homes of the Gentiles that I visited after the war.</span> <span id="s148">They vehemently desi -- [coughs] deny -- let me stop.</span> <span id="s149">[tape break].</span> <span id="s150">You -- your question was about precious possessions.</span> <span id="s151">One of the things that I learned from the Holocaust is never to care for precious possessions.</span> <span id="s152">I can walk away from this house any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Yeah, because you’ve -- you -- you’ve learned from those experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yeah, what I learned from the experience is that the ability to walk away from something is very important, it’s [indecipherable] survival.</span> <span id="s155">If there is a major lesson I’ve learned from the Holocaust, it is my ability to just, when I see a problem, something going wrong, I just walk.</span> <span id="s156">And -- and I would say that is a characteristic which is something very deeply ingrained in my behavior.</span> <span id="s157">And if there is a single pattern that describes what I learned from the Holocaust, is that ability to walk away.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: We’ll come back to that later in the interview, but because you’ve mentioned it, I will ask now about your decision to leave your home in 1948, when you, more than many others, had a reason to stay.</span> <span id="s159">You had a heritage and things you could pick up --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Property, yeah.</span> <span id="s161">We had a heri -- heritage property.</span> <span id="s162">I could have inhe -- I -- presumably I was inheriting lots of land, houses.</span> <span id="s163">My decision to walk was much earlier than when people were forced out by the communists.</span> <span id="s164">I -- although many of the Jews who came back, they were spending their time reclaiming properties and going to court, and going through recovery and reclamation and restitution and all of this thing, I wanted no part of it.</span> <span id="s165">I didn’t -- never touched it in my years there.</span> <span id="s166">I basically felt that the -- the country was poisoned.</span> <span id="s167">The people that I saw on the streets when I walked, were -- were the people who were killing and stealing and robbing and -- and -- and committing crimes, including the people who gradually came to the forefront in a political position.</span> <span id="s168">These are people I knew from the uprising as criminals.</span> <span id="s169">You know, I said, I just don’t want to live in this country.</span> <span id="s170">Just don’t want to be there, regardless.</span> <span id="s171">So I told my sister, you take everything is here -- by the way, I never took a penny out of that place.</span> <span id="s172">Never took a penny, I’ve never claimed anything.</span> <span id="s173">I was never paid or made any claims to the Germans, although all the other Jews did.</span> <span id="s174">Never wanted to touch it, that was tainted stuff.</span> <span id="s175">So this is -- this is a very important characteristic of my experience that -- that I did not cling -- I do not cling to things which are basically, in my view, morally evil.</span> <span id="s176">When you see anything that’s morally evil, wrong, you don’t stick around.</span> <span id="s177">And -- and that is really the reason why, starting in 1946, the idea was, I’m not going to stick around, I’m just going to go wherever I can.</span> <span id="s178">Of course, the idea was to go to America, where there was unlimited opportunity and nobody knew me.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Now, was it that clear cut in the beginning?</span> <span id="s180">I mean, th -- all -- did you rationally think through the pros and cons of leaving everything and going with nothing to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, the big moment, the big moment in my life, you know, in -- in other words, in -- when you look at life, there are only few things which are so called, a fulcrum.</span> <span id="s182">And this is when you roll your dice, and if you don’t roll the dice right, you die.</span> <span id="s183">It’s -- it’s -- you know, it’s -- it’s -- or -- or perish, or whatever.</span> <span id="s184">When the -- when the uprising took place and -- and the Germans started persecuting Jews and partisans and arresting people, we went to predetermined houses where we wo -- you know, hide and we -- the Christians are going to keep us hidden and we were going to crawl into the attic, or crawl into a closet or -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s185">And, you know, these experiences, everybody has a different experience about what they did.</span> <span id="s186">I went to the house, which you may or may not recall from my interview, to the house of an employee who was a very trusted interview -- employee of -- of my father’s.</span> <span id="s187">A long employee who owed very much to my father.</span> <span id="s188">His wife was very unhappy, his wi -- by the way, the marriage was a bad marriage to begin with.</span> <span id="s189">And she was grousing about, y-you -- you know, the Germans coming, finding me there and shooting the whole family because they to -- that is what the Germans were advertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to be executed.</span> <span id="s190">So I -- I was told to just go out to the -- near the river, and sit there during the day, when presumably the Germans were going to do house to house searches and then come back at night and they’re going to feed me.</span> <span id="s191">And the big decision, this is one of these fulcrum decisions which sort of imprinted me on my whole model, walking away.</span> <span id="s192">When I sat at the river, I said, I’m not going to go back.</span> <span id="s193">I’m rather going to go take my chances where the shooting was than go back to what is presumably a safe house.</span> <span id="s194">Same thing happened in ’48 -- or ’46, you know, I could have stayed there, but this idea of walking was by that time very heavily imprinted in me.</span> <span id="s195">Also, th-that my behavior in -- in the partisans was very much -- a-as you know, during the partisan warfare, there’s always a little cottage where you can go to and some peasants will hide you or keep you for the night, so instead you being outside in the frost, you’re going to come into the village and stay there and get fed.</span> <span id="s196">Well, lots of partisans lost their life that way.</span> <span id="s197">I just didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s198">There was always a bunch of guys who say, well, it’s just too dangerous.</span> <span id="s199">So this idea of not necessarily staying comfortable, but doing the contrary thing is something which is not just Paul Strassmann, this is something, when you look at history of Jews -- I’m just finished reading for the second time Paul Johnson’s history of th -- of Jews.</span> <span id="s200">You know, when you say, well how did the Jews survive for, you know, whatever thousand years it was, you know, how did they move from -- from Sumer to Egypt to Canaan to Assyria to Babylon and back and forth.</span> <span id="s201">And then went to Persia, then went to -- to -- to -- to Damascus and to Anatolia.</span> <span id="s202">Th-The -- the wandering Jew.</span> <span id="s203">Well, the survival of the Jews was one that they always were ready to move.</span> <span id="s204">They would have stayed put, they would have died and perished like everybody else who stayed put.</span> <span id="s205">So this is not just a Paul Strassmann kind of an imprint, it’s just deeply -- now whether it’s genetic, I doubt, but it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or religious or psychological orientation.</span> <span id="s206">It’s something that -- that very much has been a pattern of everything I’ve done and how I’ve progressed in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: It could be, I suppose, this real survival instinct.</span> <span id="s208">I had -- on the one hand, you could say that you’re -- certainly with the partisans you’re -- you seemed to have nine lives.</span> <span id="s209">You were young, you were taking risks, but it’s an interesting to -- way to -- to look at it, that it was in your blood, that it’s part of the -- part of your heritage.</span> <span id="s210">And there does seem to be moral overtones, that rather than hiding, you were taking an active role that might make things better.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yeah, in fact my son that I lost was very much interested in the subject, and -- and he was a brilliant, brilliant scholar at Harvard.</span> <span id="s212">And he always wanted to know, you know, what -- what makes it tick?</span> <span id="s213">You know?</span> <span id="s214">Give me an equation, you know, give -- give me something quantitative.</span> <span id="s215">Because you know, I always do things quantitatively.</span> <span id="s216">And I said, well, a-as you know, in -- in games theory and in mathematics, and in gaming, there are things called algorithms, okay?</span> <span id="s217">And so he wanted to know, what’s the algorithm.</span> <span id="s218">And anythi -- in conversation with my son, then I said, you know, the -- the -- the algorithm in life is that you always want to migrate to where your number of options that you have, increase.</span> <span id="s219">So the algorithm is that if you are somewhere in what’s called a mathematical sack, cul-de-sac, you’re down to one option.</span> <span id="s220">And so in gaming theory -- this is called option theory, by the way, and by the way Van Neumann did a formal analysis of this [indecipherable] so -- so there’s a mathematical basis for it.</span> <span id="s221">In gaming theory you have to look always for space, for more options, even if it costs you more, because once you have more options, even if the price is higher, the probability of you possibly doing better is greater than if you are what’s called, in a zero sum game.</span> <span id="s222">Cul-de-sac, it’s called -- in -- in mathematics, by the way, this is called a knapsack.</span> <span id="s223">I mean, there is formal theory over this thing.</span> <span id="s224">And my -- my second son Steven, who has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., he -- he -- he’s a -- he’s a class one nerd, you know, mathematics, everything has to be quantitative.</span> <span id="s225">You know, one day I just on a napkin, drew for him this whole theory of life, that life is really of maximizing your options.</span> <span id="s226">That’s what life is.</span> <span id="s227">In fact, when you look at the -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: According to this theory of option, it means that if you stay hidden in a house of an employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are basically cooped up and there’s no options.</span> <span id="s229">I mean, you are just totally wedged in, and you have no place to go.</span> <span id="s230">When you are just in shorts, and with a t-shirt and sandals, and one sandwich, in the reeds of the river Váh, and going back two miles is that house, or going forward, actually swimming down the river and then going to the mountains where shooting takes place, that’s more options.</span> <span id="s231">So you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s233">Now you spoke very critically of that wife and that being a bad marriage and -- in your earlier interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What -- did you know, in your community, much about that woman?</span> <span id="s236">I assume she could not be trusted, and you were at risk in the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, about that wife I knew very little, except that the a -- other employees were -- were always joshing this man, who was my father’s confidant, about this wife that he picked up.</span> <span id="s238">And I picked up enough sort of, innuendo, to -- that my -- my -- my radar said, well there’s something f-funny in here.</span> <span id="s239">Y-You must understand, in the back of my father’s store were, you know, were the merchandise and were the -- we loaded cars.</span> <span id="s240">There was lots of rough play and -- and -- and -- among the employees and of course I always mixed around and listened.</span> <span id="s241">And I picked up that this was one unhappy, henpecked husband.</span> <span id="s242">So -- so, you know, but yo-you just factor that in -- into the equation.</span> <span id="s243">The fact that they didn’t want me to stay inside the house, and you know, this was only the second day.</span> <span id="s244">I was there only one night.</span> <span id="s245">On the second day, get out, you know, was enough of a signal that I would have no options at all because when the Germans really started looking for people and doing house to house searches, I would have no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Let’s go back for a moment, because we’ve jumped from your early childhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: -- to this period when you w-were in hiding.</span> <span id="s249">And tell me a -- the context of what had taken place by then, and what had happened to your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Well, the tragedy was -- is that the -- my father greatly mistimed the whole issue of how we will survive.</span> <span id="s251">Ye -- we received, in 1942 at the end -- towards the end of the deportation, a presidential exception, which also covered the grandparents.</span> <span id="s252">Grandfather Weiner was sent to concentration camp, but it was the Slovak concentration camp.</span> <span id="s253">The Slovaks kept some of the carpenters, and some of the Jewish craftsman to make furniture and artifacts for the Slovak new powers.</span> <span id="s254">So they kept a camp where the Jews were slave laborers, but they did -- were not shipped to -- to -- to annihilation camps.</span> <span id="s255">So Grandfather Alexander was in a place called Novaky.</span> <span id="s256">We were in Trencin.</span> <span id="s257">My father, because of his prior connection with a very distinguished Catholic priest, by name of Bernetsky, really an outstanding friend of my father, secured a presidential protection, so that we were not deported in 1942.</span> <span id="s258">But we always knew that the day of reckoning will come when the front moves in from the east, and the Germans retreat.</span> <span id="s259">At that time, there will be wholesale destruction and annihilation and murder and who knows what happens.</span> <span id="s260">And so, starting in ’43, we started rehearsing where do we go, where do we hide when the front moves.</span> <span id="s261">My father had set up a hiding place, and then a fall-back hiding place and a third place.</span> <span id="s262">In other words, there were like three places to go to.</span> <span id="s263">When the -- the beginning of the uprising, but it was not so full born yet, but when the guerilla attacks started -- it was precipitated, by the way, by the -- by the communists, for reasons which -- that’s another story.</span> <span id="s264">We decided to go to back-up place number one, which was in a town called Selec, which is not too far from -- from Trencin, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s265">Was a small peasant village, there was peasant who was for money and my father already provided food and what have you, we’re going to go there.</span> <span id="s266">Well, when my father decided to -- to go to Selec, well then, there were other people who my father was obligated to.</span> <span id="s267">My father inherited from his partner, who I may or may not have mentioned, by name of Kubicek.</span> <span id="s268">Kubicek went to the Zionist congress in Basel in 1938 and never came back.</span> <span id="s269">My father took over custody of his wife and his son.</span> <span id="s270">So -- and there were two aunts, so my father took a truck from the business, loaded everybody and in we go into Selec to hide.</span> <span id="s271">Of course, the whole village saw that here comes a whole bunch of Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s272">It was just not well thought out.</span> <span id="s273">So we were there for two days, which was, I think August 27 and 28 and my father recognized this was really -- it was just too noisy, there were just too many people.</span> <span id="s274">And everybody was in the same place.</span> <span id="s275">So the decision was to go back to Trencin and regroup and start going into places where everybody will go in onesies or twosies --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: -- to hiding places.</span> <span id="s278">Well, that night Gestapo came and took my father as a hostage, and my grandfather Weiner.</span> <span id="s279">And just happens that that night I was not sleeping at home.</span> <span id="s280">Of course, we were, by that time, living in very, very low, low -- low kinds of housing, you know, housing that was very, very low grade.</span> <span id="s281">You know, it was out in the boonies.</span> <span id="s282">I think we had only one bedroom and one living room, so it was crowded anyway, so I stayed with a friend.</span> <span id="s283">So in the morning I was told the family was taken, my father was taken, and therefore I should go now to contingency place number three, which was the -- this employee, so -- so within three days, we went from contingency one to contingency two, to cont-contingency three like this.</span> <span id="s284">And these -- so you were at the end of the rope by that time.</span> <span id="s285">And it was still now only September one or September two, 1944.</span> <span id="s286">So you were out of an -- a -- a rope, you’re at the end of the rope now, already, and the -- you know, the show only started, I mean the -- the bad times only started now.</span> <span id="s287">So that th -- was the context under which I said, this is a bad option.</span> <span id="s288">I mean, I have no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: 15.</span> <span id="s291">I was 15.</span> <span id="s292">I was a sturdy 15.</span> <span id="s293">Really experienced hiker.</span> <span id="s294">Because I couldn’t go to school at the age of 11, my father apprenticed me to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s295">When my grandfather was shipped to the labor camp, I was then apprenticed to work in a machine shop, which was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s296">And in the machine shop we were fixing threshing machines.</span> <span id="s297">And i -- the -- in -- in those days they didn’t have ball bearings, so they had bushings made out of copper, and when they didn’t oil it properly the copper melted, so you had to re -- ream the bushings, and I learned pouring, holding the mold when people were pouring metal to make a bushing and then reaming it out and fitting axels into it.</span> <span id="s298">I -- the people in the machine shop were a bunch of real tough guys, including one guy who was wounded in the Spanish Civil War, in a communist brigade.</span> <span id="s299">Was a rough guy, and who subsequently became the commissar of one of the battalions and was guilty of enormous atrocities.</span> <span id="s300">And after the war he became the deputy chairman of the communist party.</span> <span id="s301">And he was one of the guys why I decided, with that guy around, I -- I don’t want to live in this town.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: That -- it was one -- one dangerous guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s305">Do you think your father, just as he took you on hikes --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: -- was also, in your apprenticeship in the threshing shop --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: -- deliberately toughening you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s311">Oh my -- my father always -- of course my fa -- because of his background, believed in tough.</span> <span id="s312">You know, physical, mental tough stuff.</span> <span id="s313">And of course, Hashomer Hatzair particularly emphasized that.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: And of course the town I come from used to be a garrison all the way going back to Roman times.</span> <span id="s316">Trencin was the last mountains -- mountain pass from the Carpathian mountains into the D-Danube [indecipherable] and the Romans were -- had their advance camp in there and on the castle, I will show the picture if you’re interested in.</span> <span id="s317">It was a huge, medieval castle.</span> <span id="s318">And we used to, you know, at -- at -- at seven years old our favorite game was to go into the castle and play cops and robbers and Crusaders and particularly figuring out how to defeat the Turks, because the Turks used to come to Trencin and devastate the population, so -- so, you know, th-that environment was already that kind of a mental process.</span> <span id="s319">This was not a mamby-pamby kind of a protected environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: And of course, starting in ’37 - ’38, we were badly beaten up by the hooligans, as Jews, you know, so we had to go in packs on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: But at the same time your father was also, with optimism, making sure you continued your studies, your piano lessons and your tutoring.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh yes, oh -- well, meanwhile, my father, of course, paid for piano lessons, which we couldn’t afford, and for English, you know, I -- starting in ’38.</span> <span id="s324">But we always knew -- you know, my father’s ideal life -- I mean, he alway -- was to move out of Slovakia -- Czechoslovakia, move to England, put his son into an English school, and live in a setting like I live in right now.</span> <span id="s325">A garden and privacy and quietness.</span> <span id="s326">And th-that was his idea.</span> <span id="s327">My father’s idea of life was to live like an English gentleman, reading books and -- and -- and writing, and -- and -- and -- and -- and not -- not having to deal with this tremendous pressure, this enormous social pressure which existed in that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And of course you -- I-I was just thinking of the fact that your survival in that one instant, clearly rested on your father sending you away that night, to stay with this former employee.</span> <span id="s329">I -- I mean that y-you were the only son, he seems in so many ways to have --</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: No, no, no, that night when my father was taken by the Gestapo, I was with a friend who was not an employee, he was just a chi --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Oh, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: -- was a childhood friend, and we -- we were quite friendly with him.</span> <span id="s333">He was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s334">And th-the reason I stayed there was that, you know, it was just I s -- I used to sleep around with friends, you know, we visiting back and forth, and it was late, there was curfew already and they said, well, why don’t you stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Oh, so that was not a --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: It was not a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: -- a kind of instinctive thing on your father’s part.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No, it was not, it was -- it was just stupid luck.</span> <span id="s339">I mean, it was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: -- just luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s343">Do you remember what -- what it was like, what you felt emotionally, knowing that your father had been taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Well, in some respect it was a sense of betrayal, because I did not know -- see, nobody ever told me what the plan was.</span> <span id="s345">I did not have any money.</span> <span id="s346">I did not know what the financial arrangements were.</span> <span id="s347">See, part of the problem was that I was a big blabber.</span> <span id="s348">And my father really didn’t share too many things with me.</span> <span id="s349">So -- you see, the assumption was always that dad will take care of everybody.</span> <span id="s350">This idea that I, at the age of 15 would be independent, and have to make decisions on my own, I don’t think that was on the agenda.</span> <span id="s351">See, the assumption always was, the father of the family will sort of direct everybody and decide who goes where.</span> <span id="s352">And so part of this experience was that here I was with no clothing, just wol -- told, why don’t you go to this house.</span> <span id="s353">No -- there was no question of money, what the arrangements were, nothing.</span> <span id="s354">I didn’t know what the deal was.</span> <span id="s355">I did not know where it leads, what was the further fall back, nothing.</span> <span id="s356">So not knowing anything, I finally decided, well, you know, you either sit here, go back and do what everybody else was doing, or just get -- get on with something.</span> <span id="s357">And I guess that was the -- the -- the decisive moment, because had I stayed, I would have been -- sure ended up in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s358">They -- they would have surely found me and shipped me off.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Now the protection that your father had from -- was it Monsignor Be-Bernetsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: How rare would that be?</span> <span id="s362">I know your father was prominent and successful --</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It was quite rare, it was quite rare.</span> <span id="s364">It was quite rare, yeah, it -- it -- it was.</span> <span id="s365">It was -- well, you know, I can give you the numbers, you know the numbers are that -- that there were 83,000 Jews in Slovakia, 64,000 were shipped to annihilation camp with nobody coming ever back.</span> <span id="s366">Of those who left, which was like 18,000, a number, maybe 4,000 went into slave labor camps to -- to work for the locals.</span> <span id="s367">Then whoever was left [sneezes] -- excuse me -- either got false papers or sort of disappeared, or got legitimacy, and of -- got -- got papers, so-called white papers, and [indecipherable] and it -- it was a big deal.</span> <span id="s368">It was a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Would it have involved any assumption of risk or danger for Bernetsky that he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Protecting.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: -- protecting your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Bernetsky was untouchable.</span> <span id="s373">He is considered today a sort of, you know, the town square is named after him, a-a-and he -- he was close with Tiso, who was the president.</span> <span id="s374">The president of Slovakia could write an exception, you know, under his signature.</span> <span id="s375">For my father and the family to be protected required the signature of the president of Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And it seemed that you never had to pass as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s377">Am I right in -- I -- I mean, al-always your community knew who you were, and who your family members were, but from a bureaucratic point of view, you did things so that according to paperwork, your -- you’d be placed in the category that gave you a better chance for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Well, there was a few wrinkles with this thing.</span> <span id="s379">We had to get baptized, and the question was, well what’s the faster ways of getting baptized?</span> <span id="s380">Well, to become baptized as a Catholic -- and Bernetsky offered that, was a very complicated thing, and you know, the timing was short.</span> <span id="s381">My father was very good friends also -- because my father was one of the leading citizens in town, with the senior -- the -- which he’s a sort of a -- like a auxiliary bishop, by name of Zimon, a wonderful scholar of the Lutheran church.</span> <span id="s382">And so in 1942, after a proper course in catechism and so forth -- which I did very well, by the way.</span> <span id="s383">Frankly, I liked the catechism better than I liked the Jewish stuff because I could understand it, you know, it was in Slovak and it was sort of interesting, historically.</span> <span id="s384">And -- you know, and Jesus was a Jew, so it must have been okay.</span> <span id="s385">And also, the beautiful thing about the -- the Lutherans is th-the organ music.</span> <span id="s386">You see, the Jews didn’t have music in the synagogue, only wailing, you know, the -- no music.</span> <span id="s387">The -- the Lutheran church had a wonderful organ and then in the chapel they had a harmonium, which I used to like to play on.</span> <span id="s388">But, you know, the -- the -- the s -- the psalms, you know, mostly old -- this -- this was Lutheran of the Augsburg persuasion.</span> <span id="s389">I don’t know you understand the -- Lutherans -- Lutherans come in various flavors, you understand that?</span> <span id="s390">Okay.</span> <span id="s391">There was lots of Old Testament songs, which have been -- which have been -- which are sung, according to music [indecipherable] by Johann Sebastian Bach.</span> <span id="s392">And they’re beautiful, they’re absolutely beautiful.</span> <span id="s393">So I had a great time with the Lutherans.</span> <span id="s394">Everybody knew, of course, that I was a baptized Jew.</span> <span id="s395">I mean, y-you know, in this little town, everybody could tell that.</span> <span id="s396">But i -- you know, it was just -- just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s398">I -- I really just meant that distinction between those who hid their Jewishness, and y-you were really, as a family, not doing that, but also assuming this membership in the Lutheran church.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah, and a -- a -- yeah, we -- we were not hiding anything, there was no way of hiding it.</span> <span id="s400">I mean, everybody knew who s -- Adolf Strassman, my father was and who I am, but -- but i-it was a convenient way, and the Lutherans who were a minority in the town sort of felt that they were -- and the Lutherans never went in with this Nazi stuff anyway.</span> <span id="s401">I mean, in the ar -- in the underground, much of the pro-western connection -- i -- yi -- as you know there was a London underground and there was a Soviet underground.</span> <span id="s402">The -- the Soviet underground was a bunch of atheists and -- and -- and quasi-criminal element.</span> <span id="s403">The intellectual underground in London was mostly Lutheran.</span> <span id="s404">And I turned out to be quite a scholar in -- in Lutheran affairs, and of course I went, you know, the catechism, answered all the questions and -- and -- and -- you know, I -- I did just fine.</span> <span id="s405">I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s406">So -- so yi -- y -- sort of everybody went along with this thing.</span> <span id="s407">It was a very interesting period.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I have only warmest memories on -- on that period.</span> <span id="s410">I mean, in -- in the period of the war, which is 1942 to 1944, it provided a period of relative stability.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Does your story of what happened in this case shed light on Madeline Albright’s family history, and the fact that, I think, she di -- she was not aware of her Jewish heritage --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Oh, balderdash --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: -- until a late si --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: -- balderdash.</span> <span id="s415">I don’t believe that, but -- but if she was or she wasn’t, a -- I mean, there -- there was no point of hiding it, if -- I mean, these are small circumstances, small town.</span> <span id="s416">Now she u -- if she came from a big town like Prague, and I don’t know of the detail, it’s possible that the thing was sort of expunged, but in a small town there was no way of forgetting who was a Jew, and who wasn’t a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: I just thought that -- that th -- the practices and the things done to help s -- Jews survive in Czechoslovakia might differ from what was happening in other countries, and that therefore --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: -- her case -- that it shed some light on her story.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I --I -- I’m sure of that and you know, that the conditions were different in Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s421">For instance, I -- I happened to be presiding last year at the Bulgarian memorial, and it was very interesting for me, th-that was a totally different approach of solving the situation.</span> <span id="s422">The -- the -- you know, ge-getting a presidential except -- exception, the white paper, and by saying, well yeah, but that you also converted to Christianity, you know, that was another check mark and that was okay.</span> <span id="s423">At least in ’42 it was -- you know, in September of 1944, all the bets were off, I mean, none of that applied.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s425">But what was happening in your family’s story, where your father previously seems to have been masterfully studying strategies --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: -- is most interesting.</span> <span id="s428">I mean, yo-you suggest that with some forward thinking and astuteness, you could work the system, to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: That is correct, you could work the system as long as options were available.</span> <span id="s430">Once the Germans took over, there were no options.</span> <span id="s431">I mean, they eliminated all options, I mean, there was -- y-ye -- if you were a Jew, baptized or otherwise, you know, your -- you were either shot or shipped to -- to concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s433">Now you were 10 when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, th-the Germans did not occupy Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s435">The Germans occupied only the Czech Republic and they created what’s called the Protectorat.</span> <span id="s436">They did not occupy Slovakia.</span> <span id="s437">They made a deal with Monsignor Tiso to create a Slovak state, because they just had their hands full, and th-they wanted to draw on the military capability of Slovakia, which was quite considerable.</span> <span id="s438">Slovakia ultimately put up 92,000 soldiers working for the Germans, fighting with the Germans against the Soviets.</span> <span id="s439">So the Slovak, two divisions went into Russia, advancing all the way to the Caucasian mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: But it was -- it was that -- well, really my question is, your life would change dramatically when you were 10, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes, yeah, life changed dramatically because the Aryan laws were put into effect by the Slovak legislature, following the script, the German script, and that means Jews were stripped, in a very methodical way of all property, all privileges.</span> <span id="s442">And it was a bureaucratically highly organized process of taking property away.</span> <span id="s443">The -- it was very important that the various people who owed their loyalty to the Nazis and to the Slovak, were getting as much property as possible.</span> <span id="s444">So it started as a way of stripping the Jews of property, shipping most of the Jews, like 85 percent of the Jews into annihilation camps, and then whoever was left, depriving them of all the civil rights and -- and property and radios and fur coats and -- and automobiles, and -- and -- you know, th-there was a long list, I still have those lists of what you can or cannot do, and what street you can be on, what is your curfew, whether you can have a window looking at the street, or not looking at the street.</span> <span id="s445">I mean it was a very elaborate, bureaucratic structure that got erected to do this.</span> <span id="s446">And, you know, as time went on, you know, things got closed down.</span> <span id="s447">The synagogue got closed down, the Jewish school got closed down.</span> <span id="s448">Going to a movie got closed down and so forth and so forth.</span> <span id="s449">And it -- it was -- there was -- it was always a next step.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: And when you were living in poor quarters --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: -- in what you describe as a shack, but it -- it would be a couple of room, that would have happened within the space of a couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s454">First we had a beautiful house that my father built in 1933, which was on top of the store on the main, commercial streets.</span> <span id="s455">So, immediately we could not live in the rooms which were facing the street.</span> <span id="s456">That was -- immediately we were pushed down into the two rooms which were behind, not looking over the street.</span> <span id="s457">So that went on for about eight month or so.</span> <span id="s458">Then came an ordinance that you cannot live on that street altogether.</span> <span id="s459">So then we moved to another apartment, a one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s460">It was a very small living room, an upstairs walk-up, not too far from our original house.</span> <span id="s461">And we were there for maybe a year.</span> <span id="s462">Then an ordinance was passed that you cannot be even there, because it was ho -- it had hot and cold water.</span> <span id="s463">Jews cannot be in any apartment where there is both hot water and cold water.</span> <span id="s464">So we had to find a place which was really, you know, a slum, beca -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s466">This is an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the 8th, 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s467">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Paul Strassmann on July the 11th, 1990.</span> <span id="s468">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s469">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s470">Did you ever go back and look at your old home?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: We -- I surely did.</span> <span id="s472">I -- my father’s house on the main street, when I finished my officer course in 1945, in a military uniform and with a Tommy gun, I just walked in at two o’clock in the morning, banged at the door.</span> <span id="s473">And of course it was occupied by the people who took over my father’s business.</span> <span id="s474">They were absolutely petrified, you know, it was immediately after the war, and I was basically a political officer.</span> <span id="s475">You -- you must understand that when I got out of the partisans, I was considered to be an exceptionally reliable person to be used for whatever purpose, such as eth -- ethnic cleansing, you know, I was ready to do anything.</span> <span id="s476">And so I went back as soon as I could to find out if anybody was alive and of course they were petrified, they immediately moved out of the front -- front rooms of the house, to the back, where we used to live.</span> <span id="s477">And I stayed there one night.</span> <span id="s478">I wa-wanted no part of it, I found out nobody knew about anything about my family.</span> <span id="s479">All they knew that my mother was found shortly after she went into hiding and that nobody knew where my sister was, and everybody knew that my father was shipped to concentration camp right away.</span> <span id="s480">So -- so that was in ’45, I immediately went there.</span> <span id="s481">Since then a v -- you know, under the communists, I couldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s482">The -- it was shut down in 1948, when the communists took over.</span> <span id="s483">First time I went back to Trencin was in -- maybe in 1978 or ’79.</span> <span id="s484">By that time the house was razed and a huge monster complex was built up as -- for Soviet kind of apartments.</span> <span id="s485">But I go there now at least once a year, sometimes twice a year.</span> <span id="s486">I just finished a very major project in Trencin, which may be of interest to you.</span> <span id="s487">When I went there in 1986, I went finally to the synagogue, which of course was converted into some kind of a music hall, but next to the synagogue was a small chapel, and everything was piled in, what that was left from the synagogue into the chapel.</span> <span id="s488">It was a warehou -- i-it was a ma -- badly messed up closet, that’s all it was, the benches were stacked up.</span> <span id="s489">And on the wall were the names of the Jews that perished.</span> <span id="s490">1536 names.</span> <span id="s491">And they were just printed on pieces of paper that was curling and getting mildew.</span> <span id="s492">And there on the spot I decided that that is not going to be.</span> <span id="s493">And after four years of work, and getting people from all over the world to cooperate, last year we unveiled 24 bronze tablets with the names.</span> <span id="s494">I paid for it, just about all of it.</span> <span id="s495">And it is now a sanctuary.</span> <span id="s496">So I’ve been back -- I mean, this idea of getting that memorial up into the -- into that chapel was very time consuming.</span> <span id="s497">I must have made like 10 trips negotiating with various people.</span> <span id="s498">See, the Jews didn’t want to have any part of it.</span> <span id="s499">They didn't want to stir trouble.</span> <span id="s500">So -- but finally I -- y-you know, it got very complicated.</span> <span id="s501">Nobody wanted any part of it, you know, why do you want to stir things up?</span> <span id="s502">Well, I stir things up.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Would there be repercussions fo -- th-that the Jews would suffer f-f --</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: The few Jews, and I think there are eight or nine, that’s all there is, and they’re all in their 80’s like my sister, want to be left alone, peaceful.</span> <span id="s505">They don’t want to be bothered.</span> <span id="s506">They don’t want to be called Jew, or anything.</span> <span id="s507">So their idea is to lay low, and if there’s one thing this guy doesn’t do, it’s lay low, you know?</span> <span id="s508">So -- but ultimately, people came from Israel, and from Germany and Switzerland and England for the unveiling.</span> <span id="s509">I think they were more interested in talking to one another who survived, because they grew up all together.</span> <span id="s510">These are the survivors.</span> <span id="s511">They’re looking at the memorial, but that’s okay, that memorial is go -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s wedged into the wall with deep rivets.</span> <span id="s512">Th -- it’s -- it’s heavy metal, like this.</span> <span id="s513">So it’s fairly indestructible, I mean, you would -- really would have to blow it up.</span> <span id="s514">And I just feel good about it, and to hell with everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And there had been Jews a -- I understand in Trencin since -- I as -- somewhere I saw that first records were of 1760, perhaps before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Oh, Jews have been in Trencin, you know, I mean for -- the records go back to about the 11th century, because you see, Trencin was always a military town, it was a base.</span> <span id="s517">It was always a government town, it was a trading town.</span> <span id="s518">And so Jewish traders came and gone.</span> <span id="s519">That’s why you have those large co -- concentration of Jews in Trencin.</span> <span id="s520">Because the Jews were basically the lawyers and the record keepers and the -- the -- the Hungarian and Austro-Hungarian nobility used Jews as their record keepers, as their bookkeepers.</span> <span id="s521">See, the [indecipherable] never wanted to be tainted by anything commercial.</span> <span id="s522">So they -- and they actually, as you know the history, they invited the Jews to come in to help them to manage Poland and -- and many of those countries, because the Jews were totally dependent on the nobility.</span> <span id="s523">And so there was a very large Jewish population and the Jews were being used as a money gatherer because the Jews really were, until about 1860 could not own land.</span> <span id="s524">So the Jews were used as instrument of feudal oppression and tax collection, which of course was one of the sources of anti-Semitism, which was deeply endemic in that part, particularly among the peasantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Now, you talk in your earlier interview about anti-Semitism being essentially an urban phenomenon.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes, well because the Jews were urban.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s529">The jur -- the Jews were, of course, here and there, sitting in the -- in the properties, where they were maintaining property, and they were innkeepers.</span> <span id="s530">But that was p -- all part of the taxation mechanism that the feudal regime maintained.</span> <span id="s531">See, the feudal lords, they don’t want to mess around with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Now, I’m -- I’m going back again, but from whom would you have learned about what happened to your father, and when would you know that he’d been taken to Sachsenhausen and tortured?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I knew it from secondhand, of his torturing, because when I got back into Trencin as a political officer, I was hell bent to even some scores.</span> <span id="s534">And we were interrogating a number of people, and I j-just found out what happened, because everybody was saying, well it wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s535">It turned out that the Slovaks, jointly with the local Germans went -- and they had a list of hostages that they wanted to pick up, people who were suspect as working with the partisans, you see, because my father managed the food business, even under the Slovak regime.</span> <span id="s536">My father made sure that some food got moved into the villages.</span> <span id="s537">So my father was on the list for a collaborator.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: So that you -- you learned that later on.</span> <span id="s541">Now, y -- t-to what extent did you settle scores?</span> <span id="s542">I think you make some reference to ugly times, or whatever, initially after --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I -- well -- le-let me -- le-let me say, looking back at it, I really didn’t settle any scores.</span> <span id="s544">I really did not kill anybody.</span> <span id="s545">There were some people that I testified against, because of some of the acts that they committed, but they were let go anyway, so -- so there was no scores to settle.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Again I want to go back to ask you about th-the fact that your family did not leave in 1938, when th-they had made preparations to escape.</span> <span id="s547">And you tell the story in your earlier interview about your mother as treasurer --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: -- hiding money and then it got damaged by a steam radiator.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: But it -- it seemed to me that your father’s family responsibilities weighed heavily on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And did he ever speak about -- with regret about not going, or -- ju -- I’d just like to know more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s555">Th -- as I noted before, during the bad years, which is ’39 through ’44, the parents really didn’t speak much.</span> <span id="s556">They -- they -- they felt that -- that -- that I was a potential source of -- of leaks.</span> <span id="s557">Of course, my sister subsequently told me that she also did not know what was going on.</span> <span id="s558">I think it was just the way my father and my mother operated is they -- they wanted to keep everything very tight.</span> <span id="s559">Also, in those days you did not speak to your children as peers.</span> <span id="s560">It was a different social structure.</span> <span id="s561">Children were there to be told what to do, to be educated, to be trained.</span> <span id="s562">And -- and -- and you had obligations, it was almost a feudal kind of a relationship.</span> <span id="s563">It’s not the American way, you know, where -- you know, the conversation between the father and the mother and the children is fairly free, at least in my family.</span> <span id="s564">So we -- we just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s565">We didn't know their thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s567">But have you put yourself in your father’s shoes, and it does seem to me that the reason he chose not to leave with his immediate family was because of that responsibility to the extended family --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s569">Well, yes, clearly, the responsible for the extended family and particularly to his parents, he was very devoted to his father.</span> <span id="s570">He went and visited his father every night.</span> <span id="s571">And th -- he could not get his father out.</span> <span id="s572">I mean, we had passports.</span> <span id="s573">You must understand.</span> <span id="s574">In 1938, my father, my mother, my sister and I had pass -- valid passports.</span> <span id="s575">We could have walked out any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Did your parents ever regret this, do you think?</span> <span id="s577">Or was it an unspoken regret, if that was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: It was unspoken, it was never discussed.</span> <span id="s579">They never discussed, you know, what could have happened, or what didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s580">That was never discussed, not to my best knowledge, and neither to my sister’s knowledge, who was older and she says she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s581">She just didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s583">And I assume that this would be what would happen in so many families where it would be possible for some members to leave, but it’s very hard to leave close relatives behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s585">I -- I would say that -- that the fir-fir-first -- everybody always said that nobody expected it to be so bad.</span> <span id="s586">There was this old pattern, well somehow we’re going to mu -- muddle through.</span> <span id="s587">You know, this also will come to pass.</span> <span id="s588">I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, “The Pianist”.</span> <span id="s589">You remember the early scene -- by the way, I only saw the first eight minutes of the thing, and then I wa -- got sick.</span> <span id="s590">There they are, ready to move out and leave Warsaw, and they hear on the radio, Churchill announces that England and France is going ag-against -- in war against the Germans and they all have a big party because all their problems are solved.</span> <span id="s591">You remember that scene?</span> <span id="s592">Well, that scene was repeated again and again and again.</span> <span id="s593">This is denial.</span> <span id="s594">The -- the -- much of the existence in those days was denial.</span> <span id="s595">People were denial -- were in denial all the way to the entrance of the gas chambers, and even then they were in denial.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Why do you think that was so?</span> <span id="s597">Is that human nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Well, I don’t know about what is human nature, but -- but a-a-as you know, when you have no option -- this goes back to my options theory, okay, if you have no option, if you are -- if you have only one option, and that’s all you have, the only thing you can do about it, if it’s a horrible option, is to deny it.</span> <span id="s599">You don’t want to face up to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: See, the moment you have options, you cannot do denial because you then have to confront -- you know, of the three or four things that I can do, which one will I do?</span> <span id="s602">Then you have to go into so -- irrational process.</span> <span id="s603">So if you are pretty well set in a given groove, denial will be the most natural way to try to deal with it, other than committing suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: And it helps to protect your children, and your spouse, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: -- and so on.</span> <span id="s607">Tell me what happened to your mother and your sister after your father was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Well, Mother went into a place for hiding, you know, she -- she already knew this was fallback number three, she went there.</span> <span id="s609">My sister didn’t like fallback number three, but she had false papers, so she went and took a train and went to Bratislava, where she worked as a servant.</span> <span id="s610">My mother was betrayed in 30 days.</span> <span id="s611">Somebody said, well there is a Jewess in this house.</span> <span id="s612">Most likely, of course, it was given that she was betrayed by the people who were keeping her.</span> <span id="s613">My sister was picked up on the street, somebody recognized her.</span> <span id="s614">And my mother was shipped to Ravensbrück and so was my sister.</span> <span id="s615">My sister barely made it, I mean she was this close.</span> <span id="s616">She -- she then did the forced march.</span> <span id="s617">M-My mother died of typhoid.</span> <span id="s618">My sister was very sick and she was on this forced march and they were shooting anybody who was a straggler, and she just fell down and two of her friends picked her up and walked her.</span> <span id="s619">That’s how she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Has she ever been interviewed by the --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: -- Holocaust -- oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yeah, I have a ca -- I have a copy of her ta-tape.</span> <span id="s624">It is a very guarded description.</span> <span id="s625">She -- she censors her feelings very much.</span> <span id="s626">I mean, she -- she just feels that -- that she was left really helpless.</span> <span id="s627">And very much alone.</span> <span id="s628">And really did not know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: That sounds much like your feelings, initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Initially.</span> <span id="s631">But she had no -- no -- she had no place to go.</span> <span id="s632">She just went to another town.</span> <span id="s633">And once you were in another town and you were moving up in an open, sooner or later they’re going to get you.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: I wonder if you feel, or you have any memory of when you were on your own, whether you have any sense that you clung to f-fond memories of childhood, and did they wa -- ho -- wa -- did that give you strength to keep going?</span> <span id="s635">As an observer it would seem to me that -- that start that you had in life, of security and a -- and an extended family, a really stable, good background would give you reserves, sort of inner reserves that might help you to keep going, but do you -- do you consciously have any thoughts?</span> <span id="s636">Do you remember having memories of family times?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Le-Let me sa -- tell you very, very clearly on this one.</span> <span id="s638">None.</span> <span id="s639">The -- the -- the conditions were so brutal and so difficult, that just coping with the here and now, and what do next totally occupied me.</span> <span id="s640">There was no -- looking back would be -- have been a weakness.</span> <span id="s641">So if you’re totally occupied with trying to make the next step, the -- you know, the next sortie, the next raid, the next piece of clothing that you need because winter is coming.</span> <span id="s642">The -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the struggle for survival in -- on a very brutal military conditions was so extreme that looking back was really not very useful.</span> <span id="s643">And -- and I usually don’t look back.</span> <span id="s644">It was interesting, about two days ago I had a conversation with my daughter.</span> <span id="s645">She had a contract that expired early in 2003, and the people paid her for awhile, and then she protested and so they finally gave her a new contract.</span> <span id="s646">And th -- it’s a nice contract, it’s a three year contract.</span> <span id="s647">The question was, they didn’t pay her for about four month and there was a back pay issue.</span> <span id="s648">And her husband screamed at her that she should not sign a contract because th-they owe her back pay.</span> <span id="s649">I say, forget about it.</span> <span id="s650">Forget about back pay, you know.</span> <span id="s651">It’s gone, you know?</span> <span id="s652">Look forward, they’re giving you a good deal for the next three years.</span> <span id="s653">Take it and run.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Move on.</span> <span id="s656">So this idea of move on and the -- the -- the -- that is the only thing that -- that -- that is important.</span> <span id="s657">Except when it comes something very close, like the death of my son.</span> <span id="s658">That you -- that’s something that -- that sort of looms because that is a d-deep wound.</span> <span id="s659">But, you know, whether you had a nice house, and nice clothing and nice this and tha -- that’s -- that’s -- doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s660">That’s the -- that’s easy.</span> <span id="s661">That’s -- you can walk away from there.</span> <span id="s662">For instance, during the Cuban crisis, I picked up my children and moved them out to upstate New York.</span> <span id="s663">You know, we had a nice house in Mount Vernon, so what?</span> <span id="s664">I mean, I mean, this means nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Trappings.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yeah, it’s all trappings.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s668">Well, you moved on.</span> <span id="s669">I-In -- was it 1948 when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yes, yes, October in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s672">And you’d been, of course, a remarkably young, noncommissioned officer, looking like a young boy in uniform, it seems to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: You were a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: But you -- tell me about your -- your plans to come -- I think your goal was, from early on, to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yeah, and get an education.</span> <span id="s678">I mean, the important thing in life is to get an education, get a wife, and have a house, and live as closely as your father talked about, namely live somewhere with a garden, and -- and have children and -- and -- and have peace and quiet.</span> <span id="s679">You know.</span> <span id="s680">It’s that simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And your -- w -- t-tell me about your -- th-the -- the logistics of how you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Okay, the logis -- the logistics was that I knew the communists would be taking over, because they actually came over and said, you know, Strassman, you’re a hero, but you are the son of a capitalist.</span> <span id="s683">Would you do us a favor and just go?</span> <span id="s684">So, a very close, wonderful friend of my father, who was if so -- so -- who was a brother-in-law of the man who went to Basel -- you know, my father took care of a mother and a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: So they went to America right away because he was an American citizen, so he could get his wife and his son to America right away.</span> <span id="s687">I, of course, was not a relative, but he issued an affidavit for me and put me on the immigration waiting list.</span> <span id="s688">My immigration visa hadn’t come through in ’47, or even ’48, but the brother-in-law of this man who was in America, a very wonderful guy, said, look Strassmann, you better get out.</span> <span id="s689">You better get out while the getting is good.</span> <span id="s690">So he found a school in England which was teaching electronics, who signed me up for a course.</span> <span id="s691">And with that course and the fact that I’d all kinds of certificates and what have you, plus the fact that I paid 50,000 dollars for a passport, I was able to leave Slovakia with a -- one suitcase and no money, on February the seventh, of 1948.</span> <span id="s692">The communists took over on February the 15th, and shut the place down.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Just in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: I went -- and I went to -- to Paris where this man, his name is Freddie Kobler, came from London to Paris to pick me up, he was waiting for me at the North Station as I came from the train, and he looked at me and said, boy do you look bedraggled, I -- ya -- you know, you -- you -- I -- I have to take you out into a real restaurant.</span> <span id="s695">And so he took me out to a three star restaurant and served me a steak.</span> <span id="s696">I got promptly sick.</span> <span id="s697">He couldn’t -- I couldn’t si -- you know.</span> <span id="s698">I cried when he -- when the steak came on my plate, I said, oh this is a ration for a whole family for a month, I cannot eat that.</span> <span id="s699">And then in the evening he took me to Folies Bergère where I saw for the first time a naked woman, which you know, in -- in those days, you know, ma -- ma -- that was very puritanical.</span> <span id="s700">And then I came to England and I went to school in England, getting my English fixed up, and I was in England from February 1948 until early in October 1948 when a Liberty ship w-was returning empty from Plymouth to New York.</span> <span id="s701">And I got, for 83.50, a fare on an empty -- in the hold of a Liberty ship.</span> <span id="s702">I just want you to know, the real Americans all came from Plymouth, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s704">Now, are the --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: And so I arrived in -- in -- in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s706">M-My father’s friend picked me up at the dock in Brooklyn and brought me to a house in Forest Hills, and I decided that I have to start my career in America, so I found a job in -- in Thanksgiving -- for Thanksgiving at -- in the Gertz Department store in Jamaica, New York, selling socks.</span> <span id="s707">And I sold the socks from Thanksgiving right through Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Let me go back.</span> <span id="s709">The passport that you left with --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: -- when had the money been paid for that?</span> <span id="s712">When did you obtain that?</span> <span id="s713">Was it the passport you had earlier, or is it a new one?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: No.</span> <span id="s715">I had only one -- one Czechoslovak passport, which I obtained in January, late in January of 1948, and I obtained it by paying a lawyer, basically 50,000 dollars, who then went around -- you couldn’t get the passport any other way except paying a lawyer who then went and paid off the various bureaucrats and got a passport.</span> <span id="s716">The passport was not valid to go to America, was just to go to England to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: And that would be th -- the money was going to someone, it was essentially a bribe?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Oh yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And how would you access the funds?</span> <span id="s721">I mean, presumably this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Well, I was still in Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Yes, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: And -- and, you know, my sister had money from the store.</span> <span id="s725">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: -- my sister took over the store I mean wa -- she got back the property.</span> <span id="s728">Sh-She married her sweetheart, who was sick.</span> <span id="s729">But she was in the store, and there was money.</span> <span id="s730">And I said, well give me 50,000 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: This was in kraus, this was not in dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Now your sister could have left, but she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: -- dedicated to her sick husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Well that, and the property.</span> <span id="s737">There was lots of property and she, you know, claimed the property and asked for the restitution of the property and there was a big store, there were fields, there were -- all the uncles were killed, so they had property.</span> <span id="s738">So I said, take the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s740">Now -- I’m jumping back to the Liberty ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: How long would it take you to travel across the Atlantic, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: 13 days.</span> <span id="s744">Liberty ship from Plymouth to Brooklyn was 13 days.</span> <span id="s745">It’s the same thing that it took prior years -- I mean, those Liberty ships were leaking.</span> <span id="s746">I mean, they were riding high, th-they -- you know, they were coming back empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Tell me -- explain the -- explain what a Liberty ship was, and then I also want to know who else was on board.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: What is a Liberty ship?</span> <span id="s749">During World War II, we needed a great deal of shipping cap-capacity to ship the soldiers, both first to -- to Europe and then to Atlantic.</span> <span id="s750">So there was a man by the name of Henry Kaiser, who used to make automobiles, who set up two assembly lines of making ships.</span> <span id="s751">They were called Liberty ships, they were sort of tack welded together.</span> <span id="s752">He made one ship every two days.</span> <span id="s753">And they were sort of tacky, and against all the code violations and what have you, but they brought the troops back and forth, brought them home.</span> <span id="s754">You know, the -- the Germans sank a few, but not too many.</span> <span id="s755">They went -- used to go in big convoys.</span> <span id="s756">And then in 1946, the relief for Europe, much of the grain went in Liberty ships.</span> <span id="s757">But by ’48 those ships were just too small for that sort of thing, so they retired them down in the James River.</span> <span id="s758">I mean, there were -- I used to fly over the James River, there used to be couple of hundred Liberty ships tied up in James River.</span> <span id="s759">I say, which one did I come in on?</span> <span id="s760">They were all the same.</span> <span id="s761">So that was li -- li -- a Liberty ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s763">Who else was on board?</span> <span id="s764">And -- and I’m also interested in knowing what was in that suitcase?</span> <span id="s765">You had -- have very few possessions then, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s767">What was in the suitcase was an -- a small accordion.</span> <span id="s768">In fact, my -- the first money I ever made was playing accordion and I actually arrived in the United States with 20 dollars that I made on the ship.</span> <span id="s769">The -- most of the people on the ship were a bunch of hippies.</span> <span id="s770">I mean, there was no -- not too many immigrants -- or emigrants from Europe, you know, because the visas were very hard to get, particularly immigration.</span> <span id="s771">But starting in ’46 and ’47, lots of American college kids used to just go to Europe to -- just to see Europe, for whatever reasons.</span> <span id="s772">And that was the cheapest way how to get back.</span> <span id="s773">And many of them subsequently became quite famous.</span> <span id="s774">For instance, on the ship was Leonard Rose, who subsequently became a very famous cellist.</span> <span id="s775">But th -- it was mostly a student and young kind of adventure, non-conformist young people who used that as the cheapest way to get back to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Now, at the end of your time as a partisan and then in the Czech army --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: -- you were emaciated.</span> <span id="s779">I wondered if, by the time that you sailed to America, you had gained weight and were pretty much restored to good health?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Well, you have to listen to my wife.</span> <span id="s781">My wife -- I -- I had a bad stomach until I married her.</span> <span id="s782">In other words, you know, I married her in 1954, but I had y-you know, th-the places where I used to eat.</span> <span id="s783">And the kind of diet I maintained and the kind of schedule I maintained.</span> <span id="s784">So I had a very -- I never recovered until I married her, and then she started feeding me what she calls in a -- not very well seasoned hospital food.</span> <span id="s785">She’s -- she -- she still just believes in boiled chicken and boiled potatoes and -- and -- and not -- not -- none of the fancy food.</span> <span id="s786">I love the spiced, fancy stuff.</span> <span id="s787">She doesn’t feed me any of that.</span> <span id="s788">So I wa -- my -- my real health did not recover until -- until married times.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s790">You -- you spoke about the fact that you’re -- in your teenage years, despite all the deprivations, you’ve -- you felt as if your family was -- despite the hardships, maintaining a semblance of n-normal life with --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: -- n-no feeling that there was no food and so on, but in fact, your diet must have been very restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Well, dur -- in -- from there -- from 1942 through 1944, you know, diet was very limited, it was wartimes.</span> <span id="s794">On the other hand, my mother knew so many people and they brought us fruit and they brought us things that otherwise were not available.</span> <span id="s795">Once in awhile we had a chicken.</span> <span id="s796">But we only had meat once -- once a week.</span> <span id="s797">Most of the time we had dumplings, or ya -- you know, sour cream with potatoes and stuff like -- which was fine.</span> <span id="s798">I mean, I never felt deprived.</span> <span id="s799">I was never hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s801">Clever management.</span> <span id="s802">Do you have any -- I mean, did you have any long term health problems that resulted from your hardships during World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Oh yes, oh yes, I -- I had bleeding pleur -- pleurisy.</span> <span id="s804">So, when I came out of the partisans, which was on March 25, 1945, I was immediately shipped to the hospital and declared unfit for military duty.</span> <span id="s805">So they shipped me to a very good sanitorium.</span> <span id="s806">And -- and -- and you know, th-they started feeding me.</span> <span id="s807">I -- I-I -- really, I had good food.</span> <span id="s808">And after three weeks I was declared to be totally fit to go and kill some more Germans.</span> <span id="s809">[laughs].</span> <span id="s810">So -- so they shipped me out of the sanitorium and that was that.</span> <span id="s811">But -- but m -- you know, always had problems with stomach.</span> <span id="s812">And of course then, in the summer of 1945, I had a relapse and I was again shipped to a sanitorium, but that was on my own money.</span> <span id="s813">And I think during the month of August of 1945, I was bedridden for about a month, but ri -- I was fine after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: So there, not surprisingly were affects of that kind of existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Well, actually, the most serious disease I ever had was -- I -- I don’t think I mentioned it, but in 1949, I went to Cooper Union, the ci-civil engineering course, you know the story how I got into that -- that -- that school, wonderful school.</span> <span id="s816">And in the -- the summer of 1950, after having a course in surveying, I volunteered to go to Israel to do surveying of Arab lands, subdivide Arab lands, f -- you know, for the new jew -- Jewish settlements.</span> <span id="s817">And made a load -- loads of money, I mean -- I mean, they really paid well.</span> <span id="s818">I didn’t know, when they told me to go and how much they will pay me, that this actually involved getting shot at, because you see, the surveyors is the first thing you kill.</span> <span id="s819">You -- you -- you understand, you always take a shot at the surveyors.</span> <span id="s820">But the problem was that towards the end, and I, against any advice, drank from an Arab well, water, because I was so thirsty.</span> <span id="s821">And I came in with a horrible case of dysentery that lasted for about a year.</span> <span id="s822">I was sick a year af-after that.</span> <span id="s823">But what the hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Now, tell me about meeting your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Oh, Mona, Mona was upstairs in the art school.</span> <span id="s826">The art school of Cooper Union.</span> <span id="s827">The engineers were very busy, I don’t -- you know, I was the class president, I was editor of this or that, a chairman of the judiciary and what have you.</span> <span id="s828">And self-supporting, so I also had a job, Thursday, Friday nights and all day Saturday as a draftsman, so that I -- I was making a decent living.</span> <span id="s829">Decent living, sure, you know, 2,000 dollars a year was really all you needed the -- in those days.</span> <span id="s830">All -- you know, all you ate was potato chips and rotisserie chicken that you bought in a supermarket, and you know, perfectly good food, plus some Twinkies, you know?</span> <span id="s831">That -- that can last very well.</span> <span id="s832">And there was this girl in -- in Cooper Union I had my eye on.</span> <span id="s833">She was really a beauty, I mean, really beauti -- her hair, she had a braid all the way down to her waist.</span> <span id="s834">She looked very traditional, she wore a dress up to her s -- to her -- to her neck, you know?</span> <span id="s835">And she was -- what -- five years younger, and she was very subdued, you know, sort of -- you know the other girls in the art school were sort of wild.</span> <span id="s836">There was lots of girls.</span> <span id="s837">I-I was the -- the big man on campus, you know, as the chairman of this and that.</span> <span id="s838">She was one of the girls who were -- really did not come on, you know?</span> <span id="s839">So she was interesting.</span> <span id="s840">On graduation day, 1953, us engineers, who really didn’t have time for anything because th -- you know, it was much more convenient for a date to go upstairs than to go scurrying around the town.</span> <span id="s841">We went upstairs and we invited some of the girls from the art [indecipherable] to go to -- for hot dogs at Coney Island.</span> <span id="s842">You know, it -- that was the big thing.</span> <span id="s843">So this whole bunch of girls from the art school -- it was one s -- one class below our class.</span> <span id="s844">I was al -- oh -- because of my military, I was older than my -- my -- my -- the other guys in this school.</span> <span id="s845">We went to Coney Island and somehow they put her next to me on the roller coaster.</span> <span id="s846">Now, have you ever been on a Coney Island roller coaster?</span> <span id="s847">The most dangerous thing, I mean, people get killed all the time in those days.</span> <span id="s848">Well, we go into the roller coaster and it’s just really bad, I mean it’s really -- I mean it’s one of these extreme things.</span> <span id="s849">We get on the top, we come diving down and this girl goes limp on me.</span> <span id="s850">She basically -- whatever, she either fainted or whatever.</span> <span id="s851">Well, I grab her, because you know, in those days they didn’t have any of the safety stuff, she could have fallen out.</span> <span id="s852">Well, we get off the roller coaster, she’s as white as a linen.</span> <span id="s853">And I say well, you know, I really have to take care of you, I saved your life.</span> <span id="s854">And she said, well what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s855">I said, well you know, I have to take you somewhere.</span> <span id="s856">And that’s how we met and never left.</span> <span id="s857">So that’s the girl I saved.</span> <span id="s858">She always had an eye on me anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Tell me about Mona’s family, and do you share a lot of values?</span> <span id="s860">What was her background?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes, her father was a very unusual guy.</span> <span id="s862">He was a philosopher, he was in a Jewish tradition, a student.</span> <span id="s863">He really was a very bad businessman, very bad.</span> <span id="s864">But he was a scholar and he read.</span> <span id="s865">The mother pretty well ran -- wonderful woman, wonderful woman, her mother.</span> <span id="s866">They ultimately ended up living with us.</span> <span id="s867">And th -- Mona’s father, Joe and I got along very well.</span> <span id="s868">Joe’s idea was that the world is coming to an end, and that you have to go and really live out on a farm somewhere, so it will be self sufficient.</span> <span id="s869">So he bought a 10 acre farm, upstate New York, in Duchess county and built a sort of a dinky house, and -- and well, got cattle and geese and planted an orchard and the conversation was always survival.</span> <span id="s870">Subject that I sort of could relate to.</span> <span id="s871">This where went during the Cuban -- Cuban episode.</span> <span id="s872">So -- so he and I used to go up, you know, as the kids, my little children were growing up, leaving my mother-in-law and Mona and the little kids and he and I went up farming, to prepare for doomsday.</span> <span id="s873">It’s a long, sad story.</span> <span id="s874">He used excessive amount of insecticide because he wasn’t a resident there, and he ultimately got a stroke from -- from the insecticides, you know -- you know, the insecticide was very powerful, he over-overdosed the place with insectici -- insecticide and herbicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Now, not realizing its toxicity?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Well, he did, but he -- he was -- it was not on his mind.</span> <span id="s877">But I married into a wonderful family, I really -- he was a true friend.</span> <span id="s878">Joe was a true friend.</span> <span id="s879">Mother -- I called her Mother, was a very loving person.</span> <span id="s880">She stayed with us.</span> <span id="s881">She was really a true grandmother to my little children.</span> <span id="s882">You know, we had four children, one after another, and the-there was lots of work to be done.</span> <span id="s883">And my wife Mona never wanted to have any servants.</span> <span id="s884">First we couldn’t afford it, so you know, my -- my -- my wife washed the diapers.</span> <span id="s885">I mean, there was no -- no such thing as -- you know, buying them, diapers.</span> <span id="s886">And she taught the children -- she’s -- the children were very literate at the age of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: So you re-created, and we -- and were blessed with a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Actua --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Seemingly so much by chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Well, i -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: The girl in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Well, you know, there’s no such thing as a chance, you know.</span> <span id="s893">You know, the -- I -- I -- there were lots of girls I could have picked from, and there were some girls who were very seriously interested in me.</span> <span id="s894">In fact, there was one girl who actually announced that she is marrying me and told everybody.</span> <span id="s895">And that’s bad, though, you don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s897">Now you were -- you were eyeing the woman who was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: The sort of quiet one.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yeah, the quiet one.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And the reserved one, or -- or what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: N-Now, tell me about your choices in raising the children.</span> <span id="s904">To some extent you’ve explained that really in -- in telling me how you started, but did you want to bring them up with this so-sort of real sense of their Jewish heritage?</span> <span id="s905">Did you observe religious holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: No, we -- they had all choice.</span> <span id="s907">They all had choice, and one of them is religious, strong Jew, a devout Jew, reasonably so, and the other one no part of it.</span> <span id="s908">But everybody had a choice, and -- and that’s their call.</span> <span id="s909">I never, for better or worse, for better or worse, never tried to tell my children what to do.</span> <span id="s910">My model has always been they have to find their own choices and then live with those choices.</span> <span id="s911">I was not going to mastermind for them, anything.</span> <span id="s912">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s914">And tell me about the -- your children.</span> <span id="s915">When they were born, and their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Well, Vera was born in 1957.</span> <span id="s917">She did extremely well in school, in high school.</span> <span id="s918">She scored 800 on the SAT, eight zero zero, you know?</span> <span id="s919">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s920">You don’t score 800 on the SAT.</span> <span id="s921">Then she went to Johns Hopkins and she was going to be -- go study medicine, and something happened in Johns Hopkins, and I really don’t know what, where she suddenly just decided she was very insecure about herself.</span> <span id="s922">What it was, you know, I visited her; she just clammed up.</span> <span id="s923">She then went for a Master’s degree in public health.</span> <span id="s924">Went to work for a number of insurance companies.</span> <span id="s925">She’s quite an expert in her field.</span> <span id="s926">She’s a recognized expert.</span> <span id="s927">She has maybe 80 published papers in the field.</span> <span id="s928">The men she always -- she is on her third marriage, although one of them sort of had a heart attack and died on her.</span> <span id="s929">But the men she always -- were sort of weak men.</span> <span id="s930">She -- she always picked a very weak person.</span> <span id="s931">She has two beautiful children, absolutely gorgeous children.</span> <span id="s932">She’s all right, but she’s still struggling.</span> <span id="s933">She still has to figure out what she wants to do.</span> <span id="s934">You know, she’s 47 now.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: The second child is Andrew.</span> <span id="s937">Andrew has always been interested in simulation, war gaming.</span> <span id="s938">He is the Jew.</span> <span id="s939">Very militant, he -- he -- he wants to take on the whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: How much younger than Vera?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: He’s just barely less than two years younger than Vera.</span> <span id="s942">And -- and Andrew has a Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon and a summa cum laude from Wesleyan.</span> <span id="s943">He’s literate.</span> <span id="s944">He’s really a literate person.</span> <span id="s945">I mean, he reads.</span> <span id="s946">You know, he’s a student.</span> <span id="s947">Has two boys.</span> <span id="s948">He married a woman he shouldn’t have married.</span> <span id="s949">He tells me, Dad, why didn’t you tell me?</span> <span id="s950">She -- she married him because she expected that he’s going to be a rich man.</span> <span id="s951">When she discovered he’s not going to be a rich man, she just walked.</span> <span id="s952">It was just too much -- too much work for her to take care of.</span> <span id="s953">She -- she wanted to be taken care -- she was a Jewish princess, if you know that expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: And, you know, Andrew is a very hard working, very honest, straight kind of a kid.</span> <span id="s956">Ab -- as straight as they can be.</span> <span id="s957">I mean, he’s never done anything crooked, or anything.</span> <span id="s958">He has only had two jobs.</span> <span id="s959">[indecipherable] always everybody likes him on the job.</span> <span id="s960">And that’s Andrew.</span> <span id="s961">Then comes Steven, two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s963">Let me go back, first of all, to Andrew.</span> <span id="s964">Does he have custody of the children, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Oh yes, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: -- oh he’s -- he’s remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: -- he’s got custody.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Oh, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: -- the judge looked at the situation and said, I don’t want that wa -- wa -- woman to -- to -- to -- to have anything to do with those children, you know.</span> <span id="s972">Which is rare, by the way.</span> <span id="s973">Of course, when he got custody of the children, me and Mona got -- my wife got custody of the children.</span> <span id="s974">I mean, you -- you understand that, because he has -- he has work.</span> <span id="s975">And he’s a consultant, he travels.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: So that’s Andrew.</span> <span id="s978">Nice guy, a nice kid.</span> <span id="s979">Then you have Steven.</span> <span id="s980">He’s the rascal of the family.</span> <span id="s981">Steven was born two years later.</span> <span id="s982">The jokester.</span> <span id="s983">Bright as can be.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Like his father, sounds like?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Oh, he’s a fa -- he’s a jokester.</span> <span id="s986">Never cracks a book in his life and always gets A grades.</span> <span id="s987">And I said, Steven, how do you do it?</span> <span id="s988">[indecipherable] well, I study the teacher, I don’t study the subject.</span> <span id="s989">He has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., has a undergraduate degree.</span> <span id="s990">He just went to M.I.T. and stayed.</span> <span id="s991">He would have stayed in M.I.T. all his life, he di -- had a great time, lots of girls.</span> <span id="s992">Good looking boy.</span> <span id="s993">I mean, he just draws girls like -- like -- like, you know, the catnip, you know, just very congenial.</span> <span id="s994">He’s a Boy Scout and an Eagle Scout.</span> <span id="s995">A real solid citizen, honest as can be.</span> <span id="s996">Very smart, very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s997">Very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s998">I mean, he and I talk once or twice a day.</span> <span id="s999">Let me give you a Steven typical.</span> <span id="s1000">Comes high school.</span> <span id="s1001">I say, Steven, you have to start applying to college.</span> <span id="s1002">He says, it’s too much paperwork.</span> <span id="s1003">And -- and then I-I say, well yeah, but you have to, you know, you have to spread your risk, you know, you have a number of col -- where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s1004">Well Dad, you went to M.I.T., I go to M.I.T..</span> <span id="s1005">I say, it’s hard to get to M.I.T..</span> <span id="s1006">Oh, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1007">So, you know, now -- now -- now, you know, it’s March and I say, Steven, where are your applications?</span> <span id="s1008">Well, I applied for early admission to M.I.T..</span> <span id="s1009">Now, you know, in those days, early admission means that you don’t apply to anybody else and you’ve -- you understand, you -- you -- you -- you just roll your dice, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1010">I said, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1011">He goes up to -- to -- to M.I.T. for an interview.</span> <span id="s1012">I buy him a Brooks Brothers suit, th-the kid has never wore a suit in his life before or ever after.</span> <span id="s1013">One of the beautiful things about Steven is very early, you know, I had computers in my house.</span> <span id="s1014">Never told the kids to go be interested in computers.</span> <span id="s1015">Steven -- all my kids had to go to work at the age of 13, just like my father, you know, you -- you have to have a trade.</span> <span id="s1016">Steven decided to sell Apple computers.</span> <span id="s1017">This is when Apple came out.</span> <span id="s1018">Well, the salesman in the electronics store didn’t have a clue what an Apple computer was like.</span> <span id="s1019">Steven was a hacker from the word go.</span> <span id="s1020">He sold more Apple computers than anybody else.</span> <span id="s1021">So -- so he goes up to M.I.T. and they -- during the interview he tells them how to sell microcomputers.</span> <span id="s1022">M.I.T. said, well, you know, fine.</span> <span id="s1023">Early admission?</span> <span id="s1024">You’re in.</span> <span id="s1025">So he comes back in the evening by train from Boston, sort of mischievously, like I didn’t do it kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s1026">I say, well Steve, what happened?</span> <span id="s1027">Well, they accepted me.</span> <span id="s1028">I said, well, when are you starting?</span> <span id="s1029">Well, they accepted me.</span> <span id="s1030">So -- so he never filled out a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1031">I mean, he’s a real rascal.</span> <span id="s1032">I mean, this kid is a rascal.</span> <span id="s1033">Very good natured, really helping me.</span> <span id="s1034">Y-You know, I’m -- I’m doing some fairly complicated things.</span> <span id="s1035">So that’s Steven.</span> <span id="s1036">And then of course, comes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: And M.I.T. made a good choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: And M.I.T. made a good choice, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1039">And then, of course, comes the apple of my heart, Eric, the youngest.</span> <span id="s1040">Beautiful child.</span> <span id="s1041">I mean, this kid had everything.</span> <span id="s1042">Eagle Scout.</span> <span id="s1043">He was -- he’d has his own software company.</span> <span id="s1044">He started doing software in high school, when a teacher gave him a project to do, physics, like a pendulum, he wrote a software program to solve all the pendulum problems in the world, and handed in a floppy disk as his homework.</span> <span id="s1045">The teacher then said, you know what -- and now, Eric is now 14.</span> <span id="s1046">There may be other kids who would want to -- to -- to take advantage of this thing.</span> <span id="s1047">So Eric, with my help, opens a software business, Strassmann, Incorporated, and start selling and licensing worldwide, Apple programs to be peddled to high schools throughout the world to solve homework in physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Wh-Where were you living then?</span> <span id="s1049">Where did th -- where did he go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Well, we -- we -- we -- we lived in New York and then when Vera came we had a small, two bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s1051">And then when the other kids came, I bought a house in Mount Vernon, a four bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s1052">I always wanted the kids to have their own bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1053">And then I built, in 1969 -- in ’68, this absolutely gorgeous house in Chappaqua, a six bedroom house.</span> <span id="s1054">I mean it really -- it made the front page of the real estate section of the New York Times.</span> <span id="s1055">It was made out of redwood, I mean, and it was made by Finnish carpe -- boat carpenters, who used to come during the winter season when Finland sort of freezes up, to work here where it’s warmer.</span> <span id="s1056">And they built my house like a ship.</span> <span id="s1057">I mean, it was really some house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Like Shackleton’s boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Oh yeah, that -- that was really built.</span> <span id="s1060">And -- and so -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s1062">This is an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the 8th, 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1063">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Paul Strassmann on July the 11th, 1990.</span> <span id="s1064">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s1065">This is tape number three, side A. Chappaqua.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Chappaqua.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: You --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: So s -- and Eric could do anything.</span> <span id="s1069">He -- he was a worker, for instance.</span> <span id="s1070">You know, he was 12 years old when we built the house.</span> <span id="s1071">He laid the pavement for the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s1072">He -- he was a worker.</span> <span id="s1073">This kid, I mean, you know, we have pictures of him, always with a shovel, or something, or helping.</span> <span id="s1074">A scout, very much admired as a scout.</span> <span id="s1075">Very thoughtful.</span> <span id="s1076">He -- he was a -- a child that was thinking about -- was not impulsive.</span> <span id="s1077">He was a very thoughtful, very bright, but not assertive, he was sort of a lovable teddy bear.</span> <span id="s1078">Everybody loved this kid.</span> <span id="s1079">And -- and -- but he always liked to experiment.</span> <span id="s1080">He did -- I mean, he did always something, you know, he -- he -- he put a knife into the electrical socket when he was three years old.</span> <span id="s1081">He climbed this tall tree that we have here, this 50 foot tree, all the way to the top to see how far he can go.</span> <span id="s1082">As quiet as he was, he was always pushing the limit.</span> <span id="s1083">This kid did not have any limits.</span> <span id="s1084">And so we lost him in 1984.</span> <span id="s1085">I must say that was the most devastating thing that ever happened to me.</span> <span id="s1086">I mean, this is -- you know, when you look at life, you know, what happened over the last 75 years, that is the thing that was the -- the worst thing.</span> <span id="s1087">Worse than the Holocaust, worse than anything, because this kid was just -- and he’s destroyed my wife.</span> <span id="s1088">I mean, she -- she just absolutely shrank, as a result.</span> <span id="s1089">And life has never been the same.</span> <span id="s1090">He was such a good kid, and -- and -- you know, I -- I always felt that if I ever have somebody who could be a president of the United States, that was the kid who could make it.</span> <span id="s1091">You know, the -- the -- when you get an Eagle Scout, there’s a -- what’s called a court of honor.</span> <span id="s1092">Do you know about Eagle Scouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: It’s a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: It’s a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: It shows a lot of discipline and dedication and it’s a big accomplishment for a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: And -- and charisma, because you have to be able to organize the other kids, who look to him as a leader.</span> <span id="s1099">Everybody always looked to him as a leader because he was not a pushy -- he was a leader leader, he actually went out and did things.</span> <span id="s1100">He wa -- a-at the court of honor the scout executive said, well I’ve seen lots of Eagles in my life, never seen one like this.</span> <span id="s1101">So that is the tragedy, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Ah, it’s a long story.</span> <span id="s1104">It’s -- it’s a -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1105">It’s -- again, he was pushing, he was pushing the limit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1107">And of course pushing the limit is what special people do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And I suppose -- would you say that that’s what you had done always?</span> <span id="s1110">Or was Eric [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1112">Yeah, an-and he was very close to me.</span> <span id="s1113">You know, his statement always were, when I grow up I want to be just like Dad.</span> <span id="s1114">And he always asked me how -- why did you do this, why did you do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: What did you -- I wondered if there’s anything special that you did in memory of him.</span> <span id="s1116">I only ask that cause --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: -- sometimes -- oh, I -- I’m -- I shouldn’t be putting his on tape [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Well, what happened was, he was so admired at Harvard that Harvard did something that has never been done before.</span> <span id="s1120">The students, from their own money, when they graduated, decided to take all the money -- because you know, when the students go in and they sell their books and furniture to the next class, and what have you, they took all the money and informed the faculty that they are putting a granite bench with Eric’s name on the quadrangle.</span> <span id="s1121">Now, you know, there’s lots of rich kids at Harvard and so forth.</span> <span id="s1122">There’s lots of parents.</span> <span id="s1123">Mr. Bok, who was the pre -- chairman -- president of Harvard was so taken --</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Derek Bok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: -- Derek Bok was so taken by it, that he gave permission for the students to put that bench into the grove on the quadrangle and it’s still there to this day.</span> <span id="s1126">What I have done, Eric’s royalties for the software -- you know, by the way, all my books are dedicated to him -- Eric’s royalties go into a fund to send Boy Scouts who cannot afford it to summer camp.</span> <span id="s1127">It continues to this day.</span> <span id="s1128">And there is a library, Eric’s computer library in -- in a kibbutz in Israel.</span> <span id="s1129">There is a funding to put computer books there in his memory.</span> <span id="s1130">It’s going to be 20 years this year, and I’m putting together, right now, in the middle, putting together a book about Eric for his siblings and for the grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s1132">You know, I’d -- I -- my comment before, it doesn’t really have a place in the interview, but a boy who lived next door died on that Lockerbie plane crash.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Special -- a special young man, I think, and his parents started a music scholarship, and it just simply that it’s -- the students benefiting from the scholarship has been helpful to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Oh yeah, I know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: -- to feel that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: -- that it’s the right thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: -- but it’s some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: But I’m sorry that you had such a loss.</span> <span id="s1143">Hard for -- hard for your other children, too.</span> <span id="s1144">Their loss is different to yours, but they see you suffering in a way they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: -- both parents, anyway.</span> <span id="s1147">The -- going on.</span> <span id="s1148">Let’s move on now to your career.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: I really -- family came first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: But then you’ve had a really most interesting career, which you say was because you became involved with computers, but I think it was much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yeah, wh-what happened over here was after Cooper Union, when I’ve -- and I finished Tau Beta Pi, and you know, honors, and number two man in a very tough school.</span> <span id="s1154">Cooper Union is a tough school because it’s all -- everybody there is on scholarship.</span> <span id="s1155">And it was very competitive, these were -- this was the last crop of World War II veterans who went on the G.I. Bill of Rights to school, and th-they -- they were a different generation, I mean, very serious students, I mean no horseplay, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1156">And my conclusions was that although I loved engineering and always wanted to be an engineer, I felt that I just didn’t have -- I was not an educated person.</span> <span id="s1157">And there was a trustee of Cooper Union by the name of Rossi, who set up a scholarship for the Sloane School at M.I.T., which in those days was other than Harvard Business School, but for engineers it was the school on -- on -- on -- on management.</span> <span id="s1158">And I was nominated for the Rossi scholarship, because of all of that.</span> <span id="s1159">And I basically said that -- that I would love to go to M.I.T. -- and by the way, M.I.T. accepted me, but a Strassmann doesn’t take scholarship money from anybody, I am self-supporting.</span> <span id="s1160">Now everybody tells me, including my wife Mona, that was absolutely stupid.</span> <span id="s1161">But I declined the scholarship because I considered it a act of charity.</span> <span id="s1162">Now, this was still the old way, you know, you don’t take money from anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Adolf Strassmann’s son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yeah, I don -- doesn’t take money from anybody.</span> <span id="s1165">So -- and I just made quite a bit of money working on the New Jersey turnpike, summers.</span> <span id="s1166">So -- so -- so I said, well, I’m going to pay my own way, which I could afford.</span> <span id="s1167">You know, in those days the tuition at M.I.T. was 40 -- 4,500 dollars, which was an awful lot of money, but I made eight.</span> <span id="s1168">And of course, I worked overtime and weekends and what have you, but I had 8,000 dollars, so I could afford 4,500 dollars.</span> <span id="s1169">So I went to M.I.T. Sloane school.</span> <span id="s1170">That’s when I started dating Mona.</span> <span id="s1171">Mona was either in New York or at her dad’s country place in Salt Point, New York, Godforsaken place out in the boonies.</span> <span id="s1172">And she just said, well, if you’re interested in me, you better court me.</span> <span id="s1173">And I asked her father for permission for me to court her, you know.</span> <span id="s1174">He says, take her, you know?</span> <span id="s1175">He liked me very much.</span> <span id="s1176">But, you know, you don’t -- did -- don’t ask -- nobody does that any more.</span> <span id="s1177">So I said, yeah, but i-in the Bible, you -- I have to earn a wife, and I don’t have money.</span> <span id="s1178">So, he said, well, you know, what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s1179">I said, well I want to do something on this farm for you so that I can show, because it was a -- Abraham built for his father-in-law Laban, a enclosure for sheep.</span> <span id="s1180">Said, I’m going to build something for you.</span> <span id="s1181">And my father-in-law -- potential father-in-law said, well, you know, I could really use a barn.</span> <span id="s1182">So I built a 22 by 22 barn to earn my wife, which was subject to lots of conversations over the years.</span> <span id="s1183">So I finished that, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Who helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Oh, my father-in-law helped me, you know, you know.</span> <span id="s1186">But -- but I d -- I did quite a bit of it myself.</span> <span id="s1187">But that was considered t-to be that, you know, how old-fashioned do you want to get, I mean, you know, you’re really getting Biblical.</span> <span id="s1188">But I felt, you know, I have to earn -- this is a wife, I have to earn it, you know?</span> <span id="s1189">So that was that.</span> <span id="s1190">So while I was working weekends on the barn, I was also working for a company who was building the New Jersey turnpike.</span> <span id="s1191">And the problem was that that summer there was a dispute about toll collectors, and you may or may not have heard that story.</span> <span id="s1192">You haven’t heard the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Oh, that’s the story.</span> <span id="s1195">Well, I’m sitting in a drafting room, checking blueprints, you know, a-and there was no air conditioning, and when you lean your sweat on an Ozalid blueprint, you leave an orange mark, yeah, really miserable, smelly, but that was the job I had.</span> <span id="s1196">And one day as -- as -- as Al Matimbi, the senior partner of Howard, Needles, Tammen and Bergendoff, a very distinguished consulting firm, they built most of the turnpikes in the United States, walks through.</span> <span id="s1197">He says, Strassmann, I understand you going to M.I.T..</span> <span id="s1198">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1199">What are you going to study?</span> <span id="s1200">I said, well I’m going to study management.</span> <span id="s1201">He said, well do you know anything about statistics?</span> <span id="s1202">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1203">Well, we got a problem.</span> <span id="s1204">We have a union dispute on the New Jersey turnpike we just built, where the toll collectors say that we are -- that they are overworked.</span> <span id="s1205">And we need somehow to figure out whether they are overworked or not, because the governor goes through the tollgates and finds that they are just standing there doing nothing.</span> <span id="s1206">Course the governor goes to work at 11 o’clock in the morning, but -- ah, so I said, oh, th-th-this thing is answer, you know, you have punch tickets in ev-ev-every toll gate, with round holes.</span> <span id="s1207">All you have to do is count the punch tickets and find out how many cars go through, do some time motion studies on the toll collector -- I make it up as I go, and we’ll figure out whether they are overworked or not.</span> <span id="s1208">He said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1209">Let me take you off this -- this drawing board and let me put you to work on the New Jersey turnpike.</span> <span id="s1210">For the next two years in grad school, I processed hundred thousands of punch cards from the New Jersey turnpike, through the only place in the world where there was a computer like this, M.I.T..</span> <span id="s1211">When I got done I had a Master’s thesis, which is today considered to be the first Master’s thesis in the United States on business application of computer.</span> <span id="s1212">That computer scheduled toll collectors and compared what they were doing against what the machine was doing.</span> <span id="s1213">I got paid an awful lot of money.</span> <span id="s1214">Howard, Needles got paid extremely well for this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Everybody was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s1217">I finally had enough money to be able to afford a wife, because I was not going to have a wife -- my father-in-law was going to give me money.</span> <span id="s1218">I said, f-forget about it, you know, I -- I’m supporting my wife.</span> <span id="s1219">So -- so I got into computers in 1954.</span> <span id="s1220">Really liked it and from then on I was in computers and -- and -- so you sort of wander into these things almost -- almost by accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Well, to what extent do you think that your career has been luck, arising out of the story you just told, or is it much more complex, with strands that come from your background and also energy and discipline and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: -- maybe ambition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah, my -- my children have always asked me the question.</span> <span id="s1225">My answer to that is everybody has luck.</span> <span id="s1226">The question is, do you pick it up or not.</span> <span id="s1227">But everybody, sooner or later, has luck.</span> <span id="s1228">The -- everybody has coincidences, and some people jump at it, and some people sort of walk away from it, or don’t recognize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Someone else might have said, oh I don’t think you -- I’m prepared at M.I.T. to help you with those punch cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Oh, yeah, something like -- something like that.</span> <span id="s1233">And -- and so the ga -- the question is -- again, coming back to this whole question of choice, luck is -- and I’m giving you the mathematical concept, luck is an event, it’s in -- what’s called a node.</span> <span id="s1234">And out of that node goes a number of options.</span> <span id="s1235">One of the options is to do nothing.</span> <span id="s1236">Another option, of course, not even know that you have a node.</span> <span id="s1237">Now the real game of life is that you have a node, which happens, and it happens to everybody.</span> <span id="s1238">Now, of course, if you are in America, you have more nodes than if you are in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1239">I mean, this is -- this is part of the social context.</span> <span id="s1240">In other words, you cannot say that a peasant in India a -- or in -- in Bangladesh has all his luck opportunities.</span> <span id="s1241">Th -- you know they are -- the tragedy, they are all constrained in a world where there are no choices at all.</span> <span id="s1242">But if you are in America and you happen to be moving in a given direction which seems to be evolving and where the options are continually opening -- in other words, if you are in -- in making buggy whips, you know, ther -- ye -- you know, you’re th -- unless you do something else, you know, you just don’t have those options.</span> <span id="s1243">But the luck is there, it’s always there.</span> <span id="s1244">In America more so.</span> <span id="s1245">And as you climb up on the chain of luck, which by the way looks -- gr-graphically it’s represented at what’s called a decision tree.</span> <span id="s1246">I don’t -- I mean, there’s a formal branch of economics called decision trees.</span> <span id="s1247">By the way, ma -- the first professional paper I ever wrote, that was published, was on so-called stocastic decision trees.</span> <span id="s1248">Stocastic is probabilistic decision trees tr -- dec -- decision trees that branch out probabilistically.</span> <span id="s1249">Which means at any given juncture you don’t only have branches, one or two branches, but you have a whole spectrum.</span> <span id="s1250">It’s just -- just occurred to me I never mentioned it that way, but that -- coming back to the question of -- of luck, what you learn from Holocaust, coming back to the theme, is that certain things happen, or the -- what happened in 1944 is that I go where the shooting is.</span> <span id="s1251">I go up the mountain, I get a hand grenade, come down the mountain and there is bunch of Russian commando groups who just looking for somebody just like me to walk ahead of them, okay?</span> <span id="s1252">Now that’s stupid luck, okay?</span> <span id="s1253">Now somebody else would say, well, you know, I’m not going to go with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1254">By the way, the guy who went with me, imme -- immediately wanted no part of it because the Russians were really a ragtag bunch of bandits.</span> <span id="s1255">I mean, they were really a bunch of bandits.</span> <span id="s1256">And I say, bandits, you know, this is fine, you know?</span> <span id="s1257">Besides, they wanted me, you know.</span> <span id="s1258">Besides, they gave me a rifle, you know?</span> <span id="s1259">So luck happens and then you learn to -- to push it -- push it, as far as you can do.</span> <span id="s1260">Now, in case of my son Eric, he pushed it too far.</span> <span id="s1261">But, there you go.</span> <span id="s1262">So -- so th -- that is the model, then.</span> <span id="s1263">The -- the model of the Holocaust is that those people who get squashed, and there are lots of them, wh-who -- you -- you know, the people who brought me to America, you know, the friend of my father’s and so forth --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: -- they stayed confined.</span> <span id="s1266">They started -- they went into the Jewish lodge and they meet Sundays, for years and years, bemoaning the tragedy and what happened, and they sti-still speak Slovak, and they have lectures about, you know, Vienna in 1934, and th -- Prague -- you know, Prague theater in 1932.</span> <span id="s1267">I mean, they’re still in the back country.</span> <span id="s1268">They’re still mentally back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: The -- the -- the -- th-the model that I believe I represent is -- the notion is that opportunities happen, and you have to look forward, and see how far it gets you, even if it kills you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Take risks, seizes opportunities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Seize opportunities, take risk, and -- but do it within certain confines of value, because there are others who came to the United States, Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: -- who basically went after money, you know, how much money can I make?</span> <span id="s1275">And they become speculators, criminals, embezzlers, con artists, stock market map -- manipulators and all of that.</span> <span id="s1276">There’s -- you know, New York is full of that.</span> <span id="s1277">I mean, there’s -- there is a whole Jewish money-optimizing, with no feeling for America, no feeling for the community, no feeling for the society, who are very, very successful, particularly in real estate and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: You know, beco -- becoming billionaires.</span> <span id="s1280">Money is an outcome.</span> <span id="s1281">I always tell my children, whether you get money, or don’t get money, well that’s an outcome.</span> <span id="s1282">That’s not a goal, ever.</span> <span id="s1283">So, you know, one has to really put around this whole question of -- of values, also a question of what do you represen -- what are your beliefs?</span> <span id="s1284">What is the ethics?</span> <span id="s1285">And what is the -- what’s called the sense of honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1287">Which -- which your faith t -- informs, if you like, if you allow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: I mean, what your faith teaches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: To --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yeah, th-th -- this is the essence of faith.</span> <span id="s1293">The essence of faith is grace, fellowship, trying to make life better if you can, and have responsibility to your society and to your community.</span> <span id="s1294">And so that’s -- it’s this -- but you never, never compromise on that, even if it works against you.</span> <span id="s1295">For instance, you know, the people in the Jewish circle, particularly the people who brought me to America, always berated me that I never applied for reparations from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1296">I mean, just -- you know, it’s unthinkable.</span> <span id="s1297">I mean, it’s just -- just not right.</span> <span id="s1298">Just not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: They felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: No, I felt it was not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: But they felt it was not right for me not to do it because you know, I’m -- I’m leaving the -- the bastards with money.</span> <span id="s1303">But i -- but -- but that’s not the question of money, it’s a question of honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1305">You know, I -- I know sometimes people feel that it’s at least a -- a -- a gesture that has meaning for them.</span> <span id="s1306">I mean, wh-wh-wh-why do you think y -- y -- you feel it’s sort of morally wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Yeah, a -- a -- a moral wrong di -- does not get right by money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: By a pay -- amount of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: By paying them the money, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1312">You know, that’s -- that’s -- that’s very fundamental.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1314">I have to think about that, just because I was thinking of a case where a friend whose, you know, family lost property in Vienna, but just felt deeply moved to -- to get this sort of -- the paperwork of reparations and so on.</span> <span id="s1315">The -- the acknowledgement of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: That was so wrong that the acknowledgement isn’t good enough.</span> <span id="s1317">No amount of acknowledgement is good enough, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Yes, of course, yeah, you’re -- you’re right.</span> <span id="s1319">I -- I needed to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1321">No -- I mean, just not right.</span> <span id="s1322">Certain things are such horrible crimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1324">But how can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: And sometimes doing the right thing, against your interest, turns out to be unbelievably attractive and profitable.</span> <span id="s1326">Let me give you a si -- my favorite story.</span> <span id="s1327">My favorite story is here I become the chief information officer of Kraft.</span> <span id="s1328">You know, Sealtest milk, ice cream, cheese on the loading dock.</span> <span id="s1329">I have 48 computers making it possible for people to come up at four o’clock in the morning to the sh -- loading dock, get the pieces of paper, where they deliver this ice cream, or this cream and so forth.</span> <span id="s1330">And it -- now it’s 1963, and I just can’t get all of the -- the business is fantastic and now they want more sophisticated delivery tickets, what have you, and IBM cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1331">Just can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1332">IBM says, well look, we are making new machines, the 360 series are going to be fantastic, but we cannot give you machines that can cope with your workload.</span> <span id="s1333">And I said, guys, you know, you keep promising things to me and you’re not delivering.</span> <span id="s1334">Well, it turns out that I get a phone call from a guy by the name of Art Messerschmitt from Syracuse, and he says, you know, I’m golfing with this Honeywell salesman and the Honeywell salesman -- and I know they have a very good machine -- the Honeywell salesman tells me he’s going to put a Honeywell machine side by side with the IBM machine, charge me nothing, and when the Honeywell machine does exactly what the IBM machine, but twice as much for half the price, you have to promise me that I can get rid of the IBM machine.</span> <span id="s1335">Now, in 1963 getting rid of IBM is, if you know, no-no.</span> <span id="s1336">I mean, they just -- not good for your career.</span> <span id="s1337">You understand that?</span> <span id="s1338">I said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Now -- yes, I -- I know the saying, nobody --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: [indecipherable] fired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: -- what did they say?</span> <span id="s1342">Nobody ever gets fired for -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: So I say, Art, you know, what the hell?</span> <span id="s1344">Go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s1345">So Art Messerschmitt brings in the Honeywell machine, slides it in, it is fantastic.</span> <span id="s1346">Get rid of that IBM machine.</span> <span id="s1347">Well, so then the other controllers -- I mean, you know, the milk business, these are -- the people in Sealtest and Kraft are middle America.</span> <span id="s1348">Penny pinching, honest farm guy, none of this fancy New York stuff.</span> <span id="s1349">And they said, what the hell, you know?</span> <span id="s1350">It’s three cents for a carload of this stuff, let’s get some more Honeywells in, so the -- I started rolling in Honeywell.</span> <span id="s1351">Well, IBM gets very excited.</span> <span id="s1352">What IBM does in those days is they get the guy who does this thing fired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: I mean -- [indecipherable] So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: I should add -- you know, when we made that comment, an aside, I should finish it, which is, nobody ever gets fired for buying IBM.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: That’s right [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah, well, the -- it works the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: He gets fired if you get rid of IBM.</span> <span id="s1361">So IBM sends one of their heavies, an executive vice-president to have golf with Edwards, the Chairman of the Board of Kraft.</span> <span id="s1362">And they go golfing, they’re having a good time, they’re friends and this.</span> <span id="s1363">Oh, then after the golf, the executive vice president of IBM says to the chairman of Kraft, you know, this guy Strassmann is really taking lots of risks, I mean, getting rid of -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: -- this guy has reputation.</span> <span id="s1365">He’s a risk taker, and you know, if you were in the business, you don’t want to take any risks.</span> <span id="s1366">Besides, IBM is going to have these new machines, you know.</span> <span id="s1367">And Gordon Edwards, a good old Texan, says, you know, Joe, when you have those machines and you’re ready to ship them, we have -- you have orders for them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1368">We’ll test them too.</span> <span id="s1369">Meanwhile, Strassmann is shipping ice cream on a loading dock and it’s not melting.</span> <span id="s1370">So, you know, what’s the problem?</span> <span id="s1371">So Strassmann -- everybody -- of course everybody tells this story, you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the Kraft company is good old boys.</span> <span id="s1372">This is sen -- middle America.</span> <span id="s1373">This is good old boys, you know.</span> <span id="s1374">They think this is very funny.</span> <span id="s1375">They think this is a riot.</span> <span id="s1376">They talk about it.</span> <span id="s1377">Four years later, Xerox decides to go into computer business.</span> <span id="s1378">And they buy this company, which was a bad company to begin with, p-pay billion dollars for it.</span> <span id="s1379">The chairman of the board of Xerox announces that the way how they’re going to prove that this turkey is really good is that we are going to get rid of all of our IBM computers, and I have just the guy who knows how to get rid of.</span> <span id="s1380">So they hire me, double my salaries and were willing to pay me 5,000 shares of Xerox stock for every IBM computer I get rid of.</span> <span id="s1381">That’s what built this house.</span> <span id="s1382">Every store you look in there’s an IBM computer.</span> <span id="s1383">You know, I can point to the [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s1384">So -- so that is how things can sometimes work for you.</span> <span id="s1385">Xerox needed -- the only guy with a track record of getting rid of IBM computers in the United States, was Paul Strassmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Good story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: So, a similar story is -- a similar story is when I retired from Xerox -- again, I’m distr-splaying a morality.</span> <span id="s1388">The morality is, good, bad or indifferent -- I mean, Gordon Edwards could have come back from that golf game and fired me on the spot, for whatever reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: But that’s not the way I play the game.</span> <span id="s1391">If they would have wanted to fire me, this was not going to be a company for me to work for anyway, you know.</span> <span id="s1392">Years later, I’m wi -- quite an expert, I write a couple of books about computers.</span> <span id="s1393">General Motors buys EDS, this big corporation.</span> <span id="s1394">EDS takes over all computers from General Motors, it’s a absolute disaster.</span> <span id="s1395">Ross Perot gets greedy, starts charging General Motors excess money.</span> <span id="s1396">General Motors plant managers don’t get any bonuses, EDS gets all the bonuses.</span> <span id="s1397">So the vice-chairman of General Motors is given the job to find out whether EDS is overcharging or not.</span> <span id="s1398">Guess who they hire?</span> <span id="s1399">Paul Strassmann.</span> <span id="s1400">You see, I don’t have any consultants, I don’t have -- I don’t bring in a big staff.</span> <span id="s1401">I am a well known expert in the fie-field.</span> <span id="s1402">I study the situation, I call up the vice-chairman of General Motors and say, look, they’re overcharging you.</span> <span id="s1403">And then he -- he says, well how much are they overcharging me?</span> <span id="s1404">They are overcharging you at least 300 million dollars a year, which is quite a bit of money.</span> <span id="s1405">And it’s actually more, but 300 million dollars you can prove.</span> <span id="s1406">So he says, you know, this is very difficult, Ross Perot is on the Board of Directors of General Motors.</span> <span id="s1407">I have to bring it up before the board.</span> <span id="s1408">Why don’t you write a half page memorandum, stand by until the board meeting and just before the board meeting you fax it to my secretary outside of the board meeting and I’ll read it to the board.</span> <span id="s1409">Which he does -- I mean, this was going to be hush-hush.</span> <span id="s1410">By three o’clock in the afternoon every plant manager in General Motors who hates the guts of EDS has a copy of Strassmann’s memo that they’re overcharged by 300 million doll -- which is out of their pocket, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: So General Motors says, you know, sorry, you know, this really caused all kinds of problems.</span> <span id="s1413">We’re going to pay you your fee, but we cannot employ you any more.</span> <span id="s1414">I come home, Mona tells me, you know, Strassmann, again, you know, you just play it straight, you know?</span> <span id="s1415">You missed a great opportunity getting a consulting contract from General Motors.</span> <span id="s1416">You -- couldn’t you have varnished it a little or something?</span> <span id="s1417">I say, well that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s1418">Six months later, the vice-chairman of General Motors is now deputy secretary of defense, working for Dick Cheney.</span> <span id="s1419">Soviet Union collapses --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Who -- who would that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Donald Atwood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Okay I mean a -- wondered if I knew the name.</span> <span id="s1423">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Yeah, Donald Atwood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1426">That’s not the point, it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: W-We -- Congress decides [indecipherable] dividend, cuts the department of ar -- Department of Defense budget by 75 billion dollars.</span> <span id="s1428">And Cheney turns to Donald Atwood say, well you know, find the 75 billion dollars.</span> <span id="s1429">Donald can find 30, but there is -- he’s short, you know, he’s short quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1430">So he said, well we are going to do it by corporate information [indecipherable] we are going to bring into the department of defer -- corporate information management based on computers.</span> <span id="s1431">You know, this is -- this is -- this is a holy grail, you know, every couple of years this idea perks up and dies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1434">And I am just the bastard who knows how to do it.</span> <span id="s1435">And guess what?</span> <span id="s1436">I get pulled into the Department of Defense as the first Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense --</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: -- to do the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: And I assume you were much needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1441">I mean, everybody agrees and you know, I and -- you know, I [indecipherable] I don’t know how many billions I saved, but I at least set the thing in a direction -- finally Rumsfeld is doing it now, but it takes a long time to move that -- that thing.</span> <span id="s1442">But again, you know, who would have known that by calling the shots on General Motors, would end -- will end me up in this -- this position.</span> <span id="s1443">So there’s a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Now, just to show you how luck or opportunity works, I get into the Department of Defense, and I look around, and I say, well what’s wrong is computers report to the controller.</span> <span id="s1446">Computers should not report to the controller because finance people just keeps computers under throttle, computers is a weapon, it’s a military weapon, it’s a command and control weapon.</span> <span id="s1447">Let’s yank out the computers away from the controller.</span> <span id="s1448">Now, to do that in the Department of Defense, I mean, is -- this is hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Rock the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Tha-That’s really rocking the boat.</span> <span id="s1451">We rocked the boat, guess what?</span> <span id="s1452">Donald Atwood wanted to do it anyway, now he pulls the responsibility for computers away from the controller of the depart -- where it has been for the prior 50 years.</span> <span id="s1453">The controller of the Department of Defense is a guy by the name of Sean O’Keefe.</span> <span id="s1454">So we -- we make an enemy right there.</span> <span id="s1455">So we take it out, we bring it under and the assistant Secretary of Defense for command and control, the military loves me.</span> <span id="s1456">The military just loves me.</span> <span id="s1457">I get a big checkbook, I start spending money on the special forces, who until then didn’t get the money.</span> <span id="s1458">They make me an honorary Green Beret, they find out that I was a guerilla fighter.</span> <span id="s1459">Boy, this is one of our guys, he’s one of ours.</span> <span id="s1460">And of course, I give them the money, you know, I move the money away from finance and give it to the war fighters.</span> <span id="s1461">I mean, you can’t go wrong, I mean.</span> <span id="s1462">So the story then goes, I retire from the Department of Defense with all the honors, you know, but when Clinton gan -- comes in, that’s not the place for me to be, I mean, I just can’t stand the guy.</span> <span id="s1463">NASA gets into trouble.</span> <span id="s1464">The new administrator of NASA is one Sean O’Keefe.</span> <span id="s1465">He says, I know just the bastard to straighten out this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Well, he -- yo-you made an enemy of him, but he could see that the action taken was right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: No, what happens is that people disagree with me, but everybody respects me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1470">And so I get a call that, you know, would you like to do some consulting for NASA?</span> <span id="s1471">So I -- sure.</span> <span id="s1472">I come down to NASA.</span> <span id="s1473">They showed me everything else.</span> <span id="s1474">I didn’t know I was walking into a setup.</span> <span id="s1475">I ga -- arrive at NASA at nine o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1476">They give me the review of the situation.</span> <span id="s1477">I said, you guys are just in an awful mess.</span> <span id="s1478">Okay, Mr. Strassmann, what would do?</span> <span id="s1479">I said, well there are three things you have to do.</span> <span id="s1480">Well, you know, now it’s 3:30 in the afternoon, would you like to walk up and present your findings to the administrator?</span> <span id="s1481">I walk in, oh Paul, so nice to see you, so glad to see -- you know.</span> <span id="s1482">I present the thing, and he said, well, you know, that makes awful sense.</span> <span id="s1483">Guess what, you’re staying here and you’re going to fix it.</span> <span id="s1484">I said, well I’m here for a consulting.</span> <span id="s1485">No, you’re coming -- you’re staying here and fixing it.</span> <span id="s1486">I say, well you cannot appoint me to a senior executive position in the federal government that easily.</span> <span id="s1487">He said, you think I can’t?</span> <span id="s1488">So he said, well, will you take it?</span> <span id="s1489">I say, well, you know, I am a servant of this country.</span> <span id="s1490">If -- if I am asked to do something -- he says, just wait a moment, picks up the phone, brings in lawyers, what have you.</span> <span id="s1491">I walk at 6:30 that evening with a badge, as the Chief Information Officer of NASA.</span> <span id="s1492">Now, the question is luck, opportunity, or what, but there is a pattern.</span> <span id="s1493">You know, I have many stories like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I mean, lots of stories like that.</span> <span id="s1496">The -- the -- the paradigm of the Holocaust, the -- coming back to the Holocaust is that what I learned from the Holocaust is that there is always opportunity.</span> <span id="s1497">You cannot stay in a position where there’s no opportunity, because you die, one way or another.</span> <span id="s1498">And this is true.</span> <span id="s1499">In the Holocaust this is also true, in business, this true everywhere in life.</span> <span id="s1500">And within bounds of ethics and honor and commitment and service, you just do what’s right.</span> <span id="s1501">And then if you happen to get money for it, well so be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: But that’s not the way I make the -- the decisions.</span> <span id="s1504">That’s not the way to make decisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: You know, there’s a Quaker saying, you do good, and do well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Well, sure, y -- well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1507">But -- and the well may or may not come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1509">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: So that -- that is really -- I think -- not just Paul Strassmann, this is -- this is bigger than Paul Strassmann, has to do with history of Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: -- has to do with preservation, has to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: That’s what I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s1514">It’s not just the Holocaust, it’s really the history of a people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: It’s a -- oh, history of a people.</span> <span id="s1516">Jews, when you look at the history of the people, have been extremely successful in survival.</span> <span id="s1517">They are the oldest survive -- continually survivable civilization and culture.</span> <span id="s1518">There’s nobody else who goes that far back in a line of succession.</span> <span id="s1519">The Egyptians are gone, the Romans are gone, the Greeks are gone.</span> <span id="s1520">The Chinese empire has come and gone.</span> <span id="s1521">But as a continuum, as a thread, there has be -- there has been a paradigm there that basically says that you -- you -- you -- you diversify.</span> <span id="s1522">You don’t know -- do not get stuck in Judea.</span> <span id="s1523">Sure, you may fight the Romans, but everybody else who fought the Romans and stayed where they were, are gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: And then I was thinking of Eric’s place in that evolution, that you lose some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Yeah, and then you lose some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: There’s horrendous losses.</span> <span id="s1528">There are horrendous losses in the process.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1530">But you could say they’re not in vain, because they’re part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: They’re part of the -- part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: -- thread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: -- part of the thread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: And all your -- all your honors and awards are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: So what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: -- fit with the pattern -- I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: -- yeah, yeah, just milestones, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1540">That’s all they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1542">[indecipherable][tape break] There are many other things we haven’t covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1544">My relationship with the Holocaust Museum goes back to perhaps as early as 1990 -- no, no, no, no, 1988, when -- 1988 when I gave a lecture at the Holocaust Museum on -- on the fact that the great lessons of the Slovak no -- uprising was the fact that a Jewish brigade at the labor camp, the slave labor camp, marched out as a bat -- armed battalion, as organized battalion and participated as a Jewish organized military unit, although the -- the Jewish brigade in the British army was organized in Tobruk in November of 1944, the Jewish brigade organized in Slovakia as a Jewish unit, goes back to August 29th, 1944.</span> <span id="s1545">And I wanted to point out that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is the first organized Jewish military unit that went to war since A.D. 70.</span> <span id="s1546">There was some interest on the part of the Holocaust Museum, but in those days the Holocaust Museum was very much concerned about crying about the enormity of the crime, Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1547">The idea of fighting, Jews fighting and opposing by action, the actions on the part of the Germans was not high on the agenda, except there was a -- a researcher in the -- in the -- the Holocaust Museum, a Dr. Sybil Milton, who got very much interested in the subject, and subsequently, when I was in Washington, I met with Dr. Milton several times, we had lunch together.</span> <span id="s1548">And I tried to convey to you my sense of the Holocaust, namely that this was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but it was a historical evolution of a state machinery that went berserk.</span> <span id="s1549">In other words, the Nazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the state to its ultimate form of destruction.</span> <span id="s1550">You know, the state has always done pogroms and done injustice, and done all kinds of things, but here, the superiority of industrial organization and scientific organization, in fact, went to its ultimate conclusion, namely, we are just going to plan, methodically, to destroy people.</span> <span id="s1551">And the enormity of the Holocaust really lies in the fact that -- in its engineering.</span> <span id="s1552">In other words, it was planned as an engineer could -- conscious process, where they were actually calculating the capacity of the cars, the capacity of the killing, how quickly can we burn them.</span> <span id="s1553">In other words, they applied scientific management.</span> <span id="s1554">And that is really the grossness, the horror of this thing, which I called the -- the bureaucratization of Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1555">In other words, the bureaucratization of genocide.</span> <span id="s1556">And the point that I was raising was that with advanced information technology, the state can, through control of people, and eliminating privacy in the future, basically grind masses of people to destruction.</span> <span id="s1557">In other words, endemic in the structure of modern civilization, of industrialization, is a capability of massive destruction, by means out of anatomic weapons.</span> <span id="s1558">Sybil Milton was very, very much taken by it.</span> <span id="s1559">I then subsequently provided to the Holocaust Museum, a collection of documents which I assembled, my sister actually helped with it, which showed methodically how the various laws were used in Slovakia to gradually strip an innkeeper, who was a veteran from World War I, and who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away, and this was taken away and the fur coats was taken, and radio was taken, and so on, until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him.</span> <span id="s1560">And I gave a collection of something like 30 documents, where the wife actually got a receipt for the husband.</span> <span id="s1561">In other words, the bureaucracy worked with perfection and completeness and everything was legitimate and everything was signed and everything was covered by law.</span> <span id="s1562">It was passed by a duly elected parliament.</span> <span id="s1563">And then, of course, Sybil said, yeah, but where do computers come into this thing?</span> <span id="s1564">And I said, well I don’t know, but when I look at this succession of how Mr. Flak got eliminated, I can see a computerized society doing it much more efficiently, much more expeditiously, without any errors.</span> <span id="s1565">Sybil then went away.</span> <span id="s1566">A month later Sybil calls me up and say, I have something interesting for you.</span> <span id="s1567">She sends to me in the mail, copies of three pages from some kind of German documentation, which shows a punch card, and shows a picture of what’s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith machine, and says, could you tell me what it is?</span> <span id="s1568">And -- and of course I said, surely, this is -- this is a machine that is being used, using census data in order to make sure that all the Jews and their property is properly filtered out so that you can schedule the Jews to destruction.</span> <span id="s1569">And she said, you know, we are building a -- a Holocaust Museum, it’s all crying and weeping, and what have you, but there’s nothing in there about this concept of the grindstone of the bureaucracy actually being an engine of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1570">And she said, you know, it would be very interesting to be able to prove that the Germans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she didn’t distinguish between tabulating machine and -- and I said, yeah, that would be very interesting.</span> <span id="s1571">I took the picture and send it to a friend of mine who is a retired IBM executive.</span> <span id="s1572">She said, oh we tried it before, we asked IBM whether they had anything to do with providing tabulating machine to the Nazis, you know.</span> <span id="s1573">I said, Sybil, you must be kidding, you know.</span> <span id="s1574">So I send it to this guy in Denver, he’s retired, he looks at it, he says, oh, this is Dehomag number 325, you know.</span> <span id="s1575">And yeah, the card says so and so Jew, and property and location and he’s accounted for.</span> <span id="s1576">So Sybil says, you know what, we really would need this kind of thing on the exhibit in order to make the point.</span> <span id="s1577">Could you get the Nazi machine?</span> <span id="s1578">I said, you must be kidding, you know, there’s no such thing.</span> <span id="s1579">Well, try anyway.</span> <span id="s1580">So I sent out, because of my many connection -- you know, I am a collector, you know, you saw that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: -- I collect some stuff, you know that -- I love to go and look for things.</span> <span id="s1583">And someday I’m going to tell you some of the stuff that I was able to find.</span> <span id="s1584">I mean, really, I have a story behind each.</span> <span id="s1585">See, I collected every item in here, I bought and collected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1587">And we should say that’s the IBM museum of -- w-we should explain to them, anyways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1589">Well -- well, the museum -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: -- Xerox Historical Museum of the Written Word.</span> <span id="s1592">Well at any rate, I sent out a -- a letter saying -- to all the computer museums in the world, and there are four, you know, do you have a Dehomag number 302?</span> <span id="s1593">Oh no, we haven’t got it.</span> <span id="s1594">I said, well, if you find wa -- one of them, we really need it for a museum, could you -- could you let me know?</span> <span id="s1595">Well, the Berlin wall falls, three weeks later I get a phone call from the British museum, the engineering museum in -- in London on -- on -- on -- on -- next to the Imperial Museum.</span> <span id="s1596">And they said, you know, somebody’s offered us for sale, in Dresden, a Dehomag 302.</span> <span id="s1597">I said, fine, can we buy it?</span> <span id="s1598">Well, you know, they -- they just -- they -- they -- they really would like to sell it for 2,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1599">I say, go buy it.</span> <span id="s1600">Well, then I go to the Holocaust Museum, oh, you know, this -- we -- how do we know it’s authentic, what is this and this?</span> <span id="s1601">I said, 2,000 bucks guys, be real.</span> <span id="s1602">Then they had to send somebody to -- to Germany to look at the machine, they didn’t know anything about the machine, they come back, yeah, there is such a machine.</span> <span id="s1603">It -- actually the air ca -- air -- th-the expense for -- was more than the machine.</span> <span id="s1604">Well, finally they buy the machine.</span> <span id="s1605">The machine is shipped to the warehouse in Baltimore where all of this stuff was being staged prior to being -- to completion of the building.</span> <span id="s1606">This is before the building was done.</span> <span id="s1607">They invite me to come to authenticate the machine, and of course my friend in Denver tells me what to look at, what serial number and all of those things.</span> <span id="s1608">I go and look at -- it’s a gorgeous machine, just gor -- you know, only the Germans can make this fine machine parts.</span> <span id="s1609">It was a tabulator, it was a sorter, it was an input machine, the whole thing, whole shooting thing.</span> <span id="s1610">I said, you know, this is -- this is just a beautiful thing.</span> <span id="s1611">Well, would you please write something?</span> <span id="s1612">So I wrote a script for the -- for the -- for the -- for the display unit, called the bureaucratization of genocide.</span> <span id="s1613">Well, it didn't go over very well with the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1614">They ultimately put the three machines on the exhibit, but they were taking too much space, so last time I know, they removed two of them.</span> <span id="s1615">I find -- I have a real bad feeling about the Holocaust Museum, I just want you to know.</span> <span id="s1616">Many of the people who are the biggest donor to the Holocaust Museums are Jews who are survivors, who came to the United States, made lots of money and are heavily funding the museum.</span> <span id="s1617">You know, this is -- this is their guilt trip.</span> <span id="s1618">I -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Now I -- I may be overdoing it, but they really did not want to take it from the fact it’s a crime to something that I see, it is something which has much broader consequence for the future.</span> <span id="s1621">And when you are telling kids about the Holocaust -- well they say, well Hitler was a bad guy.</span> <span id="s1622">Well, when -- when do we gonna get another Hitler?</span> <span id="s1623">You know, it’s all the Nazis and the Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Ah, but the mission is, you know, it’s a government insti -- funded institution to educate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: They don’t educate, in my view, and I been to the Holocaust Museum twice, I spoke there.</span> <span id="s1626">I look at -- I -- I ge -- I’m on the mailing list and so forth, and I listen to Elie Wiesel -- Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s1627">The education in the information age is to beware of the abrogation of civil liberties, of the use of computers in the police system --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: -- which can be perverted, and that I don’t see as a theme emerging from the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1630">They don’t want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: They want to keep, you feel, to the narrower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Yeah, they want to keep it as a feeling, well this is bad, this is bunch of bad guys, and all of those things.</span> <span id="s1633">To me it is much more endemic.</span> <span id="s1634">It’s -- it’s the -- the state going mad, like in Pol Pot’s time, I mean.</span> <span id="s1635">Like under Mao.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1637">Oh, which conceivably can happen to any society at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Can happen to any society, any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: And that moral lesson is not visible.</span> <span id="s1641">And you might as well tell your sponsors that, that I said so.</span> <span id="s1642">Had to get it off my chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: You had something further to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1645">There was no way -- ma -- this is my commentary on the tenor and the morality of the Holocaust Museum, and the lessons to the history.</span> <span id="s1646">And one of the very significant lessons of bureaucratization of genocide is the extremely small staff that Eichmann had in order to execute massive amount of people.</span> <span id="s1647">Eichmann and his people, in a typical German fashion, were methodical bureaucrats first.</span> <span id="s1648">So when Arons -- Ar-Arons says about the banality of -- of -- of -- of the crime, he -- she really does not get into the analytic mech -- mechanism of how this is done.</span> <span id="s1649">It was done, and I’ve studied it, in a very organized, methodical method which leveraged the machinery of the state, of the police, of the [indecipherable] of the judicial system, to commit the crime.</span> <span id="s1650">When you really look at it from a legal standpoint, there was no crime.</span> <span id="s1651">Duly elected --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Democratic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: -- democratically elected majority people, all voting in favor, in -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s1655">This is an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the 8th, 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1656">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Paul Strassmann on July the 11th, 1990.</span> <span id="s1657">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s1658">This is tape number four, side A. Nothing -- you’re saying that nothing illegal --</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Well, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: -- had occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: -- the Holocaust, at least the way I witnessed it, with the evidence available to me, although there were exceptions, particularly in the conquered lands, where in Russia, in -- where there was no legality at all, it was -- th-that was just plunder and mur-murder and what have you.</span> <span id="s1662">But I’m talking about western Europe, so-called civilized western Europe, which includes our good friends the French, and -- and -- and the Belgians, and the Germans and particularly the Austrian and the Slovaks, and the Hungarians and the Romanian, etcetera, etcetera, all did that in a very methodical, prescribed, legitimate method, which means that they could argue that they were proceeding through the sovereign rights of the state to take measures which they considered necessary to defend their social and economic well being.</span> <span id="s1663">By the way, that argument has been made.</span> <span id="s1664">Now, with that structure, and then harnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very well structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how, such as being taught in schools today, of management.</span> <span id="s1665">In fact, people get MBAs in subjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to krispies, and hamburgers and what have you.</span> <span id="s1666">Now, the evidence for this thing really is in what’s called a transaction cost.</span> <span id="s1667">The transaction costs for executing this crime were very low, because this was largely self funding.</span> <span id="s1668">For instance, the Slovak paid the Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and reeducation fees.</span> <span id="s1669">The confiscations were self funding.</span> <span id="s1670">Eichmann actually produced a profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were able to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although sooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business.</span> <span id="s1671">The business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at corporate headquarters, with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved the marshalling and destruction of millions of people.</span> <span id="s1672">And one of the key elements in that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the Jewish organizations into the liquidation process.</span> <span id="s1673">The deportation lists from my town, Trencin, that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were made by the Jewish [indecipherable], by the Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1674">The supervision and the guidance of, you know, going to this car, and going to this car, was done mostly by Jews with the enforcers onlooking except when there were some hooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth.</span> <span id="s1675">But most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion.</span> <span id="s1676">So now comes the Holocaust Museum, and you have a list of Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1677">And then you have a list of Holocaust survivor donors.</span> <span id="s1678">And then you have interviews with these donors who are being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner.</span> <span id="s1679">And then you have the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1680">Well, these people get up and make a speech and they say how they suffered in Auschwitz, and in what have you.</span> <span id="s1681">Now it turns out that none of them ever give away when they went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1682">None of them.</span> <span id="s1683">They never do.</span> <span id="s1684">This is one thing -- by the -- in many of my inquiries, and I will tell you some stories also how this [indecipherable] -- many of these people, by innuendo and implication esp -- espe -- especially as to the date of the way, how the destruction was done, are clearly 1942 inmates.</span> <span id="s1685">Now please tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Oh, because based on putting together information from what they’ve said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1688">Please tell me how can anybody survive Auschwitz from ’42 to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: -- the spring -- to liberation, which is early spring of 1945, without being a kapo?</span> <span id="s1691">So the money they’re giving is guilt money, it’s tainted money, it’s immoral money, it’s bad money.</span> <span id="s1692">And they influence the -- the tenor of what I see -- I haven’t been to the Holocaust Museum now for about seven years, maybe they changed the exhibits.</span> <span id="s1693">But it is -- the morality, you see, the morality of that thing, which is really the underlying issue and the guidance for people to think about the future is not obvious, or not apparent.</span> <span id="s1694">It’s not even discussed.</span> <span id="s1695">Now, the morality of course, is in Yad Vashem, where they have the Righteous, and th-that’s a different thing.</span> <span id="s1696">But to me the Holocaust Museum is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Well, that’s also part of the story told at the Holocaust Museum, is the Righteous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: But without the morality, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: -- individual -- you see -- see -- see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: I do see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: You see, that gets you into individual psychology of individual people.</span> <span id="s1703">When you are going to teach about the Holocaust, children, and if you’re looking into the information society of the 21st and 22nd century -- you know, those museum has ways of staying around for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Something that is the guts of the issue, in terms of relevance to the future is not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1707">And -- and of course, all the time, life goes on and other events take place, such as the Bosnian war, which also comes under the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Oh yeah, oh yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: -- teaching message of the Holocaust Museum</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: That’s right, that’s right, e-except the Bosnian war is really not analyzed in terms of -- in my terms of reference.</span> <span id="s1711">It was again the state machinery -- in this particular case the military machinery, which is the most dangerous machinery.</span> <span id="s1712">See, the Germans were much more refined, they never used the military for this purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: I mean, the Bosnians and the Serbs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: -- were just very crude.</span> <span id="s1717">I mean, that’s -- that’s -- that’s -- you -- you know, that’s very crude.</span> <span id="s1718">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Yes, I see the distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: And -- and those are very important, you see, the taxonomy of genocide varies.</span> <span id="s1721">You have a Mao Tse-Tung, very sophisticated, harnessing the young pioneers to engage in genocide, but actually mobilizing a section of the communist party to execute.</span> <span id="s1722">Then you have Pol Pot, okay?</span> <span id="s1723">Then you have the very interesting situation in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s1724">There is a whole taxonomy of different forms.</span> <span id="s1725">There is a life form out there called genocide, that has a set of indicators which should be used as an way of alerting society, so that society can distinguish it.</span> <span id="s1726">See, one of -- part of the problem with the genocide was that the society in ’38 - ’39 did not discriminate, did not distinguish it, and the Jewish organizations were used as way of distorting and not clarifying what was really happening.</span> <span id="s1727">We knew, for instance, what Auschwitz was, what [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1728">The Jewish -- we had two people come from Auschwitz, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: To your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: To Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1733">So that was known at the end of 1943.</span> <span id="s1734">Had that been known and broadcast by the Jewish community, more Jews would have taken a different view.</span> <span id="s1735">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1736">The thing was hushed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Don’t rock the boat.</span> <span id="s1739">Keep low.</span> <span id="s1740">You might offend somebody.</span> <span id="s1741">So, you know, if you really want to listen to Paul Strassmann, my lesson for the Holocaust, I mean, there’s a whole different story to be told, in terms of its real events, to the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: But I’m not sure they want to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1745">Well, we’ve -- this is a small way of making sure the story is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: In their -- in the archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1749">The whole taxonomy, structure and dynamics of the Holocaust has to deal with going back to options.</span> <span id="s1750">I-I wrote a paper and gave a series of lectures which were very o -- people were very unhappy about it.</span> <span id="s1751">I pointed out that in 1944, the probability of surviving the eight month remaining for the remainder of the war, much greater if you fought than if you went to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1752">In other words, there were two work camps in Slovakia, one in Sered, one in Novaky.</span> <span id="s1753">The one in Novaky marched a battalion with a survival rate of 70 percent.</span> <span id="s1754">Sered was done -- run by religious Jews.</span> <span id="s1755">Well, maybe we’ll negotiate our way, maybe it’s not there, maybe we don’t go on this transfer, maybe we’ll go to the next transfer.</span> <span id="s1756">Always bargaining.</span> <span id="s1757">See, you were bargaining, see the -- you were bargaining with evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: The bargaining with evil.</span> <span id="s1760">There comes a point where you don’t bargain with evil, you see, because you are out of choices.</span> <span id="s1761">Because the evil will not give you any choices.</span> <span id="s1762">And so the probability, the morbidity rate of those was 95 percent.</span> <span id="s1763">So you know, you’re now dealing with statistics and with odds, and with orientation.</span> <span id="s1764">You know, you had six million Jews with lots of money in 1938, let’s go and take a hike.</span> <span id="s1765">You know, we could have gone to Madagascar.</span> <span id="s1766">We could have gone to all kinds of other places.</span> <span id="s1767">Again, I am talking about the survival rates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1769">Well, it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s1770">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: I’d like to thank you.</span> <span id="s1773">This
