Dr. Riegner, would you tell us your full name, and where and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A. My name is Gerhart Riegner.</span> <span id="s12">Second name is Moritz.</span> <span id="s13">I was named after my grandfather.</span> <span id="s14">I am born in Berlin.</span> <span id="s15">I am a real Berliner, as Kennedy would have said.</span> <span id="s16">And I am born on the 12th of September, 1911.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q. And could you tell us a little bit about what your life was like when you were growing up in Berlin with your family, friends, the climate, so forth?</span> <span id="s18">\</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A. Well, I come from a typical German Jewish family.</span> <span id="s20">And I would say that we belonged alreadyas Kurt Blumenfeld would have saidto the post‑assimilationist era.</span> <span id="s21">It is typical that I am born in Berlin and that my two parents were also already born in Berlin.</span> <span id="s22">My grandparents came from very typical German middle‑sized cities.</span> <span id="s23">One grandfather was born in Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s24">The othermy grandmother was born in Halle.</span> <span id="s25">The second grandmother was born in Neubrandenburg.</span> <span id="s26">And the other grandfatherhere we come already to the frontier towards Polandin Niederschlesien, which is Silesia, the more German part of it.</span> <span id="s27">So I am coming from a long stock German family.</span> <span id="s28">We had in the family two traditions.</span> <span id="s29">On the one hand, a very Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s30">My grandmother, my mother's side, was a Lewandovsky.</span> <span id="s31">She was a niece of Louis Lewandovsky, who was the creator of the modern synagogue music, and some of the most beautiful modern melodies originate from him.</span> <span id="s32">His son‑in‑law was the famous philosopher, Hermann Cohen, the founder of the Marburgerschule of the school of Neo‑Kantianism.</span> <span id="s33">He was one of the few full professors under the Kaiserreich in the old style.</span> <span id="s34">He came from very Jewish origins.</span> <span id="s35">He studied the Talmud.</span> <span id="s36">He went to the Jewish theological seminary in Breslau before he became a philosopher.</span> <span id="s37">And he is the author not only of great works and the reinterpretation of Kant, but also of religious philosophy, of work in religious philosophy, based on the sources of Judaism, "die Religion der Vernunft."</span> <span id="s38">This is a great man in my family, whom I knew as a child.</span> <span id="s39">And whereevery Sunday we went for lunch to my grandparents' andfor coffee or tea to Cohen's.</span> <span id="s40">And in Cohen's house, which was very near that of my grandparents', every Sunday there was a great party, sixty, fifty, sixty persons.</span> <span id="s41">And the old man was nearly blind, was in the rocking chair, like Kennedy, with white, wonderful white hair, and the blue dark glasses, was presiding overwhat should I call it?</span> <span id="s42">Holding court, if you want.</span> <span id="s43">He was really nice to us children.</span> <span id="s44">He played with us, andbut before all, I knew that he was an important man.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">I see him still in the synagogue onSimchas Torah.</span> <span id="s46">01:10 In 1917, I was six years old, when he walked directly behind the rabbi with the little Torah, very light because he was not so very strong any more.</span> <span id="s47">And he looked like an old Jewish prophet, with his fantastic great face, his white locks, and he gave the impression of a real leader of a religious movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q.</span> <span id="s49">But you knew he was also an important man in the country in terms of his academic standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A.</span> <span id="s51">He was fighting anti‑Semitism.</span> <span id="s52">And he spoke out from 1879, when the famous attacks by Treitschke, the historian, and Stoecke, the priest and the official Dompraediger of the empire, attacked the Jews.</span> <span id="s53">And he was himself, by the way, the victim of many anti‑Semitic attacks, and washad never a call from another universitythis is also very interestingand was fighting for his pupils to get appointed as professors, and had one defeat after the other in this respect.</span> <span id="s54">Even a man like Ernst Gerschieler, as great as his name was in this countrywas his most important pupil probablycouldn't get in Marburg, the Privatdozenten, and so on.</span> <span id="s55">Now, this is the oneand here, the one source of my Jewish background which was perhaps in myself stronger than in the family itself.</span> <span id="s56">And this was due to the general climate in Germany.</span> <span id="s57">My first anti‑Semitic experience was on the second day of school, when I went to school in 1917, and somebody called me "ein dreckiger Judenluemmel," dirty Jew boysomething.</span> <span id="s58">And Ithis was my first anti‑Semitic experience.</span> <span id="s59">And I reacted immediately, not very intelligently.</span> <span id="s60">But I couldn't not react.</span> <span id="s61">And I replied "dreckiger Christenbengel," which wasn't very intelligent.</span> <span id="s62">But I did not accept the attack.</span> <span id="s63">My second experience was an experience of social anti‑Semitism, in school, when a good friend of mine, who was also a son of a lawyer, never succeeded in inviting me to his home.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q.</span> <span id="s65">You mean he tried, but his parents wouldn't allow it?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s67">It was a tragedy with which I fought three years, each time finding another excuse why they didn't invite me, until I finally understood why.</span> <span id="s68">Now, all this happened in a Germany in which there was a strong anti‑Semitic movement.</span> <span id="s69">I come to it in a moment when I speak about the political background.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q. All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A.</span> <span id="s72">But I remember, for instance, the day on which Rathenau was assassinated, in 1922.</span> <span id="s73">I was not yet eleven years old.</span> <span id="s74">And I remember the day my mother was in the clinic and we visited her.</span> <span id="s75">She had some operationI don't remember what it wasand it shook us to the foundations.</span> <span id="s76">This was the great German Jewish patriot, who, in 1918, at the end of the war, was the only one to suggest that the war was lost "Levee en masse" – the popular resistance movementa Jew who had the courage to do thiswas the organizer of the whole economic administration of raw materials during the four years of the first World War, for Germany.</span> <span id="s77">A really great German patriot, no doubt about it, who had immense merit, from the German point of view –</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q.</span> <span id="s79">He was a very able man.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A.to have organized it.</span> <span id="s81">And he was, as a minister of foreign affairs, killed by "voelkische," racist people.</span> <span id="s82">I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s83">Thisand in this wholethis whole movement, there were at least three, four, five othersI am not speaking even of Hitlerthe first revolt in 1924.</span> <span id="s84">But in every election we had it, and you felt it, and you saw it, and we were very noisy.</span> <span id="s85">Now I come to the other side.</span> <span id="s86">My family was very interested in politics.</span> <span id="s87">My father was associated since 1910 with a memberthe socialist member, a prominent socialist who became a member of the Reichstag, who was during the revolution in 1918 a member of the provisional Prussian government, minister of justice, and who became one of the great fighters against the death penalty in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q. Kurt Rosenfeld?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A. Kurt Rosenfeld, yes.</span> <span id="s90">My father was not a socialist.</span> <span id="s91">My father was a very socially minded democrat.</span> <span id="s92">Perhaps more social than the Socialist Party, deeplybut didn't believe in Marxism, and so on, but he had a very great social conscienceness.</span> <span id="s93">He was a typical product of his time, where the idea of "allgemeine Bildung," universal knowledge, universal education, was the great idea towards which a great part of German Jewry attended.</span> <span id="s94">He was very close to Cohen, who considered him as his preferred nephew, who had no children, and, therefore, the close relationship.</span> <span id="s95">He was in reality very knowledgeable in German literature.</span> <span id="s96">When he died, I heard himand the last time I saw him andlying on his beddeclaiming for hours verses from Goethe's Faust, from Heine's "Lieder," and so on.</span> <span id="s97">You know, this is human.</span> <span id="s98">At the end of the life, the souvenirs of the young years come out very, very stronglythat remain, years full of German "Bildung."</span> <span id="s99">He was a great connoisseur of art.</span> <span id="s100">In his old years he even wrote books on art and articles.</span> <span id="s101">Where he didn't succeed to write about European artto publish it in America, I gave him the idea to write for aEuropean publications about American art, and he published a series of modern American art.</span> <span id="s102">It was very appreciated.</span> <span id="s103">He was at home in many ways in many fields of human knowledge and endeavors.</span> <span id="s104">As I said, he was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s105">And he was even very esteemed amongst his colleagues.</span> <span id="s106">He was what is called a memberelected as a member of the "Vorstand der Anwaltskammer," which is the chamber of lawyers, where all the lawyers elect their own disciplinary courts and instances.</span> <span id="s107">And he got in Berlin the largest number of votes amongst the lawyers, whichfor a man who was very modestand so this was quite remarkable.</span> <span id="s108">My mother was also active in politics.</span> <span id="s109">She became active in education of women and information of women as citizens of the country.</span> <span id="s110">She gave lectures and courses toin women's schools about the responsibility, civil responsibility of women.</span> <span id="s111">She became a very active member of the Democratic Party and belonged to the enlarged Bureau of the party, went out takingmaking speeches at all elections, and so on.</span> <span id="s112">So you see here, there was a political atmosphere, both from my parents and from associates of my father.</span> <span id="s113">This was the other part.</span> <span id="s114">I was deeply interested in politics all my life.</span> <span id="s115">And I saw the disappearance, slow disappearance of the democratic republic.</span> <span id="s116">I had mentioned today when Rathenau was assassinated.</span> <span id="s117">I remember the day when the first president of the republic died.</span> <span id="s118">I took part in the 1925I think, in the funeral in the Lustgarten with the hundreds of thousands of people.</span> <span id="s119">And I felt already then somehow instinctive whether we hadn't already buried the republic there.</span> <span id="s120">And all the more when Hindenburg, to our great disappointment, was elected president.</span> <span id="s121">Andwhich was, of course, a terrible regressive step from the point of view of democracy.</span> <span id="s122">This all I lived very intensely and followed very intensely.</span> <span id="s123">And I saw with growing fear what was happening, and the great uccess of the racist and Nazi movements.</span> <span id="s124">I finished my school in 1929 with a very good examination.</span> <span id="s125">I went my first termI followed in the University in Freiburg im Breisgauwas my first being outside the house and on my own.</span> <span id="s126">I continued in Berlin.</span> <span id="s127">I went again the next summer to Heidelberg, which was perhaps the greatest experience in my university life.</span> <span id="s128">This was the Heidelberg ofwhere people teaching, like Jaspers and Anschutz and Ratbur and Gundolf, andyou name it, Tibelius.</span> <span id="s129">This was really the summit of German intellectual life, and it marked me very much.</span> <span id="s130">Even if I have been forced to separate slowly from the identification with the German peopleand you were, by the rejection which you feltalways more separating yourselves from this milieu, from this concept of belonging to the German people.</span> <span id="s131">This was, in any case, one of the great culminating points of my life, which I will never forget.</span> <span id="s132">And I owe very much to this cultural activity, to this expression of German culture, especially in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s133">I am not speaking of the other place, of course.</span> <span id="s134">Berlin at that time, of the Weimar Republic, was an enormously cultivated life, theater, operaI took part in all this fully, and I belonged to the Volksbuehne subscribers.</span> <span id="s135">I saw the most modern theater, plays, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s136">But I was very conscious aboutas I said, about the going‑down of the republic.</span> <span id="s137">When I was a student, I joined the Association of the Republican Students.</span> <span id="s138">And this was not an accident.</span> <span id="s139">In Baden, where both the University in Freiburg and in Heidelberg were located, there were still student elections.</span> <span id="s140">In Prussia, these elections for the student representation at universities had already been suppressed because the Nazis had gained large majorities all over.</span> <span id="s141">But in Baden it was still allowed.</span> <span id="s142">And I took part in the student elections in my first term, in my third term, made speeches, organized, cooperated at that time with peoplevery interesting people.</span> <span id="s143">Our patron was an old German professor, von Schuelze-Gevanitz.</span> <span id="s144">His son was later a consul in Zurichvery important consul, by the way.</span> <span id="s145">Schuelze-Gevenitz was an economist, a sociologist, a very wonderful human being.</span> <span id="s146">And one of the students with whom I cooperated then was a man who became very famous, had a very sad life, was Schulze Baeusen.</span> <span id="s147">He had just joined the democratic movement, coming from the Jungdeutsche Orden.</span> <span id="s148">He ended as a Communist, was one of the founders of the Rote Kapellethe Red Chapel, which he organized from the minister of defense residence.</span> <span id="s149">A fantastic fellow, I must say.</span> <span id="s150">We worked together in the elections in 1929.</span> <span id="s151">I would never have expected that he would go so far to the right and to be so true to his ideals.</span> <span id="s152">Anyhow, you see that I was involved in this.</span> <span id="s153">I was also involved in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s154">But therethis was 1930.</span> <span id="s155">There I already separated somehow and visited regularly the Zionist groups.</span> <span id="s156">I never joined the Zionist student groups, but I had many friends there, and even raveled on some of their excursions, winter excursions in the mountains.</span> <span id="s157">I joined them, was skiing with them together.</span> <span id="s158">And I was very much attracted by the Zionist –</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q. Let me interrupt for a second.</span> <span id="s160">Would it be fair to say that as of roughly this time, near 1930, you are still balancing in your mind the dual loyalty of being German and Jewish and trying to figure out for yourself what are the problems and where does one have to come down?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A. Well, I came certainlyI started certainly as a conscious German, but deeply offended as a Jew by what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s162">And was struggling first to defend it from inside, and then I saw more and more that this didn't work.</span> <span id="s163">And so my way of retreating from identification with the German nation became more and more clear.</span> <span id="s164">I think this is as far as I can get it, but I think this is the right description.</span> <span id="s165">And when I finished my studiesby the way, I would say that here, also, I am far from being only a jurist, only legacy.</span> <span id="s166">I was deeply involved in all kinds of other things.</span> <span id="s167">I followed especially the historians, Ongden, for instance, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s168">I followed philosophers, Jaspers, Spengler, was deeply involved in all kinds of other art, history, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">The ideal of universal Bildung, which I learned, so to speak, with the milk of my motherin the family, it was deeply working on me.</span> <span id="s170">And I took it over from my father, from my parents.</span> <span id="s171">And I was never one‑sided.</span> <span id="s172">Even in my whole Jewish career, you will find in my library sections on philosophy and history and on economy and you name it.</span> <span id="s173">And I used my university years to the full to get involved and educated in many other fields.</span> <span id="s174">Now, I finished my studies with the so‑called "Referendar" Exam.</span> <span id="s175">This is the first great examination after three, three and a half years of study.</span> <span id="s176">And I got a very good result, and was then named in the first days of 1933 as "Referendar," which is a kind of assistant to a judge, if you want.</span> <span id="s177">It's really the practical years, where you use what you have learned in a practical way.</span> <span id="s178">You spend time at different tribunals at various degrees in the administration, and as a lawyer, and so on.</span> <span id="s179">And I was in the first stage of this.</span> <span id="s180">I was at the Amtsgericht Weding.</span> <span id="s181">It's the largest tribunal of the first instance in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">And I wrote the judgments for the judge, which he signed.</span> <span id="s183">And active in all kinds of legal assistance, and so on, wrote what was asked for in this position.</span> <span id="s184">Then came Hitler to power the 30th of January, 1933.</span> <span id="s185">And this, of course, gave us a terrible shock.</span> <span id="s186">All the more</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q.</span> <span id="s188">You did not expect it?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s190">But here I would say, in the November elections, '32, you know, during that year, we hadI don't knowthree, four elections.</span> <span id="s191">In the November elections the Nazi party for the first time had lost more than a million of votes.</span> <span id="s192">And it looked at that moment that it was not absolutely necessary.</span> <span id="s193">And the whole thing that he got into the place as chancellor was an intrigue started by the people around the president, Hindenburg, because of some of the scandals in the eastern Prussia.</span> <span id="s194">And then Papen and the other reactionary politicians combined in order, in a great miscalculation, to bring about the coalition between the Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei and the Nazi parties, believing that they would dominate Hitler, which was, of course, ridiculous from the point of view of political judgment.</span> <span id="s195">When Hitler came to power, I was very soon convinced that this was a decisive point in the history of Germany, and I was very soon convinced that they would not give up power, and that this would lead to terrible persecutions for the Jews.</span> <span id="s196">I was a littlewe come back to thisa number of these Nazi manifestations, and so on, on the 30th of January, when he took power, and the 1st of April, and the Boycott, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">And I decided to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s198">We were under an illusion.</span> <span id="s199">We didn't know the world outside.</span> <span id="s200">We didn't realize how deeply the economic crisis had worked.</span> <span id="s201">We thought that first the younger generation should get out and then the older should follow.</span> <span id="s202">But the chance to build up a new existence for the younger generation was practically nil.</span> <span id="s203">I would have liked to go then to Palestine.</span> <span id="s204">The Zionist ideal, as I already said, worked very strongly on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q. Excuse me a second.</span> <span id="s206">Were there any specific events that precipitated your decision to leave, or was this just your general impression after Hitler had taken power –</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A. Well, I think it was the general understanding of what was happening.</span> <span id="s208">PracticallyI will just give you an example.</span> <span id="s209">On the 1st of April, when I was suspended as "Referendar," as the functionary of the tribunal, the same day my father was suspended as a lawyer, the same day my older sister, who was a teacher at the Lycee in Frankfurt am Main, was suspended as a teacher, my youngest sister, who was still in school, was thrown out from school.</span> <span id="s210">So out of a family of fivemy mother didn't exercise any profession as she was a good housewife at the time.</span> <span id="s211">She was a teacher by profession, and she took on again after my father didn't earn any money any more.</span> <span id="s212">She became again a teacher in the Jewish schools and was teaching then.</span> <span id="s213">The existence of four of five of our family was completely put upside down.</span> <span id="s214">This wasbut this accompanied my reason.</span> <span id="s215">Of course, if I wouldn't have been thrown out the 1st of April, maybe I would have taken longer to decide.</span> <span id="s216">Although I was only suspended, and I could have waited.</span> <span id="s217">But I knew this was a definite throwing‑out.</span> <span id="s218">So I didn't wait.</span> <span id="s219">I waited a little bit, because on the same 1st of April, in the evening, there was awe had rented a little house outside of Berlin because my father was not in good health at the time and the doctors had prescribed him he should be morein the fresh air and not running too much from one tribunal to the other.</span> <span id="s220">We had rented a house in the neighborhood of Berlin.</span> <span id="s221">And the eveningand we were the only Jews there, no other Jewish family at all.</span> <span id="s222">And at ten o'clock in the evening that day, there was what they called "Sprechchor," "Juda Verrecke, Juda Verrecke, Juden 'raus."</span> <span id="s223">This was an anti‑Semitic local group of the Nazi party which made itself felt for twenty minutes or so.</span> <span id="s224">My parents were in town, visited some friends.</span> <span id="s225">And I was alone in that house with my younger sister.</span> <span id="s226">I was in the bath.</span> <span id="s227">I felt like Marat.</span> <span id="s228">What will happen now?</span> <span id="s229">But I didn't make any movements, kept quiet, and after twenty minutes they disappeared.</span> <span id="s230">But it incited me not to leave immediately, to wait whether there would be other such demonstrations.</span> <span id="s231">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s232">And I left in the middle of May.</span> <span id="s233">I said I wanted to gowould have liked to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s234">I was very much attracted by it, but I knew you had to go to a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s235">Andwhich was very beautiful, but not for everybody.</span> <span id="s236">And knowing that I was very individualistic, I knew that this wouldn't work with me.</span> <span id="s237">Two of my best friends decided it, and it didn't work.</span> <span id="s238">They went, and they left afterwards, and finally ended in America.</span> <span id="s239">And my judgment was right.</span> <span id="s240">And as I was a quite good lawyer and very interested in, especially the philosophical side of law, what's called jurisprudence, theory of law and statethis comes and joins with my political interests, of course.</span> <span id="s241">I decided to continue my law studies.</span> <span id="s242">I went to Paris, and made my legal examinations again in Paris, Licenscie en Droitof the Sorbonne.</span> <span id="s243">And but here, something which happenedwhich I should perhaps say.</span> <span id="s244">A few days before I left, I got a message from one of the most famous professors of jurisprudence, of public law in the University of Berlin, Rudolf Schwent [ph].</span> <span id="s245">It so happened that in my second term he admitted me into his seminar.</span> <span id="s246">Why he did this, Ito this day I don't know, because ninety percent of the people who were there were postgraduate.</span> <span id="s247">Maybe he wanted a few youngsters who could make work andwhich he couldn't do.</span> <span id="s248">I don't know.</span> <span id="s249">In any case, I made a communication, andit was very interestingon "Die Wandlung des Rechtsstatsbegriffs".</span> <span id="s250">It's not an accident, by the way.</span> <span id="s251">"The changes in the concept of the state based on law."</span> <span id="s252">And this communication was an expose, as very well received.</span> <span id="s253">You know, it wasn't very original.</span> <span id="s254">When you are in this young stage of life, you have two choices: Either you get a very bright idea, or you use your working capacities and work very hard.</span> <span id="s255">And as I didn't have especially a bright idea, I worked very hard, and I found out where the notion of "Rechtsstat" appears the first time in the 18th Century literaturenot in Kant.</span> <span id="s256">I forgot even the name.</span> <span id="s257">I have it somewhere.</span> <span id="s258">And this made a great impression on Schmendt because this wasn't known.</span> <span id="s259">It's, by the way, not known because it's never published.</span> <span id="s260">And he somehow learned through a cousin of minemy name is not so frequentasked what I bewhat I become, and so on.</span> <span id="s261">And when he heard I am leaving for France, he asked me to come and see him.</span> <span id="s262">And for three hours, two and a half hours, he tried to persuade me not to leave.</span> <span id="s263">"Das kann doch nicht so bleiben."</span> <span id="s264">"This cannot remain like this."</span> <span id="s265">"You know that I am a German nationalist.</span> <span id="s266">But with these people this cannot last.</span> <span id="s267">This is an episode.</span> <span id="s268">In six months" Well, the young studentor whatever you call himwas more intelligent in this respect than the professor.</span> <span id="s269">I told him that I was convinced that this was the end, and I had to build up a new life and had to leave.</span> <span id="s270">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s271">This, by the way, Ialthough we were politically and even philosophically really on the extreme different positions, I am a great adherer ofthat the theory of Hans GenzI will come to it in a momentwho was just at the opposite end of theologictheopolitical concept.</span> <span id="s272">I nevertheless got a very warm memory of him.</span> <span id="s273">He is the only German who ever cared for me after I left.</span> <span id="s274">This is one of the things which nobody will ever tell you.</span> <span id="s275">I was twenty‑one years when I left.</span> <span id="s276">I had friends, I had comrades in school, I had mates in the University, I have studied in three universities, I knew hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s277">I was active in everal university student groups, and so on.</span> <span id="s278">Not one German ever wrote me a postcard after I left Germany.</span> <span id="s279">Not one German ever asked what I had become.</span> <span id="s280">With the exception of this professor.</span> <span id="s281">The lack of courage of the German intelligentsia was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s282">They didn't want to be involved.</span> <span id="s283">A Jew is outsidewas already something like treason, and an act of revolt against the system.</span> <span id="s284">So they didn't want to have anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s285">But what humanly this meansthat nobody ever asked for you, nobody ever sent you a postcard, nobody ever gave you a sign of lifeis something which I will never forget.</span> <span id="s286">And Schwendt wrote to me because he wanted to publish this communication I had made in a seminar.</span> <span id="s287">He thought it was deserving of publishing.</span> <span id="s288">And as it was not possiblethis is also important to knowto publishas a Jew to publish in Germany, you couldn't publish any more.</span> <span id="s289">He tried, but it was impossible, to publish it in Austria.</span> <span id="s290">This was before the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s291">He didn't succeed.</span> <span id="s292">But he tried at least.</span> <span id="s293">And I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s294">It's an interesting part of my story, but it is also a very sad part of my story.</span> <span id="s295">Now, I did go to Parisand we were allowed in Parisyou hadn't to go to the lectures in the universities.</span> <span id="s296">We could present ourselves to the examinations.</span> <span id="s297">And I passed the three examinations as soon as I could.</span> <span id="s298">And when I passed the second examination in the beginning of '34, probably spring, March probably, the French Barreau, the lawyers in Paris, got terribly scared of theI don't knowforty, maybe fifty, young Jewish refugees who took up the law in France.</span> <span id="s299">They were so scaredbut to a certain degree they were right.</span> <span id="s300">We were very good lawyers.</span> <span id="s301">We were a very good group.</span> <span id="s302">And only people who really meant and were involved and deeply involved in the profession went on with this.</span> <span id="s303">But after allthousands of lawyers in France.</span> <span id="s304">Forty or fifty Jewish lawyers would have disturbed their career?</span> <span id="s305">And they pushed through a law in the French Parliament which barred any foreigner from the exercise of the legal profession until ten years after naturalization.</span> <span id="s306">Now, as it took five years to get naturalized as a minimum, fifteen years meant you are out.</span> <span id="s307">And this was in the summer of '34 I was faced with what to do.</span> <span id="s308">And I decidedI wasn't reallyvery unclear there.</span> <span id="s309">In the summer there wasat the Sorbonneone of them who was the most eminent legal philosophers of our time gave three lectures in Paris at the Sorbonne.</span> <span id="s310">After the second lecture, I took my courage into my hands and went up to him and asked him for advice.</span> <span id="s311">I had corresponded with him as a chutzpadik young student twice.</span> <span id="s312">And he immediately remembered this, which I was very surprised.</span> <span id="s313">He wasevery great man wants to have pupils, you know, and is, of course, flattered.</span> <span id="s314">And said immediately, "Come to Geneva."</span> <span id="s315">So I said, "Well, it's not so easy, you know."</span> <span id="s316">I depended practically on thewhat an uncle of mine who was living in Holland gave me as a kind of contribution monthly to make my living.</span> <span id="s317">I was really proud that after a few months in Paris I got the first Bourse fellowship from the Alterad [ph] Universitaire Internationale.</span> <span id="s318">As a matter of fact, the only case where a man who had got a fellowship from the Alterad Universitaire Internationale, became later a president of the Alterad Universitaire Internationale.</span> <span id="s319">Anyhow, I told him, "It's not so easy."</span> <span id="s320">He said, "You can last four or five months?"</span> <span id="s321">I said, "Yes, I can."</span> <span id="s322">He said, "Come.</span> <span id="s323">And after four months, you had gotfour, five months, a good lawyer, know you, he get you a fellowship, and after a year, you renew the fellowship for the next two years.</span> <span id="s324">Nothing will happen to you."</span> <span id="s325">And this is more or less how it happened.</span> <span id="s326">I finished my examination.</span> <span id="s327">I went to Geneva.</span> <span id="s328">I got after four or five months a fellowship.</span> <span id="s329">Andwhich was renewed and I had stillI think thirteen months of fellowship, which, as a refugee, is an ideal thing.</span> <span id="s330">This is unheard of.</span> <span id="s331">You don't knowthat you don't have to be preoccupied with your future.</span> <span id="s332">So I was in Geneva, and here starts now the beginning of my career.</span> <span id="s333">I was not looking for any job.</span> <span id="s334">But while I was studying and doing postgraduate work, really, what it was, in GenevaStephen Wise and Nahum Goldman decided to create in the autumn of or the summer 1936 the World Jewish Congress.</span> <span id="s335">And they turned to three professors, whether they couldn't recommend to them a young international lawyer.</span> <span id="s336">Because the program of the World Jewish Congress at that time was two‑fold: on the one hand, to fight against Hitler; on the other hand, to support and defend the interests of the large Jewish communities of Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s337">Practically all disappeared todayin Poland, in Romaniathree and a half million in Poland, there were a million in Romania.</span> <span id="s338">And all these eastern European countries after the Treaty of Versailles had to accept the minority treaties and the protection of minorities under the guarantee of the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s339">There was a whole procedure for these things, and the Congress needed somebody who could write the briefs, and so on, and know the procedures.</span> <span id="s340">And those three professors to whom they turned, they all recommended me.</span> <span id="s341">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s342">Especially William Rappard (ph), who was the director of the institute, member of the Mandates Commission, old friend of Weizmann, of Goldman, and so on, and with whom I had never discussed Jewish affairs, but he knew apparently that I was Jewishly interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q. I am going to ask you more about the three professors, because they become laterat least a couple of thembecome important later, but they're about to run out of tape, so let's take a quick break right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A.</span> <span id="s345">But it's all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q. Yeah.</span> <span id="s347">I think we're</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A. I said too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q.</span> <span id="s350">It will take them a minute or two to put the second tape on.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A. Or is it too long, too detailed?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q. Dr. Riegner, you were telling us about the events that led to your being hired as a representative of the World Jewish Congress in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s355">This is eventoo much said.</span> <span id="s356">I was asked to become the man who deals with the international legal problems under the system of the minority treaties at the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s357">Now, as I told you, the three professors who were approached all recommended mewithout telling me, by the way.</span> <span id="s358">And then Goldman approached me.</span> <span id="s359">He was at the time a representative of the Jewish Agency at the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s360">And there was a mandate system, as you know, but Palestine was one of the mandates.</span> <span id="s361">And there was a permanent Mandate Commission which supervised the application of the mandate provisions by the mandatory powers, and he represented the Jewish agency vis-à-vis this organ in Geneva.</span> <span id="s362">And he knew as such Rappard, who was one of the professors.</span> <span id="s363">Rappard was a very fine, liberal personality.</span> <span id="s364">He was teaching in Harvard inI think in 1911, a Swiss professor, who became a friend of Wilson.</span> <span id="s365">And it was due to his relations with Wilson that the League of Nations came to Geneva in 1919.</span> <span id="s366">He was a very important personality in Swiss politics, became later a Member of Parliament.</span> <span id="s367">But he was very respected as an international figure, one of the great international figures the Swiss had at the time, was presiding at the International Labor Conference, was one of the representatives at the League of Nations, and so on.</span> <span id="s368">And he was the first director of the Mandates Commission, of the mandates section in the League of Nations secretariat, and became later a member of the mandates Commission, when he gave up this job and was a very great friend of the Jews and supported us against the White Paper of Britain in 1939, was a friend of great admiration of Dr. Weizmann.</span> <span id="s369">He represented the Geneva University at the laying of the founding stone of the Jerusalem University in 1925.</span> <span id="s370">He was there when Weizmann gave Balfour the great play on this occasion, and told us about it a number of times.</span> <span id="s371">Anyhow, he was areally a great liberal and a great friend of ours, and hein his institute, Internationalthe Graduate Institute of International Relations was one of the places which received refugees from Italy against the Mussolini Fascist state and supported them and allowed them to study there.</span> <span id="s372">And he did the same when the Nazis came to power.</span> <span id="s373">And we were in Geneva a large group of very gifted Jewish refugees and Italian refugees.</span> <span id="s374">And also, we had wonderful professors there: a great historian, Guglielmo Ferrero, the historian, was there as historian; there was Roepke, economist, a liberal economist who left Germany under Hitler; Weberg, who was an old pacifist who was teaching there; Kanzel who had taught in Jena; later, Rathenau, when he founded the University of Cologne and brought him to Cologne, was one of the first to be denaturalized by Hitler.</span> <span id="s375">And I could continue –And there were at the same time a good number of students of this type which were supported by fellowships which came partly from Rockefeller and partly from the Swiss government.</span> <span id="s376">And in any case, it was an extremely lively and interesting institute whichcreated really in the tradition of preparing people for positions in international life.</span> <span id="s377">Many went to various international organizations.</span> <span id="s378">Many went to the foreign services in their countries, and so on.</span> <span id="s379">Now, when Nahum Goldman approached me, as I said, I didn't look for any job.</span> <span id="s380">I was in a wonderful situation.</span> <span id="s381">And I really didn't want to change my outlook.</span> <span id="s382">I often said that I was very interested in public law, state law, state andnormally I would probably, without Hitler, have aimed at becoming a professor of jurisprudence at one of the universities.</span> <span id="s383">I hadn't given this up when I was in Geneva.</span> <span id="s384">But the group which Wise and Goldman headedand this I knew because it was a public knowledgewas the only groupJewish group which was really fighting Hitler.</span> <span id="s385">This is, without contest, the only group.</span> <span id="s386">They had already called three preparatory conferences, the first in 32, before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s387">In the summer of '32, six months before Hitler came to power, is the first international conference of the World Jewish Congressbefore it became a permanent organization.</span> <span id="s388">And there were two other such conferences, and they had gotten quite important publicity and it was known what they were trying.</span> <span id="s389">So I was aware that this was the only Jewish group.</span> <span id="s390">And it was so much in the line which I was educated and brought up, that I said to myself, "You cannot refuse it.</span> <span id="s391">I will give this group three, four years of my life."</span> <span id="s392">That was the idea.</span> <span id="s393">But I happen to tell you, I got stuck with the World Jewish Congress.</span> <span id="s394">I am there now for more than fifty‑five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q. Sometimes three or four years can be a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A. It's a long time of three, four years, yeah.</span> <span id="s397">And then, of course, I often ask myself, "Was it the right decision or not?"</span> <span id="s398">Of course, I often ask myself, especially when in such a position you have to do many things you don't want to do.</span> <span id="s399">You come here for the certain ideal.</span> <span id="s400">You come to do certain things politically, but you have to deal with this bureaucracy and this administration, and so on, which is not what stimulates you very much.</span> <span id="s401">So I often ask myself, "Was it right?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Should I have not continued?</span> <span id="s403">Should I" Well, of course, the fact that I remained is the answer to the question.</span> <span id="s404">I was fascinated by it and it didn't leave me.</span> <span id="s405">It didn'tthe characteristic ofthe most important aspect was that from time to time the subjects with which I had to deal changed completely.</span> <span id="s406">It was a fight against Hitler.</span> <span id="s407">There was the rescue effort in the war.</span> <span id="s408">There was the rehabilitation of Jewish communities and the fight for Israel after the war.</span> <span id="s409">There was the problem of North African Jewry, who are completely outside of our normal considerations, which came then.</span> <span id="s410">And so a completely different aspect followed, the one, the others, and which all deserved support and great concentration of labor.</span> <span id="s411">And so I came from one to the others and couldn't stop.</span> <span id="s412">On the other hand, I must havecould say, also, it gave me great opportunities even in the field in which I was educated.</span> <span id="s413">I worked with great enthusiasm as a representative of the World Jewish Congress at the United Nations and the Human Rights Commission, and so on, in the efforts for the elaboration of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.</span> <span id="s414">I contributed to some of the formulations.</span> <span id="s415">I worked on the formulation of the covenants on human rights, the two covenants, internationalon the international convention against racial discrimination, on the conventions of the INO and of the UNESCO, discrimination in occupation and discrimination in education.</span> <span id="s416">I was part of the effort to redefine the whole new humanitarian law.</span> <span id="s417">I participated in Stockholm in the International Red Cross Conference, and it was preparedI was an observer and participant in the international conferences on the new international law, the Red Cross law, in 1949 in Geneva.</span> <span id="s418">I participated in the new efforts in the seventies.</span> <span id="s419">I presided at a commission of fifty international organizations to formulate a united approach to the revision in the new International Red Cross protocols, which were later adopted.</span> <span id="s420">And so I had hundreds ofwhat shall I sayoccasions to use my knowledge and my tradition.</span> <span id="s421">But it was, of course, not the center.</span> <span id="s422">It was one of the things which I did.</span> <span id="s423">But I must have found sufficient satisfaction to continue, and, in fact, the work gave the answer to my question, which doesn't say that I don't regret that I haven't written this or that book which I wasalways been dreaming of.</span> <span id="s424">Now, I said I couldn't refuse this, I said.</span> <span id="s425">And I accepted and gave up my career.</span> <span id="s426">And then I am now for fifty‑five years in this role.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q. Well, perhaps you could tell us a bit more about your impressions of Stephen Wise and Nahum Goldman as you encountered them in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A. Well, let me put it this way: In the summer, Nahum Goldman hadn't to offer me anything.</span> <span id="s429">He just found out whether I was ready to.</span> <span id="s430">And I didn't commit myself eithermyself, either.</span> <span id="s431">Because he hadn't tohe couldn't know anything.</span> <span id="s432">The organization had first to be established, and then they had to establish the executive, and then they could act concretely.</span> <span id="s433">So he asked me, though, to write for him a brief, wanted to see how I would do it.</span> <span id="s434">And he gave me some file, and asked me, "Perhaps you can write a memorandum about this, how you would put it."</span> <span id="s435">Which I did, and which must have been satisfactory.</span> <span id="s436">And we left that summer.</span> <span id="s437">And my family was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s438">And we met usually in the summer on the invitation of my uncle in Holland.</span> <span id="s439">And we went and spent two weeks in Noordwijk aan Zee, a very nice place, where I met my family.</span> <span id="s440">And one day I got a telegram from Nahum: "Come back immediately.</span> <span id="s441">We need you for the preparation of the Congress."</span> <span id="s442">Not a permanent offer, butso I took the next train and spent I think thirty‑three hours in thestill wooden compartment in the old European trains, and arrived in Geneva, where Goldman wasn'the wasn't on board.</span> <span id="s443">And there was another chaotic bureau which gave me an enormous dossier and asked me to write a brief, a memorandum for the assembly, the first World Jewish Congress assembly, which was to meet in a week's time.</span> <span id="s444">And they wanted me to give for the participants a memooutlining what policy, in my opinion, we should continue.</span> <span id="s445">It was on the German Jewish refugee problem, of which I was, of course, very much aware.</span> <span id="s446">But that doesn't mean I had specially studied these things from a legal point of view.</span> <span id="s447">And I prepared fresh from vacation in a few days a verya very, very good paper, which I used myself years later to look up.</span> <span id="s448">When I finished it, they asked me to write two other papers about some other problems, the problem of Danzig, the problem of Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s449">And then the Congress started.</span> <span id="s450">And nobody talked to me, and I was just there.</span> <span id="s451">And so there was great chaos, as always in such things, and Ias a very orderly person, I tried to make some order in helping in the secretariat, and didn't mind whetherto dothey give us small things and big things, butthey made me secretary of two great commissions, one on the German Jewish problem and one on the minority treaties and problem with international protection.</span> <span id="s452">And there I saw for the first time Wise and Goldman in action.</span> <span id="s453">Now, Wise was the Good great moral figure of the movement, a fantastic orator, a wonderful voice.</span> <span id="s454">I know people who went to his sermons only to followto learn the Englishthe beauty of his English.</span> <span id="s455">He was really a fighter not only for the Jews but for all great human causes.</span> <span id="s456">It's not an accident he supported the movement against child workwhat you call it?</span> <span id="s457">\</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q. Child labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A. Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q. Child labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s462">Child labor.</span> <span id="s463">He was supporting the women's movement.</span> <span id="s464">He was supporting the Czech independence movement.</span> <span id="s465">He was supporting the Greek.</span> <span id="s466">He was reallyand the Negro.</span> <span id="s467">He was very, very active in fighting the fight for the equalization of the Negrothe status of the Negro in this country.</span> <span id="s468">He was really the great liberal, moral figure in the movement, and he was the first to have started the resistance against Hitler.</span> <span id="s469">When I was still in Germany, I knewhe made headlines in the Nazi press.</span> <span id="s470">You can find a number ofwhich I still saw in Germany.</span> <span id="s471">They called him the "Rabbiner Wiese."</span> <span id="s472">Wiese, not Wise.</span> <span id="s473">Wiese.</span> <span id="s474">He was really public enemy number one for them.</span> <span id="s475">Both in Goebbel's Angriff and Voelkischer Beobachter there were numerous cases where he made the headline on the first page.</span> <span id="s476">And I knew this.</span> <span id="s477">I had seen it.</span> <span id="s478">This was one of the reasons that I saw that he was really the one who was fighting against them.</span> <span id="s479">And he remained also a great moral figure.</span> <span id="s480">He never gave up the fight, even in the worst times.</span> <span id="s481">He was a man whoof unusual patience, open to every Jew who had some complaint.</span> <span id="s482">He was sometimes criticized that he wasted his time in doing this instead of concentrating onbut he couldn't.</span> <span id="s483">He lovednot the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s484">He loved every Jew.</span> <span id="s485">It's something which youyou don't find today anymore in this way, very rarely it is.</span> <span id="s486">He was very courageous.</span> <span id="s487">You know that he was a liberal rabbi, although in the end he came a little back, moderated some of his liberal convictions.</span> <span id="s488">I saw him officiate with a kippah inat marriages, and so on, which in earlier days he didn't do.</span> <span id="s489">It was a whole Hebraization process, and so on, in the reform movement.</span> <span id="s490">But he was, on the other hand, a man who had been the first to go to the Zionist Congress in 1989in '98 sic.</span> <span id="s491">[Dr. Riegner means 1897] He quoted in one of the great speeches, the last speech he made to the Congress in '48, the year before he died, in the Montreal Assembly, when he recalled this encounter with Herzl, six weeks after the state was founded.</span> <span id="s492">And he quoted Herzl: "I will not see the Jewish state, but you will see the Jewish state," and so on.</span> <span id="s493">It was unbelievable when he quoted this.</span> <span id="s494">He was not a great intellectual.</span> <span id="s495">He was a great moral figure.</span> <span id="s496">The intellectual was Nahum Goldman, absolutely brilliant.</span> <span id="s497">And one of the greatest speeches he ever made was a speech at the opening of the assembly in 1936.</span> <span id="s498">You read it todayalthough it was even also a little bit censored because he couldn'tyou had to be in some ways careful with regard to certain diplomatic necessities.</span> <span id="s499">I finally formulated some of the corrections.</span> <span id="s500">But this is a great speech.</span> <span id="s501">So there he came out and made a formidable impression on the audience.</span> <span id="s502">He was, as I said, brilliant.</span> <span id="s503">And we've come to the problems of rescue, and so on.</span> <span id="s504">We'll have to come back to some of these aspects.</span> <span id="s505">He saw the essential.</span> <span id="s506">He could formulate the essential in very short sentences, but what he then extracted was really the essence.</span> <span id="s507">And he hadI believe opinions that was laterhe was a maverick.</span> <span id="s508">He was provoking in the last years of his lifeintentionally in order to get reaction and to educate the people like that.</span> <span id="s509">The old rabbis of oldhe wanted to have this impact on the people, that they should think.</span> <span id="s510">But he was a very highly intelligent man, very brilliant.</span> <span id="s511">I have once written a piece on the occasion of the first Jahrzeit, where I called him the Renaissance Jew, a new Renaissance man.</span> <span id="s512">Renaissance, in every respect.</span> <span id="s513">A Renaissance personality, and was all what the Renaissance Mensch represented, and he wasopen and extremely wide interest, and so on.</span> <span id="s514">And on the other hand, a man of the Jewish Renaissance, of course, in the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s515">He was the brain, and Wise was the conscience.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q.</span> <span id="s517">You mentioned so far that you hadn't yet agreed to take a permanent job.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q.</span> <span id="s520">When did you realize</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A. Well, as a matter of factyeah.</span> <span id="s522">I will tell you the story, too.</span> <span id="s523">And as a matter of fact, I helped in all kinds of things during the assembly, and I was taken inthere wasthis I felt, there was a great movement born.</span> <span id="s524">And the people were quite impressive people.</span> <span id="s525">I mean, they are all dead today.</span> <span id="s526">And nobody knows about them.</span> <span id="s527">But it is astonishing how many great characters came to the movement and each of them had a history of himself.</span> <span id="s528">It's difficult now to remember them.</span> <span id="s529">I spoke at the 50th anniversary of the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, and I named a few of them.</span> <span id="s530">A manRabbi Rubensteiner Willner, was a member of Parliament, with the Polish Parliament, very great Orthodox Jew, a very great personality.</span> <span id="s531">Take a manAnselm ReichReich and Aldi Tartakover.</span> <span id="s532">They came from the labor movement.</span> <span id="s533">Reichs pronounced in theor read in the Congress of 1936 on behalf of the whole Polish delegation a declaration accusing the Polish government.</span> <span id="s534">This had never happened before.</span> <span id="s535">Usually in Zionist Congresses, the Hungarians accuse the Poles, and the Czechs the Romanians, and so on, but this isdistributed roles.</span> <span id="s536">But here was a man of enormous courage to do it himself for the whole Polish delegation.</span> <span id="s537">Takethere were so many.</span> <span id="s538">Iit's veryreally very difficult to name them today.</span> <span id="s539">The old people from Romania.</span> <span id="s540">Thethere were thefrom all the Baltic states, frombut the Congress, the personalities was very, very impressive.</span> <span id="s541">But on the other hand, Western Europe was very underrepresented, and America was underrepresented, and we didn't succeed at the time to really have the majority of the Western European communities.</span> <span id="s542">The Bungdorf (ph) deputies of England decided with a vote of six, a majority of six, to refuse the cooperation of the Doily (ph).</span> <span id="s543">And this was, of course, a great tragedy.</span> <span id="s544">But here was a colossal potential.</span> <span id="s545">And theyI think weit's unbelievable today that the unit of the Jewish people and the joint action of Jews is such a normal thing, that we have established it, how this was bitterly fought in the three years before the World War II started.</span> <span id="s546">And there the war has completely changed the attitude of the Jews.</span> <span id="s547">And the Jews in the Western countries followed their government.</span> <span id="s548">They followed the policies, the wrong policies of their government, the appeasement policies of their government, and didn't stand up, and here was one of the great lost opportunities.</span> <span id="s549">I don't know whether we could have changed the tragedy, the events.</span> <span id="s550">But at least we should haveshould have tried.</span> <span id="s551">And while today, even a young youth doesn't understand it, this opposition, and the denouncing of the people who had the courage to stand up and preach for the united Jewish approach and the common fight against Hitler.</span> <span id="s552">Finally, when the Congress was over, the next day the executive met, which had been elected the day before.</span> <span id="s553">And there, the decisions on offices, and so on, came up.</span> <span id="s554">There Nahum Goldman proposed my being selected for the Geneva office.</span> <span id="s555">And very interesting: There was great opposition.</span> <span id="s556">All the people with whom I became very friendly later, other Jewsthe opposition was, "But he doesn't speak Yiddish."</span> <span id="s557">And Nahum Goldman apparentlyI wasn't at the meeting.</span> <span id="s558">I was told laterhe said, "Well, I need him at the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s559">There they don't speak Yiddish, either.</span> <span id="s560">They speak French.</span> <span id="s561">They speak English.</span> <span id="s562">And this he does."</span> <span id="s563">But this didn't make anyanyany impressionand then the only German Jew who was there in the new, elected executive was Georg Bernhardt.</span> <span id="s564">Georg Bernhardt was a former member of the Reichstag, editor‑in‑chief of the Voelkischer Zeitung, which was one of the great German, liberal newspapers.</span> <span id="s565">He was a professor at the high commercial school, a university in Berlin.</span> <span id="s566">He had a number of other high positions.</span> <span id="s567">And he was the leader of the German Jewish immigration at that time in Paris, editor of the Pariser Tageblatt, and the uncontested president of the German Jewish immigrant society.</span> <span id="s568">And he stood up, and saidas I was told laterhe said, "But he comes from a very, very, very good Jewish family."</span> <span id="s569">Now, that did it.</span> <span id="s570">There was no argument.</span> <span id="s571">Yiddish you can learn, but a good family, you can'tyou must have, or you don't have.</span> <span id="s572">And apparently this convinced the people.</span> <span id="s573">Very funny, but so it happened.</span> <span id="s574">So I entered the office on the 1st of September, I think, 1936, in an office which didn't exist really, which I had to create.</span> <span id="s575">And with no budget, with a lot of debts.</span> <span id="s576">And instead the salary which I got was just a hundred francs more than I had as a studentpostgraduate student without having any obligations.</span> <span id="s577">And not only this, but all these great problems, financial problems, andand came the end of the month, I had sometimes to advance the money for the secretary, and the postage, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s578">And this hasn't changed.</span> <span id="s579">It has only grown in figures.</span> <span id="s580">They were smaller amounts, and now it's much higher amounts.</span> <span id="s581">And so I came in.</span> <span id="s582">Andbut in reality, whenwhile I was selected because of my legal knowledge, and so on, I was involved in the whole movement immediately, and I took as much part in the anti‑German fight as in anything else.</span> <span id="s583">And I must say, I said I didn't regret the fifty‑five years.</span> <span id="s584">But there is, of course, tne factor, also, which I should mention.</span> <span id="s585">Nahum Goldman was a fantastic chief, generous andas I said, he saw the essential.</span> <span id="s586">He did leave you enormous freedom.</span> <span id="s587">He discussed with you the line, but not every comma and point.</span> <span id="s588">He would discuss with you the general ideas.</span> <span id="s589">He would agree with you.</span> <span id="s590">He would make here and there a comment, "Perhaps this is too strong," "Perhaps this is too weak."</span> <span id="s591">And he would leave it to you.</span> <span id="s592">And he would leave you an enormous amount of freedom in the execution of your function and give you the feeling of participation.</span> <span id="s593">He never considered me as an employee.</span> <span id="s594">There was always the feeling of equality.</span> <span id="s595">He gave in theand I was what?</span> <span id="s596">about twenty‑five years secretary general, first coordinator, and secretary general of the Congress.</span> <span id="s597">I gave the staff, the higher staff a position of codecision in the Congress.</span> <span id="s598">And because they knew, because they were underpaid, because they had something to contribute, and they shouldn't take the layman's opinion.</span> <span id="s599">They should contribute to it, and there should be codecision.</span> <span id="s600">And Nahum Goldman understood this very well.</span> <span id="s601">And this, of course, facilitated enormously my work.</span> <span id="s602">I really felt that I have contributed.</span> <span id="s603">Many things which have gone under the name of Goldman came in fact from me.</span> <span id="s604">I never resented that.</span> <span id="s605">We were working on a joint project, a joint work.</span> <span id="s606">And, therefore, this fact.</span> <span id="s607">I am not saying that I hadn't a complaint.</span> <span id="s608">A complaint was, on the one hand, we were all very badly paid.</span> <span id="s609">We are really idealistic workers, but we didn'tI often saidonce Israel Sieff, the great philanthropist, the Zionist in England, said to me, "You could become any moment administrator director of one of my 122 stores in England."</span> <span id="s610">I said to him, "This is very nice, the nicest thing."</span> <span id="s611">These stores, each of them, had more than a million poundshow do you say?</span> <span id="s612">Umsatzturnover, yeah.</span> <span id="s613">So thereat the time, I think 132 million pounds, which was not bad.</span> <span id="s614">And I said, "Israel, it's very nice what you said to me.</span> <span id="s615">It's perhaps the nicest thing.</span> <span id="s616">But if I wanted to make money, I would have become a banker, not a secretary of the World Jewish Congress."</span> <span id="s617">And this is it.</span> <span id="s618">This was real idealism.</span> <span id="s619">And I include practically all my colleagues in this.</span> <span id="s620">We all worked for the cause, not for the money.</span> <span id="s621">And we were deeply involved in the cause.</span> <span id="s622">We lived it and we developed it.</span> <span id="s623">It didn't exist as a scheme.</span> <span id="s624">And this was, of course, very attractive, and, therefore, I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q. Things must have changed rather radically for you when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s626">I mean, here you wereyou were hired partly because of your legal expertise, your international legal problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q.</span> <span id="s629">Now there was no legality.</span> <span id="s630">There was no effective League of Nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A. On the contrary.</span> <span id="s632">You had to learn during the war that everything which is legal is no good, and everything which is not legal has to be done.</span> <span id="s633">And the complete confusion of what is</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q.</span> <span id="s635">How did you decide to do what you ended up doing, which was simplywell, which was, among other things, to amass as much information as possible about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A. Now, this wasbecamethis developed very naturally.</span> <span id="s637">The first days in the war we decided we hadwe have to dealthere was an emergency, and the greatthe great danger is for the whole Jewish world.</span> <span id="s638">One of the terrible things [for] which I will never forgive myselfwas the last days before the war broke out, there was a Zionist Congress in Geneva.</span> <span id="s639">And everybody wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s640">And I helped hundreds of people to get transit visas to get home.</span> <span id="s641">Because I was the only one who had the relations with several of the consulates.</span> <span id="s642">And the French consulateone day worked the whole shabbat to get 150 passports or whatstamped through.</span> <span id="s643">And afterwards, I said, "What have you done?"</span> <span id="s644">But, of course, nobody could foresee.</span> <span id="s645">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">But on the third day of the war, we, for instance, communicated to the International Committee of the Red Cross, that we had organized ourselves in a special little committee in which we are dealing with the worldwith the war affairs, and that we wanted to be in contact with them, and we were certainly the first to take thisthis initiative.</span> <span id="s647">We establishedand this wasat that time not yet so important, but later it became more important.</span> <span id="s648">This committee, which was called a Relief Committee for the War‑Stricken Jewish Populationand it was abbreviated RELICO, which could be a Relief Congress or Relief Committee, whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s649">It helped us to establish relations with the occupied territories.</span> <span id="s650">We couldn't work under the name of the Congress.</span> <span id="s651">The Congress was clearly an anti‑German, anti‑Nazi movement, and in order not to endanger the people, we used fromfrom that September on, this second name.</span> <span id="s652">For several years I used practically only this name.</span> <span id="s653">The other side was diplomaticoh, yesto America and England.</span> <span id="s654">And when the war got to its end, I took out the "World Jewish Congress" again and started writing on this paper.</span> <span id="s655">And this was, of course, very helpful.</span> <span id="s656">I mean, this was very important.</span> <span id="s657">And the situationI have recentlyI have it somewhere here, but in my</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q. Luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A.</span> <span id="s660">In my luggage.</span> <span id="s661">Statistics.</span> <span id="s662">How we became active in all kinds of services which nobody could render but we in Geneva, in a neutral country.</span> <span id="s663">We became a little Red Cross, a little Jewish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s664">We transmitted messages from one to the otherthousands, not a few.</span> <span id="s665">In the thousands.</span> <span id="s666">In the tens of thousands.</span> <span id="s667">We made inquiries where people are.</span> <span id="s668">And wewe transmitted money, soto relatives, to friends, and so on.</span> <span id="s669">There were hundreds of such initiatives.</span> <span id="s670">I have a statistic infor certain months, which is interesting.</span> <span id="s671">We had an enormous amount of purely humanitarian activities which developed by themselves.</span> <span id="s672">And you couldn't stop.</span> <span id="s673">You couldn't say "I won't do it."</span> <span id="s674">That wasn't possible, humanely not possible.</span> <span id="s675">And I have in my files letters where I plead with New York, "You cannot stop this here.</span> <span id="s676">There is so much human hope and need involved."</span> <span id="s677">And Nahum Goldman left Geneva inin May 1940, before the downfall of France.</span> <span id="s678">He smelled it.</span> <span id="s679">He knew what he was doing.</span> <span id="s680">He said, of course, he would come back, and he never came back.</span> <span id="s681">But he also knew thathe was right, that he couldn't have done in Geneva political actions.</span> <span id="s682">He was right to decide to go to America.</span> <span id="s683">And then there was a moment where New York wanted to close the Geneva office.</span> <span id="s684">And there is a very violent correspondence between New York and me.</span> <span id="s685">And I just refused to close.</span> <span id="s686">I was right.</span> <span id="s687">They had great financial difficulties.</span> <span id="s688">Without Goldman, they thought, well, whatwhatthis is how our polling (??)</span> <span id="s689">and thisGeneva.</span> <span id="s690">And I pleaded.</span> <span id="s691">And the statistic which I have taken from some of these correspondenceI just refused.</span> <span id="s692">As a matter of fact, in the terriblevielleicht [perhaps]one of the greatest things which I have done, one of the best things which I didin the terrible situation of the summer of 1940and you cannot imagine what that meant, the downfall of France, for all of us.</span> <span id="s693">This was really thepractically the end.</span> <span id="s694">And in Geneva, in Switzerland, itFascist Italy, Austria, the Nazi Germany, all Nazi, now France, Nazi.</span> <span id="s695">Where was hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q. And you were surrounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A.</span> <span id="s698">We were completely surrounded.</span> <span id="s699">You couldn't get out normalthere wasthen the so‑called non-occupied part of France, a little piece where you could get out, butthis was really the most difficult.</span> <span id="s700">And there was complete chaos and mental despair.</span> <span id="s701">And the people didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s702">They went to Zurich.</span> <span id="s703">People came to Geneva.</span> <span id="s704">Geneva people came to Zurich.</span> <span id="s705">In the offices was terrible confusion.</span> <span id="s706">What do you do?</span> <span id="s707">What can we do?</span> <span id="s708">And I decided with one of my colleagues, Fritz Uhlmann, who was in the agency, we leave the Geneva offices and go on vacation in the mountains and not be infected by this terrible depression.</span> <span id="s709">We have to keep our minds open.</span> <span id="s710">We have decided to remain.</span> <span id="s711">We have to stay where we are.</span> <span id="s712">This is more important than anything else.</span> <span id="s713">There have to be some offices who will remain and will be responsible for whatever still can be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q.</span> <span id="s715">When you thought of keeping that office open, was your consideration primarily in terms of helping the people who needed help, or finding a place where –</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A. Whatever.</span> <span id="s717">We saw that the information was essential for that.</span> <span id="s718">And we saw that we could do still very many things for the people inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q.</span> <span id="s720">So it was both?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A. Both.</span> <span id="s722">Both.</span> <span id="s723">Both.</span> <span id="s724">And we just wanted to keep our heads free from the confusion and deterioration of the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s725">The atmosphere was terrible.</span> <span id="s726">People wanted to run away, and so on.</span> <span id="s727">I must say, Wise sent me in August, '40, a visa to America, one of the first emergency visas, which shows my personal relationship with Wise.</span> <span id="s728">He sent it also to Gugenheim, who didn't take it, and to one or two other people.</span> <span id="s729">But II had still a German passport at the time.</span> <span id="s730">And I put it in the passport and left it in the passport.</span> <span id="s731">I didn't have any intention.</span> <span id="s732">On the contrary.</span> <span id="s733">When Nahum Goldman left, we foresaw all kinds of it.</span> <span id="s734">He bought me a Bolivian passport, which was from the real consul of Bolivia.</span> <span id="s735">I neverthis was for an emergency.</span> <span id="s736">The situation was so frightening and so unclear, I had at my home ina packed Rucksack, with shoes, and so on, to go into the mountains, if necessary, to disappear, that the World Jewish Congress office would bein case of invasion or whatthe first to be looked after was clear to me.</span> <span id="s737">I mean, the fact that this Rucksack was packed and thesome of the things which you need when you are on your own shows you the atmosphere in which you were.</span> <span id="s738">Desperate.</span> <span id="s739">And we were really desperate.</span> <span id="s740">And I will tell you another story.</span> <span id="s741">We were in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s742">It was the center of espionage.</span> <span id="s743">Don't forget this, either.</span> <span id="s744">One of my best friends was a French vice‑consul.</span> <span id="s745">When I cameI had spent summer vacation inpartly in Holland and partly with him in Britanny, where his family had very close friends really.</span> <span id="s746">He was married to a Jewish girl, Russian Jewish girl, and we were very close.</span> <span id="s747">Not onlythe whole group of young people.</span> <span id="s748">And I remember the second day, his wife was still at theon the vacation, hadn't come back.</span> <span id="s749">And we ate in the evening together.</span> <span id="s750">He had a little car.</span> <span id="s751">I didn't.</span> <span id="s752">And he came to fetch me.</span> <span id="s753">I think must have been the 2nd or 3rd of September of '39.</span> <span id="s754">And he said, "Let's go to this and this restaurant, but I have to do two other things before."</span> <span id="s755">And he said, "And you can look at it."</span> <span id="s756">And he stops before a house, takes out the mail from one of the boites postales, the boxes, and puts it in his pocket and takes out of his pocket another from the day before.</span> <span id="s757">And so he did that two or three places.</span> <span id="s758">These were German officials, I think, journalists and officials at the international labor office, who were controlled by the French secret services.</span> <span id="s759">And he showed it to me, that I should know in what situation we were.</span> <span id="s760">And I never forgot this.</span> <span id="s761">I mean, I laughed.</span> <span id="s762">I smiled when I saw what the situation was.</span> <span id="s763">It was not gemuetlich, I tell you.</span> <span id="s764">And became always less gemuetlich.</span> <span id="s765">Now, so we moved in this field slowly from one to thethen, of course, when terrible things happened, we organized ourselves to be involved and to be able to report.</span> <span id="s766">There were no direct communications of any kind.</span> <span id="s767">So we kept the relations, the correspondence with the Jewish community as long as we could.</span> <span id="s768">We subscribed to all the Jewish newspapers.</span> <span id="s769">I subscribed to all the official gazettes.</span> <span id="s770">I had I think twenty‑three official gazettes, which regularlyyou can see them I think now in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s771">I gave it to Yad Vashem, or the institute gave it to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s772">I did this for the Institute of Jewish Affairs, which since '40 was here in New York.</span> <span id="s773">And we translated those into one of the languages that the Jews would understand, German, or French, English.</span> <span id="s774">I established a whole mechanism how to get information.</span> <span id="s775">And I was helped by, for instance, the League of Nations library.</span> <span id="s776">There was a man whom I knew very well, and so on, and he helped us.</span> <span id="s777">He knew what we were doing and was a friend.</span> <span id="s778">So I could take photocopies of some of these official gazettes, and we examined them each time and we found theseall these anti‑Jewish legislations and decrees.</span> <span id="s779">And I made the filesI don't know whether you have ever seen themat least offor Romania and for France and for Germany and for General Gouvernement, for Boehmen und Maehren, for Slovakia, and for Italy, and for thesome of the especially established territories like Alsace‑Lorraine or the Baltics where there was also amilitary government, and so on.</span> <span id="s780">With the help of some of the League of Nations officials then with the help of the book shop, theyI subscribed, and I was "Monsieur Mondial," who got theseall kinds ofwe really organized ourselves in order to be able to.</span> <span id="s781">And you know, you can obtain a lot of information on this.</span> <span id="s782">Especiallythere wereunder Slovakian file, I think there were at least 150 official decrees and communications which I had sent to New York and to London.</span> <span id="s783">They got it all.</span> <span id="s784">So we organized ourselves in order to be able to inform.</span> <span id="s785">This was certainly the most important thing.</span> <span id="s786">I feltwe feltand I include Gugenheim, for instance.</span> <span id="s787">We felt that we were encircled, and political decisions would have to be made outside.</span> <span id="s788">Our judgment was not sufficiently independent.</span> <span id="s789">This, we accepted from that.</span> <span id="s790">That doesn't mean we shouldn't make proposals.</span> <span id="s791">We made a lot of proposals.</span> <span id="s792">And our judgment was often better than that of the people who were outside.</span> <span id="s793">I am not contesting that.</span> <span id="s794">But we never felt in these three years or four fromI am speaking the years from '40 onthat the decisions had to be made in New York and London.</span> <span id="s795">And, therefore, my most important function was to report.</span> <span id="s796">This was developed very, veryit came from a political understanding of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q.</span> <span id="s798">You can't make decisions unless you have good information?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s800">Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s801">Now, I said, of course, we had reports from communities, and then we had reports from individuals.</span> <span id="s802">Some people appeared, disappeared.</span> <span id="s803">You know, some wonderful figures.</span> <span id="s804">There was aa Dutchman, he was shot laterNijkeirk, wonderful man.</span> <span id="s805">He was a young Dutch who lived in Belgium and organized the Jewish youth and tried toyou may have heard the name.</span> <span id="s806">Maybe it's not on there.</span> <span id="s807">He was later arrested and put before a tribunal and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q. Let me stop you there, because the tape is going to run out.</span> <span id="s809">I'm going to want to ask you on the next tape when you started to collect information from people as well as from published sources, and when</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A.</span> <span id="s811">This I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s812">This cameyou justyou couldn't get enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A. On the contrary.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q.</span> <span id="s816">We can talk about some of the people then, but that will have to be on the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q. Maybe they will give us some lunch now.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s820">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q.</span> <span id="s823">If you don't remember exactly when you started to get it, that's fine, but let's talk about the people whofrom whom you got information.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s825">No.</span> <span id="s826">I spoke about thisthis Dutch Jew in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A. Whichthis is the type of personsI meanthere came, of course, others, but he was one of the finest II remember.</span> <span id="s829">And he came by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A. Of course, he knew that wethere was the center, and we did things.</span> <span id="s832">And he came to Lichtheim, and he came to me, andthere were all kinds of thesethere was aI had mentioned already Uhlmann, I think, with whom I went on vacation to save</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A.to save thethe office, and I saved themyou know, the offices.</span> <span id="s835">And we came back.</span> <span id="s836">It was quiet and functioned.</span> <span id="s837">And nobody wanted to run away anymore.</span> <span id="s838">Now, it was a terrible morale breakdown, of course.</span> <span id="s839">And one couldn't blame them.</span> <span id="s840">This was really a world which was falling to pieces.</span> <span id="s841">But you had to have the strength of character thatokay, this is a volcanic eruption.</span> <span id="s842">We have to wait until it's over.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q.</span> <span id="s844">There was, after all, a real chance that Switzerland could have been invaded.</span> <span id="s845">They had considered it?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A. Sure.</span> <span id="s847">I told you, I had the packed Rucksack.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A. And I had the Bolivian passport, which I probably never could use, but anyhowwhatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q. Do you want to tell us when(Discussion with someone off‑camera.)</span> <span id="s851">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s852">I didn't realize.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A.</span> <span id="s854">Now we can start.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q. We're on.</span> <span id="s856">Dr. Riegner, tell us more about some of the people who came in to you with information that you proceeded then to send out in your reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A. Now, I had spoke about this Dutchman.</span> <span id="s858">I will give you another example.</span> <span id="s859">All are not soit's quite some time ago.</span> <span id="s860">And my memory is not bad, but it has also lacunae.</span> <span id="s861">There is another one, the Dutchmana Danishman.</span> <span id="s862">You may know his name because there was recentlya book was published about him which is –</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q. Rottenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A. Yeah, Rottenberg.</span> <span id="s865">Rottenbergyou know, inextraordinary times produce extraordinary people.</span> <span id="s866">This I have seen time and again.</span> <span id="s867">Rottenberg was a Danish Jew, who suddenly appeared in our officesboth Lichtheim and mine.</span> <span id="s868">We had on the same floor, the offices.</span> <span id="s869">You should know the samein the same building and the same floor.</span> <span id="s870">We didn't know how he came, why he came.</span> <span id="s871">We didn't know where he went.</span> <span id="s872">We found out that he hadfirst of all, you are very suspiciousa Jew, a Danish Jew who can travel in Europe.</span> <span id="s873">You know that you can trust him?</span> <span id="s874">He is a spy?</span> <span id="s875">Who knows?</span> <span id="s876">We find outwe found out that he was somehow protected by the military establishment, defense.</span> <span id="s877">I was very suspicious at the beginning.</span> <span id="s878">But the man came with highly interesting information.</span> <span id="s879">I definitely remember that he gave us the first information on the administration of the Reichsbahn, of the German railways, sending the bills for the deportation of the Jews from Berlin to Riga and Lodz to the Jewish community in Berlin.</span> <span id="s880">They asked that the Jewish community should pay for the transportation of the deportation.</span> <span id="s881">For me this was the height of chutzpa which the Germans had.</span> <span id="s882">I was absolutely flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s883">And I reported this, of course.</span> <span id="s884">The story isyou can read it now in the book by a Danish Jew who heard me mention Rottenberg in one of my lectures at the Nahum Goldman fellowship.</span> <span id="s885">And I asked him afterwards, "Do you know Mr. Rottenberg?"</span> <span id="s886">And he, of course, never heard of him.</span> <span id="s887">And when he went back to Denmark, he inquired.</span> <span id="s888">The story which he has now written in the bookit's very interestingthat this Rottenberg was a German Jew who established himselfI think in 1907, in Denmark, became a very successful businessman, had earned a lot of money, had a big villa and a good business, and at the end of the First World War was approached by the German embassy, if he, with the big villa he had, couldn't house provisionally some German officer who was in trouble.</span> <span id="s889">And they agreed to it, and the officer came to live with him, and they became very friendly.</span> <span id="s890">And he stayed months, several months with him.</span> <span id="s891">And finally, he left, and Rottenberg loaned him still some money.</span> <span id="s892">And then he wrote him a letter and the officer wrote him a letter of thanks, and said if ever he could do anything for him, he would do.</span> <span id="s893">Signed, "Goering."</span> <span id="s894">Now, in 1933, Rottenberg remembered this and wrote a letter to Goering, who in the meantime became MarshalFeld Marshall Goering, the second personality of the Reich.</span> <span id="s895">And Rottenberg had some family in southern Germany still, and he asked whether he could help him toto bring them out.</span> <span id="s896">And Goering invited him immediately to come to Berlin and gave him all the permits necessary, and the permit he lefthis passports without J stamp, and so on.</span> <span id="s897">And Rottenburg must have then felt that he had some influence and tried to do certain other things for the Jewish community in Berlin.</span> <span id="s898">I haven't been able to read all the book because it's in Danish, so I don't know the details, but I know that he was in contact with a number of Jewish personalities like Sally Meier, like Winfried Israel and Schwarz andall this I didn't know.</span> <span id="s899">But I knewand wewe establishedthe author of this book approached me in Geneva, "Have youwhat is written in your files about him?"</span> <span id="s900">I told him immediately, "You will not find anything.</span> <span id="s901">You will not find the name.</span> <span id="s902">This is the type which I wouldn't put down in writing.</span> <span id="s903">But you may find some of his stories."</span> <span id="s904">And I told him the story, for instance, about thisthe bills from the Reichsbahn to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s905">He said, "But you have to tell me, what are the dates he visited Switzerland?"</span> <span id="s906">This I don't remember.</span> <span id="s907">So he produced the passports, the passports of Rottenberg.</span> <span id="s908">And we found the exact dates, and we looked in my files, and what after such dates I wrote in reports to America or London.</span> <span id="s909">And the story about the Reichsbahn, about the railway administration is there.</span> <span id="s910">Exactly afterthere is no name of "Rottenberg;" "From a very reliable source, I hear this and this and this."</span> <span id="s911">And we found him several such stories.</span> <span id="s912">You see, such things happened, and whether he was able to find any to sayto help some people to get out, I don't know.</span> <span id="s913">I cannot read the other chapters of the book.</span> <span id="s914">But I take another incident.</span> <span id="s915">One of the best organized communities and quite courageous was the Czech community.</span> <span id="s916">And we were in very good relations with them.</span> <span id="s917">And themy colleague, Fritz Uhlmann, who was in Lichtheim's office.</span> <span id="s918">He was working for the Keren Hayesod and forwas in fact also a kind of "personne de confiance" for the Czech Jews and looking after their interests.</span> <span id="s919">And he knew all the persons, and I knew through him most of them.</span> <span id="s920">And Prague sent from time to timedidn't sendused employees of the Swiss consulate in Prague to commit messages.</span> <span id="s921">And the girl came to Uhlmann and had learned by heart a certain number of things which she repeated.</span> <span id="s922">Some extremely important things: about Theresienstadt, about some of the camps, about movement, about Slovakia.</span> <span id="s923">And thisthis type of initiative coming from the communities existed, too.</span> <span id="s924">And so you have a whole series of types of initiatives.</span> <span id="s925">Later we were in contact with some of the liberation movement.</span> <span id="s926">We were in contact, for instance, in France with the underground Jews.</span> <span id="s927">At a certain moment, one of the French Jewish leaders, Mark Yarblum, who was a member of the Congress executive, came to Geneva, from France.</span> <span id="s928">There came a number of messages which were sent to him or to me from his groups.</span> <span id="s929">My secretary, Vermilla Becker, who I had for nearly forty years as secretary, the daughter of an old Zionist, Julius Becker, was sometimes in the morning at six o'clock woken up by some French railway locomotive driver who brought her a message, a whole package of stories, reports, about what was happening.</span> <span id="s930">These were the other initiatives.</span> <span id="s931">Our names didn't figure.</span> <span id="s932">Vermilla Becker wasn't known, of course, as a personso they came to her home in the morning at six o'clock and brought her a message, and such thingsa number.</span> <span id="s933">There were people who were active.</span> <span id="s934">Don't forget.</span> <span id="s935">We had, of course, in Switzerland, a number of Jewish refugees from various countries.</span> <span id="s936">And theywe used them.</span> <span id="s937">And we had people from various nationalities who kept the relationship with their community or school friends indirect to the important people in their community.</span> <span id="s938">Well, say, Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s939">I had one from Zagreb, and I had one from Belgrade.</span> <span id="s940">And I asked them, "Get me the information."</span> <span id="s941">I used them, and they produced it.</span> <span id="s942">We had people from , this is already later, Italy, Raffaello Cantoni camewho was the first president of the Italian Jewish communities after the war.</span> <span id="s943">He came in 1943, when Mussolini went down, and there was the whole group of seven thousand Italian Jews who came to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s944">I met him.</span> <span id="s945">There was the head of the refugee organization for the Jews in Italy, in Genoa, for the whole of Valobra (Ph).</span> <span id="s946">He came regularly to bring us reports.</span> <span id="s947">And not only on the Italian things.</span> <span id="s948">He had also reports from other countries.</span> <span id="s949">There was a whole network of people who brought reports or sent reports or caused that other people sent us reports.</span> <span id="s950">It's notit isnot that you can plan this systematically, but you can produce the result ininviting people, and in this way we benefited very, very much.</span> <span id="s951">But, you see, the sources are very, very different.</span> <span id="s952">And you used everything.</span> <span id="s953">And you, of course, had to judge if what they say is worth nothing.</span> <span id="s954">I give you another source of information.</span> <span id="s955">We have to speak about the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s956">Here I will take one person, who worked in the Commission Mixe, the Mixed Commission for Relief, which was a joint enterprise of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the League of Red Cross Society.</span> <span id="s957">There I had a good friend, a Baltic baron, from Riga, whowith the knowledge of the others or not, I doubtI think it was his own initiative.</span> <span id="s958">Each time when the German Red Cross delegation was in Geneva or when was in Germany and brought reporthe called me.</span> <span id="s959">This was not official.</span> <span id="s960">This wasand he gave me detailed information what they hadwhat they had reported in their private conversations, not only in official.</span> <span id="s961">And he gave me some advice as to what should be done and how we should push the Red Cross for more, and so on.</span> <span id="s962">But he also reported on some ofof the atmosphere in Germany of the "Stimmung," of the way how people felt about the destructions, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s963">And these were very important factors to evaluate the situation.</span> <span id="s964">And you will find in my reports a number of suchI am not saying from whom it came.</span> <span id="s965">I couldn't, and I wouldn't.</span> <span id="s966">But I said I have very good sources, and this and this.</span> <span id="s967">So there isI told you about thethe written information, the letters came in.</span> <span id="s968">You know, ineven in internment camps, people tried to convey to you something.</span> <span id="s969">I don't know if we will come to it.</span> <span id="s970">We have sentI don't knowI believe 100,000 packages forto people in internment camps, maybe more even.</span> <span id="s971">And they all got a postcard to confirm.</span> <span id="s972">And I had tens of thousands of such confirmations.</span> <span id="s973">They are in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s974">You can find them.</span> <span id="s975">I remember there was a family which I knew personally, and there were several sisters.</span> <span id="s976">And they got some packages.</span> <span id="s977">Some were paid by family and some werewe took a supplement, and out of the supplement, we financed gratis packages.</span> <span id="s978">And the administration, of course, we had, also.</span> <span id="s979">So in the receipts, in the postcardswhich, of course, was forbidden to write anything, but they wrote.</span> <span id="s980">And one of the sisters informed me that the sister had died.</span> <span id="s981">This was important, soand this wasn't the only type of information.</span> <span id="s982">They conveyed information which was terribly useful.</span> <span id="s983">So itthis was a chaotic time.</span> <span id="s984">And a chaotic time needs all kinds of inventions.</span> <span id="s985">You had not to do the normal things.</span> <span id="s986">You had to do extraordinary things.</span> <span id="s987">My greatest accusation against the establishment in the Jewish world is that they didn't live up sufficiently to this extraordinary time, where we needed not the normal, but the abnormal.</span> <span id="s988">I give you an example.</span> <span id="s989">The famous report on Auschwitz of the two Slovakian Jews.</span> <span id="s990">It camethe first copy came through the Czechoslovakian ambassador to the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s991">The League of Nations had not recognized the disappearance of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s992">There was no ambassador of Czechoslovakia anymore in Bern, but the one in Geneva existed.</span> <span id="s993">I used him very much, a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s994">And I trusted the Czechs more than the Poles and more than the others.</span> <span id="s995">When I needed communication with London which shouldn't be controlled, I used the Czechs.</span> <span id="s996">He got from the CzechSlovak underground these reports.</span> <span id="s997">Not onlythere came another report which is always forgotten from a Polish officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q. Polish</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s1000">Which also was a terrible report.</span> <span id="s1001">Very, very reliable report from a Polish officer.</span> <span id="s1002">I don't know who it was.</span> <span id="s1003">And from these two Slovakian Jews who escaped and who had done this for the Bratislava people.</span> <span id="s1004">By the way, I was asked later to get these two Slovakian Jews to Nuremberg for the trial of the BUNA.</span> <span id="s1005">And I found them.</span> <span id="s1006">And I delivered them.</span> <span id="s1007">And they werethis was done by me.</span> <span id="s1008">They asked me, "Who were these people?"</span> <span id="s1009">I didn't know myself who they were, but I found out in Prague immediately and everybody knew whatwhere to find them.</span> <span id="s1010">And yeah.</span> <span id="s1011">And this report which came, as I said, to the Czechoslovakian ambassador, he gave it to Uhlmann, who wasand said to give this to Riegner and ask him to make a summary for me.</span> <span id="s1012">This wasI don't knowthirty, forty pages, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q.</span> <span id="s1014">A long report.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A. "I have to cable something, but I cannot cable forty pages.</span> <span id="s1016">Ask him to make a summary."</span> <span id="s1017">And I made a summary of three, four pages, which I gave to him, and which I gave to the Americans, and I gave to the British, and which, by the way, then made the round.</span> <span id="s1018">I saw it.</span> <span id="s1019">It was communicated by the American ambassador to other peopleWinantand it's my report.</span> <span id="s1020">Because I see that it was.</span> <span id="s1021">But that's not what I am saying.</span> <span id="s1022">I get the report and sit down to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">And it's a very interesting compilation, of course, of all of the whole situation of the camp, and then reconstruction, transport by transport, according to the numbers oftwo million, more than two million people.</span> <span id="s1024">And I go through the list.</span> <span id="s1025">And I find at a certain moment a group of people from Prague, from Theresienstadt arriving in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1026">And a group of young people, under the leadership of a well‑known Maccabeeyoung leader, andarriving in Auschwitz for quarantine for six months.</span> <span id="s1027">Now, we never heard there was quarantine in Auschwitz for six months.</span> <span id="s1028">And a few lines after that, they were exterminated.</span> <span id="s1029">And then a few lines againit's the second such reporttransport coming also for quarantine for six months.</span> <span id="s1030">And I look at my calendar, and I see that the quarantine for the second group expires in five days.</span> <span id="s1031">I stop my work.</span> <span id="s1032">I take a taxi.</span> <span id="s1033">I go to the Czechoslovakian minister and show him this.</span> <span id="s1034">And in the taxi, I wrote out a telegram for the Czech government.</span> <span id="s1035">They should day and night in the BBC speak about it, that we know, and so on, that this and this group will beperhaps we can'tit's a crazy idea.</span> <span id="s1036">It's not a normal idea.</span> <span id="s1037">And Kubetzki (Ph), who is the name of the Minister ?</span> <span id="s1038">has even a better way.</span> <span id="s1039">He goes to the BBC representative at the British embassy, a ladyWiskemann (ph).</span> <span id="s1040">I knew her, too.</span> <span id="s1041">And he sends it to her, and said, "You should do this," and it was done.</span> <span id="s1042">And they transmitted the message several time from London in Czech andNow, I never heard for years whether it had any effect.</span> <span id="s1043">It was a crazy idea.</span> <span id="s1044">It was in this respect, an attempt to save some people.</span> <span id="s1045">Until one day I meet a man who was in Auschwitz from the Czech group, Kulka, the father of the historian.</span> <span id="s1046">It was also written.</span> <span id="s1047">And he told me, "Yes, I know."</span> <span id="s1048">I said, "How do you know?"</span> <span id="s1049">He said, "We heard this on the radio."</span> <span id="s1050">I said, "You had radio?"</span> <span id="s1051">He said, "Of course, we had radio.</span> <span id="s1052">And we were hiding these people."</span> <span id="s1053">He saidat that moment these people were not killed.</span> <span id="s1054">Whether they were killed later, I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s1055">Because they were distributed in other places.</span> <span id="s1056">But now I am not taking any credit for this.</span> <span id="s1057">It was a crazy idea, but this is the type of crazy ideas you had to have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q. Yeah.</span> <span id="s1059">You had to try things that were unconventional because the situation was unprecedented?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A. Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1061">Now, take another thing.</span> <span id="s1062">I have mentioned this a number of times, but it's very typical.</span> <span id="s1063">Yitzhak Greenberg, who was a head of the Hazalah in the Jewish agency in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Now, you don't know Yitzhak Greenberg, your generation.</span> <span id="s1065">For you it doesn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s1066">Yitzhak Greenberg was one of the great fighters for Jewish rights in the Polish Sejm (parliament) for thein the times of the terrible anti‑Semitic events and persecutions in Poland.</span> <span id="s1067">He was the one most courageous who stood up in the Sejm and attacked the government.</span> <span id="s1068">And we had all enormous respect and admiration for the man who did thiswho had this.</span> <span id="s1069">At that time he was in Israelin Palestine.</span> <span id="s1070">He was at the head of the Hazalah department.</span> <span id="s1071">One day I get a telegram from Yitzhak Greenberg, "Find my son."</span> <span id="s1072">I don't know whether you have ever heard this story.</span> <span id="s1073">And I said to myself, Greenberg?</span> <span id="s1074">He knows what's important.</span> <span id="s1075">How can you find his son?</span> <span id="s1076">Crazy.</span> <span id="s1077">And I think and think, and I couldn't sleep for two three nights.</span> <span id="s1078">I said, What can I do to find his son?</span> <span id="s1079">Finally, I took a crazy idea.</span> <span id="s1080">I sent fifteen or twenty packages to fifteen or twenty camps, under the name of the son.</span> <span id="s1081">And I found the son.</span> <span id="s1082">It was crazy, and I sacrificed fourteen packages.</span> <span id="s1083">Who knows what they became.</span> <span id="s1084">Generally they arrived, you know.</span> <span id="s1085">We didn't know this.</span> <span id="s1086">But we took our list.</span> <span id="s1087">And New York didn't want us to do this.</span> <span id="s1088">New York said this was against the blockade.</span> <span id="s1089">And I said, "I'm sitting in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1090">I don't care.</span> <span id="s1091">I help people."</span> <span id="s1092">And whoever getsand I have the testimony of one of the people in the Unterstuetzungsstelle in Krakow who confirmed to me that practically allcollective sendings, dispatchesand individual, well, you know how the Germans are.</span> <span id="s1093">They are correct.</span> <span id="s1094">They are correct in bad things, and they are correct in good things.</span> <span id="s1095">It was received.</span> <span id="s1096">And it helped a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1097">I knowI sent, for instance, to my old teacher, Leo Baeck, the great Jewish leader with whom I was bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1098">When I heard he was in Theresienstadt, I sent him packages.</span> <span id="s1099">He didn't know from whom it came.</span> <span id="s1100">I spoke to him later, years after, in London, and I told him it came from me.</span> <span id="s1101">He said, "Well, anyhow, we distributed it to some of our friends."</span> <span id="s1102">But you had tothis was the situation.</span> <span id="s1103">It was absolutely irrational.</span> <span id="s1104">And you had to do irrational things.</span> <span id="s1105">And this is what most of the people didn't do.</span> <span id="s1106">Now, let's come to theto theI want toto come to some of the major problems in the Holocaust, in thehow I learned thatwhat was done, what was not done, and why the people didn'tdidn't do.</span> <span id="s1107">These are the major things which I haven't spoken at all yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s1109">Why don't we lead into that with the receipt of the phone call from Segalovitz and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q.</span> <span id="s1112">It is fair to say that this was theof all of the pieces of information that you received during the war, this was the one that made the greatest impact on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A. No.</span> <span id="s1114">This was, of coursethis wasI think we should starthow we got the information, what we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q. Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A.</span> <span id="s1117">When you raised the question of my famous telegram, I have to say, in introduction, that the world didn't begin with this telegram.</span> <span id="s1118">I think I have given you already the impression that all what we did developed in thein an evolution corresponding to the political situation in which it developed.</span> <span id="s1119">And each situation incited us to make another step.</span> <span id="s1120">You don't plan all theyou plan the first step.</span> <span id="s1121">And then the number of steps follow.</span> <span id="s1122">And that I said that we have reported on the situation.</span> <span id="s1123">And it is fair to say thatwhen you see the whole reporting, it's astonishing how well we were informed.</span> <span id="s1124">Once a year, for instance, I senttogether with Lichtheima telegram to New York, the last on the eve of the Atlantic City conference, which is a resume how we see the situation in November 1944 with figures about the dead and the living and what we believe is still there and what isit's an astonishing document.</span> <span id="s1125">It's practically what we found after the war.</span> <span id="s1126">Sobut Emerson, the Director-general of the London International Refugee Organization, to whom I gave this in November or December of '44, asked me a year later when I was in London, he saidhe greeted me.</span> <span id="s1127">"Yeah.</span> <span id="s1128">You are the fellow with the figures."</span> <span id="s1129">He said, "How did youhow did you know the figures?</span> <span id="s1130">This is in fact what we have today."</span> <span id="s1131">And I say, "Listen, when you follow things in the way in which we followed, day by day, and week by week, and month by month, and year by year, you have a feeling.</span> <span id="s1132">You have facts, and you have a feeling how things develop.</span> <span id="s1133">And you come to certain estimates, and theyusually they are based on information."</span> <span id="s1134">So this is a whole process of information.</span> <span id="s1135">We know very well and we reported on all the terrible things which happened in '40 and '41 and '42.</span> <span id="s1136">Basedthe whole ghettoization and the terrible situation in the ghettos, and so on, in Poland.</span> <span id="s1137">This is allwe had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">But then comes the Russian war, the invasion thatto us.</span> <span id="s1139">And here is the great dividing line.</span> <span id="s1140">From there dates really the total extermination policy.</span> <span id="s1141">On the evelittle earlier.</span> <span id="s1142">I think May,'41.</span> <span id="s1143">Maybe the decision madehad been taken even earlier, notit's not very important, whether it's two, three months earlier or not.</span> <span id="s1144">But anyhow, the decision whenon einsatzkommandos, it's there in May of '41.</span> <span id="s1145">And youand we hear during the year '41, practically three months after the invasionwe hear all kinds of terrible thingsabout killings here and killings there and ten thousand there and five thousand there and twenty thousand there.</span> <span id="s1146">They are various names of cities, and so on.</span> <span id="s1147">And in October, '41, which means three months later, three months after the invasion, I write to Nahum Goldman one of the lettersdidn't write too many letters, so this is one of the great letters I had written.</span> <span id="s1148">I said, "The news from the eastern front are terrible.</span> <span id="s1149">They're so terrible that I do not know how many Jews would survive this war if this continues."</span> <span id="s1150">I don't know exactly what happens in Russia.</span> <span id="s1151">We had nono possibility to reach over there.</span> <span id="s1152">There was noeven diplomatic relations in Switzerland with Russia, which is not known probably.</span> <span id="s1153">But I do not knowbut west of Dnieper and the Bug, I don't know of how many Jews would survive.</span> <span id="s1154">October, '41.</span> <span id="s1155">And then comes March, '42, six weeks, about, after the so‑called Wannsee Conference, of which we, of course, didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s1156">Which is also not the decisive moment but it is the moment in which the whole extermination policy is now being carried out, supported by every administration of the Reich.</span> <span id="s1157">Six weeks after we decideLichtheim and Ito go to the Nuncio, to the Papal Nuncio, and to appeal to the Vatican, at least do something in the countries in which the Catholic church had influence, where there are priests at the head of the state, and so on.</span> <span id="s1158">And there's a very important diplomat of the Vatican, Philip Bernardini, through whom many, many of the communications from the Vatican went to the western countries.</span> <span id="s1159">And yet he received us veryvery fine.</span> <span id="s1160">And asked us to write"Give us a memorandum."</span> <span id="s1161">We give him a memorandum, in which we describe in the major Catholic countries or countries with large Catholic populations what the situation is.</span> <span id="s1162">And in this memorandum you will find several times thea phrase like, "The aim can only be total liquidation."</span> <span id="s1163">I don't think there were extermination figures, but total liquidation of the Jewish community figures, which means that we were fully aware that this was happening.</span> <span id="s1164">And I add something more.</span> <span id="s1165">Around the same time, inI would say partly end '41, beginning '42, come the first reports on experiments on the human body, injections, and so on.</span> <span id="s1166">And the second is the gas vans.</span> <span id="s1167">They experiment with gas vans in which vansin which people are being gassed in an Autobus and killed in this way.</span> <span id="s1168">Not yet of camps and gaspublics.</span> <span id="s1169">And the first time you hear it, you are really skeptic.</span> <span id="s1170">And the second time, too.</span> <span id="s1171">When it comes from different places and different versions and different people, you start taking it seriously.</span> <span id="s1172">So I am saying we are fully aware of the terrible things that are going on there.</span> <span id="s1173">And then comes an end of July.</span> <span id="s1174">The German man reports to his business friends in Switzerland, "I hear of the plan of the total extermination of the Jews of Europe."</span> <span id="s1175">And the man, whichnow known, the man, head of theEduard Schulte, a man who was at the head of a very big mining concern, Giesche and Company, who occupied thirty thousand workers for the war, who had access to the highest authorities.</span> <span id="s1176">There was even thewhat is it calledWirit's an order, special title ofWir –</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q. Wirtschaftsfuehrer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A. Wirtschaftsfuehrer.</span> <span id="s1179">We were told he had access to Hitler's headquarters.</span> <span id="s1180">And comes to his business friends, and says, "I heard in theHitler's headquarters of a discussed plan of the deportation to the east of the totality of Jews.</span> <span id="s1181">Three and a half million to four million Jews should be, will be killed in the east.</span> <span id="s1182">And they still discussed the means, but I hear of prussic acid."</span> <span id="s1183">Now, while we are receiving this, this plan was in full execution.</span> <span id="s1184">He comes back in six weeks laternot evenfew weeks later, and says, "I now know that there is an order, and it is in full execution."</span> <span id="s1185">This is always forgotten to be mentioned, but this is a fact.</span> <span id="s1186">So he himself is now sure and knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q. Tell us a bit specifically how you got this information, the other people involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A. Now, theythe people involved is a Jewish concern of Jack Rosenstein, who was ina big businessman in Zurich who was during the war in New York.</span> <span id="s1189">He was a friend of Nahum Goldman.</span> <span id="s1190">He supported the Congress, Rosenstein.</span> <span id="s1191">He was one of the financial supporters.</span> <span id="s1192">He has a representative, Isidor Koppelmann, who is in Basel and in Zurich.</span> <span id="s1193">And Schulte is in relationship with this group for many years.</span> <span id="s1194">And Schulte says to Koppelmann, "You have to inform the Jews officially."</span> <span id="s1195">And Koppelmann was a good Jew, knows one of the Jewish officials in the Swiss Jewish community, a very fine human being, Benjamin Segalovitz, the type ofthe best type of Russian Jews, in theof the old aristocratic Russian Jewish typewho lives in Switzerland for many, many years.</span> <span id="s1196">In fact, the family resided in Switzerland since 1914, when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1197">And they established themselves in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1198">And Ben Segalovitz is the specialist in the Jewish community on anti‑Semitism and fights and is the head of the press service but it's much more than the press service.</span> <span id="s1199">He is really the man who is in charge of the fight against anti‑Semitism with regard to the Swiss community.</span> <span id="s1200">And very respected and very courageous.</span> <span id="s1201">Stands up to his own superiors and attacks thempublicly and sometimesand Koppelmann informed Segalovitz.</span> <span id="s1202">And Segalovitz, without hesitating, telephones me.</span> <span id="s1203">The story that he asked himself, Whom and what?</span> <span id="s1204">It's not true.</span> <span id="s1205">We were in constant contact.</span> <span id="s1206">We spoke on telephone two, three times a week at least.</span> <span id="s1207">What I was doing in the world scene, he was doing in the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1208">We were in very close personal relations and great personal respect for each other.</span> <span id="s1209">It was a little bitthere is a certain veil on it that in the later yearswhere he had a new girlfriend who was jealous of everything else and tried to disturb this very friendly relationship with which we had.</span> <span id="s1210">And one of the reasons was inthat Moos didn't mention his name in his book, which I was very sorry.</span> <span id="s1211">I mentioned his name everywhere and gave the story and theit's not only that he deserves to be credited.</span> <span id="s1212">He immediately brought this to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s1213">But we did everything together from that moment on.</span> <span id="s1214">And he is one of the finest human beings which I have been working with in my life.</span> <span id="s1215">I really give the highest credit to him and to his integrity and his competence and his dedication to all Zionists andokay.</span> <span id="s1216">He telephones me.</span> <span id="s1217">He doesn't say what it is.</span> <span id="s1218">He said, "We have to meet immediately.</span> <span id="s1219">When can we meet?"</span> <span id="s1220">Two days later in Lausanne.</span> <span id="s1221">It was the first of August, national holidays.</span> <span id="s1222">We are both free.</span> <span id="s1223">And he wanted to go to a chess competition or something.</span> <span id="s1224">And we meet in Lausanne, and in Ouchi.</span> <span id="s1225">And we discuss for five or six hours walking along the lake and going into a restaurant or in a cafe and getting up again and walking.</span> <span id="s1226">And he tells me a story.</span> <span id="s1227">The first thing was, "Who is the man?</span> <span id="s1228">Is he reliable?</span> <span id="s1229">Is this a provocation?</span> <span id="s1230">Is this possible?</span> <span id="s1231">Is this imaginable?</span> <span id="s1232">Are we a victim of some manipulation?"</span> <span id="s1233">And wefrom this moment on we think together.</span> <span id="s1234">I mean in the realthe best way of cooperation.</span> <span id="s1235">And for hours we turn around the argument.</span> <span id="s1236">And I must say, there is another element whichnow, wehe and I knew more or less the same things.</span> <span id="s1237">I shared with him what I knew.</span> <span id="s1238">And he helped bring aboutand people like him brought people who informed us.</span> <span id="s1239">And I had in my mind something which had deeply impressed me.</span> <span id="s1240">I blink backwards.</span> <span id="s1241">In Witzen (Ph), 1939, half a year before the war started, I had to visit another man with whom I worked together for several years who was a representative of the Danzig Jews.</span> <span id="s1242">We were working against Nazis in Danzig.</span> <span id="s1243">There was a question of principle, not only the five, six thousand Jews, but also this was a city under the League of Nations supervision, that if the highest moral authority in the world cannot stop this, we cannot take this without protest.</span> <span id="s1244">And, therefore, we fought forvery, very symbolically, also.</span> <span id="s1245">But also really for the Jews in Danzig and Dresta (ph), too.</span> <span id="s1246">And he was one of the two representatives.</span> <span id="s1247">His name wasI think Walter Gerson, a lawyer, one of the two leaders of the community with whom we had to doto deal.</span> <span id="s1248">The other was also a lawyer, Rosenzweig, I think.</span> <span id="s1249">Was it Rosenberg or Rosenzweig?</span> <span id="s1250">We have to find out -Bernard (ph).</span> <span id="s1251">And he visited me in Witzen.</span> <span id="s1252">We made a long promenade on the first holiday through the campagne (i.e. open spaces surrounding the city) inin Geneva campagne.</span> <span id="s1253">And, of course, the situation was terribly tense.</span> <span id="s1254">And we knew, all of us, that only a war can put an end to this.</span> <span id="s1255">And we knew, all of us, that the war was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1256">And everybody was split in his own feelings.</span> <span id="s1257">What should one wish for?</span> <span id="s1258">Without the war, Hitler would never end.</span> <span id="s1259">With the war, terrible things could happen.</span> <span id="s1260">And then, while we had this feeling, all of us, he starts telling me, "You know, when the war will come, what will be our destiny?"</span> <span id="s1261">And he paints with an absolutely fantastic imagination the situation of the Jewish people if Hitler starts a war, where millions of the Jews willwill be killed and disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Now, spelling out something which we all felt somehow but we never dared say it aloud.</span> <span id="s1263">It shook me.</span> <span id="s1264">I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1265">It was a kind of prophecy which, as I said, we felt it, but we didn't dare say it.</span> <span id="s1266">And when people say the Jews wanted the war, it's all nonsense.</span> <span id="s1267">The Jews were terribly divided in themselves.</span> <span id="s1268">What can we help?</span> <span id="s1269">What can we hope?</span> <span id="s1270">While we go there along the lake, this comes back to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1272">So in a way</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A. It's one of thethe things which have marked me really for my life, this fellow.</span> <span id="s1274">One of the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q.</span> <span id="s1276">The tape has run out just there, so let's stop there for a second.</span> <span id="s1277">We'll have lunch, I think,</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A.</span> <span id="s1280">This you never heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q. I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A.</span> <span id="s1283">This you never heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q. No.</span> <span id="s1285">I hadn't heard that before.</span> <span id="s1286">But I was going to comment on that, that you were prepared in a way whenpsychologically you were prepared when the message came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A. I am comingI am coming now to the three reasons why I believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1289">But save that for the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A.</span> <span id="s1291">We stop now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q. I think so.</span> <span id="s1293">I think we'll probably have lunch now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A.</span> <span id="s1295">But this is a terrible story.</span> <span id="s1296">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1297">You have to tell meyou have to remind me, that I say Walter Gerson.</span> <span id="s1298">He was killed in the first ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">TAPE #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q.</span> <span id="s1301">What happened, Dr. Riegner, to this man who gave you a prophecy about the fate of European Jewry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A.</span> <span id="s1303">When I remembered this prophecy, I had to remember his very sad end.</span> <span id="s1304">And the Germans marched into Poland in the fall 1939.</span> <span id="s1305">There was shortly after a pogrom in Bromberg and in Poznanmust have been in October or sowhere five thousand Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s1306">And Walter Gerson, who had fled from Danzig to the Polish territories, was one of the first victims of this pogrom.</span> <span id="s1307">I had not forgotten this.</span> <span id="s1308">Now, let me tell you why I believedand I can I believe say also Segalovitz believed the truth of the story.</span> <span id="s1309">There were three major reasons.</span> <span id="s1310">The first was that Hitler had himself announced a number of times, usually on the anniversary of the day that he took power, the 30th of January, where there were usually a great manifestation.</span> <span id="s1311">And already on the 30th of January 39, before the war broke out, he threatened the Jews, whom he accused to want to push for the war, and he threatened them that ifone thing is certain, he said.</span> <span id="s1312">This war, if it breaks out, will not end with the defeat of the German people.</span> <span id="s1313">It will end with the extermination of the Jewish people in Europe.</span> <span id="s1314">He repeated this threat a number of times, usually, as I said, on the 30th of January.</span> <span id="s1315">And I remembered this.</span> <span id="s1316">I was following this in '36 already in my office.</span> <span id="s1317">And I was usually commenting on such speeches to a number of journalists in Geneva who followed together with me these speeches.</span> <span id="s1318">And I said to myself, we haven't taken Mein Kampf seriously.</span> <span id="s1319">He announced all what he was going to do.</span> <span id="s1320">And nobody had taken it seriously.</span> <span id="s1321">Here again is a threat.</span> <span id="s1322">Nobody is taking it seriously.</span> <span id="s1323">But now we cannot ignore it.</span> <span id="s1324">This was the first reason.</span> <span id="s1325">The second reason waswe are on the last of July, the first of Augustand as I told you before, we knew, of course, many things which happened before.</span> <span id="s1326">We knew of the deportations from Berlin, from Vienna, from Prague, from other places.</span> <span id="s1327">But something was new.</span> <span id="s1328">On the 14th, 15th of July, 1942, suddenlyand nobody understood whytens of thousands of Jews were arrested, in all great cities of western Europe.</span> <span id="s1329">In Amsterdam, in Brussels, in Antwerp, in Paris, in Lyon, in Marseilles, and so on.</span> <span id="s1330">Suddenly, tens of thousands of people were arrested.</span> <span id="s1331">And in the week before already the first trains of deportations left to the east.</span> <span id="s1332">As I said, nobody understood why suddenly this happens.</span> <span id="s1333">The report of Schulte gave the explanation.</span> <span id="s1334">Behind all this there was a plan.</span> <span id="s1335">Behind all what we knew about the starvation, the terrible living conditions, the ghettoization, the deportations, the mass murdersbehind all this was one decisive fact, a decision by the Nazis to exterminate the totality of the Jews of Europe.</span> <span id="s1336">And the third reason why I believed it has very much to do with my own origin from Germany.</span> <span id="s1337">I knew the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1338">I knew their brutality.</span> <span id="s1339">I knew their fanaticism.</span> <span id="s1340">I knew that, contrary to all other enemies in history which we have encountered, we have here a group which is absolutely fanaticized, which is absolutely determined to live up to its aims and for whom the Jew was a personification of the devil, the personification of everything evil in the world, and that it was onenot one, but the central aim of the Nazi party program.</span> <span id="s1341">It is characteristic that in his first political letter to a comrade written in September 1919, long before he published Mein Kampfit's the first document of political character which we know of Hitler until his famous political last will, the day when he committed suicide, on the 29th of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s1342">In his first political until his last political document, the fight against world Jewry is considered by him his major aim.</span> <span id="s1343">And he preaches this in 1919 as in 1945.</span> <span id="s1344">I knew about their brutality.</span> <span id="s1345">I have already spoken about my experiences as a student in the student elections.</span> <span id="s1346">But I have seen it, also, in my experience, the day when they arrived to power, the demonstrations on the 30th of January, on the 1st of April, the boycotting.</span> <span id="s1347">I knew about who had burned the Reichstag.</span> <span id="s1348">When I left in May 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q. '33?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A.'33, I knew about the first concentration camps, in Oranienburg, and inother place which escapes me at the moment.</span> <span id="s1351">I knew about the torture of his political enemies which took place in the building of the former Communist newspaper, the Rote Fahne.</span> <span id="s1352">And everybody who was a little bit interested in the political affairs knew it.</span> <span id="s1353">I knew about the violence with which they fought their political enemies.</span> <span id="s1354">There was a famous story about the murder in a PolishGerman Polish frontier city, whichin which they ruthlessly turned the facts upside down, and we knew that the German Nazis were full of fanaticism and did not know any ethical or moral limits to their exercise of power, that for them, good is what benefits Germany, as the Nazis understood it, was the essence of their doctrine.</span> <span id="s1355">And in this, the Jewish question was the central point.</span> <span id="s1356">Now, I did not limit myself to convincing myself that all these reasons made the report of Schulte very probable and very nearly convinced myself that it is an accurate report.</span> <span id="s1357">I told so, also, the American vice‑consul, whom I met.</span> <span id="s1358">My idea after having met together with SegalovitzKoppelmann, who confirmed what Segalovitz had reported to me, who told us a little bit more about his relations with Schulte, his reports which he had brought before with regard to the development of the war.</span> <span id="s1359">Amongst other things, he had rightly informed them of the date of the invasion of Russia.</span> <span id="s1360">And a number of other similar reports turned out to be completely correct, which gave us the conviction that we had to do with a very serious source.</span> <span id="s1361">And this</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q.</span> <span id="s1363">At this point you still didn't know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A.</span> <span id="s1365">At this point I didn't still know his name.</span> <span id="s1366">I didn't want to see him, and he didn't want to see us.</span> <span id="s1367">Don't forget: We are, after all, at war with Germany, and the whole situation was terribly tense, andbut the reports about his reliability and his antecedence gave us a good measure of conviction that we had to deal with a very serious source.</span> <span id="s1368">I decided to keep the whole story to myself, and only to consult Professor Gugenheim, who was our legal advisor.</span> <span id="s1369">And when Nahum Goldman left Geneva in 1940, he asked me in very serious problems to consult Gugenheim as a major person with whom I should be in contact.</span> <span id="s1370">I had written the same evening a long letter to Gugenheim.</span> <span id="s1371">I told him what I found out and told him what I had intention to do and wanted his consent.</span> <span id="s1372">And he spoke to me the next day on the telephone.</span> <span id="s1373">He agreed to the plan.</span> <span id="s1374">As a very careful, prudent, good, Swiss citizen, he moderated some of my phrases and introduced some cautious words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q.</span> <span id="s1376">These were the phrases that were in the telegram you proposed to send out to the Americans and the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1378">I made a draft of a telegram which I wanted to give the Americans and the British, and he moderated this a little bit, but the basicsome people later have accused me, "But you didn't believe yourself.</span> <span id="s1379">You have put in some cautious words."</span> <span id="s1380">But if you would see what I sent to the American vice‑consulthe consul was not in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1381">He was on vacationand to the British vice‑consul, you would see, andMr. Elting, who was the American vice‑consul, has written about this, given some information of ityou will see that I was very strong in my convictions.</span> <span id="s1382">And I told them, in spite of these words, that I was convinced that the things were serious, and I gave him all the reasons why I believed in it.</span> <span id="s1383">Elting must have consulted his chief, Mr. Squire, a consul, whom I knew.</span> <span id="s1384">Elting I had never met.</span> <span id="s1385">And they agreed, and he sent the text to Bern legation, and that they should forward everything to Washington.</span> <span id="s1386">I said, in fact, three things to Elting: "Inform your government, check the contents, what I tell you.</span> <span id="s1387">You have the Secret Service.</span> <span id="s1388">I don't.</span> <span id="s1389">And three, give this telegram to Wise, the president of the World Jewish Congress, in Washington."</span> <span id="s1390">And I said the same to the vice‑consul of the British, and asked him to give thesend the telegram to Mr. Sydney Silverman, who was the chairman of the British section of the World Jewish Congress and a very prominent member of the British Parliament.</span> <span id="s1391">In fact, the two telegrams were identical, with one exception, and it's very typical, the exception.</span> <span id="s1392">The telegram to Silverman said at the end, "Inform and consult New York."</span> <span id="s1393">Now, as I had sent the other telegram to Wise, it doesn't make much sense, but it shows that I was not convinced that the Americans would deliver the telegram to Wise, and that I was convinced that the British, because of their parliamentary traditions, would not dare not deliver the message to a prominent member of Parliament, and my guess was true.</span> <span id="s1394">It happened exactly like this.</span> <span id="s1395">The Americans did not deliver the message to Wise and informed me so by letter from Mr. Squire, the American consul, on the date of the 24th of August, in which he writes that (reading) "I am informed that the legation at Bern transmitted the substance of this telegram to the Department of State for delivery to Dr. Wise in its discretion, but it is now in receipt of telegraphic instructions from the department which indicate that it is disinclined to deliver the message in question in view of the apparently unsubstantiated character of the information which forms its main theme."</span> <span id="s1396">Now, I don't know what I could have substantiated more.</span> <span id="s1397">I know we know from some of the historians who have studied the files in the State Department that some people were afraid of Wise, and if the rabbi finds out, he will make a big scandal.</span> <span id="s1398">But this is only the first instance of a very unfriendly attitude of the Department of State in this whole matter.</span> <span id="s1399">With regard to the British, they delivered the message to Sydney Silverman, although it took ten days, and I never found out why.</span> <span id="s1400">Apparently they looked for him in London, but the parliamentary session was finished, and so he was at home in Liverpool andbut it's not clear why they couldn't find him earlier.</span> <span id="s1401">Finally, they found him, but he didn't believe in the thing, either.</span> <span id="s1402">And you study today the files which have been publishedafter all, this is now publicto a great extent, at leastpublic property, you will see the marks in the file of the State Department: "These are wild rumors borne out of Jewish fears."</span> <span id="s1403">For the first ten or fourteen days, or even more, nobody cared for the substance, what I had informed.</span> <span id="s1404">They only asked, "Who is Riegner?"</span> <span id="s1405">And my name was at that time completely unknown, for several reasons.</span> <span id="s1406">One of the reasons, that my family was until the end of 1938 still in Germany, and I had asked all colleagues in the Congress to keep my name out of circulation and out from documents.</span> <span id="s1407">So nobody had seen my name.</span> <span id="s1408">And when they asked in London at the Jewish agency and some other places, they didn't know me, either, because I had nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s1409">So this was onlyslowly when other reports came in in the same direction, with the same content, they finally started to give some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q. Credence, believability?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A. Yeahbelievability to these reports.</span> <span id="s1412">And I amsome of the historians have shown that my telegram finally has completely changed the attitude of the British government in the caseon the whole subject of war crimes and war criminals.</span> <span id="s1413">Now, when the telegram was received by Silverman, he tried to telephone to Wise in America and was prevented by the War Department to do so.</span> <span id="s1414">Finally, the War Department sent a coded telegram to Wise in New York, from Silvermanand it is only when this arrived in New York, was fully informed.</span> <span id="s1415">Now, the question about how did the Jews react tolet's say the Congress people?</span> <span id="s1416">This is something which I am, of course, interested very much, and I have three or four witnesses on which I can report.</span> <span id="s1417">I asked my colleague in New York, Morris Bernzweig, who was the head of the International Affairs Department in New Yorkwho was British, but during the war he went to New Yorkand asked him, "How did you react to this?</span> <span id="s1418">You were present when the telegram arrived.</span> <span id="s1419">Did you believe it, or did you have doubts?</span> <span id="s1420">What?"</span> <span id="s1421">He said clearly to me, "Nobody put this report into question.</span> <span id="s1422">We took it.</span> <span id="s1423">We accepted it."</span> <span id="s1424">As a matter of fact, Stephen Wise, when he got it, wrote two letters, deeplywhich he is deeply worried, deeply moved, deeply in despair, one to Justice Frankfurter, and he writes in a few lines that he received this message, and that he is in despair.</span> <span id="s1425">What could one do?</span> <span id="s1426">And he asked Frankfurter to inform the boss, which means Roosevelt, which Frankfurter has certainly done.</span> <span id="s1427">They were in very close relations.</span> <span id="s1428">And he underlinesand this is very funny for methat the report come from one whom he names "very conservative."</span> <span id="s1429">Now, I have never been described by anybody as a very conservative person, but what Wise obviously meant, that I am very careful in my judgment, that I am not a "Schreier", and that I am known for my reliability and for my good judgment.</span> <span id="s1430">It's interesting to see suchsuch words to appear when you feel you are really not a very conservative person.</span> <span id="s1431">Butin this sense of reliability and not exaggerating, and so on, it is very accurate.</span> <span id="s1432">The other letter is even a much greater expression of despair, to his very close friend, the Pastor JohnJamesHolmesHanes.</span> <span id="s1433">What's the name?</span> <span id="s1434">The pastor and the minister, the nameyou have to correct thattheit's one of the closest friendsa Protestant pastor with whom Wise was very close, and they exchanged the pulpit even, and so on.</span> <span id="s1435">And there is in the letters which Foss has edited, an outburst of his despair, "What can we do?"</span> <span id="s1436">And sees that he is absolutely shaken at his foundations about this report, and sees the catastrophe and takes it for serious, too.</span> <span id="s1437">I mean, there is no doubt.</span> <span id="s1438">He has known me in '36 at the Congress.</span> <span id="s1439">He has known me on one or two other occasions when we met and had obviously great respect for my integrity and my reliability.</span> <span id="s1440">And Wise goes to Sumner Welles andnot knowing, of course, that the telegram is laying in the State Departmentand Sumner Welles forbids the publication.</span> <span id="s1441">There are people who criticized Wise that he accepted this.</span> <span id="s1442">I don't know whether he was right or he was wrong.</span> <span id="s1443">But he agreed that they will make other inquiries about the reliability of the content, the veracity of the content of the cable, and has decided to ask the Vatican and the International Red Cross for their opinion.</span> <span id="s1444">Now, the Vaticanthis I have described in one of my speeches in Cincinnati has a very strange attitude.</span> <span id="s1445">Titmann, who was the deputy to the official representative of the president to the Vatican, insists a number of times to get information of the attitude of the Vatican on this information.</span> <span id="s1446">And finally, he gets a wishy‑washy reply: "We know, also, that there are very bad reports coming in about the treatment of the Jews, but we have no onfirmation about the story of the extermination."</span> <span id="s1447">And more or less this is the reply.</span> <span id="s1448">Very strange.</span> <span id="s1449">Because theI believe the Vatican was at least as well informed as we were.</span> <span id="s1450">They had hundreds of priests who cametraveled through Europe and came to Rome and informed the Vatican authorities.</span> <span id="s1451">A man, historian, former priest himself, Franconi, Carlo Franconiwrites about the hundreds of reports who came andfrom all over and how much theyhow well they were informed.</span> <span id="s1452">And in the documents which the Vatican has published themself, there are a number of very important facts, where you see that a number of Nuncios had very clearly reported about what is happening to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1453">There was a special man who was active, I believe, for the Order of Malta, who was pursuing in Poland some welfare activities, humanitarian activities, who writes a number of times reports already in May, and another in October, '42, where heone of the reports he says something like "There are two new things.</span> <span id="s1454">On the one hand, the bombardment of the cities, and the other is the intensification of the extermination of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">More than two million have already been killed."</span> <span id="s1456">I mean, this information was there.</span> <span id="s1457">Why the Vatican ignores it and doesn't tell it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1458">And the Red Cross didn't give anyany concrete answer, either, International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1459">Now, we will come back to the attitude of the Red Cross at a later point, where I will say what I have to say about the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1460">Now, I see that one doesn't believebut doesn't believe, and there is now ontwo activities on parallel.</span> <span id="s1461">The one activity is my own.</span> <span id="s1462">I try by all of the possible means to find corroborating evidence from other sources.</span> <span id="s1463">And the other is the activity especially of our British section, which was very active, was a wonderful group, of Lady Reading, of Silverman, of Baru(ph), of Alex Easterman, ofa marvelous leadership group which was acting in a very fine, coordinated way.</span> <span id="s1464">And they approach all the governments in exile, the British governments, and try to work on them.</span> <span id="s1465">And an interesting story there is that one of their best friends was President Benes of Czechoslovakia, considered it a German provocation and didn't believe in it.</span> <span id="s1466">And on the other hand, the only one who believed it, accepted it as fact, was Ivan Maisky, the Russian mbassador, who probably had known by his own experience that the extermination of peoples is possible, even by so‑called civilized countries.</span> <span id="s1467">At the same time, they tried to obtain some kind of a statement of the Pope, through a concerted action of the countries represented in Londonand taking up an idea which I had already a year earlier suggested in one of my letters to Nahum Goldmanthere is an attempt to obtain a collective statement of the Allied governments on the extermination of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1468">And this text is finallythis is the real, immediate result of my telegram, is the declaration of theall the Allied governmentswhich is of the 17th of December, 1942, where all the Allied governments and the French National Committeewas not yet a governmenthad solemnly denounced the extermination of the Jewish people, saying that this has been many times announced, threatened with, and now it is happening, and hundreds of thousands of people have already been killed, and they threatened with the retaliationwith the punishment of those who are responsible.</span> <span id="s1469">This is a great moment.</span> <span id="s1470">Now the story is out.</span> <span id="s1471">And it is published all over.</span> <span id="s1472">And even in the very careful, neutral Switzerland, it makes the first pages in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s1473">And one hopes now something will happen that something should happen.</span> <span id="s1474">And now starts a discussion between the two major Allied governments which goes on for six weeks, and nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s1475">You can read the pathetic appeal from the Archbishop of Canterbury in the House of Lords and this, where he accuses the governments of complete inactivity and of being responsible for their not undertaking any action.</span> <span id="s1476">Even if you cannot do anything, you have to try at least.</span> <span id="s1477">And finally, after two months practically, it is decided there will be a conference between the British and the Americans, and they decide to hold this conference in the Bermudas, in the Atlantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q. Let me stop you there for a minute and back up for two things.</span> <span id="s1479">One, the information that Washington and London were trying to get confirmed, in spite of the fact that the Vatican did not supply much information, the Americans did ultimately get additional information, including indirectly some information from Carl Burckhardt, and I wonder if you could talk about how that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1481">I will come to this now.</span> <span id="s1482">I have skipped one thing, and that the meeting with the American minister in October 1942.</span> <span id="s1483">Let me first say, when I saw that nothing was happening and that everybody was skeptical about the reportsand this you feel, and you see that nothing is happening I was never in my life as desperate as during these weeks, when you know that the world is burning and nothing is happening, and on the contrary, I am sitting in Geneva on this beautiful lake with my view on the Mont Blanc, and the blue sky, and you know</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q. Which you could see from your office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A. Hmm?</span> <span id="s1486">I saw this from my office.</span> <span id="s1487">I was having an office with a beautiful view, and already three, four kilometers around are the Germans and the Italians.</span> <span id="s1488">And the whole world is in flames, and you see this beauty of the lake and the mountains and the sky, and it's a provocation to your existence.</span> <span id="s1489">And I am waiting and waiting to any reaction positive, and nothing comes.</span> <span id="s1490">So I am trying toto get information, other information.</span> <span id="s1491">But on this I must say I was quite successful.</span> <span id="s1492">There were four major confirmations which I obtained, direct or indirect.</span> <span id="s1493">The first were some letters which were addressed to the Jewish relief organization of the Aguda in Switzerland, addressed by a man who lived outside the ghetto in Warsaw, and which was sent to Lucerne, informing them in a certain coded language, with Hebrew words and other words, of the beginning of the deportation of the Jews of Warsaw, which startedand this we knowon the 25th of July, the day when Czerniakow, the Judenaelteste, committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1494">And every day six thousand people were taken andfrom the Umschlagplatz to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1495">And they write in two letters in this kind of coded language that the people are being taken day by day to this camp.</span> <span id="s1496">And the words are clearit is gayROOSH.</span> <span id="s1497">It is complete extermination and killing, and so there is for the first time a confirmation even from Poland that this extermination is happening there.</span> <span id="s1498">Number two, at the beginning of September, I believe, comes to Switzerland a young man who saw the extermination of the total Jewish population of Riga in November and December 1941.</span> <span id="s1499">That means nine months or ten months before.</span> <span id="s1500">A young man, a student of medicine, who escaped from Riga, worked for several months in a hospital as a non‑Jew, and a hospital in Stettin, and finally succeeds to get a visa for Switzerland where he has some relatives.</span> <span id="s1501">And when he arrives in Geneva, I am informed, and I have a meeting with him, and I question him for six or eight hours about what he knew, and he gives a very detailed report of how in two nights the Nazis?</span> <span id="s1502">, was militarykilled by machine gunsI think thirty‑six thousand or something Jews in two nights, among whom the very famous Jewish historian, Simon Dubnow, who was, by the way, very near the ideals of the World Jewish Congress and whom we revered very much.</span> <span id="s1503">Nobody knew about this.</span> <span id="s1504">For nine months the world was completely silent, that you can't kill suchdo such exterminations without anybody knowing.</span> <span id="s1505">It showed thatwhat was going on was terrible.</span> <span id="s1506">The third was even more intriguing.</span> <span id="s1507">One day I get a telephone call from a doctor in the Jewishin the hospital, a Jewish doctor in the hospital of Geneva, very fine lady, good friend of mine, said, "Come here.</span> <span id="s1508">I have to show you something very interesting," and it's worth my coming.</span> <span id="s1509">And I go to the hospital, and she receives meshe's dead also nowand says, "I have here a very strange patient.</span> <span id="s1510">He is under police surveillance, and you are not allowed to see him, and you are not allowed to mention it, but I cannot begrudge.</span> <span id="s1511">You know much more thego and see him."</span> <span id="s1512">And I spent six hours in the hospital and take down what this fellow tells me.</span> <span id="s1513">And it'sas I always say, in extraordinary times are extraordinary events.</span> <span id="s1514">A young man who is taken inAntwerp or Brusselsthis I forgotin Belgium, in one of these mass arrests, and being sent to the camp in Malines, from where they are deported to the east.</span> <span id="s1515">And he gives me the exact description on what happened every day in the process of deportation, from Malines in Belgium to Krakow, Katowice, up to Russia, where he finally ends up innearthe front of Stalingrad, near Rava Ruskaya.</span> <span id="s1516">And then he describes every station, what happened, and so on.</span> <span id="s1517">Not only he tells me he was input down, put toengaged in works for the fortification at the front.</span> <span id="s1518">And one day, an officer comes and asks somebody whetherwho could drive?</span> <span id="s1519">He needs a driver.</span> <span id="s1520">And as he is a mechanic, working inwas a Polish Jew living in Belgium, working in some mechanic(al) establishment, he offers himself, and he is taken.</span> <span id="s1521">And he isten days going with the German officer, accompanying him in his travels in the car.</span> <span id="s1522">And he uses this pportunity to ask the German officer, "What happened?</span> <span id="s1523">What happened there?</span> <span id="s1524">What happened here?</span> <span id="s1525">Why?"</span> <span id="s1526">And the German officer, who is fed up with the war, lost already two of his brothers, tells him, "It's very simple.</span> <span id="s1527">Those who are up to work, they take them to work.</span> <span id="s1528">Those who are not up to work, they be exterminated.</span> <span id="s1529">Those who are not any more up to work, they have the same fate."</span> <span id="s1530">So easy it was.</span> <span id="s1531">In three sentences, the whole tragedy of the Jewish people was described by this German officer.</span> <span id="s1532">And the German officer, as I said, who was fed up with the war, decides to save this Jew.</span> <span id="s1533">In an unbelievable story, he hides him in a train full of uniforms of people who fell in the battles around Stalingrad, and hides him in this train and gives him food and gives him occupation mark, and said, "You remain in the train until it stops.</span> <span id="s1534">And then you can try to get out."</span> <span id="s1535">And he leavesI don't knowfour or five days.</span> <span id="s1536">He didn't know himself how long it was.</span> <span id="s1537">And finally this train stops.</span> <span id="s1538">Finally, didn't move any more.</span> <span id="s1539">And he gets out, and he is near the Gare de l'Est in Paris.</span> <span id="s1540">Now, you imagine from Stalingrad practically, or Rava Ruskaya, toto Paris.</span> <span id="s1541">And hehe has some occupation marks.</span> <span id="s1542">He finds his way, he goes to the Plaetzl, finds Jewish advice, goes to the nonoccupied France and finds the way.</span> <span id="s1543">He comes over the mountains of Switzerland and is arrested by some of the soldiers, and as he is typicalas for many people deportedswollen feet andand bones and legs.</span> <span id="s1544">They bring him to the hospital to be treated.</span> <span id="s1545">And there he is.</span> <span id="s1546">Unbelievable that such things are possible.</span> <span id="s1547">But I questioned him.</span> <span id="s1548">You know, I was a kind of a judge onceinquisition judge in the proceedings which I had in the tribunal in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1549">And I questioned him for hours and hours.</span> <span id="s1550">Very simple person, straightforward, and there was no doubt that what he said was the truth.</span> <span id="s1551">And yet he gave the whole story.</span> <span id="s1552">From an eyewitness who had seen it.</span> <span id="s1553">And then comes the fourth, the most interesting in certain ways.</span> <span id="s1554">When we had the ideawe had the report from Schulte.</span> <span id="s1555">I suggested to Gugenheim that we should ask the Red Cross whether they had any reports which confirmed.</span> <span id="s1556">And making it not too official, we decided that he should privately ask the vice president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Carl Burckhardt, who is a colleague of his in the institute which I spoke, the Institute de Hautes Etudes Internationales, and he should ask him in the professors' loungenot in a formal way, but in a more private, confidential way.</span> <span id="s1557">And he does this, andsomewhere in the beginning of September.</span> <span id="s1558">And Burkhardt confirms to him that his reports are very similar, that he has confirmation from two German diplomats, the one from a member of the staff of the German foreign office, the other, a representative of the military establishment.</span> <span id="s1559">He says "Defense Department."</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q. War Ministry, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A. War Ministry.</span> <span id="s1562">It seems that this was not a very correct description, but it's clear that he meant the military establishment.</span> <span id="s1563">And very interesting.</span> <span id="s1564">He uses the words which are the key words in this whole process that means "Judenfrei", make the countries "Judenfrei."</span> <span id="s1565">When you read the reports which Heidrich made to Ribbentrop, the regular reports about the progress of the extermination process in the various countries, in all of these reports, you see "Judenfrei."</span> <span id="s1566">And Burckhardt knowssays "Judenfrei" as he says, wellthere is no possibility of settlement or of emigration.</span> <span id="s1567">It is clear that it means in reality the killing of the people.</span> <span id="s1568">Now, this, of course, is extremely important.</span> <span id="s1569">And Gugenheim was doubtful whether I should use this information.</span> <span id="s1570">In any caseI will come to it in a momentshortly after, we were invited by the American minister in Bern, Lichtheim and myself, to report to him what we knew about the whole process.</span> <span id="s1571">This was suggested by Wise to Sumner Welles, andand we were invited by the American minister.</span> <span id="s1572">And knowing what it was all about, because Wise informed us, put all what you have on the table to let peopleI saw they didn't believe us.</span> <span id="s1573">Maybe now is the moment or never.</span> <span id="s1574">And we write together a memorandum of about thirty‑five pages, with a short introduction.</span> <span id="s1575">And then we add all the reports which we have and some general evaluation of the situation in various countries, with all the annexes and the documents, including these letters from Warsaw, including the Sivian (?)</span> <span id="s1576">report, including the report from the man who was in Rava Ruskaya and Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1577">All together it's about thirty‑five pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q. Stop there.</span> <span id="s1579">Because they're about to run out of tape.</span> <span id="s1580">We'll talk about your meeting you and Lichtheim, meeting with Harrison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1583">Save that for the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A.</span> <span id="s1585">They have to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q. Dr. Riegner, you were about to tell us about the information, the memorandum you brought in for the American minister, Leland Harrison, in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A. Now, I felt very seriously that this was the decisive date.</span> <span id="s1589">Either they will believe us or they will not believe us.</span> <span id="s1590">And, therefore, I was decided to tell all I knew, including the name of the person from whom the original report came.</span> <span id="s1591">And we agreed that we would not pronounce the name, but we would put it on a piece of paper and give it to the minister in a closed envelope, and this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1592">On the other hand, I also decided that I had to inform the minister that theabout the Burckhardt interview of Gugenheim.</span> <span id="s1593">I felt that this was an extremely important, positive support for our whole story, and I had to tell it.</span> <span id="s1594">Gugenheim was not very happy about this.</span> <span id="s1595">He felt it was more of personal information, and I disregarded it and told the minister the whole story.</span> <span id="s1596">I said to him that I doubt that Gugenheim would confirm it in this way, but without naming the person, he may.</span> <span id="s1597">It wasthe meeting with the minister was extremely interesting.</span> <span id="s1598">He readI never had such a meeting with any diplomat in my life.</span> <span id="s1599">When he saw that we had prepared the memorandum, he immediately took it and started reading it.</span> <span id="s1600">We were in the room for probably twenty‑five, thirty minutes without any word was spoken.</span> <span id="s1601">When he had finished, he started again and asked questions.</span> <span id="s1602">What he thought of it, we couldn't guess.</span> <span id="s1603">Lichtheim, with a good sense of humor, said, "Mr. Poker Face."</span> <span id="s1604">And he looked like a poker face.</span> <span id="s1605">But as a matter of fact, as we know today, we convinced him on that date.</span> <span id="s1606">He didn't believe us before.</span> <span id="s1607">But the documentation, it convinced him, and he obviously gave a positive recommendation.</span> <span id="s1608">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1609">You may have readedread what exactly he wrote.</span> <span id="s1610">I have never seen it.</span> <span id="s1611">But it is clear that from that moment on, he was on our side.</span> <span id="s1612">He asked that Gugenheim should make an affidavit about what we told him, and he asked an affidavit from Sivian, and the name of the other fellow waswhom I met in the hospital I didn't give him.</span> <span id="s1613">I didn't want to make trouble for the doctor who let us in.</span> <span id="s1614">But I gave it later in a special letter to the embassy so they knew, also, that the manand maybe they have approached him.</span> <span id="s1615">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q. Sivian was the Latvian who described the massacres outside of Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s1618">But thethe other fellow wasnotthe name escapes me at the moment, but I have it if you want.</span> <span id="s1619">And I gave himgave them the address, too.</span> <span id="s1620">He was in the meantime in some of the internment camps in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1621">Well, thenthen something happened which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1622">He sent the consul in Geneva, Mr. Squire, to Burckhardt behind our back, and interviewed them, what he knew about the extermination policy and what he knew from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1623">And as a matter of fact, Burckhardt repeated to Squire exactly what he had told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">There are two notes from Squire which Mr. Moos found in the files of the State Department and which he sent to me afterwards.</span> <span id="s1625">It is exactly the same what he said toto Gugenheim.</span> <span id="s1626">Thatthe very strange fact remains that Burckhardt has never said these things to his own colleagues on the International Committee of the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1627">Professor FalVAY, who had access to everythingall the files in the International Red Cross, who has seen practically everything, confirms that there is no trace whatsoever of this.</span> <span id="s1628">And the strange thing is that Burckhardt tells very proudly to Squire that there was a proposal ofmaking a protest or appeal to the Germans on the part of the Red Cross, and hehe doesn't tell him that he was against it and voted against it and stopped it.</span> <span id="s1629">He presents it as if this was a great positive fact which he supported.</span> <span id="s1630">Now, these are very strange things.</span> <span id="s1631">And it's not very clear.</span> <span id="s1632">I have my ideas about this, why he did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q. Do you want to tell us what you</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A. I think it should really come somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q. All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A.</span> <span id="s1637">It doesn't fit in in the story at the moment.</span> <span id="s1638">But when we speak about the Red Cross, we can perhaps come back to it.</span> <span id="s1639">So when thisall these documents are arriving in Washington, in November, then everybody is now convinced that wewe have a case and we are right.</span> <span id="s1640">Three months or more have passed.</span> <span id="s1641">Every day, thousands of Jews have been killed.</span> <span id="s1642">And nothing has happened in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1643">But now Sumner welles allows Wise to go public, and he does.</span> <span id="s1644">Some people say it wasn't published insufficient publicity.</span> <span id="s1645">Maybe yes, maybe no.</span> <span id="s1646">In any case, the matter is public.</span> <span id="s1647">And this now leavesand here I made a mistakeI went already to the Declaration of the 17th of December.</span> <span id="s1648">Perhaps we can turn this around in the tape.</span> <span id="s1649">Wewe get to this Declaration which was published simultaneously in Washington, in London, and in Moscow on the 17th of December, anddenouncing the extermination of the Jewish people and threatening the responsible with punishment after the war.</span> <span id="s1650">In London, it is done in the form of a question in Parliament to the government, and Sydney Silverman asked this question, which Eden replies.</span> <span id="s1651">And a very moving gesture: The whole Parliament stands up for two minutes to pay tribute, homage to the victims.</span> <span id="s1652">And a manEden himself says he was struck by the emotion which prevailed in the House.</span> <span id="s1653">And a man like Lloyd George, who was the oldest member of the Parliament, said he had never seen anything alike in the history of the British Parliament.</span> <span id="s1654">But this, of course, didn't make the people alive again.</span> <span id="s1655">And we wait now for action.</span> <span id="s1656">And as I said, there are negotiations, and finally it is decided to meet in the Bermudas and to discuss what action is to be taken.</span> <span id="s1657">This is the moment where the Jewish organizations in America, everywhere outside in the free world, get very active and devise an actions program of what should be done and what can be done.</span> <span id="s1658">And this program is being formulated andwith fifteen points.</span> <span id="s1659">We may be coming back on some of the points when we say what happened and what didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1660">In any case, it's not true that the Jews were not prepared for action, but the governments were not prepared for action.</span> <span id="s1661">That is the truth.</span> <span id="s1662">And Bermuda is chosen so that thethe public cannot follow too much what's going on.</span> <span id="s1663">Nobody is allowed access to the conference.</span> <span id="s1664">The whole thing is kept in great secret, and the great secret that only comes out very slowlythe great secret is that they didn't decide anything.</span> <span id="s1665">Now, when this becomes true, when this becomes public, when this gets out, this is the most crucial moment in the whole history of the war for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1666">And the people are completely shaken.</span> <span id="s1667">Yitzhak Greenberg, one of the very respected members of the Jewish community here, of the laborJewish labor movement, writes a famous article, "Bankrupt," and at this moment, in effect, it was complete bankruptcy.</span> <span id="s1668">Now we come later back to the reason why nothing was undertaken.</span> <span id="s1669">But here the most important thing is this: There have been attacks later against the leadership and especially against Stephen Wise and the Zionist leadership that they did not use their influence to push through a program.</span> <span id="s1670">And they are accused of having sacrificed the rescue effort to the</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q. Zionist cause?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A.to the importance of the fight for the establishment of a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s1673">This is, in my opinion, a very unjust accusation.</span> <span id="s1674">Theyone puts the cart before the horse.</span> <span id="s1675">In reality, what has happened is that for the first time, the Jewish establishment understands that it cannot in this tragic situation count on our best friends.</span> <span id="s1676">It's a bankruptcy of the effort of rescue, which puts everybody into the position that if we cannot count on our best friends in such a tragic situation, then we have to have ourselves some sovereignty so that we can act.</span> <span id="s1677">It is not the sacrifice of the rescue effort to the idea of establishment of a state.</span> <span id="s1678">But the establishment of the state is the aimthe first aim in the Jewish war aims.</span> <span id="s1679">It is the consequence of the bankruptcy of the rescue effort, of being abandoned by our best friends in whom we counted that they would do something.</span> <span id="s1680">And it's very unjust to confuse these issues.</span> <span id="s1681">And I think we have to correct this and we have to make this understood.</span> <span id="s1682">Wise has always tried still.</span> <span id="s1683">He was not the naive person many people want to see in him.</span> <span id="s1684">There is a letter which he writes to Nahum Goldman inI think it's April 1943, just during the time of the Bermuda conference.</span> <span id="s1685">And Goldman isfor the Passover holiday somewhere in the countryside.</span> <span id="s1686">And Wise keeps him informed in this letter and writes to him, "The things are as we foresaw, going very bad, and from bad to worse.</span> <span id="s1687">Some people say we should publicly denounce the President.</span> <span id="s1688">I believe this would be a mistake.</span> <span id="s1689">He can still try.</span> <span id="s1690">If we attack him, too, it will deprive us of our last support, and it will only give great satisfaction to the Congress, which is a really anti‑Semitic Congressin this country."</span> <span id="s1691">Such lettersand it should be shown in your archives hereshow that he was by far not a naive person whom people want him to be, that he was by far not blindly following Roosevelt in these things.</span> <span id="s1692">The relationship between Wise and Roosevelt went up and down in various ways, and it's not so simple at all.</span> <span id="s1693">But he had great admiration for Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1694">There is no doubt.</span> <span id="s1695">And what Roosevelt did and what Roosevelt did not do I think is one of the points which we have to discuss also in the following discussions.</span> <span id="s1696">This chapter, therefore, ends with a terrible negative despair.</span> <span id="s1697">Nothing is happening, and we are attending, we are assisting at the killing of millions of Jews without any active counteraction.</span> <span id="s1698">I did not stop making proposals and reporting.</span> <span id="s1699">I was terribly pessimistic.</span> <span id="s1700">But my feeling was, you have to try, and if you don't succeed, you have to try again and you have to try again.</span> <span id="s1701">And I had enough energy to keep this through.</span> <span id="s1702">My good friend Lichtheim was even more pessimistic than I. And he wrote lots of letters, description which are today very valuable because they show the situation as it was.</span> <span id="s1703">I wrote much less letters.</span> <span id="s1704">I didn't like to write open letters through the mail which I knew would all fall into German hands and through the German censorship.</span> <span id="s1705">But I triedover again and again to get some ideas through and some rescue proposals.</span> <span id="s1706">And there are a number of very important reports, which you will find in the files of the Congress, in January 1943 and later, and one of the most important is the report of the telegram of April 1943, in which I make again a number of very important rescue proposals.</span> <span id="s1707">This telegram had also its special fate.</span> <span id="s1708">In the meantime, the State Department had instructed the embassy in Bern not to transmit any more private messages or messages of private organizations.</span> <span id="s1709">It is in reality meant against me.</span> <span id="s1710">The reason was if we cut off the source, then the Jewish organizations in New York cannot cry and cannot push us and cannot threaten us.</span> <span id="s1711">It was a very simple way.</span> <span id="s1712">But whenin April, the consul in Geneva and the minister in Bern saw that I had very important proposals to make, they didn't understand why they shouldn't communicate this to Washington.</span> <span id="s1713">They considered it very important.</span> <span id="s1714">So finallythey didn't tell me that they had these instructions.</span> <span id="s1715">But theythey said there were some problems.</span> <span id="s1716">Finally, they came to a very funny conclusion, whether I was ready to pay for the telegram.</span> <span id="s1717">So I was puzzled by this proposal.</span> <span id="s1718">And I said immediately "Yes."</span> <span id="s1719">It was the most expensive telegram I ever sent in my life.</span> <span id="s1720">It was practically a full salaryalthough my salary wasn't very highbut nearly two hundred dollars it was.</span> <span id="s1721">You can imagine for what I worked at the time.</span> <span id="s1722">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1723">In the long run, it was a very cheap telegram.</span> <span id="s1724">It put into actionreally, it led to the establishment of the War Refugee Board, of all the actions which were undertaken.</span> <span id="s1725">And when you put it in relation to this, it was a very, very cheap, cheap telegram.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">In any case, this telegram suggested two great actions.</span> <span id="s1727">One was the rescue action in Romania.</span> <span id="s1728">I had been informed by the Jewish community leaders in Romania through the Red Cross that there was a change in attitude of Marshall Antonescu and the Minister of the Interior with regard to the Jews and there may be possibilities of emigration from the Jews in Transnistria to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1729">Now, this was sensational news, of course.</span> <span id="s1730">And they askedbut they needed funds for this.</span> <span id="s1731">And the fundsand there was a very original idea, that the funds would not have to be transferred to Romania, but could be put in ain a blocked account in Switzerland until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1732">Now, this was a very attractive and sensational idea.</span> <span id="s1733">The second was the effortand this came from the people who were in the Jewish underground in France, Belgium, and Hollanda concerted effort to evacuate as many youngsters and children from these three countries towards Spain or towards Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1734">And that they needed for this money, they needed for this weapons, they needed for this all kinds of material.</span> <span id="s1735">They needed machines to falsify papers, identity papers, ration cards, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1736">And this was the second great proposal.</span> <span id="s1737">When this telegram arrived in New York, they went to the Jewish authorities.</span> <span id="s1738">The matter was brought to Roosevelt himself and to Morgenthau, and apparently they agreed with the plans.</span> <span id="s1739">Although this was really going out of the normal ways.</span> <span id="s1740">But April passed, May passed, June passed.</span> <span id="s1741">In July, Stephen Wise goes to Morgenthau, and says, "What happens?</span> <span id="s1742">Nothing has happened.</span> <span id="s1743">Where are you?"</span> <span id="s1744">Mr. Morgenthau says, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1745">We have agreed for a long time that this should happen."</span> <span id="s1746">And there he charges two of his assistants, Bader (Baylor ?)</span> <span id="s1747">and DuBois, to find out what happened.</span> <span id="s1748">And there comes the famous report of the two Protestant assistants of Morgenthau after having approached some of the people in the State Department, and they find out that the wholesabotage which is taking place in the State Department all the time, from the beginning of the suppression of my cable, from the instruction not to send any cables to me, up to the sabotage of this great rescue plan.</span> <span id="s1749">And they write a report for Morgenthau, which theyto which they give.</span> <span id="s1750">The report is published.</span> <span id="s1751">Everybody can read it today.</span> <span id="s1752">It's a terrible indictment against the Department and isthey give it the title, "On the Acquiescence of This Government in the Mass Murder of the Jews."</span> <span id="s1753">Now, Morgenthau agrees, but the title is, after all, a little bit too strong, and he calls it "Report to the President."</span> <span id="s1754">But he is more clever than to give themhim the report.</span> <span id="s1755">He asks his legal advisor, Professor Cox, to prepare a positive proposal of how to deal with these matters.</span> <span id="s1756">And he comes with the idea of a refugeeWar Refugee Board composed of representatives of the State Department, the reasury, and the War Department, which should be entrusted with the special task to deal with the problems of the victims of Nazi persecution and the help which can be given to them.</span> <span id="s1757">Roosevelt sees that the report of the two assistants is dynamite and sees that something has to be done and accepts quite favorably the idea of the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s1758">But in the meantime, Morgenthau is clever enough not to antagonize too much the State Department andwhat's his name?</span> <span id="s1759">Secretary of State?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q. Cordell Hull?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A. Cordell Hull.</span> <span id="s1762">Cordell Hull.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1764">Hull was</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A. Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1766">And he makes some approaches, and Cordell Hull gives in, and suddenly something happens and nobody understands why.</span> <span id="s1767">I am called on the day before Christmas, 23rd or '4th of 1943, to the legation in Bern, and say, "What?</span> <span id="s1768">What have you done?</span> <span id="s1769">The whole policy and theon the financial blockade and the food blockade, it's all set aside.</span> <span id="s1770">What happened?</span> <span id="s1771">What?"</span> <span id="s1772">And I didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1773">This was Wise's and Morgenthau's doing here.</span> <span id="s1774">In any case, full of admiration, I get handed out a document, the first license in which the World Jewish Congress is authorized to send to me as the first amount, twenty‑five thousand dollars for rescue activity in favor of victims of Nazi persecution.</span> <span id="s1775">And one tells me that I can make proposals to change the text, and so on, and that it is only a first gesture, and if it works well, it can be repeated, and so on, and enlarged, and so on.</span> <span id="s1776">But it is really a breakthrough, complete breakthrough.</span> <span id="s1777">And what we know today is that in the last moment, the British embassy in Bern tried on the request of the Ministry of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q. Economic Welfare?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A.Economic Welfare to stop this thing.</span> <span id="s1780">And it holds up the whole thing for two weeks, I believe.</span> <span id="s1781">But it is finally accepted.</span> <span id="s1782">So this was really a Christmas gift.</span> <span id="s1783">And then they really didn't know what happened and how it gotmy shares went up very high in the embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q. Hanukkah came on Christmas that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A.</span> <span id="s1786">It was.</span> <span id="s1787">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1788">It was on Christmas.</span> <span id="s1789">And now, thethe rules were very strict and unworkable, and I immediately said that this is not possible in this way.</span> <span id="s1790">I made certain observations.</span> <span id="s1791">After a few days, theythey changed the rules and gave it a better formula and less strict, and then without my commenting again, a third text came in.</span> <span id="s1792">And the third text comes in the day which the War Refugee Board is created.</span> <span id="s1793">You see the direct link of this action with the creation of the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s1794">And now we worked under this, I have to report, and it's very complicated.</span> <span id="s1795">But it is a breakthrough.</span> <span id="s1796">And the establishment of the War Refugee Board is really the one great positive decision which has been made.</span> <span id="s1797">I am not saying itI am not saying it'swhatever, the War Refugee Board was wonderful, but at least it was a serious effort to help.</span> <span id="s1798">And from this moment on, we got support of all the embassies all over Europe, in Stockholm and in Bern, and in Turkey, in Ankara, and in Spain, and in Portugal.</span> <span id="s1799">And we really felt the government behind us.</span> <span id="s1800">And something which is most important, during the last year, from January 1944 to end of May, the end of the war, in May, '45, that twenty million dollars were channeled through the War Refugee BoardJewish money, not other moneythis we also have to talkwere channeled tofor efforts to rescue Jews, to help Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution.</span> <span id="s1801">It is the one great thing which has happened.</span> <span id="s1802">And I am very happy that this came out of my normal activities, and it was directly linked to these plans, the plans themselves, the Romanian situation.</span> <span id="s1803">It could never be reestablished.</span> <span id="s1804">Antonescu changed his mind.</span> <span id="s1805">It wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s1806">The situationthe whole plan fell through because it was eight months between when I suggested it and when it happened.</span> <span id="s1807">The other question of the help for the rescue of the children and youngsters, and bringing them out to Spain and to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1808">It waswas applied.</span> <span id="s1809">This is one of the three great parts in the rescue efforts in which I took thea personala personal part.</span> <span id="s1810">But this is thereally the story.</span> <span id="s1811">It took eighteen months from my first report in August until something at all was done.</span> <span id="s1812">And I tell you, it was one of the most terrible times in my life.</span> <span id="s1813">I saw one report after another, full of gloom and disaster, and waiting for the world to react, andand nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s1814">It was really the moment of our greatest need, and we were terribly lonely and abandoned during that whole period, and during this period millions of Jews were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q. Now, let me go back for a second to the Romanian situation.</span> <span id="s1816">I know that the plan to have Jews emigrate from Romania did not work in part because of German objections and Romanian objections.</span> <span id="s1817">But I was under the impression that that scheme of using money, money deposited in Swiss accounts, then was used to persuade people within Romania itself to lend money to keep Jews in Romania itself alive.</span> <span id="s1818">Now, I don't know that the World Jewish Congress was involved in that, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A. No.</span> <span id="s1820">There was somethingI don't know.</span> <span id="s1821">I wasn't any more involved there.</span> <span id="s1822">But Kolb one of the Red Cross people helped in this respect.</span> <span id="s1823">The details I don't know.</span> <span id="s1824">But the whole thing was this idea, to finance things and to be paid at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1825">It worked not only there.</span> <span id="s1826">It worked also in France and other places.</span> <span id="s1827">I know that we paid a lots of money later for what our friends in France had taken as loans, and we were presented with it, and the Joint, the same.</span> <span id="s1828">This was a great, great part.</span> <span id="s1829">But there was a political change.</span> <span id="s1830">There was a certain moment where the otherAntonescu had greater power, I think, and that disappeared apparently afterwards.</span> <span id="s1831">But the details I forgot.</span> <span id="s1832">You know, something which doesn't work, you don'tyou are not so interested any more.</span> <span id="s1833">You are interested in things which work.</span> <span id="s1834">But I believe it'swhat I have now to say is what thethanks to the War Refugee Boardfunctioned and what didn't function, and there are a certain number of things in which they have certainly helped.</span> <span id="s1835">There is criticism they could have done.</span> <span id="s1836">The greatest criticism, of course, is that it started in January, '44.</span> <span id="s1837">Could have started in '42 instead of in '44.</span> <span id="s1838">And this is one thing.</span> <span id="s1839">But on the other hand, I must sayI didn't say it until nowmy great hero is Morgenthau.</span> <span id="s1840">Without him we would never have had this.</span> <span id="s1841">He really pushed it through with Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1842">There is no doubt.</span> <span id="s1843">His assistants discovered and disclosed what happened.</span> <span id="s1844">This in itself is a great service.</span> <span id="s1845">And by the way, when Morgenthau had his seventieth birthdayno.</span> <span id="s1846">When Wise had his seventieth birthday, orgenthau made a speech and said he would never forget.</span> <span id="s1847">And Wise and Jimmy, his son, came to him and showed him the telegram which I did.</span> <span id="s1848">And then after the war, Wise sent me to Morgenthau.</span> <span id="s1849">He would like to make your acquaintance.</span> <span id="s1850">And I was with him for an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s1851">He questioned me about the people, and so on.</span> <span id="s1852">When I came in, he looked at me.</span> <span id="s1853">He is a very tall fellow, you know.</span> <span id="s1854">I am not so talland looked at methe face, a little at an angle, said, "So, this is the fellow who changed my life."</span> <span id="s1855">This was what he said to me.</span> <span id="s1856">Which, of course, moved me very much.</span> <span id="s1857">But he became back a JudeJew.</span> <span id="s1858">And this was very, very far away.</span> <span id="s1859">But I revere Morgenthaunot for the Morgenthau plan, which didn't function in any case, but also for generally what he did, together with the friend and assistant of the presidentin the White House.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q. Cox or</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A. No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q. Hopkins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A. Hopkins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A. What's his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q. Harry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A. Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q. Harry Hopkins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s1870">They together supported the Lend and Lease.</span> <span id="s1871">Hopkins.</span> <span id="s1872">And Morgenthau supported him.</span> <span id="s1873">Without Lend and Lease, I don't know whether Britain would have come through the war.</span> <span id="s1874">This is a decisive moment, and it's not an accident, that in the general scene and on the Jewish scene, Morgenthau was deeply involved.</span> <span id="s1875">Imagine for a moment what would have happened if Britain would have gone down.</span> <span id="s1876">It would not be only Britain.</span> <span id="s1877">It would not only be 400,000 Jewish in Britain being under Hitler.</span> <span id="s1878">It would be the breakdown in Palestine and the Middle East.</span> <span id="s1879">The 600,000 Jews in Palestine who are today the basis of the Jewish Renaissance and of the Jewish state.</span> <span id="s1880">Imagine that the British government would have gone down and Alexandria would be open to Rommel, and they would have gone into Israel.</span> <span id="s1881">The whole idea of Israel would have disappeared.</span> <span id="s1882">You cannot even imagine it, what this may be, because we are living in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q. Well, the whole course of the war might have been different.</span> <span id="s1884">It might have gone on years longer, with millions of more people dying who knows where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A. Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1886">But that certainlythat another million Jews would have been under Hitler.</span> <span id="s1887">And the present situation of the Renaissance of the Jewish people would be wiped out, and nonobody can even imagine what this would have been ifif Britain had beenhad gone under.</span> <span id="s1888">And this is the part wherewhere we owe gratitude to Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1889">He didn't do enough.</span> <span id="s1890">He didn't do much to help us.</span> <span id="s1891">But it is certain it preventedthis additional catastrophe and this part of the war, too, which we shouldn't forget.</span> <span id="s1892">And I, personally, with all my reservations andthat the most decent person was Mrs. Roosevelt in this whole thing.</span> <span id="s1893">She at least tried, but she didn't prevail upon her husband, either.</span> <span id="s1894">I must say that this shouldn't be forgotten, either.</span> <span id="s1895">And it wouldn't have happened without Hopkins and Morgenthau, who gave it from the beginningand this results very clearly from the Gilbert book on Churchill, the great part he played in this.</span> <span id="s1896">I therefore, I said my hero in this whole story is Morgenthau.</span> <span id="s1897">Andmy personal memory is very moved by the words with which he greeted me when I met him at the time.</span> <span id="s1898">Now, I think we can finish here.</span> <span id="s1899">This is a good moment to finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q.</span> <span id="s1901">How late do you want us to keep going?</span> <span id="s1902">This is a natural break point.</span> <span id="s1903">Can we possibly take up the next time right here?</span> <span id="s1904">Do you want to stop here for now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A. Well, I thinkwhat is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q. It's about 4:20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A. And we are already an hour late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q. I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A.</span> <span id="s1910">We are already an hour late?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1912">They'll put up with it somehow.</span> <span id="s1913">I think we should stop here, Holly, and take up next time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A. Well, I thinkwhat we have tothere are three</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q.</span> <span id="s1916">We need to talk about still some things like the bombing of Auschwitz and some of the War Refugee Board activities, and then we need to go back and talk about your ideas on bureaucracy and the Allies, what should have been done, why it wasn't done at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A. No.</span> <span id="s1918">But we have to do what was done, positively.</span> <span id="s1919">And why was not donewhy was so little done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A.</span> <span id="s1922">This is really I think one should start now, why was so little done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A. And the reasons.</span> <span id="s1925">And then what was nevertheless done?</span> <span id="s1926">And then you can ask me some other question.</span> <span id="s1927">I think we made quite a progress now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A. Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q.</span> <span id="s1931">We stillI think we need to talk moreat least about the International Red Cross, andWe should say something about the Red Cross, about the Vatican...</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">END OF PART I</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">GERHART RIEGNER</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">May 11, 1992</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A:.</span> <span id="s1936">.</span> <span id="s1937">in in...when I was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1938">This was still the Budapest under Communist regime.</span> <span id="s1939">It was very difficult to have conversations.</span> <span id="s1940">You were, of course, followed everywhere and you were under supervision everywhere and you had to be very careful what you talked about, and more was a delightful (laugher) subject which nobody could uh uh object to.</span> <span id="s1941">And so I told one evening this story and and uh the dinner where I was invited and the major Jewish uh personalities of the various groups, they they...all through those communities, the liberal community, Zionist...they were all there and uh the result was that a few months uh weeks later, I got from the office of the World Jewish Congress in Budapest a letter, saying you told us this interesting...</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">BREAK IN TAPE ...and report what they lived through.</span> <span id="s1943">And we have here about four thousand such uh witnesses and there are some which write and speak about uh the and the .</span> <span id="s1944">Are you interested in these .</span> <span id="s1945">.</span> <span id="s1946">reports?</span> <span id="s1947">Now I personally, of course, I was interested but uh the uh those who really needed it was uh the the international authority pursuing the the , so«I looked for an opportunity to get in touch with the people who were involved in the in the uh prosecution of the people and I wrote a letter and there was no uh personal communication since Germany was still completely cut out from the circulation, normal circulation, and uh and I learned that Kastner was asked to uh to go as a witness to Nuremburg and they asked him to take a letter to uh to Nuremburg and give it to the uh uh competent prosecutor.</span> <span id="s1948">And he did this, and when he came back he told me the story which was very uh stranger He didn't...this was typical of Kastner.</span> <span id="s1949">He didn't just give the letter (laughter) to to the prosecutor who was Mr. , the assistant...the former assistant of of uh .</span> <span id="s1950">He, by the way, has written a full book about the uh the prosecution about against and the and so on, and when he came to...when Kastner came to , whom he didn't of course know, he was there in order to give witness in the case against Baker (ph) and the people with whom he had cooperated, and when he gave the the letter, the prosecutor looked at the signaturea found my signature, and said something like, hum, very reliable.</span> <span id="s1951">Very reliable.</span> <span id="s1952">Now he was, of course, fascinated and flabbergasted... how does this man know my name with all, and (coughing) and asked him.</span> <span id="s1953">Then he told him, you know, this i8 a long story.</span> <span id="s1954">I can't tell you this now but if you have time in the evening, we can go have dinner together and I'll tell you the story.</span> <span id="s1955">And so it .</span> <span id="s1956">.</span> <span id="s1957">happened, and it happened that he told him the whole story which you'll find them in Morganthal's diaries which were published in Collier's a few months later.</span> <span id="s1958">I heard this story the first time from Kastner.</span> <span id="s1959">Was a little bit uh doubtful, but when I came uh uh a month or two months later to the United States, this issue of Collier's appeared, while I was there, and for the first time the whole story came out and uh I must say I was very impressed by by the .</span> <span id="s1960">They are very fine uh uh civil servants and we owe them much that this sabotage will see uh State Department, they came out and and was acknowledged.</span> <span id="s1961">There was a clear line in the State Department which really didn't want to be cooperative.</span> <span id="s1962">I think the head of it was Breckenridge Long (ph), uh one of the higher officials in the State Department who was put there by Roosevelt because he or his family had given considerable funds to to the election...electoral funds of Roosevelt, but really the the policy which they pursued I don't think really were in the line of of Rooseveltts liberal attitudes.</span> <span id="s1963">Uh Breckenridge Long really considered his holy duty to keep the Jews out of America.</span> <span id="s1964">I think this can without reservation be affirmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q:Uh there are those historians who say that uh Peter Berksen and his organization...</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">BREAK IN TAPE</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A:This I have heard many times.</span> <span id="s1968">I personally believe that this i8 highly exaggerated.</span> <span id="s1969">Uh I believe one can argue very uh uh with with great justification that my telegram of April 1943 with all the proposals it contained, uh has led directly to the establishment of the of the uh uh refugee board.</span> <span id="s1970">I think when when these proposals were submitted to Morganthal and , and were approved by both, and nothing happened, and found out in July which means several months later that nothing happened and went to Morganthal and complained, and that led to the decisive action of Morganthal.</span> <span id="s1971">One...in the asking of the report asking the two assistants the boys they paid to find out what really happened, and number two, he he he...really on the basis of this reportt he was able to go to the President and to complain.</span> <span id="s1972">Thirdly, he was able at the same time, not only to present this famous report on the acquiescence of this government in the mass murder of the Jews, he was able to use this opportunity to come with a positive suggestion, and this positive suggestion he had uh prepared it with his uh legal advisor, Professor , and this was the idea of the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s1973">Now uh I believe he has a direct line.</span> <span id="s1974">As a matter of fact, uh even the way in which the matters proceeded, uh when I got just before Christmas the first license, and I talked about this already, and then the revised form ten days later and then another revised form uh making business easier.</span> <span id="s1975">Uh had made all kinds of criticism of the strictness of the uh .</span> <span id="s1976">Again, about two weeks or three weeks later, and the second revised form is really the day when the War Refugee Board was established and the facility of these licenses extended to everybody.</span> <span id="s1977">Now here is a very clear line to show that this was really the outcome of these plans which I had submitted and which Morganthal picked up and and used as the major uh material in order to ask the President finally to act.</span> <span id="s1978">He was uh a great politician.</span> <span id="s1979">He himself used some of the uh propaganda of Birksen (ph) to put it...to the disposal of his _i own policy.</span> <span id="s1980">But he used it.</span> <span id="s1981">It was not that they had really the decisive influence.</span> <span id="s1982">There are uh for a long time plans from this extremist groups uh that they had decisive influence on things as they developed.</span> <span id="s1983">I contest this very much.</span> <span id="s1984">I think that uh they may have had an influence on public opinion at certain moments to uh raise the consciousness of the the public, which I will not contest, but on the real action I don't think they had any decisive influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q:Uh what were the most important actions of the War Refugee Board as you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A:Well, let me say...I mean the War Refugee Board has also been criticized a number of times and said that certainly, rightlyt it was too late.</span> <span id="s1987">It was much too late.</span> <span id="s1988">It was...it came into force in the beginning of uh 1944.</span> <span id="s1989">If it would have been established a year earlier or two years earlier, it would have been probably much more efficient, but nevertheless, it was mainly the only decisive action which was taken, and the whole situation changed uh all over.</span> <span id="s1990">We had really the support of the American embassies and legatlons all over.</span> <span id="s1991">In in Stockholm and in Lisbon .</span> <span id="s1992">.</span> <span id="s1993">and in and in Bern, and in Ankara and so on.</span> <span id="s1994">And this never happened before.</span> <span id="s1995">Here is really, and this you have to acknowledge even if you're perhaps critical on some of the actions he could have done more, but it was a decisive effect.</span> <span id="s1996">Number two...during the period during which it was active, that means generally '44 to ,' | i May '45...this early the end of the war, uh twenty million dollars have been uced, Jewish money...I come to this later...twenty million dollars have been used in order to alleviate the fate of the persecuted, the Nazi persecuted victims, Jews and lots of nonJews, uh but the great majority, of course, Jews, and the the money was Jewish money.</span> <span id="s1997">Now with this money, lots of things have been done but it was not only the money.</span> <span id="s1998">It was also the determination to explore all possibilities by which Jews uh people...victims could be helped and and the uh action of the Nazis counter‑acted.</span> <span id="s1999">Uh my opinion, there were a number of things which were finally uh were obtained.</span> <span id="s2000">Uh on the one hand, for instance, there were a few uh...which has nothing to do directly with the War Refugee Board but it has to be mentioned as something which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh agreements.</span> <span id="s2001">There was a number of of uh prisoners of war who especially wounded and and heavily wounded who were exchanged as through the Red Cross, and there was a great number of Palestinian Jews amongst them.</span> <span id="s2002">I Aaw the the train passing through Geneva.</span> <span id="s2003">Uh these were important actions.</span> <span id="s2004">The second is a certain...I'm not exaggerating...a aertain alleviation of the situation in the neutral aountries.</span> <span id="s2005">Uh not direct guarantees were given, but they were encouraged and they were told .</span> <span id="s2006">.</span> <span id="s2007">well, we will help you after the war to distribute the people that not...shouldn't be only on on on your charge.</span> <span id="s2008">This could have been much more energetically pursued, in my opinion (coughing) and it should have been.</span> <span id="s2009">I believe that Switzerland could have taken in the double or the triple of of people which they they took in, and w they're they're not so many countries who can say they took as many as Switzerland did, but but...and this was the general situation.</span> <span id="s2010">But this was important.</span> <span id="s2011">Then the what I said referred indirectly of any.</span> <span id="s2012">.</span> <span id="s2013">the end of the uh financial blockade and of the food blockade in favor of the victims.</span> <span id="s2014">This is really a great decision, and I quoted how I was received in Bern when the first license came and they were very astonished because the British had blockade and so the ministry of uh.</span> <span id="s2015">.</span> <span id="s2016">I don't remember...economic warfare I think it was the name in Britain...uh tried to stop the license until the last moment, and in fact it was given to me several weeks after it was also was to be delivered.</span> <span id="s2017">Now this was really important.</span> <span id="s2018">Uh really there was no no uh lack of money any more.</span> <span id="s2019">If you really wanted to do something, the money was available.</span> <span id="s2020">Uh I wouldn't say that Sonny Meyer (ph) and others who disposed _ , they had some problems there.</span> <span id="s2021">And we certainly had problems, uh couldn't raise the money in Europe at the time, (coughing) and the the food blockade.</span> <span id="s2022">I mean I never...I think I said it already...I never observed a food blockade.</span> <span id="s2023">I uh 1 disobeyed my colleagues and my superiors in America in this matter.</span> <span id="s2024">They were not very happy, but ".</span> <span id="s2025">I considered that I was in a neutral country and I could use uh and .</span> <span id="s2026">\ should use whatever I could in helping starving Jews in the occupied territories and this would...but a great action.</span> <span id="s2027">I think , it was engaged and food passes by the Joint through the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2028">T think they gave them a million dollars or something like it, and this was done now under in a in a very...in a much larger uh uh proportion as it was possible before.</span> <span id="s2029">: .</span> <span id="s2030">!</span> <span id="s2031">8 I myself...the the Congress...the World Congress office in Geneva has uh during the war sent hundreds of thousands of of parcels, uh mostly from Portugal, small parcels but uh which certainly have have helped thousands and thousands of people to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q:Let me stop you there for a second.</span> <span id="s2033">They have to fix something in the room.</span> <span id="s2034">They're shutting off the tape.</span> <span id="s2035">Just a few seconds....</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q:Dr.Riegner, you were telling us about the actions that the War Refugee Board took or made possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s2038">Uh I spoke about the uh the big .</span> <span id="s2039">Now uh the next point I would like to underline is the support which was given to the actlvities of the underground uh in order to help Jews on the spot uh to survive through uh thanks to false papers which were used in great masses, uh papers of every kind uh especially uh ration cards which had to be renewed every month uh could use in the tens of thousands and the hundred thousands probably.</span> <span id="s2040">Identity papers, false identity papers, uh baptismal certificates which were of course not , but uh showed that the people were not Jews, uh uh working permits, uh every kind of identity and uh identity cards and so on which could be used in very very larte masses...uh numbers and uh we had in France but particularly groups who were charged with this job.</span> <span id="s2041">And it was not only this helped uh tens of thousands of people to maintain themselves, to hide and to somehow disappear under the general population.</span> <span id="s2042">On the other hand, there was a special service established in western Europe by the Jewish uh resistance movement which tried particularly to organize the immigration of Jewish youngsters uh towards spain and Portugal and then the free world, or towards Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2043">And uh these groups uh were extremely successful They brought several thousand children to Switzerland, a number of them with their parents.</span> <span id="s2044">There were several hundred parents also came.</span> <span id="s2045">Uh there were a considerable number of youngsters accompanied by armed uh uh conduct to the Spanish frontier and uh then they came out to the $ree world.</span> <span id="s2046">Uh this is...was one of the most successful activities and covered, as I said, thousands of people.</span> <span id="s2047">Uh of course, you would have liked to do much more.</span> <span id="s2048">It was directed outside particular by my colleague Mark Yahblume (ph) who was one of the French leaders who wrote from nineteen hundred and fortythree and nineteen hundred to the end of the war...was nearly end of the war in Geneva in my office, and we did this together.</span> <span id="s2049">Uh he got money from the World Jewish Congress, from the Jewish agency, from the Joint, from the trade union movement, and uh altogether this was by the way one of the finest compilation and and rescue of of all kinds thanks to a person uh which was accepted in and which was...who was active in thi6 and kept the uh contact with the groups in in the occupied territories.</span> <span id="s2050">Uh this is one of the finest things I think uh which took place and I'm very proud to have been personally involved in this and have helped in this.</span> <span id="s2051">Another very important action and this was the political .</span> <span id="s2052">.</span> <span id="s2053">10 action to save uh whatever could be saved of the Hungarian Jews in 1945.</span> <span id="s2054">Uh here again something happened which is very strange.</span> <span id="s2055">We knew uh and I was responsible to warn before the Hungary was even occupied.</span> <span id="s2056">You can see in the files telegrams which I sent and and...several weeks before the actual started of the occupation of Hungary, and immediately when it was undertaken, there's another great telegram where I asked uh what should be done in order to counteract it and it should be made public counteractions so the medias or the radio and so on, through t‑he free radio from London and the and the...it should be very...an action encouraging not to cooperate with the Nazis, encouraging the non‑Jews to help the Jews, to hide them and 80 on.</span> <span id="s2057">There's a whole program which uh they have suggested to the free world and which was uh I believe to a certain degree used in uh by the the media and so on.</span> <span id="s2058">But uh | uh the strange thing which happened in the case of the Hungarian Jews was that uh from March to June uh 1944, there came practically no direct news out from Hungary, except what we read in the newspapers t in the legal gazettes and so on.</span> <span id="s2059">So what legally happened we knew, but that in these three months, half the Jews of Hungary were sent to to to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2060">It was practically unknown.</span> <span id="s2061">Uh here the Red Cross played a very uh un... .</span> <span id="s2062">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A:Unhelpful?</span> <span id="s2064">|</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q:Unhelpful role.</span> <span id="s2066">They kept some of the reports from as | we know now from Budapest and the Jewish organizations and didn't !</span> <span id="s2067">11 deliver them to the people who who were uh meant to receive them.</span> <span id="s2068">They are direct requests from the Jewish community to give these reports and we received them a month later when uh nothing could be done anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q:We need to talk more about the Red Cross and we need to talk more about Hungary, but I want to stop you right here and ask you something more about Auschwitz, because its its come up in aontext.</span> <span id="s2070">Uh there is, of course, uh an argument from some of the scholarly literature that while the outside world knew generally what was going on in terms of the extermination camps and so forth, that it did not know about Auschwitz, Birken...not know specifically about the gas chambers and and crematoria at Birkenau, uh even up until the middle of 1944.</span> <span id="s2071">Do you want to to comment on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A:Well, that's probably true, that we didn't know.</span> <span id="s2073">Uh we knew that things were happening in all kinds of places, but the uh concrete knowledge about the gas ovens, where they were exactlyw uh came much later, and the the report of the two Slovakian Jews was certainly a revelation for for all of us.</span> <span id="s2074">Uh they...there was .</span> <span id="s2075">.</span> <span id="s2076">also another report from a Polish officer which came at the same time.</span> <span id="s2077">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2078">And we are certainly also seen, uh but the the...also the...how the camp was organized, how the...where the gas ovens were placed, how the...around the the the towers, the watch towers, how this was...this was really the first time that we heard the I [ [ I; 12 ¢ real inside from this report which came terribly late, in June | 1944.</span> <span id="s2079">Uh and even this is very strange why it took so long to to I get out.</span> <span id="s2080">Therews a story that it was given to the in | and it never arrived or or took several months to arrive in [ in Rome, for instance.</span> <span id="s2081">Now we got this this report uh in two ways in Geneva.</span> <span id="s2082">The first uh copy arrived through the Slovak underground at the office of the Czechoslovakian representative to the League of Nations with whom I very closely cooperated during the whole war, Dr. .</span> <span id="s2083">Uh he had...I think I have mentioned it...he wrote very closely with one of his uh...with one...with one of our colleagues who was Czechoslovak, so .</span> <span id="s2084">Dr. and when the the report arrived, he called and asked him to bring it to me and to...he asked me to make a condensation of the report, which I did.</span> <span id="s2085">In four or five pages~.</span> <span id="s2086">.</span> <span id="s2087">this report was...I don't know...forty pages or thirty pages, uh and this this condensed report I gave them not only to him who transmitted it to London, but also to the British and to the Americans and the conden6ation has been used many...it comes out in many...in many ways.</span> <span id="s2088">I saw, for instance, the American ambassador in in London.</span> <span id="s2089">He sent it to all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s2090">It's exactly the same text in which I made.</span> <span id="s2091">The second copy came uh...I .</span> <span id="s2092">.</span> <span id="s2093">I I would say a few...a few days or a week or ten days later, and arrived and came from the uh Budapest Palestine office, uh Mr. , and was addressed to the president's office in in Geneva.</span> <span id="s2094">It came out through a man who died these days, .</span> <span id="s2095">Uh he had some facilities as a secretary of a consulate, and 13 he used uh also Romanian and other couriers to bring these things out.</span> <span id="s2096">Uh it was addressed to the uh Palestine of f iCQ but in reality, and here is a strange thing, Montello opened the the uh the envelope and gave it to uh in Switzerland who was the exchange telegraph agency or something.</span> <span id="s2097">Uh the agency doesn't exist anymore...one of the uh uh telegraphic agencies which existed at the time.</span> <span id="s2098">The fact that he gave this to telegraph agency was, of course, completely unauthorized and really not in order.</span> <span id="s2099">On the other hand, it was very successful.</span> <span id="s2100">It uh...for the first time, the swiss censor authorities didn't stop it, and this was not the merit of (laughter) of Montello but the fact that...it showed that the war had finally changed and the success in the war was on the other side, and to our great astonishment, the Swiss let it go.</span> <span id="s2101">Uh who has really the merit for this decision, I I don't know.</span> <span id="s2102">I never found out, but it was a very important step which was then claimed by Montello as as his great success, but let me not touch this claim.</span> <span id="s2103">Uh important was the fact that for the first time a detailed report on Auschwitz came out, and I would say that before this report, and this is a great merit for these two Slovakian Jews, uh that for the first time this came in the public.</span> <span id="s2104">Also much too late, of course.</span> <span id="s2105">Much too late.</span> <span id="s2106">our understanding, of course, was clear.</span> <span id="s2107">The the terrible things and the people were killed and so on, but the details in which...how this was...I would say, but of course, this was many years ago, and maybe some of it I forgot, but I would say that this was a decisive moment to give us inside knowledge of of how this thing happened.</span> <span id="s2108">14</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q:Well...I I, of course, will not quarrel with your judgment of uh decisive moment, but sometime you and I will talk about some of the earlier documents which came out about AuschwitzBirkenau.</span> <span id="s2110">There are earlier reports, not so detailed...</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A:No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2112">I'm not saying that we we didn't know.</span> <span id="s2113">Of course we knew and we knew also that there were uh uh hard labor and and and we were in contact, but uh there were documents, you could really accept as as as...this was really .</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q:Can you give us an approximate date when you received report, when you had to summarize it?</span> <span id="s2115">Approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A:No, noF There is...I have established this very clearly, because uh there is a detailed story in the report about the...a Czechoslovakian group which was in...transferred from Theresienstadt to Ausford...Auschwitz in quarantine.</span> <span id="s2117">And this is the first time that we hesrd quarantine.</span> <span id="s2118">And for six months in quarantine and afterwards it was liquidated and in the report also was stated that in a few lines under this what I just mentioned, another group from Theresienstadt arrived for six months in quarantine.</span> <span id="s2119">And when I..</span> <span id="s2120">.</span> <span id="s2121">and this I discovered when I was writing condensed report, and when I saw this I looked at the calendar, 15 and saw that there was five days left for the second six months in quarantine.</span> <span id="s2122">I stopped working...</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q:When was that?</span> <span id="s2124">f</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A:I this was this was *must have been the 13th of June, I something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q:OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A:I believe that received the report on a Saturday or a Friday evening, and we were informed on a Monday morning, and then I immediately worked on it and fixed the dates.</span> <span id="s2128">When I saw this, that there were five days and a group of Czechoslovakian young people, mostly of , uh were certain to be exterminated in a in a few days, I stopped my work on the condensation of the report, called a taxi, jumped in the taxif and went to .</span> <span id="s2129">And in the taxi I wrote a story for the BBC.</span> <span id="s2130">The idea was the BBC should day and night tell the people that publicly, the public, that we know that such a group will be gassed within five days.</span> <span id="s2131">Uh and when I came to , this this uh given the the draft (laughter) which I I wrote on on my personal note paper, uh uh is still there.</span> <span id="s2132">We we found it.</span> <span id="s2133">And uh immediately agreed, but he really didn't...he didn't send it to London, to his government.</span> <span id="s2134">He knew that there was a representative of the BBC in Bern, a Mrs. _ , a very well‑known uh l 16 journalist, and he addressed it to her, and uh as a matter of fact all these papers we we have today.</span> <span id="s2135">We have copies and we see it, and , in fact, sent the the the the report to BBC and it was uh transmitted a number of times.</span> <span id="s2136">When I told the story once, the one of the Czechoslovakian inmates of uh uh Auschwitz, uh he said yes, I heard it.</span> <span id="s2137">I said how dld you hear this story.</span> <span id="s2138">He said I was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2139">I said, you had a radio?</span> <span id="s2140">He said yes, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s2141">This was the father of the historian Kolka (ph), Arthur Kolka.</span> <span id="s2142">The the old man, he has a book, and uh he assured me...this is the astonishing thing...he assured me that this...on the basis of this report from the uh from BBC, they could manage to hide this this group in other barracks.</span> <span id="s2143">I said...he said I don't...I cannot assure you that they survived.</span> <span id="s2144">At that moment, we saved them.</span> <span id="s2145">Whether they...later I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s2146">But it showed me what extraordinary (laughter) methods you had to uh use in order to save them.</span> <span id="s2147">It was a crazy idea that I jumped in and stopped writing of the report and I sent this report to London.</span> <span id="s2148">But you had to have and this is my, perhaps one of my greatest criticism uh with regard to Jewish organization, that they were too much following the normal routine in their work.</span> <span id="s2149">You had to have extraordinary ideas, crazy ideas, ideas...T say it openly, in order to because it was an extraordinary situation.</span> <span id="s2150">I give you another example which also uh uh I have sometimes told.</span> <span id="s2151">In Jerusalem, the head of the Department of the Jewish Agency was Greenbaum (ph), a very respected man, uh particularly respected by us in the World Jewish Congress because E 17 of his past as a Deputy in the Polish .</span> <span id="s2152">He was really the greater fighter in the inter‑war years for Jewish rights in the Polish .</span> <span id="s2153">Uh very courageous.</span> <span id="s2154">Uh he left Poland, I don't know exactly when, and went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2155">He was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s2156">He was was from the radical party, but a great fighter for human rights, for for civil rights and so on.</span> <span id="s2157">Now one day, I get a telegram from Greenbaum in which he asked me to find his son.</span> <span id="s2158">I have this completely confused.</span> <span id="s2159">A man like Greenbaum asked me to find in Poland, son, and also what's going on.</span> <span id="s2160">I couldn't sleep for several nights.</span> <span id="s2161">I had great respect for the man, and I said well, after all, the son, the father, son...he looks...I have to do something.</span> <span id="s2162">But it was crazy.</span> <span id="s2163">How can I find a son who's in some camp, if he i8 still alive?</span> <span id="s2164">Who knows.</span> <span id="s2165">And I decided to try a crazy idea.</span> <span id="s2166">I sent ten little parcels to ten different camps with the name of the son of Greenbaum, and I found him.</span> <span id="s2167">Here shows...you really had to go ways and use methods which were not the normal.</span> <span id="s2168">So I decided the nine packages will be lost, and somebody may get them.</span> <span id="s2169">But I found it.</span> <span id="s2170">I'm not...I'm just using this opportunity to show that you had to to use absolutely unusual methods, and it was...now let's go back to the action of the of the War Refugee Board and what was.</span> <span id="s2171">.</span> <span id="s2172">what was...can be put to a certain degree on on it's credit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q:You're talking about Hungary and how you knew very little from March to June 1944, but do you want to talk a little bit afterwards, what happened...?</span> <span id="s2174">. »</span> <span id="s2175">!</span> <span id="s2176">18 0</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A:Now, when when this when when this uh news came and I said the second copy of the Auschwitz report came to the Zionist...to the Palestine office, and there was added already the statistics of the Jews in the provinces who had been killed, who had been uh transported to Auschwitz and who were dead.</span> <span id="s2178">Uh we...from that moment on when this was clear, and there was really &gt; a very important, concerted political action to save what could still be saved of the Hungarian Jews, and uh at this...in reality F the only political action which was undertaken by the Allies in this respect.</span> <span id="s2179">By the others and not only by the others .</span> <span id="s2180">The F f irst step I think was undertaken by the King of Sweden.</span> <span id="s2181">The Swedish section of the World Jewish Congress, had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s2182">He sent an appeal to , the head of the Hungarian state.</span> <span id="s2183">More important was the action undertaken by the American government, and that is a unique action really.</span> <span id="s2184">They uh...the American government addressed a note to a country with which it was at war.</span> <span id="s2185">This is unusual.</span> <span id="s2186">It's really a break of normal methods, and uh warned them that if they uh...this policy of extermination would go on, the consequences they would have to bear and there was attached a special note, appeal by Roosevelt himself, a statement, in this uh request.</span> <span id="s2187">And this was officially transmitted by the Swiss as intermediaries...they they were representing American interests in in Hungary and it was a direct note.</span> <span id="s2188">This certainly made a great impact.</span> <span id="s2189">The fact that the greatest state in the western alliance addressed such a very strong .</span> <span id="s2190">I 19 uh note to the Hungarian government made a great .</span> <span id="s2191">There was also an action by the Pope.</span> <span id="s2192">It's the only time that the Pope addressed a telegram direct telegram to to and of the Jewish .</span> <span id="s2193">Uh and finally there's the action in which I was also involved uh uh by the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, uh in which was equally addressed personally to to .</span> <span id="s2194">There is in the literature somebody has written about it said that the note was transmitted really very late when the action was practically over.</span> <span id="s2195">That is not the full story in my opinion because because the the legation, the Hungarian legation in in uh Bern was fully informed about this, and they they made this appeal may have reached in direct ways already.</span> <span id="s2196">All this together had a decisive uh uh result and and stopped for a certain time the deportations.</span> <span id="s2197">Then later there was .</span> <span id="s2198">.</span> <span id="s2199">for months we fought against the attempt to to re‑introduce the the old policy, and uh this is...these months are really very confu6ed.</span> <span id="s2200">There are all the time initiatives to uh continue the action to send people to Auschwitz, to continue to send them to labor and and put them into labor battalions and so on, and the , but as we know today, particularly the uh representative of of the Red Cross in in Budapest, two of the finest representatives, were very active and counter‑acted these things all the time, 50 I cannot say it was a full success, but I can say there was a real struggle going on, a fight which lasted for months, and we denounced publicly all the negative uh uh features of this fight.</span> <span id="s2201">In reality, all this...and we...very important was in this respect or 20 to the action of the World Council of Churches which was still in formation, but they had a very uh strong group there, _ and others, and the initiative uh uh was of the World Council with Mark was the president of the International Red Cross, was really done on my request, and I gave him all the uh the documentation and the arguments and and uh I've...we did the I used them too and they were, of course, more successful than we.</span> <span id="s2202">There status was... a very religious person and this is today often called the decisive thing which happened there.</span> <span id="s2203">In reality this was a cooperative uh effort by them and us and uh very much based on the documentation which I gave them.</span> <span id="s2204">Uh but uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q:Let me stop you here because I think the tape is about to run out.</span> <span id="s2206">OK.</span> <span id="s2207">We've got two minutes left.</span> <span id="s2208">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s2209">. "</span> <span id="s2210">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A:What uh happened finally there there was a very important action on the spot with regard to uh protection of Jews which the Red Cross and the Swedish and the Swiss and uh other diplomatic representatives undertook, and all together it saved practically the Jews of .</span> <span id="s2212">Those who survived to a great extent owe this to this concerted action and I uh...this is really the only political effort undertaken during the whole war in which this was tried out from all uh sides.</span> <span id="s2213">Everybody knows today Wallenberg and what he did.</span> <span id="s2214">There are the same uh uh activity was undertaken by of the Swiss representation, and the Red Cross gave also protection papers.</span> <span id="s2215">I remember very well one day Professor who 21 was Vice President, called me in and asked me uh...we are under terrible pressure we should give more protection papers, but the more protection papers we give, the less value they have.</span> <span id="s2216">What's your opinion?</span> <span id="s2217">I said give protection papers, Professor , this is not Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2218">This is uh uh uh a land where law and order is not reigning yet right here.</span> <span id="s2219">Give them...a Jew a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s2220">How...how...see how the situation is.</span> <span id="s2221">A man is in the street, and he will be arrested by uh policemen or soldiers, and then either he has a piece of paper, protection paper, or he has not, and if he has not, he has no chance.</span> <span id="s2222">If he has a a..</span> <span id="s2223">.</span> <span id="s2224">then it depends on the man with whom he has to deal.</span> <span id="s2225">Either he is in a good mood or he is in a bad mood.</span> <span id="s2226">He slept well with his wife last night, or not.</span> <span id="s2227">They squabbled or not.</span> <span id="s2228">It will depend on the local situation and and the human relationship.</span> <span id="s2229">Give them a....give them a chance, and he gaue them the chance and he ordered that many more uh such papers would...protection</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q:They have to put on a new tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A:Did you read the story of Montello, that he saved a hundred thousand Jews, which is with the this uh uh nationality or certificates of uh of .</span> <span id="s2232">I..</span> <span id="s2233">.</span> <span id="s2234">between ourselves, I have never seen a man who has uh has been saved through this.</span> <span id="s2235">I have asked many.</span> <span id="s2236">I've seen many people who were saved by Swi8s papers, by Wallenberg's papers, by other, but somewhere...that story of a F 22 hundred thousand Jews were saved by Montello.</span> <span id="s2237">YOu know, there are more people have been saved</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q:...then were killed.</span> <span id="s2239">Yes.</span> <span id="s2240">Uh this is not for the tape but I brought you a couple of things on Birkhart if you... TECHNICAL CONVERSATION END OF TAPE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q:...because they're ready for us.</span> <span id="s2242">Uh we were talking still about about Hungary and the cooperation in Hungary for the first time in a political action.</span> <span id="s2243">Uh cooperation.</span> <span id="s2244">.</span> <span id="s2245">(inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A:...until the end really it went and there were ups and downs all the time and the uh...you have probably seen the the record of uh Mr. who writes uh the story on the action of the Red Cross in in Hungary from day to day, and you see there also that I have been all the time involved.</span> <span id="s2247">Practically every action which the Red Cross undertook was finally suggested by me.</span> <span id="s2248">I didn't uh cease to to push them and to pressure them.</span> <span id="s2249">Uh it had finally some result.</span> <span id="s2250">Uh of course, there was also...this was not the only thing which I did.</span> <span id="s2251">I published, for instance, in on Hungary five pamphlets, uh booklets with great uh documentation about what was going on, the taking out of Hungarian press and other things.</span> <span id="s2252">This I published and sent around, published ; 23 anonymously~ to hundreds of people, press people, politicians and others.</span> <span id="s2253">This was all known to the Red Cross too and uh I used it &gt; for the for the churches.</span> <span id="s2254">I used it with other people.</span> <span id="s2255">We WQ we really uh...the the the report of the two Slovakian Jews.</span> <span id="s2256">I don't .</span> <span id="s2257">know whether it's known...I I had them translated into French.</span> <span id="s2258">I printed a little brochure in it and it was sent, printed in five S thousand copies anonymously because I couldn't (laughter) do it officially so it was illegally, it was was printed and and and distributed in five thousand copies in all over Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2259">(clearing throat) Uh this this was very important.</span> <span id="s2260">I left out some of the names in order not to make it...but this kind of things I did too and I wasn't only a diplomat.</span> <span id="s2261">I was...(laughter) also at different times in our pressure group if you want, uh but but what I want to say is that the the uh the the Hungarian example which was, of course, the last year of the war, and we benefitted from the fact that uh generally speaking people knew that the war was lost for Germany, but that doesn't mean that the Germans didn't...that their action was not as cruel and as determined as all the others.</span> <span id="s2262">They didn't accept that they had lost lost the war.</span> <span id="s2263">Not at all.</span> <span id="s2264">I mean what the the action which the Germans took, Eichmann and the others uh in in Hungary, was one of the most cruelest and the most determined and the most quickest... quickest action of the of of of extermination which which happened in the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q:They had the years of experience too.</span> <span id="s2266">I 24</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A:.</span> <span id="s2268">Now uh...I spoke about this but then connected with this and we should perhaps speak about this in in this connection is the uh the action which became also possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, that is the effort of the attempt to obtain certain...the liberation of a certain number of Jews by bribing some of the uh responsible people, who in the year of 1944, of course, were not so cocksure as they were before and they had their doubts whether the the the war would be won and they had their doubts what would happen to themselves, and they were afraid what would happen and there were all kinds of uh attempts to to save their own life, or at least alleviate... alleviate their situation.</span> <span id="s2269">And this you see, I have heard, of course, of the various groups which were saved by such methods.</span> <span id="s2270">There are the negotiations between Kastner (ph) and uh Baker, Sonny Meyer involved in a certain way.</span> <span id="s2271">There's the action uh of and uh the the uh the Nazis to save twelve hundred Jews from from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2272">There is the same kind of attempt made by uh of the World Jewish Congress in Sweden through the...through Himnler and through the the Dr. Kellsen (ph) who who treated him and finally , head of uh the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2273">All this uh liberated a few thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s2274">Every Jew who was liberated in Sweden was was again...there's no doubt about it, but it was, of course, a very limited action.</span> <span id="s2275">Now in the Kastner case, there was the great attempt to use this uh for for a real big deal of...between the Nazis and the and the Allied uh uh... 25</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q:A million Jews... |</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A:A million or ten thousand yeah what was it?</span> <span id="s2278">I</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q:What was your opinion?</span> <span id="s2280">Could that conceivably have been done?</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A:No.</span> <span id="s2282">This was...I mean for for men...for somehody who followed this from day to day from outside very closely, I saw that...how even the the small concessions under the license...the license which I got from the Americans, it was really sabotaged by the British and it was a license for $25r000~ I mean a ridiculous amount in reality.</span> <span id="s2283">OK.</span> <span id="s2284">They said if this is successful, we will give you more and so I don't uh taking , but when you saw how risky this these things were uh and there was a determination not to uh let the other side benefit from anything.</span> <span id="s2285">Uh this was from ehe beginning for me a dream, that the the Allies would concede.</span> <span id="s2286">This was was out of the question.</span> <span id="s2287">I didn't object to their trying to negotiate and the whole effort was, in my opinion, rightly in in this effort to to drag on, to negotiate while Jews were still alive and could be talked about.</span> <span id="s2288">This is, by the way, the same what happened in many ways in the ghettos in in in Poland and in in the Russian...uh some of the heads of the were very intelligent people and they they understood uh as long as they can put Jews to work, they are not killed.</span> <span id="s2289">And they tried to to 26 prolong these periods, and and and to offered Jews for work in order to spare their lives.</span> <span id="s2290">This was exactly the same.</span> <span id="s2291">The the war is going to its end.</span> <span id="s2292">They saw this.</span> <span id="s2293">They felt it.</span> <span id="s2294">It cannot go...it was four years, four and a half years, and the uh came back and at once the armies, so every month we can keep people alive was was once again.</span> <span id="s2295">Thi6 was absolutely normal and was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s2296">It was a clear concept which some of the people in eastern Poland especially had and was was right.</span> <span id="s2297">The same would be applicable to the efforts of of of Kastner and Brandt who who negotiated, but but there could come any decisive result was from my point of view completely uh uh .</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q:What about on the German side?</span> <span id="s2299">I mean, you've you've implied that the Allies would never have agreed to supplying trucks and so forth.</span> <span id="s2300">Do you think the high Nazi officials would have been willing to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q:No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A:No.</span> <span id="s2304">My my...I have said what I think of the Nazi determination to disrupt the the one great thing which uh on which the regime was really united.</span> <span id="s2305">There's no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s2306">The the extermination of the Jews was one of the central goals of the of the Nazi regime, and that they would uh...individuals could make 27 concession and so this is another question, but the decisive, the leadership...no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q:You know that there's an argument that that uh going back to the winter of 1942‑43, starting in Slovakia with the with with and Rabbi Weizmann (ph)...</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A:Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2309">The whole thing is with Weizmann .</span> <span id="s2310">But this is...Weizmann in uh his memoirs attacks me that I didn't support this.</span> <span id="s2311">The the real reason is that I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s2312">This was kept from me.</span> <span id="s2313">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s2314">I've never see the Weizmann proposals until '45 when I was in New York and saw it in our uh in the files in New York.</span> <span id="s2315">In Geneva it was never shown and his attacks against me is completely without foundation because I couldn't support anything which which didn't reach me.</span> <span id="s2316">What I heard about this, ideas seemed to me wonderful and a man who...</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s2318">And Hitler would bargain over the the fate of remaining Jewry in 1943...</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A:Well, I said something when I..</span> <span id="s2320">.</span> <span id="s2321">when I told you why I believed in the fin...the plan for the final solution, why why I believed this was possible, and here is the American .</span> <span id="s2322">The German Jew had seen the the development of the Nazi movement and and knew that they were...that this was their central object like 28 a part of their face, a center part of their face, on which they would never give in, and the and at the same time knowing their determination, their ruthlessness, their complete uh contempt for moral concepts and accepted what is useful to the German people as they understood and uh and this gives the answer.</span> <span id="s2323">Jews in other countries who have been...have had a much more difficult life and history amongst the citizens of other countries than German Jews probably, uh had gone through difficult periods but had always found someway to come through, with terrible losses but somehow they arranged themselves.</span> <span id="s2324">This was not possible with the Germans, and this only a German Jew who had learned, who followed the the Nazi movement from the beginning, could judge.</span> <span id="s2325">The others had illusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q:We haven't talked yet in detail about the possibility of bombing Auschwitz‑Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A:Well, let me let me perhaps before we come to this uh~.</span> <span id="s2328">.</span> <span id="s2329">well we can take this now.</span> <span id="s2330">I wanted to to take it in another...in another context but it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s2331">Uh this is one of the strangest things.</span> <span id="s2332">For me, really I don't understand it~ I personally was involved in this~ I..</span> <span id="s2333">very much.</span> <span id="s2334">When the reports from Slovakia came out, of the two Slovakian Jews, and a few days later it came the reports from the Budapest Palestine office with theifigures.</span> <span id="s2335">At the sate time there were already...I think in both reports attached the request to bomb the communication lines and I 29 Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2336">And both were done, was never done, and here I am before positive which I've never been able to sort...and I come and then speak about the why so little was done.</span> <span id="s2337">Maybe there's one aspect in which we should come back on it.</span> <span id="s2338">Uh the most important uh intervention in this in this case came from Weizmann, Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel, who was at the time the president of the Zionist World Organization, who did not interfere in any except in this case.</span> <span id="s2339">In this case he wrote a letter to Winston Churchill.</span> <span id="s2340">How important he must have felt about it.</span> <span id="s2341">Uh he he kept completely to his line.</span> <span id="s2342">He is not there for general Jewish uh interventions, affairs and so on.</span> <span id="s2343">He is there to first the Zionist idea and so on.</span> <span id="s2344">But here he made an exception.</span> <span id="s2345">And he was successful in this exception.</span> <span id="s2346">Weiman has has put this in a very good article which was published in commentary in which I have been consulted several times before he would, and it is absolutely clear that here something happened which is .</span> <span id="s2347">The...Weizmann's intervention was not the only one.</span> <span id="s2348">Wetll come back on this, but Churchill's impressed by Weizmann's letter and writes, let's try it.</span> <span id="s2349">And Eden who was less than perceptive I believe toward our case, uh is impressed by Churchill's signature and adds his name, OX...let's try it.</span> <span id="s2350">And then it goes to Sinclair (ph), up to to the the Minister of Air, who is a liberal, not a bad man, and from there it goes to the Chief of Staff, and from there it goes back to the Foreign... Foreign Office.</span> <span id="s2351">And nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s2352">And to us, and to me, to Goldman, so the deputy head of the extraditionary corps, the 30 the deputy of Eisenhower...I I don't remember the name...in America...</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q:McCoy you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A:Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q:John McCoy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A:No.</span> <span id="s2357">It was not John McCoy.</span> <span id="s2358">It was a general, a general.</span> <span id="s2359">Uh I forgot the name.</span> <span id="s2360">He he must...he mentioned it a number of times.</span> <span id="s2361">I went to the British and the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s2362">To the American Embassy, I gave them maps which I found in the in the League of Nations on the Upper Salasia in the twenties, early twenties.</span> <span id="s2363">I said this was a popular boat, and there's .</span> <span id="s2364">.</span> <span id="s2365">.</span> <span id="s2366">probably no better maps on this region than this, and I got with the help of the librarian of the League of Nations, I got copies of all these maps.</span> <span id="s2367">I said this is the best you need, and I gave it to to the .</span> <span id="s2368">This wasn't too easy to get such a thing.</span> <span id="s2369">And they tell me it's not possible and they tell me it's too far and we cannot get back and they uh...it's too risky and we know today because not only they had the...in the year 1944, the Allies had the absolute air domination over the whole of Europe.</span> <span id="s2370">Secondly, it's not true that they had no bombers that could fly.</span> <span id="s2371">At the same time when we asked...by the way, this came up already earlier in in '43 or '4 that...not four, '43...someone...the idea l 31 came out _ , but it was...we made a concentrated effort in June '44.</span> <span id="s2372">Uh at the same time when we asked, there were five bombardments of the camp of _ , five kilometers from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2373">So why do they lie?</span> <span id="s2374">Unbelievable...we cannot reach it and then they bomb at the same time.</span> <span id="s2375">We know today that the air uh uh the photographs of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q:Photo reconnaissance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2378">There is in in London an office which has all these photos, detailed photos from the whole region, much better, of course, than what I could produce from the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s2379">But why did...but they lied to us.</span> <span id="s2380">They said some people...I called _ .</span> <span id="s2381">He was then the the General Secretary of the Congress in New York, and he had an idea not to bomb it but to send in commandos there and to makes an explosion from inside in order to reduce the number of victims, and then some historians said that was against bombing.</span> <span id="s2382">(laughter) It was a more refined way of of reaching the same thing.</span> <span id="s2383">But here this really leaves me without answer.</span> <span id="s2384">And it particularly it shows the enormous role which bureaucracy has played.</span> <span id="s2385">We have always discussed the Holocaust connection with Nazi bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s2386">Uh we've seen how important the Nazi bureaucracy was in this, but here you see it suddenly that there's another bureaucracy which has played a very important role, a negative role, if men like like like like uh Churchill and Eden can give such instructions and nothing happened...because the l 32 bureaucracy doesn't like it.</span> <span id="s2387">This is a very serious uh aspect of the whole thing, and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q:Was bureaucracy then one of the basic reasons why the Allies did so little in response to opportunities between...</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A:Let's let's do this in a more systematic way.</span> <span id="s2390">But thi6 is one of the factors which have certainly played a role.</span> <span id="s2391">No doubt about it.</span> <span id="s2392">Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, but we have left out one, in my opinion, very important aspect, and that is the preservation of the camp inmates at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2393">I must tell you that from I would say probably October nineteen hundred forty‑four on, I was...I had an obsession, a real obsession.</span> <span id="s2394">I was dread the fearing that at the end...it was clear that the war was over.</span> <span id="s2395">It was clear it dragged on, the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost it, but the Germans who used children in the war effort and this was and I personally...maybe it's my education...I was afraid that the last effort in a kind of in Waggoner's context it's ...uh when everything is lost, they would at least see to it that the the rest of the Jews who were still alive, they would take them with them.</span> <span id="s2396">And I was absolutely obsessed by the idea that in the last moments they will make a slaughter of the three or four hundred thousand Jews in the camps which were .</span> <span id="s2397">And I couldn't sleep and I told myself, what can we do in order to stop this And I had at a .1 l 33 certain moment the idea, alright let's make a great effort, a joint effort of everybody together, because everybody is in the same boat.</span> <span id="s2398">The French had their inmates in the camps, and the Czechs and the Poles and so on and so on, and I took the initiative to mobilize all the Allied forces in Geneva in order to organize a joint action to prevent this~ It wasn't too easy.</span> <span id="s2399">I was stateless too, without government.</span> <span id="s2400">There was no Israeli government.</span> <span id="s2401">There was no Jewish government.</span> <span id="s2402">There was no supported, and I took the initiative and I..</span> <span id="s2403">.</span> <span id="s2404">the first question is who is neutral enough or in good relations with everybody that he could uh play this role, and I decided on the Czechoslovakian government, and I approached the delegate from Czechoslovakia at the League of Nations, and invite everybody, the French and the Belgians and the Dutch and the Yugoslav, and the Italian was in the meantime...and the Romanians were also and the Greek, and he did.</span> <span id="s2405">And we had our first meeting I think was in November '44.</span> <span id="s2406">I was in uh in 8ern that day and came a little late to the to the meeting, and I was very pleased to see all the representatives either of real government representatives or the representatives of the Red Cross Society offices, countries...they were all officials practically.</span> <span id="s2407">It was the same.</span> <span id="s2408">And uh and when I arrivedt he said the idea comes from Dr. Riegner.</span> <span id="s2409">Let him explain to you what what he wants.</span> <span id="s2410">And I uh explained to them that we we were all in the same boat and there was a great danger that this would happen, that at the last moments they would really suppress all the people in the camps and they were capable of doing it, and 34 we should do a last desperate effort to save this and to prevent this.</span> <span id="s2411">And we discussed various ways, uh neutral countries or Red Cross and so on, and the idea...and there was very considerable support, but of course they couldn't decide.</span> <span id="s2412">They had to ask their government, and uh we had several sessions.</span> <span id="s2413">The last session was in in...the decisive session was in I think February.</span> <span id="s2414">It went already in the next year because the governments are very slow in replying, and there we all agreed we should ask the International Red Cross for a very special, high‑level mission to the political authorities of of of Germany to prevent it.</span> <span id="s2415">And it was agreed and then these governments, they didn't have all relations between themselves and some didn 't recognize them, but they were all in agreement it should be done, and the idea was therefore not to to sign a joint paper but to...that everybody should submit this identical appeal to the President of the Red Cross uh for this purpose.</span> <span id="s2416">And I wrote the text, and uh everybody signed it, and at a certain day between ten and eleven, they all submitted the the signed appeal to the Red Cross, and this led to the last great action of in Germany where he saw Carlton Brunner who was really the number two under under Himnler.</span> <span id="s2417">Now when called together all these people and then when he came back, he called them again together, and I questioned him very, very thoroughly and this is also...I didn't just take his (laughter) assurances for granted.</span> <span id="s2418">It opened up a certain number of activities for the Red Cross but I think much more important, it gave to the German government as a clear understanding that the whole Allied, all the 35 Allied governments together were determined not to let this happen.</span> <span id="s2419">And it has...while events precipitated and military and others developed so quickly that all the _ were uh by‑passed by new events all the time, so that uh the agreements, the real agreements which were concluded between and the the German Nazis, the moment they were done really already by‑passed and the and it's not so important whether they were implemented or not.</span> <span id="s2420">The the...it it created a decisive fact, political fact, that the the governments did not allow this to happen, and with few exceptions, it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s2421">There are a few camps where they tried to kill people, and they killed some of them, but relatively limited.</span> <span id="s2422">The action was, on the other hand, supported by the activities of who acted in the same line with the on behalf of the Swedish _ and I was in contact, telephone and otherwise, with _ in in in Sweden and we tried at least to to coordinate and inform each other what was going on.</span> <span id="s2423">I believe that strangely the uh people have dealt with the Holocaust and the...and so the people who got saved and were spared, nobody really mentions this.</span> <span id="s2424">I think it's one...I think this is...the War Refugee Board was supporting us very much on this.</span> <span id="s2425">No doubt about it.</span> <span id="s2426">The American government asked us to keep them informed and at later meetings, they were present.</span> <span id="s2427">At the first meetings they were, I believe, not there.</span> <span id="s2428">In the later meetings, the British government also was present.</span> <span id="s2429">I mean, this was really...France and...was was a united front of the whole uh coalition of the Nazi question.</span> <span id="s2430">And uh I can only say the the the result was that the life of most of the people 36 0 was respected, which I consider was not a matter which was going without .</span> <span id="s2431">It was, by the way, not the only activity which this group undertook.</span> <span id="s2432">We alao addressed ourselves in the last days of the war to the Allies, and that they should allow uh columns of trucks with food and other medical and so to go into the camps and to see.</span> <span id="s2433">They should be not kept out because of military or bureaucratic reasons.</span> <span id="s2434">And we had...the the same group intervened with the Allied governments on on on these matters and probably the results were quite positive, the reaction on this.</span> <span id="s2435">Now I believe uh that uh Winston's man like Weinman says that the War Refugee Board saved two hundred thousand people or something such a figure, I I believe this is very questionable.</span> <span id="s2436">All these figures are very questionable.</span> <span id="s2437">Uh what _ makes the real uh calculations.</span> <span id="s2438">I believe that the saving of the people, the inmates of the camps in the last moment is is is one of the most things which we reached, saying this was also a collective effort but I I don't think I exaggerate because I was involved in this.</span> <span id="s2439">I believe really this is...made quite a difference.</span> <span id="s2440">Now let me say something about why so little was done and why...what shall I say...why so little was done and why we have this...</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q:...between November '42 and January of '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2443">Well, we didn't save...the the War Refugee Board took eighteen months until the first and the only real action was undertaken and how many millions of people were uh were killed in .</span> <span id="s2444">I 37 the meantime.</span> <span id="s2445">Now I, of course, have given more thought than most people uh because I was so deeply involved and I tried so hard and why did all this not lead to greater action.</span> <span id="s2446">There is a whole series of factors.</span> <span id="s2447">And I'll may mention them, but I'll come to the end to the most important uh reasons.</span> <span id="s2448">Firstly, nobody was really prepared for such a thing.</span> <span id="s2449">And this shows really the uniqueness of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2450">That's for sure.</span> <span id="s2451">This had never happened in history, that a whole people including the babies and old people and and invalids and men and women, children, that a whole people was condemned to be executed.</span> <span id="s2452">It hasn't happened.</span> <span id="s2453">And with all the catastrophes which have come over Jews during the course of history ...in the course of history, nobody really mentions such a thing.</span> <span id="s2454">I mean they're just not prepared for this.</span> <span id="s2455">This is the first time.</span> <span id="s2456">The second is uh the atrocity...atrocity stories of the 1st World War...(break in tape) ...this came up all the time.</span> <span id="s2457">During the 1st World War especially during the occupation by the Germans of Belgium, there came all kinds of stories what the Germans did and after the war it occurred that this was highly exaggerated and a good number of these stories were not true.</span> <span id="s2458">Whenever I came as my reports and so on, I was going against this war.</span> <span id="s2459">they called at that time, and this was a very great handicap for .</span> <span id="s2460">I am not trying to underrating it.</span> <span id="s2461">Number three, the secrecy.</span> <span id="s2462">In spite of everything, this was a socalled secret undertaking.</span> <span id="s2463">Uh has rightly said that many many people were involved but officially this was a secret uh operation, and not only was it a secret operation, this was an 38 operation for which a special language was invented which said complete different things which they meant.</span> <span id="s2464">Where the uh ...all this meant meant uh a lot of other words and we are...was invented in order to make it clear that it shouldn't have been clear.</span> <span id="s2465">The the most interesting in this is the the famous speech by Himnler to the...in '43 to the heads of the SS or...where he said more or less he will never admit it and he action was a great national act of self‑defense, but in which he said we will not leave any traces of it.</span> <span id="s2466">I will never admit it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q:And yet it was being recorded as he was speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2469">Now I have another letter such in my files by Himnler to Miller who was also one of the top people in the in the Third Reich security .</span> <span id="s2470">Section 4.</span> <span id="s2471">And this is interesting.</span> <span id="s2472">.</span> <span id="s2473">.</span> <span id="s2474">Uh it's a very strange...a letter in which he refers to a report by Stephen Wise.</span> <span id="s2475">You know this perhaps...</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A:...of September nineteen hundred forty‑two, in which Stephen Wise must have referred about my famous telegram and the report.</span> <span id="s2478">We have never found really to what statement of Wise it refers.</span> <span id="s2479">This is something for the for the scholars to to work on.</span> <span id="s2480">And there's exactly...and he he he uh he speaks there as if uh of course the the the course of transporting so many people, of 39 course, many people die and so on.</span> <span id="s2481">This is normal.</span> <span id="s2482">And again, don't leave any trace also of the dead.</span> <span id="s2483">It's clear and absolute deliberate effort to to hide the real facts and to eradicate any any traces which could be...it's a strange concept.</span> <span id="s2484">If they are so proud, why...of their action, why why this secrecy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q:I wrote in my book on Himmler that Himmler was torn by this conflict between the need to conceal, on the one hand, and the need to keep orderly records on the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2487">Now then the next point is we have already talked about it a little bit but I think we should uh talk more about it...the anti‑Semitism is the Allied camp.</span> <span id="s2488">Now this is something uh perhaps at this moment where anti‑Semitism is growing again in many places in the world and even in this country, but the generation the last thirty years, the American Jewish youngsters didn't suffer from anti‑Semitism, and they don't...didn't understand that there was a very active anti‑Semitic movement in this country in the '30's.</span> <span id="s2489">Uh those who were feeling this movement were of course the Nazis to a great extent, but you had also your your own people.</span> <span id="s2490">The Nazis with the and their own organization of the which were were appointed in all the countries to uh develop antior Nazi activities and anti‑Jewish activities all over.</span> <span id="s2491">Uh but you had your own people.</span> <span id="s2492">Uh there were the the Father Coffmann who who was twice a week I think on the on the on the radio.</span> <span id="s2493">The television didn't exist at the time.</span> <span id="s2494">There was K. 40 D. Smith, another such uh public anti‑Semite who who influenced it.</span> <span id="s2495">It was a..</span> <span id="s2496">.</span> <span id="s2497">and there was the German propagandist was extremely ably led and they the German propaganda accused Jews of America...they pushed Roosevelt into the war.</span> <span id="s2498">This was...uh first of all, it wasn't true, but uh the Jews...it it prevented really Jewish activities for two years in the war.</span> <span id="s2499">You don't find any traces of anti‑Jewish uh persecutions in the in the newspapers from nineteen hundred forty until nineteen hundred forty‑two.</span> <span id="s2500">Uh the going to war was not popular in this country.</span> <span id="s2501">Generally speaking uh this was one of the greatest problems for Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s2502">He he wanted to to stop the the Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s2503">There's no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s2504">His whole policy was...but he couldn't do it because he...the feeling that America shouldn't be involved and the isolationism of America was was enormously strong.</span> <span id="s2505">And to to to accuse the the the Jews...they pushing into the war, they are the the the war mongers.</span> <span id="s2506">They are the the responsible for...it it...this was a terrible (inaudible)... and in fact it had its effect on the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2507">It restricted them.</span> <span id="s2508">They were much...they were really afraid of this uh accusation and and and and therefore terribly restricted and restrained.</span> <span id="s2509">So...and it was highly efficient uh action...way of of uh... _ uh uh extremely uh successful propaganda in favor of the Germans and the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2510">Now uh...but we had it even in the government.</span> <span id="s2511">We spoke about it.</span> <span id="s2512">In fact the whole story of how my telegram at first was received, how instructions were given not to accept any more messages from private persons or private organizations.</span> <span id="s2513">The the uh sabotage of I « 41 [the the rescue effort, the rescue uh plans after the April '43 telegram, uh these all...the whole question of visas.</span> <span id="s2514">I know that our greatest problem as German Jews was the American visas, and there was a limited number.</span> <span id="s2515">I think twenty‑four thousand or something for German...people of German...and we found out at the end of the war they were never filled.</span> <span id="s2516">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q:You see this as more the result of anti‑Semitism than the result of bureaucracy or a combination of the two?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A:I think both.</span> <span id="s2519">But here I think the...I think the man who is responsible to a great extent is is as I said Breckenridge , and he uh in my opinion, pursued the policy to keep Jews out of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q:And there were a whole bunch of State Department people who...</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A:There were others too.</span> <span id="s2522">There were others too.</span> <span id="s2523">There were others too, and uh I don't know whether Roosevelt was aware of it or not.</span> <span id="s2524">In any case the lady who comes out very well is Mrs. Roosevelt who tried very hard but didn't succeed either.</span> <span id="s2525">She she came in several times with schemes for Jewish children and so on that...but when you turn to...from from America to Britain, you have the same.</span> <span id="s2526">There it has an anti‑zionist flavor, that the whole time uh uh is valid both for the Foreign Office and the 42 Colonial Office, and you have a very good study by about this and it's pages and pages where you where you see what the bureaucracy did in order not to be helpful.</span> <span id="s2527">There's uh...sometimes ...we haven't spoken about these little boats which were sent to Palestine from Bulgaria and and Romania with a few hundred Jews, and when you read the reports of the Foreign and Colonial Office people, you ask yourself, now who is the enemy.</span> <span id="s2528">Is it the Jews or the Germans?</span> <span id="s2529">And you definitely feel that it is the Jews.</span> <span id="s2530">It's unbelievable I mean even when you read it today, but it takes takes the establishment of the War Refugee Board, the reports and the and the British Foreign Office uh...they don't say anything else that the the establishment of the War Refugee Board is uh uh a method by Roosevelt to gain the Jewish votes in the election.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">Q:And they were .</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">A:....that there could be a humanitarian idea behind it that you wanted to to help people who are gravely in danger.</span> <span id="s2533">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2534">I mean it's unbelievable when when you read it, and these are the people who who were on your on your side.</span> <span id="s2535">They ran it.</span> <span id="s2536">He was...there's no doubt that this played a great role in your , the bureaucracy and the anti‑Semitism, the anti‑Semitic bureaucracy was able to prevent.</span> <span id="s2537">Now uh...but in in in...connected with this there is a..</span> <span id="s2538">.</span> <span id="s2539">the insensitivity of high...of people in high position, and I am particularly mentioning the military.</span> <span id="s2540">What what we have said about the effort to bomb Auschwitz, not to bomb 7.</span> <span id="s2541">,~ [ 43 / AuschwitZ how this is possible.</span> <span id="s2542">I said why did one write it.</span> <span id="s2543">To all our uh arguments and how often did I argue, they...we always got uh they have to win the war.</span> <span id="s2544">I said yes, but you will...you want to win the war in order to save the people who are threatened.</span> <span id="s2545">Yeah, this is uh...we cannot make any any exceptions.</span> <span id="s2546">Now they tell me in in in in Auschwitz when they bombed the , they couldn't have two or three uh bombs left for the for the gas uh chambers.</span> <span id="s2547">Wasn't so easy for us to take the decision, but the...all fact responsible are this bombing would kill another number of Jews.</span> <span id="s2548">Of course.</span> <span id="s2549">But you would have stopped the extermination process.</span> <span id="s2550">Every day six thousand people killed.</span> <span id="s2551">So of course we had to say better to stop the the the the extermination process and even if it costs some lives, but where is this ....how is it possible that all the high military people, that nobody even made some kind of an effort to understand this and to help.</span> <span id="s2552">It didn't cost and didn't divert anything from the war effort.</span> <span id="s2553">Is there something wrong in our moral...</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q:So is that a sort of bureaucracy as well, or is it antiSemitism or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A:No.</span> <span id="s2556">I think...I don't think it is...no, I don't think it was anti‑Semitism.</span> <span id="s2557">It was insensitivity, and and concrete...you are a soldier.</span> <span id="s2558">You have to do your job and so on.</span> <span id="s2559">But as I told you, you can also have feelings.</span> <span id="s2560">And if it doesn't harm your job, why why why can~t you do something.</span> <span id="s2561">Explain to me that uh we know I 44 today that big boats came with soldiers over the ocean, with tens of thousands of soldiers, and they went back empty, and when we were asking for visas and for transport, they said there's no transport.</span> <span id="s2562">They couldn't fill these boats.</span> <span id="s2563">Why did they lie?</span> <span id="s2564">come back to this.</span> <span id="s2565">Why did they lie?</span> <span id="s2566">There's no place...there were enormous space.</span> <span id="s2567">This was empty.</span> <span id="s2568">.</span> <span id="s2569">But here is something wrong and insensitivity.</span> <span id="s2570">I don't think they they ever thought of it, and this is the wrong thing.</span> <span id="s2571">The soldiers and and the high officials in government, also , and there something was wrong.</span> <span id="s2572">Question We'll stop here for a minute because the tape is just about to run out, and then we'll continue.</span> <span id="s2573">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION END OF TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A:All what I have said is...has influenced the situation.</span> <span id="s2575">But I believe there are two points which are really decisive.</span> <span id="s2576">The first is the complete powerlessness of the Jewish people at that time of history.</span> <span id="s2577">It's very difficult for the generation of today to understand it.</span> <span id="s2578">we have today a rather influential Jewish community in the United States.</span> <span id="s2579">We have today a Jewish state which is uh has been very successful in the last forty years with militarily, politically, which has had great influence on many understand this, and not to compare the situation of today with the situation forty or fifty years ago.</span> <span id="s2580">That has to be learned and that's one of the most important problems in Jewish education you have to understand.</span> <span id="s2581">Today we are a different Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2582">We have learned from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2583">We have learned from our isolationism.</span> <span id="s2584">We have learned that we can and decisive moments only count on .</span> <span id="s2585">You cannot apply the ways or or position of organizing uh protests of 1990 and 1940.</span> <span id="s2586">The great number of these methods were not available.</span> <span id="s2587">There were certainly not available during the war.</span> <span id="s2588">The police would have chased the protesters away from the White House or wherever uh in a in a minute, and the real thing is that we had no influence at the time.</span> <span id="s2589">This is .</span> <span id="s2590">And the second uh third truth is that what happened was so terrible and so beyond any human understanding that people really couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2591">And I'm saying this meaning both Jews and non‑Jews.</span> <span id="s2592">And concurs in one of his books in a very able way exemplified this point.</span> <span id="s2593">To exterminate a whole people including babies and sick people and...is something, and and and to throw babies into gas ovens, burning the human beings alive and then...is something which we...goes beyond any human understanding and .</span> <span id="s2594">And therefore, we have to distinguish between knowing the facts and accepting facts.</span> <span id="s2595">After the declaration of the Allied governments in December of '42, everybody knew.</span> <span id="s2596">And we thought now something will happen, decisively will happen.</span> <span id="s2597">But in reality, the people who had under...had signed this declaration had great doubts whether this was really happening.</span> <span id="s2598">And Jews themselves...I would !</span> <span id="s2599">: 47 say that many people who knew, who learned, who spoke about it, had in their inner hearts somewhere a reflection...I hope this is all not true.</span> <span id="s2600">You cannot...this cannot be true.</span> <span id="s2601">I give you a few examples.</span> <span id="s2602">In nineteen hundred forty‑three, I got one day from the Union of Polish 3ews in America, a package with thirty thousand addresses in Poland to whom I was supposed to send packages.</span> <span id="s2603">When I received this package, I got nearly crazy.</span> <span id="s2604">This organization had its seat in the same building and I believe even on the same floor as the American and World Jewish Congress to whom to whom all my reports went.</span> <span id="s2605">They must have read all my reports.</span> <span id="s2606">I asked myself, they have still not understood it.</span> <span id="s2607">But it wasn't this.</span> <span id="s2608">They had read it and they had understood it, but they couldn't accept that their own families were included in the .</span> <span id="s2609">It cannot be.</span> <span id="s2610">None of these thirty thousand addresses were valid anymore.</span> <span id="s2611">They people had been evacuated or had been killed already or had been in the in the camps.</span> <span id="s2612">Not one was .</span> <span id="s2613">But you couldn't sit 0 and do nothing.</span> <span id="s2614">You have to do something.</span> <span id="s2615">And you're excluded you own family.</span> <span id="s2616">Alright.</span> <span id="s2617">I know that many many people are sacrificed and killed, but not my family.</span> <span id="s2618">This cannot be true.</span> <span id="s2619">And so they collected that something has to be done, so they collected the addresses, and .</span> <span id="s2620">They never got .</span> <span id="s2621">I couldn't do anything but here you have the schizophrenic reaction.</span> <span id="s2622">Knowing, but not...somehow not believing or taking exceptions for yourself.</span> <span id="s2623">The story of is well known.</span> <span id="s2624">It has been often repeated.</span> <span id="s2625">When when when he went to Frankfurt and and and and and uh I can't believe it, and then he said, you mean I am a , 48 liar.</span> <span id="s2626">He said no, I didn't say that you are a liar.</span> <span id="s2627">But I said I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s2628">But this is one of the most respected Jews in this country.</span> <span id="s2629">When wise got my first uh report, he sits down and the next day or two days later and writes to Frankfurt and tells him and and really shares with him his terribly despair.</span> <span id="s2630">What can one do, but tell the the .</span> <span id="s2631">He Frankfurt he probably did.</span> <span id="s2632">I'm sure he did.</span> <span id="s2633">Uh there's another story of uh which was given by Professor deYoung, who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from Holland, and he was a young man and and and the government of exile in Holland during World war II, and was in charge of radio emissions, and he gets hold of some of my reports, and he reports in a lecture he gave in Washington...no, in Harvard, some time ago, and uh tells the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of Holland, .</span> <span id="s2634">tells...uh returns these reports a few days later to him and says, you believe in this stuff?</span> <span id="s2635">But worse even, who I made mentioned before who was Secretary General of the World Jewish congress during that last period of the War, uh there was in 1944 in November a great conference called by the World Jewish Congress in Atlantic City which really sets out a post‑War program of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2636">It's a very important document.</span> <span id="s2637">Uh it's really...it was the next twenty years what Jewish...the Jewish community in in the world has pursued as goals and so on is defined there.</span> <span id="s2638">Astonishing how how good the document is, a very important contribution to Jewish planning and Jewish policies in the post‑War.</span> <span id="s2639">And goes to a number of ministers .</span> <span id="s2640">.'</span> <span id="s2641">49 with the delegation of the assembly in Atlantic City and he meets amongst other people uh the uh Vice Minister of the Defense, McLoy.</span> <span id="s2642">You mentioned him before, and they submit the official documents and tell him to speak about it and so on, and McLoy, a very respected man in the government of this country and who played a very important role after the War as a high commissioner in Germany and so on, a lot of other important functions, asked _ to remain behind when the uh delegation retired.</span> <span id="s2643">And he says and there's a report by and it's been published...I don't remember where but I've read it and he said...so McLoy says to him, while now as we are alone you can admit this is all propaganda.</span> <span id="s2644">This is December nineteen hundred forty‑four, five months before the War was over and the number two man in the government on on the war effort doesn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2645">Now this shows uh there was really the people didn't believe.</span> <span id="s2646">This shows that it was so beyond any human (inaudible tape) human conditions, that you couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2647">this was of course one of the most negative things and it cost us millions of lives.</span> <span id="s2648">Now I'm not taking away the terrible consequences, that on the other end it's uh perhaps the most hopeful thing in the whole history of the of the Holocaust... .</span> <span id="s2649">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q:In retrospect.</span> <span id="s2651">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A:In retrospect.</span> <span id="s2653">It means that man cannot live with absolute evil.</span> <span id="s2654">You cannot accept absolute evil.</span> <span id="s2655">There is some way E 50 the conviction that man is good, man is pure.</span> <span id="s2656">Man is not condemned to the worst, and this...it's a paradox.</span> <span id="s2657">When...many Jews do not like when I say this, because they cannot forget...I cannot forget either this , but the fact that man cannot accept this, and man could not accept it, gives you hope in the man of tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2658">It is really the most positive conclusion you can have.</span> <span id="s2659">In this world of darkness, you cannot despair of men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q:Let me ask you something about something that was not specifically on your list of things that uh or explanation provided for so little done.</span> <span id="s2661">Uh you mentioned the insensitivity of high officials, but you didn't talk specifically about President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s2662">You probably know that uh some of the books on the subject, particularly David Weiman's book uh Single Out Roosevelt is is a major factor, perhaps the major factor.</span> <span id="s2663">Tell us a little bit about your assessment of Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A:Well, it's of course very difficult for my generation to to make a final judgment on this.</span> <span id="s2665">We work...we uh uh were educated in uh in a world and this was where it was the only hope, and later judge.</span> <span id="s2666">Uh and of course the study of uh the war record of the American government shows that uh all kinds of opportunities were lost and were not used, and the political responsibility is certainly borne by Roosevelt to a great extent.</span> <span id="s2667">But on the other hand, he is the only one who can say...uh could say that this policy has also prevailed, to preserve some Jews.</span> <span id="s2668">I spoke of lend I ; 51 lease.</span> <span id="s2669">Lend‑lease has saved probably Britain and probably more than Britain.</span> <span id="s2670">I think that this _ thanks to lend and lease and the...of course the resistance of the British people that they survived, and with this survival, four hundred thousand Jews in Britain have been saved from the invasion of of the Nazis and would have been victims.</span> <span id="s2671">But another conservation is even more important.</span> <span id="s2672">If Britain would have gone under, Palestine would have gone under.</span> <span id="s2673">It was very near that the Nazis came into Egypt and Palestine.</span> <span id="s2674">There are six hundred thousand Jews and much more.</span> <span id="s2675">Can you imagine that the Nazis would have wiped out the Jews in Egypt and in Palestine in 1942 or '3 or '4.</span> <span id="s2676">Our whole world...our whole Jewish world wouldn't exist.</span> <span id="s2677">With the center of Israel today is a powerful factor for every aspect of Jewish life.</span> <span id="s2678">That's also due to the Allied effort and Roosevelt had an important stake in it.</span> <span id="s2679">That doesn't mean that I'm not...I'm defending and the inactivity.</span> <span id="s2680">I think he bears a great responsibility but he and Churchill are the only ones who on the other hand have also contributed to the preservation of the free world, and that cannot be completely forgotten either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q:A couple of times we've mentioned in passing the role of the uh the Vatican and the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2682">Uh it seems to be in this section about why was so little done, uh we need to come back to them and talk a bit more about .</span> <span id="s2683">Perhaps what they did, but also what they could have done and did not do.</span> <span id="s2684">l 52</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">Q: Well, on the vatican I have once given a great lecture on the vatican and on the World Council of Churches.</span> <span id="s2686">Uh they have...there has been very little done.</span> <span id="s2687">Uh I spoke, I believe, of the memorandum which we gave to the in Bern in nineteen hundred forty‑two, and the only result of this was uh that some action was taken with regard to Slovakia and the deportations of Slovakia were interrupted, stopped for a certain time.</span> <span id="s2688">This was a Catholic priest who was at the head of the government.</span> <span id="s2689">Uh in all the...I have spoken on the action taken in in Hungary by the Vatican and here I believe that the vatican and the the Nuncio who was in Budapest has tried to and cooperated with the general effort to preserve the Jewish community, and even the local bishops and uh were influenced in this way.</span> <span id="s2690">But generally speaking, the situation depended on this the personal courage and the personal determination of the leaders in the various countries.</span> <span id="s2691">And you have examples of courage and determination and you have examples of complete uh laissez‑faire.</span> <span id="s2692">Some of the bishops and archbishops...you have beautiful examples in France like Cardinal of Toulousse, who went to the station where the deportations from where the deportations took place, and his presence was an act of protest.</span> <span id="s2693">There were some other bishops...Bishop , Bishop .</span> <span id="s2694">.</span> <span id="s2695">, but there were also other cardinals who supported the vichary regime fully, and the Vatican never interfered even in the French anti‑Jewish legislation when it was asked whether.</span> <span id="s2696">.</span> <span id="s2697">of his opinion.</span> <span id="s2698">the Vatican in my opinion, and there there are twelve or thirteen volumes of vatican documents what uh what they were doing l 53 during the War, I believe that the real problem in the catastrophe of the...which happened to us was never taken seriously by the Vatican until the War was practically over, and I believe that there was no real realization in the highest uh levels of the Vatican bureaucracy, uh no real evaluation of the out...of of the the the dimensions of the catastrophe, and I believe that the Vatican was better informed maybe than we believe.</span> <span id="s2699">There are hundreds and hundreds of priests.</span> <span id="s2700">and we were not prevented from and there are books who report on this, on these reports.</span> <span id="s2701">In the official documentation, it shows that some uh priests reported very clearly about the about the elimination of the Jews and the killing of Jews.</span> <span id="s2702">When prohibited Wise to publish my famous it was agreed that they should ask opinion of the Vatican and the opinion of the Vatican was very wishywashy.</span> <span id="s2703">They said we have also reports but uh it doesn't...on on that treatment, but they didn't confirm the elimination.</span> <span id="s2704">Astonishingly, because , the who reports regularly to the Vatican and who writes about the same time the new things are the bombardments of the state, of the cities, and the uh increased elimination and extermination of the Jews and there are already more than two million exterminations.</span> <span id="s2705">So one cannot tell me they didn't know.</span> <span id="s2706">Uh in some places, the local bishops helped.</span> <span id="s2707">The action of the vatican centrally was practically limited to Hungary.</span> <span id="s2708">There they tried a certain influence, but otherwise I wouLd say there was no real great concern.</span> <span id="s2709">And uh I often uh thought that my long conversation with uh with Monseigneur Montini 54 in 1945 when the war was over and I was asked to plead with him the Catholic authorities should help us to recuperate the Jewish children who had been hidden by Catholic authorities or Catholic individuals and when I argued with him...this was November 1945...and said that we had...we were very grateful to the Catholic Church for what it had done in order to save some Jews, Jewish children especially, but we had lost in the war one and a half million Jewish children, and we couldn't loose one more child.</span> <span id="s2710">He questioned me, he questioned this statement and was absolutely astonished when I gave him the statistical background to my _ .</span> <span id="s2711">For twenty minutes we argued.</span> <span id="s2712">I told him, you know, there were in Poland...the birthrate...was a birthrate...a Jewish birthrate of sixty thousand every year.</span> <span id="s2713">Multiply by 16, 16...you can...you arrive at 960,000 children, up to the age of sixteen.</span> <span id="s2714">We should have in 1945 at the end of the War, found 960,000 Jewish children in Poland.</span> <span id="s2715">Do you know how many we found?</span> <span id="s2716">Something like 3,640 kids.</span> <span id="s2717">There is a report by uh Jewish leader, Louis Seeger who comes back from Poland and brings these figures.</span> <span id="s2718">take Hungary.</span> <span id="s2719">Hungary with Transylvania, territories which belonged...we call to Romania, about eight hundred thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s2720">There were about four hundred thousand in the Hungarian provinces.</span> <span id="s2721">On an average, there should have been a hundred thousand Jewish children.</span> <span id="s2722">Maybe a little less...eighty thousand.</span> <span id="s2723">When the war was over, how many Jewish children did we find?</span> <span id="s2724">Eight children.</span> <span id="s2725">He was shaken when I told him and I continued.</span> <span id="s2726">I was well prepared to go on.</span> <span id="s2727">He said they they they left.</span> <span id="s2728">There was immigration.</span> <span id="s2729">55 | I said where was immigration.</span> <span id="s2730">Perhaps a few hundred, for there I were still was to the mountains of Romania, but it's terribly difficult.</span> <span id="s2731">Not thousands...for twenty minutes we argued.</span> <span id="s2732">It was one of my most unsuccessful diplomatic _ in my whole career.</span> <span id="s2733">I shook him, there's no doubt.</span> <span id="s2734">He...for the first time he realized that six million Jewish dead meant a million and a half Jewish children, but if the number two or three in the uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q:Hierarchy...</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A:Hierarchy...the the Catholic hierarchy, had to learn from me to realize in November when it was 1945, what this meant, this shows that uh not very high priority was given to these problems in the Vatican, and uh the other example is I mentioned already several times.</span> <span id="s2737">He went to the Vatican in August nineteen hundred forty‑two...uh '45, supported by some very important Catholic uh scholars, including Jack who became later the cardinal, became the French Ambassador to the Holy See, a very important, very distinguished Catholic scholar, including uh the uh priest in in in uh who became a cardinal later whose name escapes me at the moment, who has written a very important book also in Catholic‑Jewish relations, including uh a prelate of Egyptian‑Jewish origin.</span> <span id="s2738">A whole series of very uh distinguished Catholic theologians and they argued that this was a time for the Holy See to issue a Jewish on the relations with the Jews.</span> <span id="s2739">There was no reply, and it took twenty years until vatican Council 56 II that the church really found that it had to issue a statement on the future of Christian‑Jewish relations, a very important statement .</span> <span id="s2740">It's a beginning of a new approach to the Jews, but you see here the.</span> <span id="s2741">.</span> <span id="s2742">all these indications show that certainly the Jewish catastrophe was not seized in all its terrible dimensions and it had certainly not priority in the considerations of the vatican at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q:What about the role of the International Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A:The International Red Cross, you have today a very important study by Professor , uh the Geneva historian who has...is the only one who had access to all the files, and the result of this study is not very positive to say the least.</span> <span id="s2745">There are two positive things which I have to say sbout the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2746">The one is the fact that uh , Vice President, concerned to us in 1942 that he had also news about uh the final solution and that he had heard from several German diplomatic witnesses that the final solution was in in execution.</span> <span id="s2747">This was a positive, a very positive fact for us to determine and to inform the Allies that this was a reality.</span> <span id="s2748">The second is the negotiations which I mentioned before with and certainly contributed to to help prevent the extermination of the people who were still in the camps at the end of the war, but apart from this, the attitude of the Red cross was uh not very helpful, and not very uh courageous.</span> <span id="s2749">There was a moment when some of the members of the Red Cross really 57 felt they had to make an open protest against amongst other things the treatment of the Jews.</span> <span id="s2750">Uh or at least an appeal in which these matters would be open...openly denounced but uh it never came to this appeal or public protest.</span> <span id="s2751">It's...although I must admit there was a majority of the members of the International Committee who were in favor of such .</span> <span id="s2752">But here the Swiss government intervened and prevented any such declaration.</span> <span id="s2753">Uh I've been often asked whether this should have happened or not.</span> <span id="s2754">In my opinion, there are moments for international organizations, welfare organizations, where you have to speak out, and I was asked by the Red Cross at the time...I clearly recommended and pushed and was very active in order to that such a statement of denunciation should happen, but it didn't happen and was prevented, as I said, by the swiss government which was afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s2755">Uh but nevertheless, at certain moment our insistence of decisive action had some result.</span> <span id="s2756">There was in 1942, in September '42, and the dates are very important because this is the moment where we informed uh _ that we knew about the final solution and he confirmed to us that he knew too.</span> <span id="s2757">Uh there the Red Cross sent a memorandum to their delegation in Germany in which uh they left it to the decision of the delegation if they should uh submit to the German authorities uh a request for the extension of the basic rules of Red cross protection to the intern...interned people in the various camps and not in the camps of prisoners of war and the other camps.</span> <span id="s2758">Uh this activity, this action had no consequences.</span> <span id="s2759">That was the most serious.</span> <span id="s2760">They kept me in the belief for two I 58 years that they were pushing on this constantly and there were always new interventions in this sense.</span> <span id="s2761">This is just not true.</span> <span id="s2762">'s book makes it very clear that until the uh situation developed in Hungary in 1945 which we have described, practically nothing has has happened, and this is in my opinion a very serious mistake and uh very serious failure of the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2763">Moreover, the book of _ brings out a number of very unpleasant facts.</span> <span id="s2764">For instance, the Red Cross accepted without protest a request of the German Red Cross that...I think it's 1941...it could be '42...that in the future inquiries about people who are lost...who are searched for, should in the future be submitted separately for aliens and non‑aliens.</span> <span id="s2765">That they accepted this distinction is certainly a scandal and certainly not in the line of uh Red Cross principles, and there are a number of other such incidents which are certainly not very good and show also the the very limited courage which the Red Cross had in countering the Germans.</span> <span id="s2766">There's a historian who has...a Swiss historian, Mr. Paul Stouffer, who has denounced this attitude in an article concerning the case of .</span> <span id="s2767">The twelve thousand Polish officers were murdered by the...by Russians.</span> <span id="s2768">At the time, the uh German government and the Polish government in exile both asked the International Red Cross to establish an inquiry commission in order to determine who was responsible for this act.</span> <span id="s2769">Uh behind all this was the government...was the propaganda ministry and uh the Red Cross could not accept the proposal because the third party hadn't and the third party were the Russians, and according to the principles of !</span> <span id="s2770">59 the Red Cross only when all involved could agree...could such a question could such an inquiry commission be established, but Mr. Stouffer refers in this respect to the diaries of .</span> <span id="s2771">Uh of course, the Germans were very upset that this inquiry commission didn't happen.</span> <span id="s2772">Uh but in the diaries of uh he defends himself and says we couldn't make a big fuss about this case.</span> <span id="s2773">We are much too much depending on the International Red Cross concerning our own interests with regard to prisoners of war and other other interned people in Allied countries and so on, which shows exactly that the Red Cross disposed of higher prestige and status in Germany when they believed themselves and all their hesitations not to insist too much with the Germans because of the overwhelming power of the Germans, uh it.</span> <span id="s2774">.</span> <span id="s2775">at the time is here really contradicted by one of the greatest witnesses one could produce in which it said we depend on the good will of the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2776">This has never been taken serious and never been realized but by the responsible people in in Geneva.</span> <span id="s2777">So the Red Cross today doesn't anymore really defend this position.</span> <span id="s2778">For the first time under the new president there, , I saw recently articles in which they said yes, we didn't do enough at the time, but now we have another policy and so on so.</span> <span id="s2779">And this is in a not the attitude uh of the deal on these matters much more in detail in my own autobiography.</span> <span id="s2780">I was very much involved in the whole theater of Red Cross activities, and the book by you see day by day for how I pressured the Red Cross into action in the Hungarian uh case and uh also in 's book, there are I think 45 references I 60 to my activities uh but it was certainly a very important activity also from our side and some of it produced results but, of course, much too limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q:We have a little less than ten minutes to go.</span> <span id="s2782">I was going to ask you about uh relations with the Jewish agency and the Joint, but if you have something that you would rather say that has not come out yet, please feel free to take this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A:No, we can speak about the the the nations that say they cooperation of the Jewish organizations in Geneva.</span> <span id="s2784">I'm not speaking now on the on the world.</span> <span id="s2785">Uh there have been very little described really.</span> <span id="s2786">We were not very good.</span> <span id="s2787">With the agency I had very good relations with the head of the agency in Geneva, , who was an old diplomat of the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s2788">He was even more pessimistic than I was, and so pessimistic that he really gave up doing things.</span> <span id="s2789">He has written enormous amount of letters in describing his despair, which is...I didn't do this.</span> <span id="s2790">I uh was afraid partly of the censorship.</span> <span id="s2791">Everything which we wrote went through censorship and I didn't want the , but uh there was...cooperation was alright.</span> <span id="s2792">There were all kinds of uh little offices between which there was a good deal of jealousy, but while I was at the time upset by some of these personal problems, when you see it as a whole and it didn't make any difference on the whole scene.</span> <span id="s2793">Uh the the Germans were so uh powerful whether we would have _ a little better together or not, wouldn't have made 61 any difference.</span> <span id="s2794">The Joint is another chapter.</span> <span id="s2795">The Joint gave instructions not to cooperate with .</span> <span id="s2796">Had instructions from the Joint in in , New York, not to cooperate with us which was due to the uh competition between the World Jewish Congress in the United States which pursued rescue activities on its own and based on the collections in South America and the Joint.</span> <span id="s2797">My criticism with regard to the Joint is very clear.</span> <span id="s2798">Until very late they did not see that this was not just a general welfare undertaking which was necessary but a special political rescue action.</span> <span id="s2799">This they understood very ...and rescue and philotropic (ph) welfare is quite a different thing.</span> <span id="s2800">The Joint even opposed Martin Goldman's proposal to the...Goldman was a man who had great ideas and great schemes.</span> <span id="s2801">He had.</span> <span id="s2802">.</span> <span id="s2803">in the war, during the war, two great ideas.</span> <span id="s2804">The one was to approach the Allies and to take...to ask them to ask them that the Allies should offer to the German government to take the totality of Jews into the Allied camp, and to evacuate and the other camp would care for them.</span> <span id="s2805">This, of course, was a revolutionary idea.</span> <span id="s2806">It was probably the only great idea uh that could be conceived, but it was immediately rejected by the British .</span> <span id="s2807">The other idea was the constructive idea of a basic joint effort to rescue, and he proposed five...a fund of five million dollars of contribution from America, five million dollars contribution from uh United...from uh Britain and two million from the Jews.</span> <span id="s2808">This was sabotaged by the Jews.</span> <span id="s2809">The Joint was against it.</span> <span id="s2810">The Joint was believing that they had a kind of monopoly on Jewish defense and and and Jewish welfare activities, .</span> <span id="s2811">_1 62 and the government shouldn't interfere.</span> <span id="s2812">It was an absolute basic mistake.</span> <span id="s2813">When the war was over, our greatest asset was that we we succeeded in in convincing the Allied governments, the UN, to participate and take the responsibility for the surviving refugees.</span> <span id="s2814">The was based was based and financed by the governments, not by the Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s2815">The UNDRA effort was based and here the World Jewish Congress had an important role in in uh introducing this idea and this concept.</span> <span id="s2816">The the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were in need was not the responsibility of private people.</span> <span id="s2817">It was the responsibility of the uh world community, which had not conducted world affairs in the way which could have saved these people, and so uh both in number and both in the uh international refugee organization after the war, the responsibility of governments and the financial responsibility of the basic needs was recognized and we should have done it, of course, during the World uh World War II, but the the Jewish were not yet right for such a concept.</span> <span id="s2818">Today it is absolutely obvious that private organizations, private citizens, can only contribute to it, but the the basic needs and the basic policies have to be financed by governments and international intergovernmental organizations in order to keep the basic needs covered.</span> <span id="s2819">.</span> <span id="s2820">.</span></p> <p><span

this...I believe that history doesn't repeat itself.</span> <span id="s2827">That's the first thing.</span> <span id="s2828">But uh the idea it cannot happen here is also gone.</span> <span
