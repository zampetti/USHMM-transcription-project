id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans, conducted by Amy Reuben on November 11th, 2004, in Fort Lee, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s12">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s13">Mr. Gans, would you please start by telling me your full name, and where and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay, my name is Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in a little town in West Germany near the Dutch frontier, the name of that town is Borken, it’s -- at the time it used to be called Borken in Westfarn -- in Westphalia.</span> <span id="s16">And I was born in there on the 27th of April, 1922.</span> <span id="s17">My father’s family had lived in that town at least since 1610.</span> <span id="s18">The town records showed that his -- the fa -- his -- his mother’s family, by the name of Windmiller, were allowed to live inside the walled city of that town in 1610, which was very exceptional, because Jews generally were not allowed within walled ci -- cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Do you know why, perhaps, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No, I can -- can’t remember why, exactly what the reason was why -- but -- why they were allowed to live there.</span> <span id="s21">But basically Jews had lived in that area, or in that town since sometime -- something like 1246.</span> <span id="s22">The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is fully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a small group of people who have occupied themselves with the history of the Jews.</span> <span id="s23">And they have fabulous documents about everything.</span> <span id="s24">So if you have to clear up something, this is where you can go, and anybody who wants to research the subject should go to these -- to these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: How large a Jewish community was there when you were living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: There were -- about 25 Jewish families lived in the town itself.</span> <span id="s27">And there were Jewish families in every -- all the little villages around it.</span> <span id="s28">The town was a -- you know, was the county seat, and the -- all these other Jew -- little Jewish communities in the villages, some of them had their own synagogues, but none of them had schools.</span> <span id="s29">And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p -- all the Jewish children had to come to Borken for the Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s30">We -- oh, I had one towa -- want to mention one more thing which I -- this third thing is very important.</span> <span id="s31">So the Jews in a -- i-in effect, had lived in this town for 750 years.</span> <span id="s32">And though it was a free town, that means it was -- it was -- it had -- it was an independent town, which could make its own decisions, my father was the only Jew who was ever elected into the town council.</span> <span id="s33">There have been no Jews before that, and no Jews, of course, since that -- since itch -- there are no Jews living in the town now.</span> <span id="s34">Everybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Well tell me, if you would, tell me your father’s name, and when was he part of this council, and maybe you could tell me a little bit more about him, and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s37">My father’s name was Maurice Gans.</span> <span id="s38">He was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a -- all the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the town, he went into the Jewish school for the first four years of his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was.</span> <span id="s39">And then, at the age of 10, he went into the high school, which actually was a larger, Catholic school.</span> <span id="s40">And he graduated from there at the age of, I think about 16.</span> <span id="s41">He did -- he did not finish up as a full matriculation because there -- there was certain stages.</span> <span id="s42">And from there on s -- from then he -- he went into the textile trade, and he was an apprentice in a wholesale textile ware -- company in Frankfurt, i-i-in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s43">He -- when World War One broke out, he was a -- drafted into the German army.</span> <span id="s44">He was in Italy, and his unit was continuously short of food, and supplies, and he made it his business to go into the Italian towns and get provisions there.</span> <span id="s45">And coming back from one of those expeditions, a -- a -- he was shot at by his own people, who hadn’t recognized him, and as a result he lost a leg, and as a result of a big loss of blood, he lost a lung, and so he -- his whole like -- life from there on, he had only one leg, and one lung.</span> <span id="s46">He was extremely brave.</span> <span id="s47">He was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish home for recuperation in Switzerland because of having lost the lung.</span> <span id="s48">Of course the -- you know what -- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he had tuberculosis, which he did not have, and there he got involved in founding a Jewish recuperation home.</span> <span id="s49">I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all those -- those things.</span> <span id="s50">When he eventually returned to his hometown, he set up his own company, and my mother was his partner.</span> <span id="s51">Now, ma -- tell you a little bit about my mother, because she had a totally different background.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Actually, and -- first tell me when he was elected to the town council, cause you said that was such an unusual occurrence.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yeah, he was -- I think he was elected to the town council only in -- either in 1930 -- 1930 or ’31.</span> <span id="s54">Then, of course when -- when the -- when the -- there were so many elections just before the Hitler period, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic party in town.</span> <span id="s55">When the social democratic party was reduced to only one representative in the town council, I -- my father decided that his non-Jewish social democratic -- what trying to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: A colleague of his, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: A colleague -- colleague should stay, rather than he.</span> <span id="s58">And so that he was out of it.</span> <span id="s59">Now, how did he get into this position that people voted for him?</span> <span id="s60">When he returned to the town, after World War One, and set up his own business, he also took a very active part in the league of war orphans, widows.</span> <span id="s61">And -- I’m trying to find a -- find a English wor -- when people who had been injured in the war, there was a -- a -- a league like that, and he beca -- soon became the head of that league.</span> <span id="s62">He had his staff work on all the applications which were necessary so that these war orphans, war widows, and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various government offices for the support to which they were entitled.</span> <span id="s63">And he never charged anybody for all these services, and therefore he became very, very popular.</span> <span id="s64">His staff was -- his office staff, which was concerned, of course with wholesale textiles, was a-accustomed to service the members of the league of war orphans, widows, and people who had been injured in the war.</span> <span id="s65">Oh, I also started to tell about my mother’s family, right?</span> <span id="s66">My mother’s family lived in a little town called Falksen, which was near Hannover.</span> <span id="s67">And my grandfather, Maurice Frankel, had come from somewhere in the Brunswick area, Braunschweig at the time.</span> <span id="s68">He had set up his own business, and this is a town, he was a total free thinker, didn’t believe in organized religion at all.</span> <span id="s69">But -- and his wife, my grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn’t mean that they were hiding the fact that they were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but they just didn’t believe in organized religion.</span> <span id="s70">Their ideal were opera, and theater, German [indecipherable] you know, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s71">In fact, one of the sisters of my grandfather was an actress in Hannover, and she was a paramour of the king of Hannover.</span> <span id="s72">She was very good looking.</span> <span id="s73">Even I remember her, though vaguely.</span> <span id="s74">And of course, I’ve seen pictures of her.</span> <span id="s75">So, it was totally different type of upbringing, but nevertheless my mother also had to go to Hebrew school two or three times a week, in -- this was a town called Springer, which was a -- probably only about four or five miles away.</span> <span id="s76">There -- you know, in those days of course there were plenty of trains.</span> <span id="s77">They went to and fro by train all the time.</span> <span id="s78">So she too had a smattering of Jewish education.</span> <span id="s79">And then when she finished elementary school, her parents sent her to a finishing school, to Belgium, a Jewish finishing school where essentially ladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very much oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in Belgium.</span> <span id="s80">For a short while, she actually worked, after the [indecipherable] she -- she was a -- a companion lady or whatever you call this, in the house of Rosensweig, was a German philosopher, Jewish philosopher who -- who -- usually his name is connected with Buber, who was in -- who was -- who was later on a professor in -- in Israel, at the [indecipherable] university.</span> <span id="s81">Of course, Franz Rosensweig was at that time already very sick.</span> <span id="s82">He had contact -- contract-tacted syphilis while he was in the German army in -- in Poland.</span> <span id="s83">And sa -- but he was an outstanding thinker, and ve-very famous in his interpretation of general philosophy and Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: And what’s your -- what was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: My mother’s name was Else Frankel.</span> <span id="s86">E -- E-l-s-e Frankel.</span> <span id="s87">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And when was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: She was, I think, five years younger than my father, so she must have been what, 18 - 19, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Sol tell me a little bit about the home then, that they had for you, as you were growing up.</span> <span id="s91">Try to give me a picture of what the -- what that, you know, how your daily life was like at home, and of course, could you mention, you know, the siblings who -- who are your siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s93">I only vaguely remember the house in which we lived during the -- during the first three years of my life.</span> <span id="s94">That house is not in existence any more now, but I know exactly where it was, it was near the railway station in Borken.</span> <span id="s95">And my parents just rented an apartment th-there.</span> <span id="s96">Now, my father was very successful in business, he was a -- always a financial genius.</span> <span id="s97">And -- and I think in the year 19 -- yeah, ’35, just before my younger brother was born, he bought a very stately house, just outside the town of Borken, which had been built by a man who was the owner of a brick factory once, th-therefore they had -- they hadn’t -- not spared any -- any expenses, any bricks, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s98">That house is still in existence now, and it’s still an outstanding house, up to the -- up to the sis -- da -- this day.</span> <span id="s99">And it still has a lot of the features which it had when we lived in it.</span> <span id="s100">At the time when my parents bought it, and it was not developed around it, gradually they, you know, they planted trees and bushes, and things like that.</span> <span id="s101">So we had two maids as servants, we had people looking after the vegetable gardens, and after the flower gardens.</span> <span id="s102">And above all, my father had a chauffeur, since he couldn’t drive himself.</span> <span id="s103">He was always on the road for -- during the whole week.</span> <span id="s104">Usually he came back at night, sometimes he did not come back at night, but he usually came back at night and then went out again in the morning, into the rural district, to sell the specialty textiles to people who make custom clothing.</span> <span id="s105">So it -- it -- it -- i -- it wa-was certainly upper class.</span> <span id="s106">I think we had a higher standard of living than anything I have achieved since then, or my brothers have achieved since then.</span> <span id="s107">My older brother was called Karl, and he -- he was two years older than I. He’s still alive now, he lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s108">Now he’s called Gashom Kadar.</span> <span id="s109">He’s changed his name during wor -- World War Two, when he was serving in a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army.</span> <span id="s110">And my younger brother, his name was Tayol, and when he went -- went -- went to Israel in 1950 -- let me see, he went to Israel in 1952.</span> <span id="s111">He too changed his name from Gans to Kadar.</span> <span id="s112">I have to excuse myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Okay, if you could just continue to tell me about your life in your childhood home, and was it a very festive life with your family?</span> <span id="s114">Tell me a little bit about the sort of routines that you had, you know, as a family, and at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well the routine obviously was we go to school every day.</span> <span id="s116">Until the age of 10, we went to the Jewish school, Jewish elementary school, where we learned both the secular subjects and the basic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things like that.</span> <span id="s117">So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew.</span> <span id="s118">Then, at the age of 10, since our parents were well enough to do to -- they could send us to high school, we shifted over to the high school.</span> <span id="s119">Now, th -- the routine at home was that we’d all be in school until about one o’clock and then came home and had the -- the main meal of the day.</span> <span id="s120">In the afternoon we were supposed to do our homework.</span> <span id="s121">Had some sort of other activities, we were essentially free.</span> <span id="s122">And the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it’s -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox.</span> <span id="s123">Not -- we wouldn’t call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Orthodox in the United States now here.</span> <span id="s124">And Friday evenings we would go to the service.</span> <span id="s125">After the service there would be a very festive meal.</span> <span id="s126">My -- my father would be home most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the weekends.</span> <span id="s127">Saturday morning we would go to synagogue again.</span> <span id="s128">The synagogue would finish at about half past 10, 11 o’clock.</span> <span id="s129">We then would go home and have a very festive breakfast, and after that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father’s mother, who was living in town.</span> <span id="s130">And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old.</span> <span id="s131">And we had to visit her every Saturday.</span> <span id="s132">And after that we’d go back to synagogue for the afternoon service, a -- which was at about one o’clock, and about two o’clock was the main meal, and in the evening at the end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to synagogue and participated what’s called the Havdalah service.</span> <span id="s133">So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolved largely around the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s134">On Sunday we had to go to Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to Hebrew and Jewish history.</span> <span id="s135">The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight grades in it.</span> <span id="s136">Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the high school only stayed in it for four years.</span> <span id="s137">But there were people -- Jewish kids in the school who -- whose parents could not afford to send them to high school, and who did all the eight grades in the -- in the one room school, this was a one room school.</span> <span id="s138">Which was very interesting because it -- it almost was like self education.</span> <span id="s139">There was only one teacher, and h-he would attend to all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody.</span> <span id="s140">But when he taught history, or when he taught something to somebody else, of course you could always listen in.</span> <span id="s141">And I think [indecipherable] that was very, very good for our development.</span> <span id="s142">That’s in my -- in my days, the name of that first teacher we had, his name was Gunsberg, and he became an outstanding person in the [indecipherable] s-service, or [indecipherable] organization in Israel, when he finally em-emigrated to Israel, some time before World War Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: When you started the high school, tell me what age you were when you started the high school, and were your friends at the high school only Jewish, or did you have also non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: We started high school at the age of te -- 10.</span> <span id="s145">Before the Hitler period, we mixed fairly freely.</span> <span id="s146">Not hundred percent te -- hundred percent freely, but fairly freely with everybody.</span> <span id="s147">And there was not much of a distinction made between Jews and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate very easily with everybody else.</span> <span id="s148">In my case, of course, this only lasted for one year.</span> <span id="s149">And then in 1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s150">But in the case of my older brother, this state of affairs had much -- lasted much longer.</span> <span id="s151">My cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the oldest amongst all of us who was at that time, he must have been already about 16 or 17, he had gone through that whole school, and of course had been totally integrated into the class in which he was.</span> <span id="s152">So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not much -- there was not much distinction made, but there -- there -- there was -- always was a certain amount of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s153">And the really wealthy families in town, non-Jewish wealthy families did not mix with Jews, basically.</span> <span id="s154">So there were certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you remember feeling anti-Semitism in school before -- before Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Oh yes, yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s157">First of all, it was already 1932, the Nazi movement was already very active, and certain -- let’s say parents of certain -- of children have -- were already very active Nazis.</span> <span id="s158">And they already came out with some objections to Jews.</span> <span id="s159">It didn’t -- it wasn’t very serious, and we didn’t take it very serious, and we also had -- always had already answers to everything.</span> <span id="s160">We always fought back.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well, some of the [indecipherable] I remember somebody say to him -- said to me, you Goddamn Jew, you have a bend in your nose, you know, Jewish nose?</span> <span id="s163">And I said better -- I said it’s much better than having a bird in your brain like you do.</span> <span id="s164">I said -- that’s the German expression for -- for being a nut, is to have, you know -- so -- but it -- it more or less stopped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you ever feel, you know, physically harassed, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Well now, are you talking about f -- before Hitler, or after Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: First before.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Before Hitler, I don’t -- I don’t think -- I personally had no encounters of physical harassment.</span> <span id="s169">Maybe it was just lucky, but I -- I don’t think it was very common to have physical harassment before Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Would you say -- can you tell me how large the overall town was, how many people lived there, and was it -- would you say it was pretty good relations in general between the Jewish community and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: The town had 8,000 in habitants, and as I said before, there were about 25 Jewish families in it.</span> <span id="s172">The relationships were, I think, pretty good.</span> <span id="s173">There were, of course, very Jewish businesses, and there were certain people who were anti-Semitic, who were just avoided.</span> <span id="s174">You just didn’t con-contact them.</span> <span id="s175">Of course, the -- the point of our town with 8,000 inhabitants is that everybody knows everybody.</span> <span id="s176">You couldn’t hide.</span> <span id="s177">But by and large, I think it was a pretty peaceful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Now before we get to the time when Hitler comes to power, can you give me just a very brief snapshot, the personalities of your family members; your mom, your -- your father, and your siblings.</span> <span id="s179">Just give me a sense of, you know, who they -- who they are, and -- and their personalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, my father was the -- was very, very respected by -- by us.</span> <span id="s181">He was our greatest friend, and w-we three sons had a extremely good relationship with him when he was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s184">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s185">If you could continue to tell me -- you were starting to tell me about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: My mother, of course, had a hard job educating three sons, and no daughter.</span> <span id="s187">And she was -- could be quite volatile at times, and put on quite some scenes when we wouldn’t go along with what she preached.</span> <span id="s188">And w-we could at times form a united front against her, and she would complain like hell to my father, who w-would get very upset about it, when he heard about it.</span> <span id="s189">But -- and I don’t want to underestimate the fact that, of course, my mother was in the afternoon in -- in my father’s business, and we were somewhat educated by the maids we had in the house, too.</span> <span id="s190">We had two maids, as I said before, and we had other se-servants, and that had some sort -- quite a bit of influence on us, too.</span> <span id="s191">Which I suppose is the usual experience of people who have grown up in -- in we-wealthy homes where there were servants.</span> <span id="s192">My older brother was -- he was very much the intellectual.</span> <span id="s193">He we -- he -- he was what you called a bookworm.</span> <span id="s194">And he -- he loved reading, and it came -- came -- c-came in very handy later on.</span> <span id="s195">I can go into the fine details afterwards.</span> <span id="s196">And my younger brother, he was outstandingly good looking.</span> <span id="s197">So -- and my mother always said that I’m -- I was her only s -- d-daughter.</span> <span id="s198">I had to learn all the practical skills.</span> <span id="s199">I had to do all the stuff in the kitchen, helping and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s200">My -- my older brother was shielded from that -- he was quite awkward, too, that’s because he was so bookish.</span> <span id="s201">My younger brother, of course, was spoiled like hell because he was so good looking, and so I had to have all the practical skills to -- to help everybody.</span> <span id="s202">So those -- those were the personalities, and they somewhat remained that way all our lives, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So tell me now about Hitler coming to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Well, of course it wasn’t a -- it was not unexpected.</span> <span id="s205">There had been so many elections, and every election Germany was going further and further to the right.</span> <span id="s206">More and more people were voting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of which were eventually merged into the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s207">Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so unexpected.</span> <span id="s208">When we visited my grandparents in Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- in a town that was largely Protestant.</span> <span id="s209">And that town was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler.</span> <span id="s210">So already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids who didn’t play with us because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s211">And they were already converted.</span> <span id="s212">So it’s a -- a -- th-they -- this is where the indic -- these were the indications of things changing.</span> <span id="s213">This a -- well, I never forget the day Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s214">We were having lunch, and we were listening to the radio, which was on because we listened to the one o’clock news.</span> <span id="s215">And the newscast came out, and then suddenly the announcer said, “And here is a little message, which has just fallen on my desk, the president of Germany, Hindenburg, has appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of -- as the next chancellor of the German state.”</span> <span id="s216">And I remember my mother was very, very shocked to hear this, and somehow we took it and said -- said well, that wa -- this was just one of the things we had to face.</span> <span id="s217">The full implication of it, well I suppose we didn’t ful -- fully realize -- at the time the kids didn’t, but my mother obviously did.</span> <span id="s218">My father was not home.</span> <span id="s219">I can’t remember whether he came home that night.</span> <span id="s220">But soon -- he certainly came home very soon after.</span> <span id="s221">Now -- things changed in school now very -- I would say very rapidly.</span> <span id="s222">There -- some of the cra -- o -- some of our classmates were keen to join the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s223">There was no Hitler youth in our town, and every time they had a demonstration, they had to call out the high school, which included us, for all their -- their demonstration, and whatever they were celebrating at the time.</span> <span id="s224">Eventually my father got us out of there, we didn’t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what -- what do they call it?</span> <span id="s225">It’s called in German [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s226">Had the torchlight parades and all that sort of things.</span> <span id="s227">We didn’t have to go -- go along with that any more, but in the beginning we did, because the school just said everybody come tonight, there’ll be a torchlight parade to celebrate this, that, and the other.</span> <span id="s228">And so we had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Now did you always feel and know that you were against this, even though you had to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis.</span> <span id="s231">That, I think is the advantage of having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s232">My father’s father had come from Holland to marry my -- marry my grandmother.</span> <span id="s233">And he had grown up with the Sephardic Jews in Holland, though he was not Sephardic himself.</span> <span id="s234">In fact they were from the part of Holland that borders on Germany.</span> <span id="s235">And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience.</span> <span id="s236">And every time the word Spain was used, he spit.</span> <span id="s237">I didn’t know him personally any more.</span> <span id="s238">He -- he died in 1917.</span> <span id="s239">He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s240">And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that sort of things was part of the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s241">And there were two Jewish families living in town, who had come from either Poland or Russia, and who had been exposed to this whole business of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish persecution in the east.</span> <span id="s242">So again, everybody was Orthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one’s history.</span> <span id="s243">We had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came.</span> <span id="s244">People find that hard to believe, particularly I -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not brought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when someone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had -- who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to power, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that time.</span> <span id="s245">But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn’t socialize that well with other pe -- with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn’t eat in their homes.</span> <span id="s246">And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our homes, and eat with us.</span> <span id="s247">As one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the ha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- we -- homes were not that comfortable in those days, and we all were friends because we played on the street.</span> <span id="s248">So the -- the intimacy that one now can experience in being in each other’s home, we had -- we did not have that in any case.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So did you start to experience more restrictions at school?</span> <span id="s250">And also who -- tell me a little bit about the composition of -- of the student body at school.</span> <span id="s251">I think you s-said in your memoirs mostly Catholic, but tell me a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s253">The -- of course the town was largely Catholic, and most of our classmates before Hitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth movement.</span> <span id="s254">That was the standard thing to do, for everybody to belong to the Catholic youth movement.</span> <span id="s255">That of course we -- we were already automatically excluded.</span> <span id="s256">We did not, at that time, have a Jewish youth movement to which we belonged, but we did later on.</span> <span id="s257">Now, all these -- of course, now the pressure became very strong on all these members of the Catholic youth movement to change over to the Hitler youth, and most of them did, eventually.</span> <span id="s258">It took a little while for everybody to go along that line, but this is -- this is where they went, eventually.</span> <span id="s259">And our attitude to them was you are wrong and we are right.</span> <span id="s260">Well, it’s a -- things came to a head on the first of April, 1933.</span> <span id="s261">Now, this was only what, three months after Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s262">He come to power on the 13th of January, 1933.</span> <span id="s263">The -- they started this boycott movement against Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s264">And it was a Saturday, and there were storm troopers in front of every Jewish business to make sure that people wouldn’t buy at -- in Jewish shops.</span> <span id="s265">And w-we of course had to go to school on Saturday, we didn’t write, we didn’t ca-carry our satchel because we were Orthodox, but we had to go to school and listen to the school classes.</span> <span id="s266">And while we were in school, the -- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted teachers, [indecipherable] was trusted most, came and called us out, and he said -- he said to us, I remember there were four Jewish boys in my grade, “Look, you know what’s happening to you.</span> <span id="s267">I think it’d be safer for you to go home now.”</span> <span id="s268">So, when we went home, and well, you know, this -- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine.</span> <span id="s269">Course our parents were -- I won’t say shocked, but they were stunned.</span> <span id="s270">And my father wasn’t going to take it.</span> <span id="s271">So he immediately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, he got on the telephone to the headmaster of the school, and he says, “Hey, what’s happening?</span> <span id="s272">I’m not going to send my children back to the school if you can’t guarantee their safety.”</span> <span id="s273">I am convinced that that headmaster then had to contact all the necessary party lines.</span> <span id="s274">I don’t think there was a Gestapo in this town yet, at that time.</span> <span id="s275">I was very much aware of the Gestapo when it finally came, because of course, they -- they -- later on, at the outbreak of World War Two, they took over our house as Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s276">But I’m sure he -- he couldn’t give my father a direct answer, he had to square this away with all the authorities.</span> <span id="s277">Anyhow, by Monday morning he told my father that all the Jewish students could come back to the high school, and they could guarantee their -- our safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: How did you feel personally?</span> <span id="s279">Were you getting worried, as -- as a youngster?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Not in the least.</span> <span id="s281">Not in the least for it.</span> <span id="s282">They were wrong, we were right.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Do you want to take a short break?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yeah, I have to get my medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Okay, if you want to continue telling me recollections of -- of this early period when the Nazis came.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: So that was April first, and the next lightning bolt struck on May first.</span> <span id="s287">Of course May first is always celebrated in -- in Europe by all labor unions and people who have anything to do with labor, you know, which the Nazis thought they were -- were too.</span> <span id="s288">This was a big celebration.</span> <span id="s289">And of course there again, we had to have a -- a parade, and again, since there was no Hitler youth, so we -- we ha-had to collec -- come together again.</span> <span id="s290">There wasn’t a big demonstration, but we suddenly -- one of the teachers came out with a swastika emblem, which showed that he’d been -- been a member of the Nazi party for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s291">I don’t know whether it was true.</span> <span id="s292">There’s a long history attached to this character.</span> <span id="s293">He was a dis -- teacher of mathematics, bio -- and particularly of biology, and he eventually was charged with teaching the signs of a racist, a subject -- new subject, which the -- the Nazis had thought out.</span> <span id="s294">Anyhow, on May first it turned out, he -- he came out with a swastika emblem on his coat, which showed that he had been a long time member of the Nazi party.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And you -- you witnessed this yourself, this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s297">I have a long history with this man, who of course now, by now he’s dead.</span> <span id="s298">But he was an invalid.</span> <span id="s299">I can’t remember from what any more, but he -- he -- he walked av -- one of his legs wasn’t functioning properly, so he was never called into the war, he stayed in the town through the whole war period, and as I said, I had quite a history with this character.</span> <span id="s300">Anyhow, now m-my older brother, who decided that we should not communicate with our classmates any more.</span> <span id="s301">We -- we shouldn’t wait.</span> <span id="s302">He was -- my older brother was the sort of leader of the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s303">My cousin, who as I said, who was about at that time was 16 - 17 years old.</span> <span id="s304">When he died last year he -- in New York.</span> <span id="s305">He was -- he -- he wasn’t in school any more, anyhow, so my older brother became the leader of the Jewish children, and he decided that we’re not going to wait until we’re excluded, we’re going to separate ourselves.</span> <span id="s306">So from that time on was -- we did not communicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in the -- in the a -- in the periods between lessons.</span> <span id="s307">Well -- we -- communication was absolutely at a -- at a minimum.</span> <span id="s308">You know, without any degree of intimacy between them and us.</span> <span id="s309">So, and this how I went to school for five years.</span> <span id="s310">My older brother, who left in 1935, who -- which was three years later, and went to, at that time, Palestine, Israel.</span> <span id="s311">And so he was out, and so other Jewish children were taken out of school and sent abroad, or didn’t continue high school.</span> <span id="s312">Emigrated and gone [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s313">So eventually, by the time -- by the time I left, there -- there were only very few Jews -- Jewish children left in the school, in the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you feel -- what about the Nuremberg laws?</span> <span id="s315">Did you and your family feel repercussions also?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah, the Nuremberg laws as far as we were concerned meant that we couldn’t have any non-Jewish maids any more.</span> <span id="s317">We then managed to get some maids whose nationality -- we-were Dutch by nationality, you know, it’s in a -- in a fr-frontier area like that wasn’t that difficult to find.</span> <span id="s318">But that was the na -- the major effect it had -- had on us.</span> <span id="s319">I am not aware of any other of these, you know, manifestation of the Nuremberg laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: What about your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: My father reduced his business considerably, and he started -- he -- he concentrated all his efforts on getting cash out of Germany.</span> <span id="s322">And he set up a new business which sold vacuum cleaners, and irons, and you know, for -- for pressing clothing, things of that nature, because he saw a chance to do business of that nature, to get a lot of his money out of Germany, which of course, was illegal.</span> <span id="s323">There were schemes of that nature.</span> <span id="s324">I know my uncles had had schemes of that nature.</span> <span id="s325">My father’s brothers who were -- all of them were doing very well financially.</span> <span id="s326">And -- and including my father’s best friend, who became my father-in-law later on, he too had a scheme of this nature, and this is how people who had money managed to get some of their possessions out of the country, some of their cash out of the country.</span> <span id="s327">It’s -- it’s a complicated way of doing it.</span> <span id="s328">Might be interesting to investigate it some time, but I think it goes too far to talk about it in great detail here.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Do you -- do you know at least where, in general, he was sending the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yeah, to -- largely to Holland.</span> <span id="s331">And he -- he went to Holland very frequently.</span> <span id="s332">He had a cousin in Winterswijk who cooperated with him.</span> <span id="s333">And I don’t know all the details about it -- it -- but there -- there always was some money available for us.</span> <span id="s334">He bought a house in -- in Israel in the early stage, when he -- he went on a trip to Israel, I think in -- first time in 1936, or 1937, and you know my -- of course my older brother was there, and he obviously had to pay for the school, my brother went to Ben Shemen together with all the -- a lot of the famous leaders of -- o-of -- a lot of the men who became the famous leaders later on in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Including -- in -- and amongst these -- his classmates were people like Rabin and Dayan.</span> <span id="s337">So he -- so, as I said, money was available from -- for him to attend these schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Tell me what were -- what were the conversations like within your family, and at home?</span> <span id="s339">What were you talking about now?</span> <span id="s340">Your father’s business was changing, the changes at school.</span> <span id="s341">What -- what kind of conversations at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Interesting question.</span> <span id="s343">Was a -- what were we -- what were we talking about?</span> <span id="s344">Well, I don’t think the subjects changed that dr-drastically.</span> <span id="s345">My parents were still very much interested in literature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture.</span> <span id="s346">And they -- they did occasionally discuss what we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public.</span> <span id="s347">And -- and if you had to be cautious and all that.</span> <span id="s348">At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and -- the police and the storm troopers came into our house, and they went through my father’s library, but they weren’t -- weren’t enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious background.</span> <span id="s349">So my mother, too, had no -- absolutely no fear of these people.</span> <span id="s350">So I call them a bunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers.</span> <span id="s351">And I’m sure they -- my parents are not afraid of them and nothing close to -- very radically happened.</span> <span id="s352">But my father was in the -- interesting point, my father was in the town council.</span> <span id="s353">He had advocated that the high school for girls, which only had 50 students in it, should be combined with the high school of boys.</span> <span id="s354">Now, of course, in a Catholic town that was out of the question.</span> <span id="s355">My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the town to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that.</span> <span id="s356">Well would you believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two schools?</span> <span id="s357">My father was away, I think in Hannover at the time, and my mother -- I remember my mother telling him on the telephone that this has happened, but of course she didn’t say it direct because the telephones were probably listened to.</span> <span id="s358">But she said -- she used some Jewish expression to -- to make him aware of that this was -- was happening.</span> <span id="s359">Finally his scheme was being translated into reality.</span> <span id="s360">So from one day to the other we had girls in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Now, was your -- was your life a-aside from not interacting with non-Jewish students at school, were there other things about your daily life that really changed, or was it largely the same as -- as before?</span> <span id="s362">A: It was largely the same as before, except that [indecipherable] we cou -- we couldn’t show our faces any more at sports events, you know?</span> <span id="s363">You know, these sort of sports events that are organized, what shall we say, by kids themselves.</span> <span id="s364">There was a certain amount of exclusion there, and that it got worse.</span> <span id="s365">But there were -- there were classes to teach aircraft design in the afternoon, which I participated in and I’m sure we were allowed to participate in.</span> <span id="s366">So it’s -- i-it didn’t change too drastically, except now, the other thing was of course that now we had a different teacher, who was very, very keen to -- to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different teacher -- teacher of the Jewish elementary school, and he was very, very keen that we should go into much -- to greater depths in -- in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s367">And eventually we went to Hebrew classes.</span> <span id="s368">Now, I’m talking about modern Hebrew speaking classes, every -- every day, except Friday.</span> <span id="s369">Every afternoon we had Hebrew classes.</span> <span id="s370">So that -- that was a radical change.</span> <span id="s371">And of course it did us a lot of good, and -- because go -- got us much into greater depths into Hebrew.</span> <span id="s372">This teacher, who also later on was -- became the headmaster of the Mizrachi high school in Tel Aviv, he started the -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a little bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other towns occasionally, and so we were -- became the members of the Mizrachi.</span> <span id="s373">Now it’s a national religious party, but it wasn’t as radical as that in those days.</span> <span id="s374">The youth movement, and we were part of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So this was still in Borken, and was this a Zionist group?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, yes, yes, it was a Zionist -- Zionist group.</span> <span id="s377">That must have started round about 1934 or so, because my older brother was still in town when we started it, and he became one of the motivators of it.</span> <span id="s378">And as I said before, he left in ’35, I think, to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s379">So that -- that was another connection which we had -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s381">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: My mother’s sister had gone to the Jewish agricultural school near Hannover, as -- when she had finished elementary school.</span> <span id="s383">And there she met the man whom she eventually married, Alex Mo.</span> <span id="s384">And who was one of the teachers in the school.</span> <span id="s385">And both my uncle, Alex Mo, and my aunt, spend all their lives until they emigrated from Germany, being in charge of agricultural training schools for Jews.</span> <span id="s386">Now, in 1932, I think it was, I spent a summer in the school which they ran at the time, which was near Berlin, it was called Gutwinkle, and we somewhat participated a little bit in the work they did, and ma -- we were rewarded for it.</span> <span id="s387">But then, in 1933, they took over a very large, what we called a hashavah camp, a cultural training camp for Jews who were changing professionally to agriculture.</span> <span id="s388">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s389">And I spent almost every summer there, until I left Germany.</span> <span id="s390">And this of course, it was a fantastic influence on all our lives.</span> <span id="s391">We -- we loved the ti -- to go there.</span> <span id="s392">Since my uncle was in charge, we had, of course, a lot of privileges.</span> <span id="s393">One of them was that we did a lot of horseback riding, and s-systematically learned horseback riding from one -- one of the teachers who was there, non-Jewish, who had been in the German army cavalry.</span> <span id="s394">My uncle himself, who rode around all the time, supervised the work that was being done in the fields by these trainees, who were changing from all sorts of profession over into agriculture.</span> <span id="s395">And to a child this was an absolutely i -- ideal way of -- of living.</span> <span id="s396">We -- I have interest stories of the -- of the life we led there, and it was a -- a [indecipherable] connected with the work and play, and it was a terrific experience.</span> <span id="s397">And I had -- it’s of -- very much set the atmosphere, both for my brothers and for myself, as to wh-where we wanted to go professionally, eve-eventually.</span> <span id="s398">Some --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: How did it -- how did it establish your direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, my uncle thought well, of -- you know, he -- he put -- put us into whatever we wanted to do, and was -- wherever we could be used.</span> <span id="s401">We -- in the morning we always worked, and he soon found out that I was very, very handy, so he assigned me to the repair shop which they had there.</span> <span id="s402">And that sort of set me on my -- on my aim to become an engineer for repairing -- for agricultural machinery.</span> <span id="s403">I played around already at that time a little bit with the idea of becoming a chemical engineer, but it was -- there was -- everybody said you can’t do that without doing it full time.</span> <span id="s404">And I always felt that I would never have the money to go to a full time university.</span> <span id="s405">So, there -- that was, of course, my idea, and I’ve already mentioned, my older brother went to an eke -- went to Israel, went to Ben Shemen, which was the agricultural school in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s406">So that set his life, too.</span> <span id="s407">And my younger brother, he -- when he finished school in -- in England, eventually he also took up -- there was a -- a job in -- in agriculture, and stayed in that field all his life.</span> <span id="s408">He later on became a specialist of fertilizers and things of that nature.</span> <span id="s409">So all our directions were set by this agricultural experience, which we had in the training schools run by our uncle and a-aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And this is when you’re a teenager, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And what about your Bar Mitzvah during this time of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Well, Bar Mitzvah to us was not a big deal really, because we knew so much Hebrew, and learned so much.</span> <span id="s414">And my older brother was Bar Mitzvahed in 1933, yeah ’33, that’s right.</span> <span id="s415">And at the time -- at the time my -- my mother’s father had just died.</span> <span id="s416">So my parents didn’t -- for that reason, and also because the Hitler business, did not want to make a huge Bar Mitzvah for him.</span> <span id="s417">But, you know, he had a f -- it was a very nice Bar Mitzvah and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s418">Very luxurious, but it was kept relatively small.</span> <span id="s419">You know, we had a huge family because my -- my grandmother had five boys and five girls.</span> <span id="s420">And we al -- and they all married, and they all had kids, you know, so th -- wa -- it was somewh -- somewhat resented by all these relatives that they -- they weren’t -- the invitations were relatively kept to a small [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s421">Now, by the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1930 -- it’s 22 and 13 is 35, right?</span> <span id="s422">Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s423">’33 to thir -- yeah, ’35.</span> <span id="s424">By the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1935, w -- we had a really huge Bar Mitzvah, with all the trimmings on it, and of course people coming to our town, they had to be fed three times on a s -- Saturday, you know?</span> <span id="s425">On Friday nights, on Saturday morning, and s -- then somehow again something -- something again in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s426">We were expected to do the whole Torah reading for that day, of sh -- was no -- no difficulty to me at all.</span> <span id="s427">And we were expected to do the whole reading from the prophets, the Haftorah readings for the day.</span> <span id="s428">Again, no -- no -- no particular -- wa -- and we were expected to make a speech.</span> <span id="s429">And I made a f -- apparently made a speech which upset my parents very much, because I -- politically it was unwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Well, yeah, I think I started off by saying we are being accused of -- of such and such, and such and such things now, and I’ll teach you that this is totally against our laws, and that we couldn’t be like this.</span> <span id="s432">And so it’s a so -- so anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So your -- your speech actually had to do with the political climate and the times?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s435">But you know, the speech was made at home, not in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s436">And the servants of course that were around, were non-Jews, who served the meals, so -- I don’t think that my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- non-Jewish friends to any of these occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: What were your favorite Jewish holidays growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Oh, I would say Pesach, Passover.</span> <span id="s439">Best food.</span> <span id="s440">You know, cause of my mother, being such a fabulous cook, all these things were -- were -- were on a -- on a scale that wer -- was gour -- real gourmet eating.</span> <span id="s441">I mean, even the -- you know, that we -- we of course did not eat meat on the nine days before Tisha B’Av.</span> <span id="s442">But it was wonderful, the stuff my mother cooked was just out of this world.</span> <span id="s443">No meat in it, and this being summer, you know, you have all the fruits you want.</span> <span id="s444">And she made the most fantastic fruit soups, and vegetable soups tha -- vegetable dishes, anything you could think of.</span> <span id="s445">And this way it was no hardship at all.</span> <span id="s446">The only hardship was that we also couldn’t go swimming in those -- in those nine days.</span> <span id="s447">And in the summer, you know?</span> <span id="s448">So we were waiting for Tisha B’Av to be gon -- be gone so we could go back to the s -- to the swim baths, you know, go swimming.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: That reminds me of something you wrote in your memoirs about the pool in -- in the community.</span> <span id="s450">Can you tell me about that during this time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, actually it’s a -- the -- the -- the pool was not forbidden to us, except for certain times.</span> <span id="s452">They had to, you know, there was sort of a mixture between Catholic and Nazi.</span> <span id="s453">They had periods [indecipherable] was women only, and -- where women were allowed.</span> <span id="s454">Those periods we did not -- we were not allowed to go into the swimming pool, the town swimming pool.</span> <span id="s455">But then they also had periods when the -- the pool was open to men only, and those periods -- in those periods we could still sneak in and take a swim.</span> <span id="s456">So we had to be carefully attuned to what could and what could not be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Was there any rule at all that said that Jews could not swim in that pool?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah, not -- not -- not -- not complete exclusion.</span> <span id="s459">The exclusion was only for the periods when women were allowed, or mixed swimming was allowed.</span> <span id="s460">So we managed to ge -- to gets -- to sneak in still.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Were there any other places in town where you weren’t actually allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: They -- the -- the -- you know, there was only one movie house in town, and that put up a sign fairly soon saying we don’t want any Jews, Juden [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s463">And when that sign went up, my parents would not allow us to go in any more because this is -- you know, that -- that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So it’s not like you tried, you just decided not to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: We decided that -- not to go, yeah.</span> <span id="s466">I think if you could have sneaked in, nobody would have objected very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: And what about any recollections of Nazis in -- in your town, did you ever have any encounters yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s469">Violent, too.</span> <span id="s470">I mean, it started to get dangerous to -- to walk in the -- i -- you know, in the very beautiful woods around that town.</span> <span id="s471">You know, on Saturday afternoon we would go for a walk, and sha -- would want to play, and there were certain guys who -- who it was dangerous to meet.</span> <span id="s472">And they were beating us up and God knows what.</span> <span id="s473">That’s -- we had to be very, very careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did this actually happen to you, or mostly to others?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s476">Once a guy hit me in the face with a burning rubber -- rubber what do you call it, a rubber stick, and I, you know, I had an injury from it for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s477">And there was another, you know, usually it was just beating up, or stones being thrown, and things of that nature.</span> <span id="s478">You just had -- had to be very, very careful.</span> <span id="s479">And you just -- nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s480">You had to recognize that there was superior force on the other side.</span> <span id="s481">You don’t stand and fight superior force.</span> <span id="s482">You just have to flee from it, go into an area where gro -- you have enough grown-ups who would interfere with what these kids were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So now tell me about what -- what happened -- what leads up to you going to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Actually, my parents wanted to get me into a Jewish high school in Berlin in 1938.</span> <span id="s485">On -- on one of the many trips to this farm, that training farm which my uncle and aunt -- aunt were in charge of, I had to -- come to know two of these schools.</span> <span id="s486">They had to -- they had come to visit the farm, and I was there.</span> <span id="s487">I got very, very friendly with some of the teachers, and some of the kids.</span> <span id="s488">And as a matter of fact I went to one of the schools, and well, for a day or two in Berlin, and listened in, and from -- and then my parents said in 1938, that I should leave the school in our hometown and go to one of those schools.</span> <span id="s489">And it was decided that since all these schools are very far advanced in teaching English, I will need enough English to ca -- catch up with the other me-members of the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: What languages did you know already at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: We had been -- we had, apart from Hebrew, of course, which we did not learn in public school, our education was Latin.</span> <span id="s492">We -- we -- ever since we were 10 years old, every day we learned -- had at least one or two hours of Latin.</span> <span id="s493">Latin was the foundation of our -- of our knowledge.</span> <span id="s494">Now, I learned some English, I learned some French, but certainly not -- not to a very high degree.</span> <span id="s495">Anyhow, my parents wanted to send me to England for the summer, and -- to learn English, and then I -- I would come back to -- to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s496">But while I was in England, my parents wrote saying that they have talked with other people, and they’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not wise for me to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s497">And they said what would you do if we were tell you, you just stay where you are.</span> <span id="s498">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: And what did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s501">I was free.</span> <span id="s502">I had -- I had made friends, again thr -- through my relatives with other f-family where the gentleman was very active in the Jewish agency, Adler Rudell.</span> <span id="s503">And I went to them, and I told them that -- what my parents had written, and -- and what should I do?</span> <span id="s504">And we decided that the thing to do was, since my means were limited, was to go to an intensive tutorial college, and try and do metric, you know, high school cer -- equivalent to a high school certificate, in that fashion.</span> <span id="s505">And I -- I loved the idea to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Now tell me when is this, how old are you, and what kind of major experience is this for you at this time, because you’re pretty young.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s508">This was 1938, so I was 16 years old, and -- I liked the idea of trying to make it in about four or five months, to try and get -- get a equivalent of a high school certificate, and then go and start working.</span> <span id="s509">Since I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I would get myself a job, and I would go on and learning in -- in evening classes.</span> <span id="s510">I didn’t have any doubts as to what to do, and I like -- as I said, I like the idea to be on my own.</span> <span id="s511">Now my parents did come over occasionally, my father or my mother, or both of them, during all this time when I first came to England, and -- until the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s512">They -- on and off there, they were in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Was it easy for you to leave, and also for them to travel like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: It was very easy for me to leave, because we all had been living so close to the frontier, we all had passes to cross the frontier.</span> <span id="s515">It took a long while to get a passport wh-which could take me past the frontier areas of Holland.</span> <span id="s516">But we -- we -- we all passports at the time.</span> <span id="s517">One more thing, already at that age, I had learned to drive the car.</span> <span id="s518">My father wanted me to do that in case we suddenly had to get out in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s519">So by the age of 16, and of course t-totally illegal, I knew how to drive a car already.</span> <span id="s520">And I -- I left home on a Friday afternoon, Friday morning, I crossed the frontier, went to my c -- my father took me to his cousin, I stayed there for the weekend, and on Sunday I traveled on to Hoek van Holland, took the night boat over to England, and arrangements had been made by my parents for me to live temporarily with a family, a very nice family in -- in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: So when you were preparing to leave, were you thinking a lot about the escalating events in Germany?</span> <span id="s522">Is this what you and your parents talked about a lot?</span> <span id="s523">Is this also -- was this on your mind a great deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, yes, in my mi -- we came to the con -- conclusion that things were really getting worse and worse, and that it wasn’t worthwhile to take the risk of sticking around.</span> <span id="s525">So -- and since I was out of the country anyhow, my parents felt that I should stay out, because as I said before, my older brother had been in -- in -- in Israel since 1935, so it wa -- it wasn’t such a big sh -- idea for me to get out, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: But your parents and your younger brother did stay in your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s528">My father somehow just couldn’t make -- give himself the push to cut off everything.</span> <span id="s529">He saw more and more chances to get at least some of his money out, and he was going to stick it out to the -- to the end and get the maximum amount, you know, of course that probably was the wrong decision to make.</span> <span id="s530">My younger brother also stayed at home.</span> <span id="s531">My parents were rather reluctant to let him go because he was not independent yet, and so he stayed until after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: So tell me about what you knew while you were now in London, what you knew about events, things going on like Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s533">What -- what did you hear, and what did you know about what was happening back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Well, it’s a -- you know, this became wu -- practically headline news in the British papers, when this Kristallnacht happened, and some of the papers tried to say that this was spontaneous, you know, and other papers, like the new scr -- new [indecipherable] liberal paper, they said no, this is organized.</span> <span id="s535">I discussed -- discussed it with my friends, the Adler Rudell, and he said, “No, this was organized by the state, there was nothing spontaneous about that.”</span> <span id="s536">This was an assertion of power, a first sign, and if you had no doubts about it, where all this was going to -- to -- to lead.</span> <span id="s537">The fact that so many people had been put into prison, some in concentration camp, and so on, so forth, I mean I don’t think that anybody, at least I didn’t have any doubts this was the beginning of an absolute disaster.</span> <span id="s538">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Were you worried about your family, your parents, and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No, I don’t think I was worried about my parents because I knew that they could always get out when they wanted to get out, and this is what they intended to do.</span> <span id="s541">And -- and that they had enough means to -- to -- to get out when they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s542">So from -- personally we didn’t -- I didn’t feel this was a -- was to -- go -- going to be so critical.</span> <span id="s543">But you know, the [indecipherable] the stateless Jews [indecipherable] family in our town, people who had come from Poland, and never -- never become citizens, and you know, they were picked up, and shipped away, and put at the border of Poland and -- and -- and Germany.</span> <span id="s544">That time we were very much aware of what was happening to them.</span> <span id="s545">You should -- you know, the Poles didn’t want to let them in, and the Germans wouldn’t have them.</span> <span id="s546">And, you know, these were families whom we knew.</span> <span id="s547">[indecipherable] 35 families in a town, of course you know everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Did you have a feeling once you’re in London that you may never return to your hometown, or what was your sense at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s550">Already when I left Germany I knew I would never -- never return.</span> <span id="s551">And I was -- I -- I was convinced that this German experiment would last for ages and ages and we would never be allowed to return.</span> <span id="s552">I never mentioned that this was all going to be over and done with in -- in what was it? ’</span> <span id="s553">38?</span> <span id="s554">Fa -- ’45?</span> <span id="s555">That’s seven years, right?</span> <span id="s556">We got back to Germany in ’45.</span> <span id="s557">It’s incredible.</span> <span id="s558">It’s incredible, except that it didn’t seem so incredible after Munich, you know.</span> <span id="s559">After Munich we knew that war was coming, and -- and that Hitler would go too far.</span> <span id="s560">So -- but befo -- but when I left, I thought I will never see the place again.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: How did that make you feel, had -- did you feel an attachment to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, I -- I did, you know.</span> <span id="s563">I -- after all, we had traveled a lot in Germany, we had been in various children’s camps, things of that nature, and I -- I -- I loved the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful woods and all.</span> <span id="s564">[indecipherable] very much trave -- traveled along the Rhine.</span> <span id="s565">Was a beautiful area, by -- into -- by train, and so we were very much aware of what the place looked like, and definitely had -- definitely had a certain attachment to it.</span> <span id="s566">Felt very bad about never being able to see it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So tell me a little bit about your life in -- in London, and are you following the news very carefully?</span> <span id="s568">Is this something that you really were, you know, closely following, about these developments?</span> <span id="s569">Just tell me about this phase of your life before the war actually starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Well, first off, as I said, when I came to London, I was living with a wonderful family, with the Jacobs, who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs, he’d been an officer in a Jewish brigade in World War One, and of course, knowing a lot about Zionist history, all this makes a little sense to me.</span> <span id="s571">His wife was from a Jewish family that had settled originally in -- in Scotland, she spoke quite a good ger -- German, and sh-she was [indecipherable] woman, very hard working.</span> <span id="s572">They had one daughter, about my age, and also living with them was a nephew who was an orphan, and who went to business every day.</span> <span id="s573">And also a distant relative, a girl from -- a Polish Jewish girl apparently from very well-to-do parents.</span> <span id="s574">She spent every afternoon in the movies.</span> <span id="s575">She was a total movie addict, this girl.</span> <span id="s576">So -- so it was a big household, and actually we only ate together on -- again, on Friday nights, and Saturday lunch time.</span> <span id="s577">The -- the house was located right be -- within one or two blocks of the [indecipherable] synagogue, which was a big synagogue, and that’s where Mr. Jacobs belonged.</span> <span id="s578">And -- and I concentrated on learning English, very much helped by Mrs. Jacobs, who had no hesitation to correct me, telling me what to do.</span> <span id="s579">And ever since I love reading newspapers, and the Jacobs, since they were liberals, you know, with a [indecipherable], course the newspaper was a news chronicle, and I u-used to translate newspaper articles and then learn them by heart, and this is how I si -- taught myself English, to a large extent, very much helped, as I said, by Mrs. Jacobs, as I was there.</span> <span id="s580">Was a wonderful time I had there.</span> <span id="s581">Was a little bit expensive, and so I couldn’t stay there any length of time, but while it lasted it was -- was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s584">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Well, one incident that actually I think is worthwhile recording is one day Mr. Jacobs went to the library, and he said, “Do you want anything from the library?”</span> <span id="s586">And I said “Yes, get me “Mein Kampf,” Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” in German.”</span> <span id="s587">Of course, while I was in Germany, I would never do them the honor of reading this, but I felt I had to read it, and I’m very, very grateful that I did read it at the time when I -- whe -- because it made it so clear, totally clear as to what was going to happen, from reading that book.</span> <span id="s588">And this -- all this -- the propaganda methods, the way to achieve their aim.</span> <span id="s589">This business of expanding Germany into the eastern [indecipherable] and sh -- chasing all Slavic nations behind the euro -- and all this was all -- the all -- all set out there, you know?</span> <span id="s590">It -- i-it was shus -- it was oka -- I don’t know why I did it, but I did read “Mein Kampf” in German while I was there.</span> <span id="s591">Then occasionally we went to the movies, Mr. Jacobs took me to the movies, which was, of course, in English.</span> <span id="s592">And that -- that was a good experience too.</span> <span id="s593">And generally ha-have a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s594">Eventually, when my parents say cha -- that I should stay, I realized I couldn’t stay with the Jacobs because it was far too expensive, and I had to go and look for cheaper accommodation.</span> <span id="s595">An -- but -- but of course, by that time my English had improved a lot, too.</span> <span id="s596">I had made up my mind to go to the tutorial college in Euston -- it -- is it Euston?</span> <span id="s597">It is near -- I know it’s near Bushhaus in -- it’s -- it’s Euston, which is spelled E-u-s-t-o-n.</span> <span id="s598">And so I made the arrangements to find a new home, or new digs with se -- with those factors in mind of having to go to -- to the tutorial college every day, a-and obviously I still wanted to be near a synagogue and all that, and I had to live kosher.</span> <span id="s599">So that’s -- determined where I settled.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: What were the signs of -- of the war now -- now encroaching, coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Well, the signs were the demands which Germany made on Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s602">There was the gathering of the party -- I can’t remember any more where it was, where they -- where they celebrated the presence of the S-Sudeten German people, and their demands for incorporating the Sudeten area into Germany became very, very loud and forceful, and it was quite obvious what they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s603">They wanted to annex the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s604">And this led to the Munich gathering, which -- in which France and Germany agreed -- France and England agreed that Hitler could go into -- could annex the Sudetenland without France and England going to war.</span> <span id="s605">Well, of course, Hitler signs a piece of paper saying that this would be his last demand, and it will be peace in our time.</span> <span id="s606">That’s the famous peace in our time.</span> <span id="s607">And Chamberlain came home to England, he says peace in our time, the memo in his hand, and I remember next Saturday, next Shabbat in synagogue -- I still went to the [indecipherable] synagogue, Mr. Jacob saying, “I don’t like this whole thing.”</span> <span id="s608">And of course, there was the famous speech by Churchill in Parliament, where he told Chamberlain y- you had to -- you had to choose between dishonor and war, you chose dishonor, that’s why you’re going to have war.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Was this -- was this a difficult time for you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No, no, it’s a -- you know, it no -- it became -- it -- it just said it was all inevitable.</span> <span id="s611">This is all -- what’s going to happen and so there was nothing we could do about it, and we just had to fit ourselves into this -- into this -- into this situation.</span> <span id="s612">Before the Munich agreement, a lot of people had left London, including my landlady and her daughters, [indecipherable] and I was sort of asked to look after myself, which I didn’t mind at all.</span> <span id="s613">And they -- they returned after the Munich agreement had been signed, and it was pretty sure that a war would not break out immediately.</span> <span id="s614">People we -- were divided.</span> <span id="s615">They ca -- people who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I mean, you know, this conservative party of England.</span> <span id="s616">There were a lot of those in a rich community like Goldaskreen, and they took the attitude Chamberlain did the right thing.</span> <span id="s617">We have not got the means to go to war at the moment.</span> <span id="s618">He s -- fo-fought for time.</span> <span id="s619">The people who were liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dishonor which we shouldn’t have gone in for.</span> <span id="s620">And the people who were lesstich labor, they -- they had been such you Jews, they had been such pacifists, that they -- they -- they wouldn’t hear about -- about any requirements such as having a draft and mobilizing, and any of those things.</span> <span id="s621">They -- they couldn’t get used to this idea [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s622">And, as I said, I was very much influenced by the views of people like Mr. Jacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this was a --a dishonor.</span> <span id="s623">So we’ve faced reality, as best as we could.</span> <span id="s624">And -- and of course the pressure on -- on the German Jews which -- other Jews became larger, until more and more refugees coming into England, and a lot of -- and the difficulty of getting jobs for people, and getting a way of finding money to live on became larger and larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well organized, largely by volunteers.</span> <span id="s625">They had money available, and they -- I think they, in my opinion they took care of this refugee program in an excellent -- in a wonderful way, in spite of the fact of course, obviously everybody finished up living at a standard of living which was far, far below the sort of standard of living they had experienced in -- in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Was life difficult for you as a refugee in London, or did they also make it easier for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Well, you know, the point was that I had enough money to live on.</span> <span id="s628">All I had to look after was t -- to do, was to work and work and work and try and get this high school simetric in four months, which I didn’t succeed to do eventually, but nevertheless, that effort [indecipherable] was the only thing I -- I was going for.</span> <span id="s629">It’s -- I -- I did not have to share in a lot of the hardships which other people were exposed to, because after all, my father could send me some money -- carefully, you know, didn’t squander it in any way, lived very simple.</span> <span id="s630">But it gave me certain pride to -- to live in a frugal way.</span> <span id="s631">And as I said, my aim was to -- was concentrated on qualifying for the high school certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: So tell me about the start of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: All right.</span> <span id="s634">After I finish the tutorial college, and have not passed the examination, I -- I passed everything except the English, I just wasn’t good enough.</span> <span id="s635">But I -- I decided I was not going to go back to school full time.</span> <span id="s636">And I registered as the [indecipherable] I -- I went into the German Jewish aid committee, and saw what went on there for a whole day.</span> <span id="s637">And in the evening, one of the ladies, she was from the Shief fam -- family -- you know, these were all volunteers, people who did this.</span> <span id="s638">She had -- obviously has a tough day, and she says, “Would you like to go to Manchester?”</span> <span id="s639">I said, yes, I’ll go.</span> <span id="s640">I thought it was very important that we -- we refugees would not all congregate in London, and so -- so I -- together with a few other people, a few days later, I went to Manchester, and again, there was a organized German Jewish aid committee, first liv -- first lived in a -- in -- what do you call -- would you call it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s641">Some sort of communal house, which again it was, you know, had to be kosher, and -- and it was very nicely organized, and all that, and of course we had to work and keep it clean and all that.</span> <span id="s642">And the c-committee went out and to tr-try to find us jobs.</span> <span id="s643">And -- and through them, eventually, I got a -- a job which -- which I liked very much.</span> <span id="s644">In fact, this was the first non-Jewish offer which the committee had had for jobs.</span> <span id="s645">And I wanted to go into machinery repair, and it turns out that this, we -- this part of this -- this plant was not -- the repair shop was not unionized, so I could go -- go -- go into that, and fit myself into that.</span> <span id="s646">And it turned out to be an extremely good experience.</span> <span id="s647">It’s an interesting story, you can tell it in great details.</span> <span id="s648">Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn’t work on Saturday, I wouldn’t work on Friday afternoons, or would go home early on Friday afternoons.</span> <span id="s649">But they -- they didn’t mind at all, they said, “Look, if you don’t work, you don’t get paid.</span> <span id="s650">If you clock in and you clock out, and that’s it.”</span> <span id="s651">Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in the home where we were, that I should go to a certain place, to a certain address where I would be able to make arrangements to finding a place -- permanent place to live, a lodging to -- to live.</span> <span id="s652">I went to this place, I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address, and to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautiful estate, very rich, obviously very rich people.</span> <span id="s653">I didn’t know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address.</span> <span id="s654">It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me.</span> <span id="s655">These were the Steinats.</span> <span id="s656">They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous Laskeys were the richest family in Manchester, Jewish family in Manchester.</span> <span id="s657">And the Steinats were the second richest families.</span> <span id="s658">And they were -- s-started my relationship with that -- that family.</span> <span id="s659">The brother of Mrs. Steinats had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War One, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats.</span> <span id="s660">So you see it’s just all -- all a question of connection with -- and it was very important in England, everything is c-connection.</span> <span id="s661">It’s not what you know, it’s whom you know.</span> <span id="s662">And the Steinats made arrangements for me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a room from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr. Steinats father.</span> <span id="s663">Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts.</span> <span id="s664">He didn’t like her at all.</span> <span id="s665">But it came in handy for me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years older than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a lodger.</span> <span id="s666">Now, this lady rented rooms, and she provided meals.</span> <span id="s667">It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn’t [indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I had accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it again, the circumstances of -- of cleanliness, and toilet facilities were just d-disgusting.</span> <span id="s668">But I th -- I thought this is part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in the poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for practically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere.</span> <span id="s669">Undoubtedly the Steinats were richer even than my father was.</span> <span id="s670">And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great experience.</span> <span id="s671">So I -- I think I have to take another trip to the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s673">[tape break] So where were you when the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Well, just let me tell you about one more item that was also very significant in my life.</span> <span id="s675">It -- first of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched and took over the rest of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s676">Of course, everybody thought the war was going to break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s677">Because now the attitude of France and England changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to Moscow to try and get a gr-great alliance with the Russians going.</span> <span id="s678">And of course that was their big hope, that they eventually would pull that off, and pull it off together.</span> <span id="s679">And -- and all the workers in -- in the factory where I worked said we’ll be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won’t be.</span> <span id="s680">They going to try this, and they’re going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a major alliance with the Russians.</span> <span id="s681">And this is very much what happened.</span> <span id="s682">So nothing much happened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a war.</span> <span id="s683">But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet.</span> <span id="s684">Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was at the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from Manchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from Berlin.</span> <span id="s685">Quite young, he was in middle 30’s, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable] after the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together with a few other very prominent people of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s686">The day was glorious, the weather was glorious, the food was incredible.</span> <span id="s687">Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis University.</span> <span id="s688">And he -- we became friends right there and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful lot, until the time he died in, I don’t know, some times in the 80’s.</span> <span id="s689">He was professor at Harvard, same time professor at Jerusalem University.</span> <span id="s690">And but that’s -- basically he was a fantastic thinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in Manchester, and then later on here, in this country.</span> <span id="s691">And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and views that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding of Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way.</span> <span id="s692">So that was sometime on May, 1930 -- ’39.</span> <span id="s693">And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly transpired that Germany had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a pact with Germany that they were going to divide up Poland between the two of them.</span> <span id="s694">I don’t know whether we were a hundred percent aware of it, that they were going to divide up Poland at that time, but you know, that’s what it amounted -- amounted to.</span> <span id="s695">And now the road was clear for Hitler to march into Poland, and -- which he did on September first, 1939.</span> <span id="s696">England declared war on the following Sunday, this was -- September first was a Friday, and England declared war on a -- on a Sunday night.</span> <span id="s697">And I happened to be at the Steinats at that time, listen -- listened to the speech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, which he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I had the -- the exact text of this.</span> <span id="s698">I’ve asked people to look it up, I think I want to look it up, it’s very worthwhile.</span> <span id="s699">He said these [indecipherable] evil things we’ll be fighting against, bad faith, something something, and oppression, but I can’t remember exactly any more.</span> <span id="s700">And against these, I’m sure the right will prevail.</span> <span id="s701">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Is it [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: That’s this here.</span> <span id="s704">So the -- the first thing -- the first thing we experienced at the time, was that we all had to register, we German Jews, and we were, in a typical British fashion, put before a tribunal, which [indecipherable] each case individually, and people were classified into a categ -- German -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British we were all German.</span> <span id="s705">There were -- category A went straight into interment camp, category B could go on living under certain circumstances, and category C were totally free, and being treated like British people.</span> <span id="s706">Of course with my connections to the Steinats and all that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C.</span> <span id="s707">So i-it didn’t affect me in the beginning, at all.</span> <span id="s708">The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up.</span> <span id="s709">Conscription was enacted, people were called to the services, and obviously the country was getting on a war fut -- footing slowly.</span> <span id="s710">This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing happened.</span> <span id="s711">There was a British expeditionary force sent into France but not into Belgium.</span> <span id="s712">And th-they were very -- an-and the western front was extremely inactive, nothing happened there at all.</span> <span id="s713">Hitler was occupied in the east, conquered Poland, and this was a -- and apparently things were very quiet, but everybody realized this was a quiet before -- before the storm.</span> <span id="s714">I continued to work in the same place I was, and in January ni -- 1940, I managed to pass the high school certificate, which I had continued preparing -- prepared in pravin -- largely in private class, private pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going to any classes at all.</span> <span id="s715">I had a pr -- civil pri -- different private teachers.</span> <span id="s716">I -- I had a very heavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run around all over the place, at all times of the days and nights.</span> <span id="s717">And somehow this way I -- I managed to -- to -- to survive.</span> <span id="s718">In -- now, you know, jobs became freely available.</span> <span id="s719">There was a shortage of workers everywhere, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do something closer to what I -- my long term aim was, and I got myself a job in a factory that manufactured agricultural machinery.</span> <span id="s720">They -- actual -- in actual fact, the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was not very good, and the agricultural machinery was very crude compared with what I had been doing up to that time, and I didn’t think I was learning too much from getting -- being exposed to this machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or less made up my mind to give all this up, and go into a different direction, for to -- to go into machine tools, which were th -- at the height of -- of what has -- one has to know as a mechanical engineer.</span> <span id="s721">But then of course, came the invasion of -- first of Norway and Denmark, and after that the invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the western front, and now everything changed.</span> <span id="s722">Obviously with the -- the use of secret sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers that suddenly rose up in Holland and in Belgium, in -- in less -- to a lesser extent in Denmark, but to a larger extent in Norway, now the British public became a -- very, very concerned about people like ourselves.</span> <span id="s723">The first affected -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s725">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: So, after the invasion of the lowlands, and Hitler’s victory in the west, and after the British expeditionary force had been brought back to England via Dunkirk in the famous Dunkirk retreat, it -- our life was made a lot harder.</span> <span id="s727">As I said, I had to given -- I had to give up my bicycle.</span> <span id="s728">Luckily it was summer, so I could do everything by bus, and the days were long.</span> <span id="s729">But very soon thereafter, we were interned -- put into an internment camp.</span> <span id="s730">The first internment camp I was in was near Manchester.</span> <span id="s731">It was an old disused factory, terribly filthy.</span> <span id="s732">It was in Bury, B-u-r-y, and there were about -- there must have something like two or 3,000 people in it.</span> <span id="s733">They ranged from German merchant sailors, so ver -- real Germans who had been taken prisoner on the high seas, to us, the ultra Orthodox Jew, or the Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s734">There was a whole big group of Orthodox people there, and we all stuck together.</span> <span id="s735">We of course didn’t participate in the -- the general food, we -- we did our own cooking, and looked after ourselves, which meant no meat, and of course there were no such things as eggs, so f-food was pretty short.</span> <span id="s736">I don’t -- can’t remember how long we were in this disused factory.</span> <span id="s737">We were lucky that the weather was perfect, for England, and this was a beautiful summer, because I -- I -- thinking i -- in case of rain, I don’t think the roof would -- would have held up.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: How did you first learn that you were going to be sent to this internment place?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Well, the police came around, you know, the police came around and said oh sorry, you ha -- you have to pack up and you have to go -- you’ll be interned.</span> <span id="s740">The -- first they had come around before, and you know, told me to se-sell the bicycle, which I did, I sold it to a neighbor who -- who was a bicycle nut.</span> <span id="s741">He l-loved bicycles, and then they came around later on again, and said sorry, we have to intern you.</span> <span id="s742">So this was from one day to the other, pack up, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: And when was this, when did this begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: This must have been something like June, July, 19 -- 1940.</span> <span id="s745">Sis -- so we were in this place in Bury, this -- this used factory, tried to make ourselves useful by working, it’s one thing or the other.</span> <span id="s746">That was a lot of time to spend, but a lot of people had bor -- brought good books, and tis -- there were interesting discussions.</span> <span id="s747">As I said, I -- I think there must have been something like 2,000 people in that camp.</span> <span id="s748">From there we were eventually shipped to a place near Shrewsbury, which was an internment camp which was all tents, so we lived in tents.</span> <span id="s749">Again, the Orthodox j -- Jews kept together and had a very organized life.</span> <span id="s750">There were enough rabbis amongst that group to organize all this.</span> <span id="s751">And we kept to our -- ourselves, and everybody tr-tried to he -- help, and make -- make a go of it.</span> <span id="s752">[indecipherable] I -- I did feel -- I became quite weak because of the lack of food.</span> <span id="s753">The one main instance I remember is that when the son-in-law of the famous chief rabbi of England, Dr. Hertz, whose -- you know, who has written that book [indecipherable] Torah -- underneath the green you’ll find the -- that’s the Hertz Bible.</span> <span id="s754">And he came around and he -- he sort of assured us that they would see to it that the -- the food situation would improve.</span> <span id="s755">But, of course, it couldn’t be for a very long time in this tent camp, and I think some time in -- probably in September or so, maybe it was later, I can’t remember exactly any more, every -- these -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of Mann, where they had fenced off whole districts of the town and some [indecipherable] were converted into -- into internment camps.</span> <span id="s756">Again, there were houses with -- for Orthodox Jews, and we all kept to ourselves.</span> <span id="s757">But life was quite organized there.</span> <span id="s758">It was -- it was before Rosh Hashanah, because I remember, you know, the -- the houses were right on the seaside.</span> <span id="s759">For Rosh Hashanah, a lot of people went into the ocean for like a -- you know, doing the cleaning, for a mikvah.</span> <span id="s760">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: This is all 1940 still?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: 1940, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Who -- was it only Germans there, and were there any women, or only men?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: There -- there was a women’s camp somewhere.</span> <span id="s765">I don’t -- don’t know -- can’t remember where it was any more, but there were only men, you know, in case -- there were only men in the internment camp.</span> <span id="s766">The -- yeah, the -- as I said, the life was very -- start getting very organized, there were a lot of classes.</span> <span id="s767">You could learn anything you wanted, people taught just about any subject you could think about.</span> <span id="s768">And of course there were a lot of aus -- Austrians there.</span> <span id="s769">There were very good lectures on psychology, and very intensive classes on -- on -- also Jewish subjects.</span> <span id="s770">Mathematics classes.</span> <span id="s771">I remember I started learning mechanical drawing there, and there were people who were teaching automobile design and things of that nature [indecipherable] was very -- intellectually very, very active.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: These are just classes taught by the other people who were being kept there?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yeah, yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s774">All self organized.</span> <span id="s775">Well, I don’t know when it was, I think it was October, November, they had the -- there was an announcement that the age of entry into the army for enemy aliens, whi-which we were, had been lowered from 20 years to 18, I think.</span> <span id="s776">So, I had actually tried to volunteer for the army before that, but because I -- I still saw that eventually we wouldn’t be able to avoid it, but I was too young.</span> <span id="s777">Then they lowered the age, and a few British Jewish officers came around, and organized meetings.</span> <span id="s778">Had a big meeting in -- in the internment camp and told us to come and volunteer for the army.</span> <span id="s779">Well, I -- I volunteered.</span> <span id="s780">It was somewhat resented by some people.</span> <span id="s781">A lot of people said that they will join if they were free men, but they wouldn’t join from internment camp, things of that nature.</span> <span id="s782">But I thought that was neither one way or the other, and that they eventually will have to go one way or the other anyhow, so might as well g-go and do it sooner than later.</span> <span id="s783">I d-definitely wanted to get out of internment camp.</span> <span id="s784">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Was it a -- was it also a -- even though it was intellectually a -- a per -- you know, a period of fruitful intellectual activity, was it also just very harsh conditions, living conditions?</span> <span id="s786">What were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No.</span> <span id="s788">Living conditions were pretty good, except again for this food business [indecipherable] the living conditions were quite good.</span> <span id="s789">We -- we lived in houses.</span> <span id="s790">Of course, every room had -- was full of beds, you know, and there was one common room, a dining hall where everybody collected for anything that’s -- what wasn’t sleeping.</span> <span id="s791">And -- and it -- it -- it was not -- it was not a great hardship, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Did you feel that it was unfair to -- to keep you in an internment camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Well, maybe I did, but I -- you know, I -- I -- I felt a sympathy, with all the things you’d read about the -- the Quisling regimes, and the traitors that had been in Fr-France -- in -- in Holland, or Norway and Belgium, I -- somehow I -- I -- I sympathized with the British, that they had to do this in order to make sure -- they couldn’t j-justify -- before their own people they couldn’t justify having us run around free in their country.</span> <span id="s794">So it -- it was more -- it was definitely done more for morale and propaganda than for actually being afraid that things might -- sas -- there might be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s795">So I -- I was willing to accept this affect, that this w-was a necessary move that the government had to make.</span> <span id="s796">And then in -- I think it was beginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps, but actually what was happening was we were -- we were ju -- went by boat and train from the Isle of Mann, first to Liverpool, and then to Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you know, it’s just -- just south -- in the far southwest of England.</span> <span id="s797">That was the headquarters for the Pioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien man -- Pioneer Corps.</span> <span id="s798">The other members of the Pioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- actually were very -- had come i -- were not -- not completely trusted because of legal difficulties, or were people who had -- were not fit at all.</span> <span id="s799">So we had these German Austrian companies of the Pioneer Corps, that were made up of very f -- relatively very fit German Austrian Jews.</span> <span id="s800">And -- and the Pioneer Corps stayed there in Ilfracombe in the southwest for a few weeks, for some sort of basic training, which of course did not involve weap -- weapons.</span> <span id="s801">We were not trusted with weapons.</span> <span id="s802">And from there we went to Yorkshire, my company went to Yorkshire, and -- which there w-was a big army camp, Ketray camp, and from there we went to a very nice place in the -- the lake district, beautiful place where we build a -- a petroleum dump for storing gasoline.</span> <span id="s803">You know, it was all labor work.</span> <span id="s804">In Ketray camp, I don’t think we did that much labor yet, but then we went to this Sedberg.</span> <span id="s805">Now Sedberg was in the lake district, a beautiful town with -- which had a -- one of these what’s called public schools, which of course are these very, very private schools in England.</span> <span id="s806">And i-it was pleasant, very pleasant to be there, first time a chance to go out and go to dances, and go to m-mix with the population, started having a girlfriend, things of that nature.</span> <span id="s807">Also, the other thing was my father had a cousin in York.</span> <span id="s808">And I’d never met them, but I knew they were there.</span> <span id="s809">And so one Sunday I hitchhiked to York, and I came to know my father’s cousin, who was the owner of a very, very successful factory in -- i-in -- in England.</span> <span id="s810">I’d heard about him, but I’d never been there, I’d never been in touch with these people, but I just happened to go there.</span> <span id="s811">And on -- on a Sunday afternoon, and I happened to find them at home.</span> <span id="s812">He had bought up a patent in Italy for a plastic which has what we would now call -- basically the structure of nylon.</span> <span id="s813">But he made it -- he made it out of the milk that was rejected from the chocolate ma -- making process.</span> <span id="s814">And he sold this -- his idea to Roundtree in York, the famous chocolate company, and he ec -- he got -- got their waste product, and he made this plastic which was called not Bakolite, but Gansolite, because his name was Gans, too.</span> <span id="s815">And they had this big factory there, very successful, and his home really -- which was also one of these beautiful estates, almost in the center of York, his home was sort of the rallying point for all of us Gans and related families from the American and British army, who happened to be in England.</span> <span id="s816">And this was -- this was a very, very nice c-contact, and a very nice connection.</span> <span id="s817">I volunteered for every -- every damn thing that could be, to get me out of the Pioneer Corps.</span> <span id="s818">England was now alone.</span> <span id="s819">You know, the United States was not in -- not in the war, and Russia was -- had successfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler.</span> <span id="s820">So they were not in the war.</span> <span id="s821">So the i -- the British had the idea that the only way they could possibly inflict a lot of damage on Germany was to have a huge Air Force.</span> <span id="s822">So they were looking for volunteers for people to go into the Air Force.</span> <span id="s823">Well, I went to the examination, and all -- the examination was in Blackpool, which was -- was about two or three hours by train ride from where -- from where I was.</span> <span id="s824">Passed the examination, was accepted in, but of course they -- they didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s825">When they f -- looked at my nationality they refused to let me in.</span> <span id="s826">But I had the -- I ha -- for ye -- for a long time I carried around this piece of paper which showed that I had passed the part of the acceptance process for the Air Force.</span> <span id="s827">So that didn’t work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And when is this now?</span> <span id="s829">What point?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: This is n -- this is now -- now, wait a minute, let me see.</span> <span id="s831">This is 19 -- it’s nine 1940 -- four ni -- ’41.</span> <span id="s832">It’s 1941.</span> <span id="s833">And this -- you know, in -- in the meantime of course, th -- round about -- I think it was in the spring of 1941, there was this meeting between Elizabeth and chur -- Churchill on the high seas.</span> <span id="s834">America was still not in the war, but America had -- was giving for free, 50 destroyers to Great Britain on generally supporting -- supporting the British war effort.</span> <span id="s835">But th -- Roosevelt could of course not go and -- and join in the war.</span> <span id="s836">There was far too much isolationism in the United States to allow him to declare war, but he was actually supporting the British in their war effort.</span> <span id="s837">And then in the summer of 1941, I don’t know the exact date any more -- of course, from one minute to the other, Hitler moved his armies against Russia.</span> <span id="s838">It’s apparently just totally expected by both the British and the Americans.</span> <span id="s839">They had made all the provisions just what -- what they were going to do when this event would happen.</span> <span id="s840">I wish I would have copy [indecipherable] if you could get it off the streets that Churchill made that night when -- when Germany invaded Russia.</span> <span id="s841">It’s -- it’s very applicable to our present situation in Iraq.</span> <span id="s842">He said something like I won’t take back anything I have said against Communism, but I see a people now being faced with a totally different ideology.</span> <span id="s843">I see the ordinary Russian people, and -- be -- being faced with an -- a representative of an ideology that is totally alien to them, and I’m sure they will resist against it.</span> <span id="s844">[indecipherable] all this was -- I -- I -- I have to find the actual speech.</span> <span id="s845">I-I-It’s -- it’s very, very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: And this whole time you were in the Pioneer Corps, still?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s848">Now -- I were -- things were loosening up.</span> <span id="s849">They allow -- we were allowed to -- we were getting weps -- we were now subject to weapons training, and felt more -- by this time, I think we were in Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s850">As a matter of fact, I -- we were working in a anti-aircraft unit that was the first mixed sex -- sex mixed anti-aircraft unit in the -- in -- in Great Britain.</span> <span id="s851">And it was a very, very interesting experience, too.</span> <span id="s852">Also some very lovely girls there, no doubt.</span> <span id="s853">And later on we went to -- to Glasgow, and we worked -- we started working building an ammunition dump for -- let me see, can’t remember exact date any more.</span> <span id="s854">I think by this time -- can’t remember the date, six -- ha-have -- have to think this out, but I have a feeling that we were building this ammunition dump for the Americans.</span> <span id="s855">So that must have been after Pearl Harbor then.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: And when did you get this rare opportunity that then came your way?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Well, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I think.</span> <span id="s858">By that time I had made my name in the -- in the unit.</span> <span id="s859">See, you know, th-these -- these Pioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push themselves forward very much.</span> <span id="s860">They were all experts at everything, you know.</span> <span id="s861">And I -- I, of course, I never participated very much in -- in -- in sports that were open to many people, things like that.</span> <span id="s862">Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of like a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round on -- and that was the major event there.</span> <span id="s863">And of course there were all these guys there who had been such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, and God knows, all over the place.</span> <span id="s864">Well, I did the run, and I won it so easily.</span> <span id="s865">And now I had made my name, you know.</span> <span id="s866">I -- I -- I hadn’t realized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were so -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know?</span> <span id="s867">A-And I knew when w-we were near Glasgow at the time, and we were billeted on pr -- in private homes -- you know, we were not eating there, but were -- just slept there.</span> <span id="s868">Had a -- had a -- when -- I remember when I went home, I knew this was going to be the change of my life.</span> <span id="s869">And so it went.</span> <span id="s870">When eventually the call came for people to go to something very, very special, I was one of the first who was s-selected to -- but there being -- after this event, we started a -- we competed in many, many different sports events, and I was always very much the center of everything of the team that was sent by our unit, to all these sports event -- events, and I’ve -- I’ve -- I was running on -- on -- on a cloud, you know?</span> <span id="s871">So I think it was at the end of 1942 that I was -- went to London, and I was interviewed by a man who had the uniform of a captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot, and knew what he wanted, and that turned out to be eventually the skipper, you know, he’s -- he’s all on the pictures there.</span> <span id="s872">I -- I s-should have gone through these pictures before with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yeah, well you can show me at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: We can look at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: And also then, we were interviewed by somebody from MI-five, who was supposed to make sure all on your background, and -- very knowledgeable people, very, very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s877">You know this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA and the FBI.</span> <span id="s878">And I was absolutely sure that I had been accepted.</span> <span id="s879">I had no doubts about it whatsoever.</span> <span id="s880">And then, a few weeks later, or two weeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [indecipherable] told me, and maybe three or four others to go to the Pioneer Corps center in -- in Yorkshire.</span> <span id="s881">I think it was in Yorkshire, horrible place.</span> <span id="s882">And there -- from there we were taken on a train by night, and the next morning we arrived in Abu Dhabi, which was the training pl-place for [indecipherable] commando.</span> <span id="s883">And there we changed our names, changed our identities.</span> <span id="s884">Within two hours, we all -- we had a false history, a false name, and that was it.</span> <span id="s885">And that was the beginning of the -- being in the commandoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: What was your false name and your background, your identity you were given?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: My name was Fred Gray.</span> <span id="s888">I spelled it a-y.</span> <span id="s889">And we were all s-supposed to say that we were British by -- by nationality, but that our fathers, our parents had been assigned to such and such a -- m-my case it was, of course, Holland, since I spoke some Dutch, it was easy to do, had been assigned to -- to -- had -- had lived in -- in other countries.</span> <span id="s890">And so that’s the reason why we had grown up in -- abroad, but we were British by nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: What was the main qualifying factor for being part of this troop?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: That you spoke German without an accent.</span> <span id="s893">This was extremely important.</span> <span id="s894">We didn’t realize it at that time, how important this would [indecipherable] be.</span> <span id="s895">I only can ta -- give you one statistic.</span> <span id="s896">I must have caused the surrender of about 10,000 Germans [indecipherable] without a fight.</span> <span id="s897">I didn’t -- I didn’t -- we didn’t realize it at the time.</span> <span id="s898">We were supposed to do long distance patrols, we were supposed to do interrogation on -- on the battlefield, which we did, and which were very important.</span> <span id="s899">No doubt these were very important, because you know, we could interrogate the prisoners right there and then on the battlefield.</span> <span id="s900">And we had been trained for that.</span> <span id="s901">I had been to the intelligence school in Cambridge, in -- in England.</span> <span id="s902">And so -- and that -- that was extremely important, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s903">But the ability to walk into a German position and persuade people to surrender without fighting, proved more important than anything else.</span> <span id="s904">A-Anything else we learned.</span> <span id="s905">After all, we learned everything.</span> <span id="s906">Mountaineering, parachute jumping.</span> <span id="s907">Anythi -- we’d done any -- everything there was to be done.</span> <span id="s908">But it -- the -- the ability to walk into a ger -- walk into a German position and talk to them as if you were one of them, this was the main contribution, as it turned out to be, for the war for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: They would see you, of course, in your uniform, and you would appear to be, you know, a British, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but -- but you’re saying the fact that you spoke without an accent was also more convincing to them, somehow, to get them to surrender?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yeah, ju -- obviously there had to be some sort of infiltration and some fights before that, which you may have read about in the stories in which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we did this repeatedly, or in France.</span> <span id="s911">You -- there had to be some sort of infiltration before that, but once you were in that position, you -- then we were very, very persuasive.</span> <span id="s912">Don’t threaten them with a gun, just tell them quick how many -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s914">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Again, they said that was not necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned out to be our greatest asset.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Who was in this troop, the numbers of people, and what was their background?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: There were 87 people in the troop, and they were all, I think this -- with the exception of one or two, they were all German or Austrian Jews, meaning Jews by the t -- by Hitler’s definition.</span> <span id="s918">A lot of them by wh-what we call Halachak definitions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a Jewish father, and a non-Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s919">Quite a number of those, quite a number.</span> <span id="s920">Of course you know a couple like that had to leave Germany very early, otherwise life was impossible for them, and a lot of them did leave very early.</span> <span id="s921">So by what we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish [indecipherable] maybe 75 percent of us were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: And was this -- do you think this was an important qualification that -- that they were looking for, that the British actually chose Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: No, they didn’t choose Jews, no.</span> <span id="s924">Those -- Montgomery -- I’m sorry, Lord Mountbatten.</span> <span id="s925">Lord Mountbatten, who was in charge of combat operation, who was -- you know, he’s -- is the uncle of, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the queen, he da -- his -- I think his parents had gone through some sort of experience in World War One, and he was in combat -- in charge of combined operation, which consisted of the units of the army, largely commanders, Air Force, and Navy.</span> <span id="s926">And he came up with the idea that he had to have German speakers somewhere, and that he needed really good German speakers, so he -- he sold that idea to Churchill, and Churchill was very enthused about it, and Churchill said that the troops should be called X-troops.</span> <span id="s927">But of course that name had to be dropped, it was too suspicious.</span> <span id="s928">And then, you know, we became a [indecipherable] of the inter-allied commando.</span> <span id="s929">That’s how we were -- were -- how we were known.</span> <span id="s930">Was a commando which had units, Belgian units, French units, Polish unit -- units, Norwegian unit, and well, that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: So previously I never knew about this troop, do y -- and I’m wondering if -- if it seems like it’s been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept secret, and -- but has it been sort of a well kept secret even -- even now?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Well, it’s just -- not kept secret, but you know, we all went our different ways.</span> <span id="s933">The -- the skipper, the head of the troop got injured in France, you know, on a long term patrol, and he was taken prisoner, and he was -- did not return until after the war.</span> <span id="s934">He wrote a very nice assessment of the troop back in 1946 or so.</span> <span id="s935">And -- you know, we were all, after the war we were all -- we -- we didn’t particular think that we had done such great things.</span> <span id="s936">We were -- we were involved in our own careers, had to make a living.</span> <span id="s937">Potential wives, girlfriends, were not interested in what we had done during the war.</span> <span id="s938">What they wanted was to get married and make sure that we had enough money to -- to have children and all that.</span> <span id="s939">And particularly this was the attitude of -- of the parents of all our potential wives and girlfriends.</span> <span id="s940">So the whole idea was not really -- we da -- we -- we didn’t care to -- we didn’t have any reunions until maybe the 40th anniversary of D-Day, and wh-what was that?</span> <span id="s941">That would have been in 1984, right?</span> <span id="s942">Yes.</span> <span id="s943">I -- I think that the first one was 1984.</span> <span id="s944">And of course it’s the -- Peter Maas’s book that really brought all this out into the open, better than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Did you realize at the time how unusual this was, that you were, you know, Jewish, and able to train to fight and obviously eventually go to an area where, you know, Jews were so persecuted?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes, we -- I was very much aware of it.</span> <span id="s947">I was very much aware, and so were my friends, that this was something totally unique.</span> <span id="s948">My -- my closest friends were very, very supportive of all this, and they realized what were -- what had happened.</span> <span id="s949">But it -- but it remained a unique experience.</span> <span id="s950">We -- and, you know, my experience of course was very -- almost very different from everybody else’s experience.</span> <span id="s951">First of all, I refused to go to the officer’s training school.</span> <span id="s952">I didn’t want to miss the war.</span> <span id="s953">My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to officer training school for four months just before D-Day, and of course they missed most of the war.</span> <span id="s954">I absolute refused to go.</span> <span id="s955">I wer -- and then there came an order from the British army command that people were not to be promoted to officers in their field without going to officer’s training school.</span> <span id="s956">Well, I didn’t care two hoots about it, but it so happens that of course I was attached to a Marine unit.</span> <span id="s957">And the Marines didn’t have to take any notice of all these army uni-units.</span> <span id="s958">I was with the Marine commando, and one day they colonel said, “Tell me who you really are.</span> <span id="s959">I -- I want to make -- I want to put you in for be-becoming an officer.”</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: So speaking of your other identity, what was that like to assume a different identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Oh, it was very handy.</span> <span id="s962">You know, I -- I had no difficulty with it.</span> <span id="s963">And you have -- in England you have the desire to submerge yourself.</span> <span id="s964">It’s not like American society.</span> <span id="s965">You know, if you tell -- in those days, it’s very different now, very different now, in those days if you told a British person -- a British person, I’m going to be naturalized, and become British, and they would say, “You?</span> <span id="s966">You’re not British.”</span> <span id="s967">You know, tha -- but here, people -- you come in this country, and it’s -- the people ask you when are you going to get your naturalization, or have you gotten it already, you know?</span> <span id="s968">And braka -- hurry up, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s969">Totally different attitude in this country.</span> <span id="s970">But -- so.</span> <span id="s971">you had a desire in England to submerge yourself and pretend that -- were -- to be something that you were not.</span> <span id="s972">And -- so that suited in very, very handily.</span> <span id="s973">Of course, I had to give up being an Orthodox Jew, in doing that, you know?</span> <span id="s974">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: How difficult was that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Well, let’s -- it was part of -- this was part of the sacrifice you make.</span> <span id="s977">I want to tell you a story which is very, very interesting, I’ve -- I’ve not told it before.</span> <span id="s978">When we were in the Isle of Mann in the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a man there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s979">Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg was known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orthodox who had come out of Hungary to become a -- a rabbi, chief rabbi of -- of Hamburg, in Germany.</span> <span id="s980">His son was regarded to be far superior to the father, as far as brain and knowledge was concerned.</span> <span id="s981">And one day t -- one day to the other, the son decided that a rabbinical career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law.</span> <span id="s982">He knew Talmudic law fantastically, and he then went and became -- took his legal papers in Germany.</span> <span id="s983">Of course he couldn’t practice by the time he’d finished.</span> <span id="s984">So, you know, he couldn’t be a lawyer, Jewish lawyer in Germany any more.</span> <span id="s985">But he was with me in there, in the same house in which I was in -- on the Isle of Mann.</span> <span id="s986">And he -- he was a tall man, good looking man, always -- he did not run around with a yarmulke, he run -- was running around with [indecipherable] golf cap -- golf cap [indecipherable], but I mean, he was a ultra, ultra-Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s987">Extremely well versed.</span> <span id="s988">I mean, a lot of the things which I have learned, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and Jewish law, I’ve learned from him.</span> <span id="s989">Well, the day when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or three other people in the house volunteered for the British army, it came out -- we went into our dining room where -- which was the only common room there was, and we announced to people there that -- what we had done, that we volunteered for the army.</span> <span id="s990">There was a fellow there by the name of Josele.</span> <span id="s991">Well, Josele was a devoted Yeshiva student, absolute -- not too brilliant, absolutely devoted to -- to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s992">He got very, very upset, and he said, “If y -- you -- what you doing is you will have to work on Saturdays, you’ll hardly be able to eat kosher food.</span> <span id="s993">You will have to starve yourself to go.</span> <span id="s994">This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army, it just goes to show that you put your secular existence far above your Jewish consciousness.”</span> <span id="s995">And in the corner was this ra -- Spitzer, the lawyer rabbi, and he was sitting behind his books.</span> <span id="s996">And he came out, he -- he looked up from his book, and he said, “But Josele,” -- remember, this in 1940, “it’s -- it’s not a mitzvah -- mitzvah to fight Hitler?”</span> <span id="s997">Josele, he had a totally different -- totally different attitude to this -- to -- he saw the larger implication, in spite of the fact that by that time there had no -- not been concentration camps, mass extermination and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s998">You know, after all this was all st -- still to come.</span> <span id="s999">But it stuck -- stuck -- stuck into my mind, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Did that influence you at the time, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yeah, and this, you know, this is -- this is why I was willing to accept -- accept whatever it meant, or whatever I had to do, because -- including giving up being an Orthodox Jew, when the time came to be at the commandoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Now, while you were in the commando, did you still, in your own personal and private way, was religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: It’s a -- in a sort of general way, yes.</span> <span id="s1004">But you know, there was too many other things we had to concentrate on to -- to even start thinking about all this.</span> <span id="s1005">I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a set of ideas which I practice, and it’s -- I -- I’m not that comfortable in praying because the prayers to me are -- have a great depth, but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to.</span> <span id="s1006">And just as you find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they rather sit down and study the Talmud than go and do -- do prayers.</span> <span id="s1007">And -- and you know, this is -- so you had a guidance there, and -- when it was absolutely needed, but that wasn’t very often.</span> <span id="s1008">And I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not -- not pray.</span> <span id="s1009">I remember that one [indecipherable] one -- you may have read this story I written about Pontlivek, when I suddenly found myself in this German artillery fire, very much exposed, and I just -- I -- you know, I s -- I sort of said, get me out of this.</span> <span id="s1010">Bus -- was addressing wa -- I was obviously addressing a higher authority, like God or so.</span> <span id="s1011">And -- but it -- it required moments of that nature to make -- to make me -- to make me even think about -- about religion.</span> <span id="s1012">Normally the concentration had to be all on techniques.</span> <span id="s1013">Going through a minefield, doing this and that and the other.</span> <span id="s1014">Always a technique we had [indecipherable] out.</span> <span id="s1015">You had to concentrate.</span> <span id="s1016">There was no time to -- to think of anything else.</span> <span id="s1017">And that’s [indecipherable] made it all possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: So tell me about D-Day.</span> <span id="s1019">You -- is this the first time that you -- you entered --</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: -- into actual war time fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes, it -- yes.</span> <span id="s1023">We had -- we had been -- we had tried to do certain raids on France before D-Day, by parachute, and certain missions were planted, or didn’t come off, some of them, bec -- because we always -- when you were -- when a -- when a force like that went out by parachute, they had to go out with the massive bombers that attacked the American and British bombers that attacked [indecipherable] Germany at the time.</span> <span id="s1024">So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you drop out and do certain things.</span> <span id="s1025">Well, none of these things came off, partially because of bad weather, partially because the information was obtained from different means and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1026">So, though we had been prepared for certain raids, and some of us had been on certain raids, I personally had not been in any actual fight until D-Day.</span> <span id="s1027">We were sequestered -- oh, let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1028">The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up just before D-Day, when there were four or five of us attached to every invading commando troop.</span> <span id="s1029">I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris Latimer, whose -- and the Sergeant Major of the troop, O’Neill, and a fellow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton.</span> <span id="s1030">These are all these cover names of course.</span> <span id="s1031">Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the Sudetenland before he joined that troop.</span> <span id="s1032">So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine commando.</span> <span id="s1033">And we were held in camps for I think two or three weeks while we were being briefed about the landing.</span> <span id="s1034">And w -- we couldn’t communicate with anybody outside because those -- they were -- didn’t tell us where we would land.</span> <span id="s1035">We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for which people who really knew France well could have guessed where this was.</span> <span id="s1036">But I’m -- we personally, we didn’t know where it was going to be.</span> <span id="s1037">We didn’t know we were going to land in Normandy.</span> <span id="s1038">So we were in these camps for about two or three weeks, and then one evening, total darkness, we were -- we embarked into little boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each boat had maybe something like 80 people.</span> <span id="s1039">And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any intercommunication, in a pitch dark night.</span> <span id="s1040">And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents.</span> <span id="s1041">We sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn’t see anything at all.</span> <span id="s1042">And -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s1043">The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came closer to the coast in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o’clock in the morning by the time we landed.</span> <span id="s1044">But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment of the coast, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us.</span> <span id="s1045">And one of us always sat on the steps, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running commentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us.</span> <span id="s1046">Lucky tha -- luckily we were not hit.</span> <span id="s1047">And now, before all this, while we were in the camps, Montgomery, the a -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, “Look, every time there’s a landing, everybody sticks to the beach because they want to be protected by the Navy.</span> <span id="s1048">Get off the beaches.</span> <span id="s1049">You can -- don’t,” -- and that struck me as being very, very significant.</span> <span id="s1050">The really tr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn’t get away from the beach.</span> <span id="s1051">And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me.</span> <span id="s1052">So, when -- when the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the -- the coast -- and of course as I said, we now were under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the gangway, and I got -- got down -- was on the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the engineer’s unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti-tank obstacles that were on the beach.</span> <span id="s1053">And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them, “Where’s the pass through the minefields?”</span> <span id="s1054">Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I didn’t have any fear of mines any more, but at that time I still was very much aware.</span> <span id="s1055">And lo and behold, when I didn’t threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language, the first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews.</span> <span id="s1056">Different uniform and they could be on our side.</span> <span id="s1057">And lo and behold they told me.</span> <span id="s1058">I didn’t threaten them, I had the tommy gun down.</span> <span id="s1059">I just said, in a very calm way, “Where’s the pass through the mine fields?”</span> <span id="s1060">And they pointed it out to me.</span> <span id="s1061">And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I’d gotten through the -- gotten off the beach, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single casualty.</span> <span id="s1062">So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50 percent of the unit.</span> <span id="s1063">Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day.</span> <span id="s1064">Later on, when we made the landing in Washoe, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy beaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the landing.</span> <span id="s1065">But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us.</span> <span id="s1066">And everybody did the same as I did, get off the boat, get over the beaches, forget about it and get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1069">This was the beginning of D-Day.</span> <span id="s1070">Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the German strong points were, and we were at the other end of the village.</span> <span id="s1071">Luckily, the pass through the mine field was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the other.</span> <span id="s1072">I had no doubt where we were.</span> <span id="s1073">You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently.</span> <span id="s1074">I knew we were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point.</span> <span id="s1075">Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points.</span> <span id="s1076">Why should they be out on the road, in the French villages?</span> <span id="s1077">The French who have murdered them, you know?</span> <span id="s1078">So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the road that was le -- going towards the German strong point.</span> <span id="s1079">But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and -- when it -- when it comes to -- when there’s so much artillery fire and mortar fire.</span> <span id="s1080">It’s -- the splinters will carry.</span> <span id="s1081">So you have to go from one door to the other, dive in and dive out.</span> <span id="s1082">And of course the population was on our side.</span> <span id="s1083">They willingly opened the doors for us.</span> <span id="s1084">So I says you know, you couldn’t do this in Germany.</span> <span id="s1085">We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in Germany, and we didn’t intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it -- had come to the same conclusion.</span> <span id="s1086">So we were diving from one house into the other.</span> <span id="s1087">In some houses actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one side or the other.</span> <span id="s1088">In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the road first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the street when the -- when a shell exploded.</span> <span id="s1089">You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions.</span> <span id="s1090">So we worked our way -- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point.</span> <span id="s1091">When we got into this position where we thought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun pointing at us down the road, we got off the street, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned houses, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point.</span> <span id="s1092">And I went upstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed.</span> <span id="s1093">So I rushed downstairs again.</span> <span id="s1094">I think I -- so I went down into the house, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the house next door.</span> <span id="s1095">And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was going from our side into the strong point.</span> <span id="s1096">So we really didn’t know what the hell this was.</span> <span id="s1097">We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there.</span> <span id="s1098">So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that.</span> <span id="s1099">And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German strong point.</span> <span id="s1100">So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1101">But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did.</span> <span id="s1102">And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- ’45.</span> <span id="s1103">So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the German strong point.</span> <span id="s1104">And I went with him.</span> <span id="s1105">And he was one of those guys who wouldn’t take no notice of any German fire.</span> <span id="s1106">He was running around with a briefcase.</span> <span id="s1107">His name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did.</span> <span id="s1108">And he -- he wouldn’t throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn’t going to do this, so I dodged the way I’d learned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was out of the war.</span> <span id="s1109">So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified.</span> <span id="s1110">But then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the village from the beach, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main road to -- on -- on to the German strong point.</span> <span id="s1111">Which was crazy.</span> <span id="s1112">The way we did this later on, we used armored vehicles, and even tanks, only as mobile guns.</span> <span id="s1113">We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the field, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in.</span> <span id="s1114">Anyhow, this attack totally failed.</span> <span id="s1115">I didn’t participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that.</span> <span id="s1116">But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] tank pointing right down the road.</span> <span id="s1117">There was no chance that an armored car could get by that.</span> <span id="s1118">So we hadn’t -- we hadn’t -- we had not succeeded in taking the strong point on that day.</span> <span id="s1119">By now it was getting late.</span> <span id="s1120">We were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon somewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a ditch that had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of the food which we had, it was -- I hadn’t eaten all day long.</span> <span id="s1121">I don’t think we had eaten during the night either.</span> <span id="s1122">There was cocoa.</span> <span id="s1123">There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn’t take strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much.</span> <span id="s1124">And jus -- just at that time, the -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied gliders, British gliders come -- being pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of Lyon canal, and they were sort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s1127">This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: So this shows that things were proceeding along the way they were planned.</span> <span id="s1129">Also, by this time a German fighter came over and flew right along the beaches.</span> <span id="s1130">And you know it says in the book the longest day?</span> <span id="s1131">That’s -- he got away with it, nobody shot at him, but that wasn’t true, lots of people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him.</span> <span id="s1132">But, you know, it -- one fighter alone could not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn’t -- couldn’t -- it wouldn’t work in our case.</span> <span id="s1133">So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of D-Day.</span> <span id="s1134">I slept very well that night in my ditch.</span> <span id="s1135">I needed it.</span> <span id="s1136">Next morning, we continued what we were supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer German headquarters, move it inland.</span> <span id="s1137">We were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get into Luc sur Mer.</span> <span id="s1138">We had to -- not succeeded doing in any idle -- any of these things.</span> <span id="s1139">So, next morning the first thing we -- it was decided we’ll attack the German headquarters in -- inland.</span> <span id="s1140">Well, that didn’t tu-turn -- it wasn’t much of a headquarters.</span> <span id="s1141">This happens to be a battalion that had just come from the Russian front and they were pretty decimated.</span> <span id="s1142">And we decided we were not going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which came off beautifully.</span> <span id="s1143">And s -- I found three Germans there who were obviously volgama -- the Germans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from Russia or Poland, they’re -- very hard to understand them.</span> <span id="s1144">I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved t-totally useless.</span> <span id="s1145">So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point -- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up.</span> <span id="s1146">And th -- so, I was late.</span> <span id="s1147">They -- I don’t exactly know how -- I think it was B troop of 41 commando that was under the leadership of -- of very, very good officer, whom I had accidentally met already a year ago before that.</span> <span id="s1148">And he managed to apparently get -- infiltrate his people into the strong point, and get the strong point to surrender.</span> <span id="s1149">So we went on, and the next stage was very simple.</span> <span id="s1150">We got into Luc sur Mer very easily, and this -- this was the far end of the British Canadian landing, and now we were at the border of the American and British beach head.</span> <span id="s1151">And that was supposed to be our D-Day assignment, so this was the end of -- of our D-Day assignment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Now for the rest of the war, if you could give me a sense just generally, the kind of movements where you -- where you -- you know, what kind of territory you covered in general, and maybe there are a few things that -- that come to mind that particularly illustrate the kinds of things you were doing.</span> <span id="s1153">I’m also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to surrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don’t think I ever -- ever was in that position.</span> <span id="s1155">My idea was get as many of them to surrender as you can -- can get.</span> <span id="s1156">Find some high ranking officer who will go with you and make everybody surrender.</span> <span id="s1157">This -- this has worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, and this worked ma-many, many times.</span> <span id="s1158">Now, I must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this and did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost was in a similar situation, too.</span> <span id="s1159">Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations.</span> <span id="s1160">They had been left behind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very heavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified.</span> <span id="s1161">And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile to make an attack -- a direct attack on them.</span> <span id="s1162">So we were positioned around them, near -- near them, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, make believe that they were about to be attacked.</span> <span id="s1163">The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned to build an air -- airp -- airport, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away from these radar stations.</span> <span id="s1164">And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were fields there that were suitable for landing aircrafts on it, and this had to go ahead.</span> <span id="s1165">And they couldn’t take any notice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there.</span> <span id="s1166">So our task was to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked.</span> <span id="s1167">And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so.</span> <span id="s1168">There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience.</span> <span id="s1169">But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it.</span> <span id="s1170">Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful.</span> <span id="s1171">Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender.</span> <span id="s1172">So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the prisoner camps of which there were there, but we shipped out.</span> <span id="s1173">That was an interesting experience which I’ve written up in great detail.</span> <span id="s1174">If you want to read, you can read it.</span> <span id="s1175">After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern front of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev -- very heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall.</span> <span id="s1176">And, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or through some hedgerows to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and th-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn patrol there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the radar stations and he had went back to -- to England.</span> <span id="s1177">The Sergeant Major O’Neill was still with me, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone home on deeplus two or three, he said he was shell-shocked.</span> <span id="s1178">And O’Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw them -- saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Now let me ask you, the Germans you encountered along the way, did any of them question you and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you’re Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come up, was that ever a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1181">As a matter of fact, that was the un -- unbelievable attitude.</span> <span id="s1182">If somebody spoke to them in fluent German, they thought that well, you know, we are -- we have -- of such high culture, of course other people speak our language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So they wouldn’t even guess that you were originally German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s1185">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1186">Nobody even dreamt of it.</span> <span id="s1187">It was -- it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1188">And that I think is a -- a -- you know, of course ga -- cultured pe-people speak German, naturally, right?</span> <span id="s1189">And I’m sure you speak German, too.</span> <span id="s1190">If you don’t, you’re not cultured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1193">So -- yeah, and from -- from that -- so we got on the -- on the northeastern part of the -- of the -- of the Normandy beach head.</span> <span id="s1194">From there we shifted over to something absolutely terrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern corner of the beach head.</span> <span id="s1195">Again, this was the -- the only thing that was lucky about it is there ha-had been a British guards battalion there before us, they had dug some way with trenches.</span> <span id="s1196">We were now something like, maybe maximum 200 - 300 yards away from the German lines.</span> <span id="s1197">And the bombardment was day and night, mortars, artillery.</span> <span id="s1198">Artillery is all right because you know it goes off and you can hear it coming and you know what to do, throw yourself into a ditch.</span> <span id="s1199">But the mortar fires were -- could be very surprising, you know.</span> <span id="s1200">We -- we -- we le -- it was o -- it was a lot like being in World War One, it was trench warfare practically.</span> <span id="s1201">But at night again, we went out on patrol, shot up patrols, we got shot up on -- on patrol and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of the fact of what was happening on the other fronts.</span> <span id="s1202">The fact that the Americans were breaking through and going south, that they were going west into Brittany, and that they were swinging around as the British -- had been a terrible mass l-losses of germ -- of two and a half German divisions in one night with that -- were poised for counterattack on -- on the British advance, th -- the Germans had not -- thought that they could keep this counterattack of two and a half German divisions secret, but they -- but of course it was all seen from the air, with the ability that the British Air Force had to -- to look at all German movements, and so it came in with a very heavy -- before the -- the Germans could even start to move, came in with a very, very heavy thousand bombers attack.</span> <span id="s1203">And most of these two and a half -- the people of the two and a half divisions -- SS divisions, they -- they died through lack of ox -- oxygen, or lack of -- or ho -- of hi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-experienced being out in the open, being ready for counterattack.</span> <span id="s1204">That was -- then -- that was a -- none of these divisions appeared again for the rest of the war.</span> <span id="s1205">They were SS divisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: What was the most frightening episode that you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: I think that, you know, sus-sustained frightening, was the position we were in in Pontlivek, because we were a cross place, the Germans are at one side in a railway -- in a railway station and we were on the other side, and we were be -- behind walls at [indecipherable] but we knew the walls were -- would not stand -- would not stand a anti-tank gun shot, and we knew that the Germans usually left -- with their rear guards they usually left an anti-tank gun.</span> <span id="s1208">And that would have gone right through us.</span> <span id="s1209">But v-very soon -- th-this was realized that we were in too exposed a position, and we were told to get -- get out of this position and just -- because also, the Germans had left devices in -- in all the bedrooms of the houses, which w -- suddenly all the -- all the houses around us went on fire, and -- you know, this was a sustained, longer experience.</span> <span id="s1210">But we managed to get out of this, and get out and then we did what we did -- always did, we defeated ma -- we made 10 night attacks in 10 days in that -- that -- during that time.</span> <span id="s1211">So we were taken out of Pontlivek, was decided what we’ll do is we -- we’ll go around on the night attacks, and we sa -- we go past them, and don’t do a frontal assault anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: So, were you at some point starting to imagine that the war might be coming to an end?</span> <span id="s1213">When did you start to get a feeling that -- you know, that -- that this might actually be close to the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Not until very, very much later.</span> <span id="s1215">I -- even when I -- the first time I got back into my own hometown in Borken, which was Easter Saturday, the town had been taken on the Thursday, Thursday, that Thursday before Easter.</span> <span id="s1216">I knew about it, and you know, by that time I -- I was an officer, I could move around as I wanted to.</span> <span id="s1217">Everybody supported me, and I went into Borken, and we -- even at that time we realized that things were not over.</span> <span id="s1218">And you know, actually there were quite a number of people from sweep of troop -- tank commandoes, who were killed before Hannover.</span> <span id="s1219">You know, this is hundred miles away, this is almost on the -- on the line with -- where the two armies, the Russian and the -- a-and the ar -- western forces met.</span> <span id="s1220">Even there, there was still resistance.</span> <span id="s1221">It -- it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1222">We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these people.</span> <span id="s1223">And the closer it was getting home to them, the c-ca -- th-the worse it got, and we had absolutely no illusion about it, that -- that there was still some heavy fighting ahead of us at all times.</span> <span id="s1224">We had -- we si -- it so happens that they -- they -- you know, we were on the Dutch -- Dutch front, it never lit up.</span> <span id="s1225">We -- we never personally were involved.</span> <span id="s1226">But at any moment we could have been told get over to this and this and this position, and that would have been -- and there would have been real fanatical resistance.</span> <span id="s1227">There was a very good friend of mine, a German writer, who wrote a -- a book called, “Five Minutes Before Midnight,” where he describes how there’s last minute resistance in this area, all the time, and of course he says this -- this led to the destruction of all these towns in -- in our home district, because there were always some fanatics who said they could hold out, and you had -- you had to -- had to take care of it.</span> <span id="s1228">Quite apart from the fact that we just knew if there was going to be an invasion of Japan, we were going to be in it.</span> <span id="s1229">This unit had been in the invasion of Sicily, had been in the inva -- invasion of Italy, had -- we had been in Normandy.</span> <span id="s1230">We had done the invasion of Washoe.</span> <span id="s1231">There -- no way was there going to be an invasion of Japan without us.</span> <span id="s1232">So, the war was not over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: And you were -- were you able to, you know, have enough strength throughout?</span> <span id="s1234">Was this -- you know, did you get used to living with just always having a certain amount of fear, or did that fear go away after awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: No, w-we [indecipherable] particularly after we -- we felt very much experienced, battle experienced, superior to the -- to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1236">Better -- we were better equipped, we knew how to move better.</span> <span id="s1237">A lot of their strength had gone out by too fanatical resistance.</span> <span id="s1238">The fear -- the fear was not a real condition any more.</span> <span id="s1239">Ve -- very, very confident what we could do, particularly after the -- during and after the Washoe invasion.</span> <span id="s1240">It was a -- was a terrific morale booster for us that everything had gone so smoothly against incredible fortifications.</span> <span id="s1241">So -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Where were you at the end of the war?</span> <span id="s1243">Where had you gotten to at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: We were still in the south of Holland, in -- you know, the -- that part of Holland never surrendered.</span> <span id="s1245">Th-the Germans never surrendered at all until I don’t know wh -- well after -- even after we left.</span> <span id="s1246">So, you know, I had heard through people who had been -- go-gotten to Switzerland in this exchange of Eichmann’s, of Jews against trucks, that my parents were in Theresienstadt, so I was set to go there at the earliest possible moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: When is the last time you had actually heard from them, or corresponded with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: I would say in 1941.</span> <span id="s1249">There were still Red Cross letters, you know.</span> <span id="s1250">1941.</span> <span id="s1251">A -- long before I went into the commandoes.</span> <span id="s1252">That was the last time I [indecipherable] then they went -- they went into hiding too, but of course they got betrayed.</span> <span id="s1253">That’s one story I’ve never written up and my brother is always telling me to write that up, that story, because I confronted that guy, and he finally got 10 years prison for -- but he done a lot of other things apart from betraying my parents.</span> <span id="s1254">He had s-sold all the weapons of the Dutch underground to the Communists.</span> <span id="s1255">When -- he wasn’t a Communist, no way, but he was after money.</span> <span id="s1256">He was state detective.</span> <span id="s1257">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So at the end of the war, you -- you didn’t know what had happened to your parents, but you started to hear.</span> <span id="s1259">How did you hear about them?</span> <span id="s1260">Who -- who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Well, as I said, there was this exchange of Jews against trucks, and some of these had gotten to -- family had gone to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1262">They wrote to my uncle in -- in New York, saying that my parents were in ter -- Terezin, and he wrote it t -- to my younger brother, who was still -- whose address he still knew.</span> <span id="s1263">Of course that nobody knew what I was doing, or where I was.</span> <span id="s1264">I had a cover address and all that, and eventually that news got to me, that they were in -- probably in Terezin.</span> <span id="s1265">And this is why I decided I want to try to get there.</span> <span id="s1266">So after -- soon as I got permission to do that, I took a Jeep and a driver, and we drove all across Germany into the Sudetenland, which had not surrendered yet, still German divisions, it was still real German.</span> <span id="s1267">Then we drove into the Russian lines, and Terezin had been liberated by the Russians just two days before I came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: This was -- I think I got to Terezin on May 12th, so I think it was -- must be May 12th I got there, or May 11th, something like -- or maybe it wa -- somewhere around that time.</span> <span id="s1270">It was two -- two or three days after -- after V-E Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: So, first of all tell me a little bit about the journey to get there.</span> <span id="s1272">Was it a -- a difficult journey, what -- what was it like, and what did you see along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: The -- the journey was hard for us because we had so much trouble with the Jeep.</span> <span id="s1274">But you know, you could always drive into some British or American repair station, and they didn’t fuss around very much, they gave you new wheels, they gave you new -- new shock absorbers, new brakes, whatever you have -- whatever you needed could always be obtained pretty rapidly.</span> <span id="s1275">But then, you know, once we left there, w-we ca -- first we came accidentally into the Russian line.</span> <span id="s1276">I hadn’t wanted to do this, so I went back into the -- went back to American lines, spent the night there.</span> <span id="s1277">I described it in great detail in my report.</span> <span id="s1278">And then, next morning we set out and we crossed over into unconquered territory, the -- Germany has [indecipherable] to be.</span> <span id="s1279">That’s the northern foothills of the Atz mountains of the Sudeten mountains.</span> <span id="s1280">And it was an interesting experience to see Germany as it had been, officers strutting around and so on, but of course I couldn’t stop.</span> <span id="s1281">And we went up into the mountains and came across two and a half German divisions that were still there, f-fully armed.</span> <span id="s1282">And they, I’m sure, are the same divisions as I menti -- as I mentioned -- as -- as mentioned in the story of -- Schindler.</span> <span id="s1283">You remember the Schindler story?</span> <span id="s1284">That when -- when they -- when he was going [indecipherable] to be rushed into the American lines from the Russian lines, they -- he -- he -- he came across two -- two and a half German divisions.</span> <span id="s1285">I’m sure that those were the same divisions.</span> <span id="s1286">Anyhow, we crossed that, went down, and finally hit the Russian lines, and it was -- the Russians were so enthused when they -- everybody wants to shake hands, and embrace you.</span> <span id="s1287">You know, the [indecipherable] was a manifestation of these two armies, western armies, and the Russian armies having -- having come together, you know, there must have been millions of such encounters.</span> <span id="s1288">But particularly these people whom we met there, they had -- they had not been through this experience at all, and therefore they -- they were just delighted to see a western allied vehicle fully armed, with people in it.</span> <span id="s1289">This was their meeting of east and west, you know.</span> <span id="s1290">Fa -- I forgot [indecipherable] they looked as if they had come all -- all the way from Stalingrad, and this was, you know, the first German defeat in the f -- major German defeat in -- in Russia, and we had come all the way from the Normandy beaches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Was it a very emotional time for you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: N-No, I can’t say so.</span> <span id="s1293">I -- I -- I -- I was -- didn’t feel emotional in those days, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s1294">Ther -- they were happy, we were happy, it was a great experience.</span> <span id="s1295">This is what we had looked forward to, and -- [interruption].</span> <span id="s1296">Yeah, the attitude, thank God, was -- that I had was different, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1297">… I am -- when -- when -- when I got into the camp -- into the camp there, you know, and again the officer at the entrance of the troops who were guarding the exit there, he wanted to shake hands, you know, make his contact with the western allied army, and then he said, “Look, there’s one area in this camp in which there’s the -- what you call the zoif --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Typhus, yeah, but he called it zoisha, of course, in German.</span> <span id="s1300">And if your parents are in that, you have to promise me that you’ll come out and not go -- go, forget about seeing them.</span> <span id="s1301">Otherwise I can’t let you go back into your own army.</span> <span id="s1302">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Was this trip dangerous, do you think, to go to Theresienstadt at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1305">Now that I think about it, it was just incredible what risks we took.</span> <span id="s1306">Incredible.</span> <span id="s1307">Was all these -- first of all there’s -- there’s the danger of the car breaking down, what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1308">And the second thing is, the Germans up in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s1309">They were fully armed.</span> <span id="s1310">They -- you know, they were there to -- to fight.</span> <span id="s1311">But I -- like -- just like on -- on the -- some of the patrols I did, in open daylight.</span> <span id="s1312">You rely on the fact that they’re not going to shoot at a single vehicle.</span> <span id="s1313">They’re too surprised to see just a single vehicle, just like they are too surprised to see -- see a single person coming, approaching them in a friendly way, you know?</span> <span id="s1314">So people don’t have their finger on the trigger in a position of that nature.</span> <span id="s1315">So that -- that was the second danger.</span> <span id="s1316">Now, the Russians I think were very, very cooperative, but I also -- there were certain situations which I carefully avoided, such as ch -- taking girls out of the -- out of the concentration camp [indecipherable] be very inviting to do that, but we would have never -- would have never gone back with the Russians, you know.</span> <span id="s1317">This is -- you couldn’t do any of those things.</span> <span id="s1318">So there’s question of having enough gasoline, you know, there was no gasoline, and we -- we -- we were just loaded up with gasoline and we had to rely on the fact that we would get back into American lines before we run out of -- of gas.</span> <span id="s1319">So -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s1321">This is tape number four, side B.</span> <span id="s1322">So tell me about your first impressions when you arrived to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Well, first bi -- it was -- it was a -- pretty shocking experience to see people like this, you know, in their -- their starved state.</span> <span id="s1324">Some of them -- quite a number of them too weak to even get up -- get out of the way for our car.</span> <span id="s1325">That’s -- it was a -- that was [indecipherable] impressions, the next impression I had is this -- these are all very familiar faces.</span> <span id="s1326">These are the Jews amongst who I’ve lived all my life.</span> <span id="s1327">So n-not that it struck me as being so emotional at the time, but this is what I realized.</span> <span id="s1328">And I don’t know who told me, maybe the Russian guards told me that there’s a registry where I could find out whether my parents were still there, or whether they -- or where they would be.</span> <span id="s1329">You know, I asked around and found my way to this central registry.</span> <span id="s1330">And there was still one girl working -- by now it was something like five o’clock in the evening I think.</span> <span id="s1331">We had been traveling all day long without a break, without stopping for food anywhere.</span> <span id="s1332">And I p -- asked this girl -- gave her my name of my parents and she s -- she said, “You are extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s1333">They’re still here.”</span> <span id="s1334">So she said, “I’ll come with you.”</span> <span id="s1335">So then went to the house where they were.</span> <span id="s1336">They were supposed to live in, you know, again you saw this terrible overcrowding, went to -- I left the driver outside of course, and went upstairs.</span> <span id="s1337">It was like people everywhere, you know?</span> <span id="s1338">There was just -- there was just no space for anything.</span> <span id="s1339">It was like having people move around you.</span> <span id="s1340">So the girl then went to my parents, she found them, and [indecipherable] and she told them, “I have good news for you, your son is here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Was it overwhelming to you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: No.</span> <span id="s1343">No feeling.</span> <span id="s1344">I was shocked to see my parents in the state they were, particularly my father.</span> <span id="s1345">I wouldn’t have recognized him, I -- a bit of a shock, y -- it was not -- it was not emotional experience at the time.</span> <span id="s1346">Now it is, when you think back about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Why wasn’t it emotional at the time, do you -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: No, I just -- I j -- managed to f-fight down all my feelings for things.</span> <span id="s1349">Shock yes, but deep emotional, no.</span> <span id="s1350">Now -- now y -- now you remember this and you cry.</span> <span id="s1351">Most of the time I couldn’t have done that.</span> <span id="s1352">There was no -- no way.</span> <span id="s1353">There was no -- were not my feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Do you think it’s because you had to be so strong and focused on fighting in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1356">Yeah, I mean you had to do without your feelings.</span> <span id="s1357">I mean, you know, it’s -- you have to overcome your feelings when you jump out of an airplane, you know?</span> <span id="s1358">Particular if -- if you jump out of an airplane through the bottom, and not through the side door.</span> <span id="s1359">And things of that nature.</span> <span id="s1360">Y-Y-You had to s -- just have to s -- s -- concentrate on technique and not -- not get carried away with any emotion.</span> <span id="s1361">Yeah, there’s a good saying was -- they had in the parachute school, the instructors, they told us always, if you start feeling sorry for yourself, get out of here, you won’t jump.</span> <span id="s1362">Ge -- get out before you have -- before you’re going to get your badge, because you can still ge -- if you get frightened when you -- this was the British army [indecipherable] says, “If you get frightened and want to get out, get out.”</span> <span id="s1363">They let you get out, but once you had your badge, of course, it was your du-duty to go ahead and -- and jump.</span> <span id="s1364">And th-tha-that’s something -- something worthwhile remember, I -- I very often quote -- quote that, if you start feeling sorry for yourself, you won’t jump.</span> <span id="s1365">Y-You know, you can’t feel sorry for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1366">We’re in the position where -- where we are, just our own choice.</span> <span id="s1367">Maybe not by own choice, but then we can’t help it, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: You say that you were shocked the way that your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: My father looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: -- father looked, and what di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I wouldn’t have recognized him.</span> <span id="s1372">If I had met him on the street I wouldn’t have recognized him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: What -- what was so different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Well, I mean, he -- he was, you know, he -- he was a well fed man before the war, and people shrivel up, you know, particularly in that situation in which they had been.</span> <span id="s1375">They totally shrivel up.</span> <span id="s1376">And he -- you can hardly recognize.</span> <span id="s1377">They age.</span> <span id="s1378">I mean that -- you know, after my father had been back in Holland for two or three weeks, he looked his former self again, you know?</span> <span id="s1379">But people changed totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: What about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: She somehow -- somehow she was slightly different, she was more -- you see, my father not be -- having only one lung and one leg, was probably more subject to -- to these hardships.</span> <span id="s1382">And my mother somehow had managed to live through it.</span> <span id="s1383">She worked in the S.S. kitchen, stole -- s-stole the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1384">Had no fear of these people, and somehow got through in a more positive way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: So what was it like, your -- your first, you know, reunion, what did you talk about?</span> <span id="s1386">And -- and tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Well, just about everything of course, you know.</span> <span id="s1388">They had been totally cut off from the world.</span> <span id="s1389">They obviously wanted to ri -- wanted to know what -- what wa -- what had hap -- what was happening to my brothers, and they wanted -- wanted to know about all the other relatives, my mother’s sisters, and my -- my fathers relatives.</span> <span id="s1390">You know, we’re family oriented family.</span> <span id="s1391">And they had a -- they -- they were amazed that I was an officer.</span> <span id="s1392">Of course they couldn’t recognize British ranks.</span> <span id="s1393">They were amazed that I was a paratrooper.</span> <span id="s1394">They had no idea what wa -- all these insignia meant.</span> <span id="s1395">And were absolutely in-incredible.</span> <span id="s1396">And they want -- want -- and to -- they told a lot about their experiences, and what had happened, and in the camp on the -- then they eventually were joined by other people who wanted to know what was happening in Holland.</span> <span id="s1397">They were living in what was called the Dutch colony of the Terezin camp.</span> <span id="s1398">You may have heard about the group of young girls, [indecipherable] young girls, who were in Terezin.</span> <span id="s1399">My mother was very friendly with them because ya -- ha -- eventually was -- was going to be Israel.</span> <span id="s1400">And these -- a lot of these girls came to congratulate my mother, you know, and all that.</span> <span id="s1401">Mainly they wanted to know what had happened.</span> <span id="s1402">They had no idea about the Normandy invasion, only vaguely what -- what had happened there.</span> <span id="s1403">They didn’t know about the total destruction in Germany, they couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1404">I -- you know, I -- I -- I -- I j -- I -- I -- I told my father -- he -- he had one [indecipherable] he said, “We can never get r-revenge for this, because we can’t be that cruel.”</span> <span id="s1405">So I said to him, “The revenge has been, it’s finished.</span> <span id="s1406">It’s not what we wanted, but this is ha -- this is what happened.”</span> <span id="s1407">And I tell him -- told him, in -- there is not a single -- in Muenster, which was the capital of our county, there is not a single house standing any more between this boulevard and that boulevard.</span> <span id="s1408">It’s like telling you, look there’s not a single house standing any more between -- between 72nd Street, and -- and city hall in New York.</span> <span id="s1409">Everything is destroyed.</span> <span id="s1410">That gave him a concept of -- of how incredible the destruction had been.</span> <span id="s1411">When I drove through Muenster, which I had known, through this massive rubble, where -- but you know of course the roads had been cleared by American bulldozers, because after all, our armies had to get through, all I met was one woman who was crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on a -- on a -- in black -- in a black dress, with all around was -- that was Germany.</span> <span id="s1412">That was the revenge.</span> <span id="s1413">I don’t remember what the -- the divisions, the two and a half S.S. divisions that had been blasted out of the s -- from the sky, and that -- that -- that died for lacks of -- lack of oxygen.</span> <span id="s1414">And they were supposed to be counter-attack.</span> <span id="s1415">That was revenge.</span> <span id="s1416">Nuremberg trials, none of them -- none of us thought of them.</span> <span id="s1417">The revenge had been.</span> <span id="s1418">It was -- it was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Did a lot of people at Terezin want revenge?</span> <span id="s1420">Is that something they felt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: I don’t know, I didn’t talk to a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1422">People who -- whom I talked to were t -- were like the justice of -- The Hague court of justice, who gave me a letter to Princess Julianna.</span> <span id="s1423">They -- they wanted to have some certain practical things solved, like repatriation in -- in a hurry, and so on and so forth, which -- which I managed to have a hand in arranging later on.</span> <span id="s1424">You know, it was -- everybody had his own practical needs, nevermind go-going after things like revenge.</span> <span id="s1425">This was a -- a concept that people whom I talked to were not concerned with.</span> <span id="s1426">They wanted to -- me to take letters back.</span> <span id="s1427">I must have taken something like 500 letters back, which the wife of a friend of mine gave to the Red Cross in London, because of course I didn’t have a postage stamp to send all these things out.</span> <span id="s1428">So I put them in -- in a big parcel, and I got back to my unit in -- in -- in Holland, and she send them to -- to London, and the wife of my friend took them to the Red Cross, and they sent them out.</span> <span id="s1429">And apparently most of them did arrive.</span> <span id="s1430">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: So how did other people react to you when you came to Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Well, as I said, they were concerned with practical things like please take a letter for me, and -- or do this and this and this for us.</span> <span id="s1433">One guy came along, and he said, I own two factories in Germany in the Zarund, which is not very far from our -- my home, Borken, and I want you to be the -- the manager of these two plants, because if you can come here and win, it’s everything.</span> <span id="s1434">And I told him, “Look, I’m not out of the army yet, you know?</span> <span id="s1435">It’s a long time pi -- we still have a long war ahead of us.”</span> <span id="s1436">So people weren’t -- the discussions were not -- not in any of these abstract subjects, they were very, very practical.</span> <span id="s1437">Told them that in -- in Holland you had to pay a gilder, which is, you know, a lot of money, for just one potato, but the starvation was like in Holland, it -- it was occupied by the Germans, not in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1438">And th-those were the things people were interested in, the practical things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: What about the fact that you’d been part of this -- this British commando, and did that come up much, your involvement in -- in -- had they known, you know, anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: No.</span> <span id="s1441">They -- they -- they had not known that they -- did not know that there was such a thing as a Jewish brigade, again.</span> <span id="s1442">They thought it was of -- they -- a lot of them felt it was sort of natural.</span> <span id="s1443">We were in England, so we -- we -- we -- we did the fighting.</span> <span id="s1444">As Peter Maas has once said, “We were the em-embodiment of all their dreams.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: It seems like maybe it was, you know, an inspiration for them, a-at the end of this experience they’d gone through, to -- to see you.</span> <span id="s1446">Did it feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1448">I think so, yes.</span> <span id="s1449">I th -- I think it was -- some of the -- but some of they felt that they -- all right, this -- this is what you ha -- has to do, thank God you did it.</span> <span id="s1450">We didn’t have the chance to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: What did you learn from your parents about what their experiences had been during the war, during the time you weren’t in contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Well, they roughly told me what had happened to them when they were in hiding, and how they had been -- how they were picked up, and they -- they went into this camp in Holland, in this concentration camp, and they had a chance to -- my mother absolutely refused to let herself be shipped out until she [indecipherable] forced to ship out.</span> <span id="s1453">My father wanted to stay with a certain group, but my mother thank God, refused, because that group went straight to Auschwitz to be gassed.</span> <span id="s1454">And they -- my father had this letter, which he was hiding in his af -- artificial leg, where he were -- his deeds were acknowledged by the organization of the League of German War Widows, Orphans and sa -- Injured People from World War One.</span> <span id="s1455">He had a letter from them that was written in 1934, thanking him for his fantastic service.</span> <span id="s1456">[indecipherable] in view of the time, you know, she has to give up that job.</span> <span id="s1457">And se -- he -- he made the most out of this letter, to get himself promoted just in these -- these camps.</span> <span id="s1458">The -- the fact that he kept his diary, which I have in here by the way, he did -- didn’t tell me at the time, but -- so there’s something that was interesting, and it came out later.</span> <span id="s1459">Well, they -- they tried to -- they -- they tried to tell me -- th-the worst part for them had been these transports from one camp to the other.</span> <span id="s1460">They had been in this Dutch camp, and then they had been in Bergen-Belsen, and then after that they were shipped to Terezin, and it was this -- these long voyages on these horrible trains, on these cattle trains with the S.S. in one of those, and -- and they were real -- that was a real horrible experience for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: How long were they at Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: I don’t know, I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: So that first night, what -- what else happened the night that you -- you were at the -- at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Well, as -- as -- we -- we talked until about three or four o’clock in the morning, and then we decided to [indecipherable] myself down in someplace or the other, and decided to catch a little bit of sleep before it got daylight again.</span> <span id="s1465">We had -- I had gone to the commandant of the camp -- ration commandant, and just to -- I don’t know, can’t remember what the motive was, but he was very, very -- very, very friendly, and he -- but he also said, “Look, you cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1466">By tomorrow morning, 10 o’clock, you have got to be out of here, otherwise you’re going to be infected, and I can’t let you -- can’t let you go back to your own army.”</span> <span id="s1467">But he was very, very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1468">Very warm feeling.</span> <span id="s1469">His ti -- the mayor was very -- doctor [indecipherable] lady doctor who speak -- spoke fluent German, or Russian.</span> <span id="s1470">She did the translating.</span> <span id="s1471">Thi -- thi -- that was it.</span> <span id="s1472">He [indecipherable] and I reported to him.</span> <span id="s1473">I said, “Yeah, I’ve come to look for my parents,” he -- he wou -- turns to the lady doctor and said, “Here, how -- how do we find his parents for him?”</span> <span id="s1474">And then she said [indecipherable] in the meantime already he was very concerned about it.</span> <span id="s1475">Very, very friendly atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Did you -- did you go there thinking that if you found your parents you would try to -- to bring them out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: I was absolutely settled not doing that, it was far too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1478">The roads were dangerous.</span> <span id="s1479">People threw hand grenades, fired shots, did all sorts of crazy things.</span> <span id="s1480">Quite apart from that, I felt I had a duty to pick up as many American and British soldiers as I could.</span> <span id="s1481">In the end when we -- in the end when we crossed the American lines, the Jeep -- we had 18 people on the Jeep.</span> <span id="s1482">Si -- the ex-prisoner of war, Americans and British, who -- who wants to get back and absolutely settled on making it.</span> <span id="s1483">Some of them were in very, very bad shape, too.</span> <span id="s1484">And we managed to get them across, and get them onto the buses to go to the Nuremberg airport for repatriation to England.</span> <span id="s1485">Returned to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: But your parents were not infected with typhus, right, they were generally healthy at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1488">They did not have any of the contagious diseases, so I had been spared that.</span> <span id="s1489">People who had these diseases were in what they called the -- the [indecipherable] the -- the castle.</span> <span id="s1490">Listen, I’ve got to [indecipherable] now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1492">[tape break] Okay, if you could just tell me about then -- your -- after you leave, and -- and what you -- what you do to -- to help people leave Theresienstadt eventually -- Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1494">So, I left, I picked up all these [indecipherable] of wars, went back into the American lines, and then th-the generals from these two and a half German divisions, which I had met in the Sudeten mountains came into the American lines, and the American com -- local American commander asked me to come with him to make these people surrender to the Russians, because they had fought the Russians and therefore had to surrender to the Russians, that was the agreement we had.</span> <span id="s1495">That’s -- every German division surrenders to those whom they -- whom they have been fighting.</span> <span id="s1496">So the Americans could not accept their surrender, wouldn’t accept their surrender.</span> <span id="s1497">So we returned them to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1498">Now, so we eventually got back to my unit, and it’s in the south of Holland, and I na -- went to see Princess Julianna, who was in ch -- chas -- charge of repatriation, and I gave her the letter, which the justice of [indecipherable] court had given me, and she said she wants to talk to me, but I didn’t have a chance to do that.</span> <span id="s1499">That’s it -- later on, because by the time my unit moved on to Germany, and nobody to this day believes that -- believes me, but the first town we moved into was my hometown, and I had absolutely nothing to do with it, nothing.</span> <span id="s1500">Nobody will believe this.</span> <span id="s1501">What an experience.</span> <span id="s1502">And there we actually -- we were -- we weren’t even the occupation force.</span> <span id="s1503">The idea was for us to be equipped with new weapons to get ready for the invasion of Japan.</span> <span id="s1504">So it wa -- it -- it was of course was incredible experience to be right there in that town.</span> <span id="s1505">We confiscated the best houses in town, to which Jews would never have even been invited before Hitler, and -- [phone ringing] -- Yeah that -- that was quite -- quite an experience, to be back, out of all places, in my hometown.</span> <span id="s1506">Well, I just don’t want to get into all the details, but actually [indecipherable] were -- my last job in the army was to be the deputy intelligence officer of a 12,000 people camp, 10,000 men, 2,000 women of high ranking Nazis, largely preparing for the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s1507">A very interesting experience, from every point of view, which I have rarely told anybody about, because even in Germany today, people do not like some of the things that their relatives experienced while being in this camp, not -- not that in my opinion they didn’t deserve them, but this is what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Such as -- such as what?</span> <span id="s1509">What’s an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Well, you know, people were held in these camps, and -- who were -- who had been say of [indecipherable] of my hometown had been a guy who -- I only learned about this afterwards, actually -- who -- who had been a judge in Poland.</span> <span id="s1511">You know, that’s an automatic arrest category.</span> <span id="s1512">Somebody goes to the judge, German judge in Poland, can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s1513">And, you know, you j -- obviously we were -- w-we prepared a case like that, we pec -- practically condemned the guy to death already.</span> <span id="s1514">He di -- that’s not what they did to him in Nuremberg, but they di -- they did get, you know, like the long sentences.</span> <span id="s1515">So somehow or the other, I think there’s still too many Germans around who, if they know it at all about what went on at that time, think that a lot of these things are very unfair.</span> <span id="s1516">And they still cannot imagine all the crimes that were committed in -- by say a guy who was a judge in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: How did you feel talking to the Germans, interrogating them?</span> <span id="s1518">What’s the name of this place where you were, and how did you feel about it?</span> <span id="s1519">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1520">Well, again, we had a job to do.</span> <span id="s1521">Th-The British had a very good system of making us filling in certain questionnaire interrogating people.</span> <span id="s1522">I filled in all the questionnaire with a typewriter, because I typed on a German typewriter quite well in those days.</span> <span id="s1523">And I -- I -- I had no pity on any of these people.</span> <span id="s1524">Most of them really deserved it.</span> <span id="s1525">We had Mr. Armeyer from Auschwitz, and you know, he had been a commandant of the -- of Auschwitz for a while.</span> <span id="s1526">And I don’t think before too long, I thought, hey, he was a common criminal, who was in prison with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1527">Hitler was in prison in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s1528">He was in prison for murder.</span> <span id="s1529">And so, you know, he stuck to his Nazi regime, that’s how -- how he made his career.</span> <span id="s1530">We had 500 high ranking German officers, who had spent their time in Norway during the war, who wouldn’t believe all these stories that were being circulated around about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1531">So we made up a [indecipherable] I give them a lecture on what happens in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1532">He describes it in great detail, of how people came in, were -- were -- were -- were put into these so-called showers, which were of course the gas showers.</span> <span id="s1533">[indecipherable] and we told [indecipherable] who was -- thank God was stupid enough to believe that, that you know, he had got nothing to fear, because after all, he only followed orders.</span> <span id="s1534">And he described all this to these 500 high ranking German officers.</span> <span id="s1535">And these guys were stunned.</span> <span id="s1536">Th-They don’t -- there’s a film, “Judgment at Nuremberg,” where some -- something similar is being done.</span> <span id="s1537">But you know, we did it.</span> <span id="s1538">Ours was not fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Did you feel a lot of resentment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: To the Germans that you interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Well, I don’t know what -- what you mean by resentment.</span> <span id="s1543">What about y -- I -- I felt that these guys had to be brought to justice, you know.</span> <span id="s1544">That we had -- had a to -- a totally different subject.</span> <span id="s1545">We had a major investigation of the attempt on Hitler’s life in -- in -- when was it, in -- in June 1944 -- July 1944?</span> <span id="s1546">Was -- was after the invasion, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s1547">Was it -- yeah, yeah, it was in July, so it must have been in July 1944, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: I know you wrote a -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans.</span> <span id="s1550">This is tape number five, side A.</span> <span id="s1551">So I think we were just finishing up talking about when you were interrogating Germans, and I was wondering if you had any other feelings or encounters with not the -- those who had been high S.S. officials, but sort of more the ordinary Germans, and if there were any kind of different feelings you had, or did you kind of hold them responsible in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was an -- actually a military [indecipherable], I -- of course I met a lot of ordinary Germans, and it -- I didn’t have any prejudice against them.</span> <span id="s1553">I was willing to judge people on the basis of who they -- what they were, and who they were.</span> <span id="s1554">It was the -- I -- we were go -- gotten quite friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of fraternization, but ma -- with s -- with some of the Germans who were obviously had been -- not been [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constructive.</span> <span id="s1555">We had to work for them.</span> <span id="s1556">Certainly in military government we did.</span> <span id="s1557">Then, of course, they made the rule, very wisely, that no extra -- extra Jew, or extra [indecipherable] could be in military government.</span> <span id="s1558">It would be a very good idea if the United States had the same rule for Iraq now.</span> <span id="s1559">It -- it -- it just is -- became -- was a bit of a shock that we had to leave military government, one day to the other, but I think it was an extremely wise decision.</span> <span id="s1560">They wanted to show the military how -- the British authorities and American authorities wanted to show -- no, I think it’s only the British who did this, they wanted to show that they had confidence in the political leaders who were coming up wer -- like Adenauer and Schumacher, who were now coming up in Germany, and that they would not be sidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had left the country and who had not gone through the same experience as these political leaders had gone through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: So when were you discharged, and how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: I was discharged in August, in ni -- 1946.</span> <span id="s1563">At that time I was 24 years old, and wa -- in -- from one day to the other I changed my name back, I didn’t -- didn’t [indecipherable] to Manfred Gans from Fred Gray, and I was discharged on a Saturday night, and on Sunday morning I started studying for my entrance examination for the university, which I -- you know I had of course been back in England once or twice on -- on leave, and I tried to make arrangements for getting into university.</span> <span id="s1564">Now I wanted to go for chemical engineering because I -- there was a government grant for se -- ex-servicemen, and now all these things that I had thought were not possible before the war, were now possible.</span> <span id="s1565">The results of getting these -- what we -- you c-call in this country, G.I. grants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: And by now where’s the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Well, you know, my parents, of course died in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1568">They -- they -- my -- my parents went to -- c-came to Israel in 19 -- they were here fif -- that must have been [inaudible] I don’t know, 1950 something.</span> <span id="s1569">I ca -- and you know they lived in Israel until they died.</span> <span id="s1570">My father died wa -- he was 95, so -- yeah, in ni -- 1980 he died.</span> <span id="s1571">So they lived a -- a very full life in Israel.</span> <span id="s1572">Very full, very good life.</span> <span id="s1573">Course they -- you know, th-they had pensions, and -- and the restitution from Germany, my father fought like blazes for all those things, and he knew how to do it.</span> <span id="s1574">So they had a pretty good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: And your brothers wound up in Israel, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: My -- ma -- my older brother, of course, was in Israel all the time.</span> <span id="s1577">My younger brother went to Israel in 1952, I think.</span> <span id="s1578">Yeah, ’51 -- it must have been 1952, yes.</span> <span id="s1579">Yeah, I think my parents went to Israel in 1953 or ’54.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: And when did you emigrate to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: I came here for the first time in 1948.</span> <span id="s1582">I got married, and I went back to England, and came to United States for good in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: So I just have a couple overall questions and then we’re done, I think.</span> <span id="s1584">When did you decide to write your memoirs about your experiences, and how long did that take you, and was that a difficult process or -- or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Well it -- you know, par -- part of it I had written before.</span> <span id="s1586">I had written it for my niece in Israel, the one who drew your -- your attention to my story.</span> <span id="s1587">When she was doing -- she was going in for a master degree, and she felt that all she had to do was to translate my -- my holo -- my tere -- Terezin story, that will be enough.</span> <span id="s1588">But the authorities didn’t let her get away with that, so she had to pose a large number of questions to me, and I answered those.</span> <span id="s1589">And a lot of it came out as such at that time.</span> <span id="s1590">I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so [inaudible], about 2002 sometime, I started to write, sitting down and writing things up on the computer.</span> <span id="s1591">And it’s been -- it’s been growing ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Has it been hard to do, to write about these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Oh yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1594">It’s ver -- ver -- th -- the main -- as I said, the main -- main hardship is not recounting all the experience, but realizing what terrible risks we took.</span> <span id="s1595">We were so inexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1596">We learned pretty fast, I suppose, but we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- that we would never have done if we had been more experienced.</span> <span id="s1597">That -- that part of it gave me nightmares, re-realizing how -- what -- what wrong steps we took.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Although it seems amazing to me that you have such detailed and vivid recall.</span> <span id="s1599">Have you always had that memory all along of -- of all these incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Well, I -- I don’t -- don’t think so, but I mean, these were very special experiences I have written up, and th-they -- you know, I recall them.</span> <span id="s1601">If I was to recall all the experience I’ve had in my professional life, I don’t think it would be quite that experience, but I’ve had a very, very adventurous career in my professional life, too, and maybe if I sit down -- would -- would have sat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured up some of those experience again, it would have been -- would -- they would have come back.</span> <span id="s1602">But you know, you start concentrating, and as you know, of course, these were very unique experiences.</span> <span id="s1603">And so the -- Peter Maas’s book has been quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Are there certain sounds or smells that take you back to that time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Mm, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1606">I -- I -- personally I don’t have a very good smell -- sense of smell any more.</span> <span id="s1607">No, I don’t -- I don’t think that there -- that any of that nature would -- would take me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: And when did you write about your journey to -- to find your parents?</span> <span id="s1609">That was at a different time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: To find my parents?</span> <span id="s1611">When I wrote up the story?</span> <span id="s1612">The night I came back from the trip.</span> <span id="s1613">I wrote this whole story in one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: And why -- why did you feel so motivated to do it right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Because I wanted to inform all my friends of what I had -- what I had done.</span> <span id="s1616">I didn’t think that was a historical document.</span> <span id="s1617">Luckily, the guy who typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had also been in the unit already on D-Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a copy of it.</span> <span id="s1618">So I wrote it up, and it took him about four or five days before he finished the typing of it all.</span> <span id="s1619">And I don’t know that I’ve given you one of the originals.</span> <span id="s1620">I -- I can ge -- probably get a copy of one of the originals, the way it was originally typed up.</span> <span id="s1621">It’s -- one of them is in Terezin, my cousin deposited it in Terezin on one of their trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did.</span> <span id="s1622">Of course, has mistakes in it.</span> <span id="s1623">This one you have in there is -- which was done on a computer by my secretary is -- is more correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: And finally, do you feel that there have been things in your life, decisions, or the way that you’ve approached things in your life that come directly from, you know, the experiences, what you went through during the war, what also, in general, the Holocaust, you know, that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Yeah, yeah, it’s hard for -- it’s hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the matter is that I’ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I’ve done, if you put a large chemical plant on line, with a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything I’d done in the war.</span> <span id="s1626">As I said in one of the comparison, on the night of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in Normandy, 1944, in the night of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination plant on line in -- in southern France, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944.</span> <span id="s1627">But it’s very hard for non-technical people to realize what is involved in the invention, development, design and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process.</span> <span id="s1628">That -- that’s one -- on aspect of it.</span> <span id="s1629">So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences.</span> <span id="s1630">The highlight of my professional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the University of Hanoi in 1986, to a totally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when they should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they were totally hostile, not willing to listen.</span> <span id="s1631">I -- as I said, in one state I was in the University of Hanoi lecturing 13 years before Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphere was still very different then.</span> <span id="s1632">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: I -- I s -- I think I read somewhere that you -- you’ve also been back to Germany and have spoken to students there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Yes, regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: And what’s -- what’s that been like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Regularly.</span> <span id="s1637">Oh that’s a very interesting experience, very worthwhile.</span> <span id="s1638">In 1988, on the anniversary -- or was it the -- the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my hometown, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back.</span> <span id="s1639">My two brothers came from Israel with their wives.</span> <span id="s1640">Everybody could bring one companion, my wife came along.</span> <span id="s1641">And we -- I made a condition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the schools.</span> <span id="s1642">And the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and again.</span> <span id="s1643">I’ve been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s -- he died in the meantime, he went there back every year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile experience.</span> <span id="s1644">I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that, but also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well.</span> <span id="s1645">It’s a great privilege to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: And students you found were receptive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Oh very.</span> <span id="s1648">Extremely receptive.</span> <span id="s1649">They -- well, of course it depended a little bit as to who the teacher was.</span> <span id="s1650">If there was a teacher that had prepared them for this, they were very much more [indecipherable] than if it was just somebody who let us cu-cut in.</span> <span id="s1651">But this was a very worthwhile experience.</span> <span id="s1652">And as I said, they paid for it.</span> <span id="s1653">They gave us all expenses.</span> <span id="s1654">I’ve written up a lot about these experiences.</span> <span id="s1655">Unfortunately I have not [indecipherable] but when the BBC thought of making a film about my life, they wanted to incorporate this into their -- into that film.</span> <span id="s1656">And no -- and just -- and th-they -- they, in fact they asked me, think you can get us some non -- ex-Nazis, who have not -- non -- what do -- ho-how do you call it, non-regenerated?</span> <span id="s1657">The wa -- y-you know?</span> <span id="s1658">I said I can, yes I can.</span> <span id="s1659">I know we -- we can produce it.</span> <span id="s1660">It’s still there.</span> <span id="s1661">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Did you enjoy going back to Germany?</span> <span id="s1663">Was there a part of you that enjoyed going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: I did, I enjoyed it very much, after the first experience.</span> <span id="s1665">My wife in the -- the first time -- she only went along once, she was very apprehensive about it, very apprehensive.</span> <span id="s1666">She somewhat frightened, but maybe she was already coming down with the sickness at the time.</span> <span id="s1667">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: And your -- in the house where you grew up, tell me just about the different stages it went through during the course of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Well, when my parents left it became Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s1670">And they even had a torture chamber in our wine cellar.</span> <span id="s1671">And then it was taken over by the mili -- British military government as the headquarters for the district.</span> <span id="s1672">This was when I came back there, only two days after -- after the town has been liberated, the advance people were just mo -- moving in.</span> <span id="s1673">It stayed that way for awhile, and after that they sold it, or they -- it was handed over to the German police.</span> <span id="s1674">It became police headquarters in the town for a little while, not very long.</span> <span id="s1675">And then it went back into private possession.</span> <span id="s1676">At the moment it’s largely -- there are four lawyers in it, I think it’s [indecipherable] their offices in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Do you remember the address?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Yes, of course,
