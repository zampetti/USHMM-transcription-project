<span id="s12">Esther, first of all, thank you very much for taking the time to give this interview to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s13">You were kind enough to fill out the questionnaire.</span> <span id="s14">Why don’t we start talking about the earliest memory you have of your childhood.</span> <span id="s15">What’s the first memory you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: I do – I can’t answer exactly what first because my memory is not – I – I remember a little bit here, a little bit there, but I cannot put them together, and I cannot say which one first, and which one is second.</span> <span id="s17">But I remember when I was in the children home, very, very young, the Germans came in and start shooting the kids.</span> <span id="s18">And they – that part left me in such a horror, so when I came to Israel, I would always think about a fox who – who killed the kids except me.</span> <span id="s19">And when I met the [indecipherable] here, I ask her, why they shoot the kids?</span> <span id="s20">Why they didn’t kill me?</span> <span id="s21">So she said, the kids were boys who were circumcised.</span> <span id="s22">You were a girl so you were not circumcised, that’s why.</span> <span id="s23">So the Germans were looking for circumcised boys to kill them, and they killed them right there at the spot.</span> <span id="s24">And luckily – I was wounded also, with one of the shots, and I still have – I have a s – in my leg, a problem with that.</span> <span id="s25">Both legs, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s27">And when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: They shot me too.</span> <span id="s29">That’s happened – I do not know the year, I mean, I was too young to say what year.</span> <span id="s30">That’s was during the war.</span> <span id="s31">In Slonim, in Alberton – in Alberton Children Home in Slonim.</span> <span id="s32">But the name of the children home was Alberton.</span> <span id="s33">Slonim, Poland at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s35">Do you have any memories – how did your mother explain to you the situation you were in?</span> <span id="s36">How did she explain to you why these things happened to you?</span> <span id="s37">What –</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My mother – I never knew my mother, I did not know my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My mother, when I was very, very – when I was six months old, she put – what’s happened is she put me in – on the footsteps of a home where – that’s was a nursing home.</span> <span id="s41">And the woman, who was a good friend of her, a Christian wowan – woman, her name was hern – Helena Westerly.</span> <span id="s42">And she had a plan.</span> <span id="s43">She gave my mother two identities, two passports with false name, and had put me in a – in – in a footsteps of that nursing home.</span> <span id="s44">My mother was behind the bushes of the nursing home, looking what’s happened to me.</span> <span id="s45">And in the morning the cook came in, and they saw a baby, and they said, what we going to do with this baby?</span> <span id="s46">And they decided to put me in a children home.</span> <span id="s47">They – Helena Westerly, who was there too, she pretended she did not know who I was.</span> <span id="s48">And I was given a name, as Onay(ph) Vidoma(ph).</span> <span id="s49">Onay(ph) Vido – Vidomska(ph), which is mean, the unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: And they put me in a children home, as unknown child.</span> <span id="s52">Nobody knew who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s54">How old were you when you learned what had happened to you, or to your parents?</span> <span id="s55">Where was your father at the time your mother gave you to this nursing home?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: My father?</span> <span id="s57">He probably was dead already.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s59">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I was before it in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s61">My mother did escape with me from the ghetto, and somehow we’re back in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s62">We escaped, we went to different countries, and some – I do not know why she returned back, what’s happened, the circumstances exactly, I was too young to know.</span> <span id="s63">And she returned, and a – back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So your mother was able to escape –</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: – from the ghetto, with a baby, so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah, and – yeah.</span> <span id="s68">Eventually she joined the partisans, and in a z – ava – in the woods around Slonim – in Slonim area of Poland.</span> <span id="s69">And in 1944, she – she went – they were raiding the partisan, the Germans.</span> <span id="s70">At one point I do remember that I was in a train, I do not know what’s happened exactly.</span> <span id="s71">I was on a train and that – in a train, a lot of people were there.</span> <span id="s72">They couldn’t move, nothing.</span> <span id="s73">And I saw people jumping off the train, escaping.</span> <span id="s74">And I was told to be quiet.</span> <span id="s75">And then the train got hit by a mi – by a mine or something they threw.</span> <span id="s76">The partisan attacked the train, and the train could not go any farther, and I don’t have no more memory after that, what’s happened.</span> <span id="s77">This is one of the things I remember.</span> <span id="s78">And I remember I was in the woods with a man, a tall man, and he told me to be behind the tree, to wait for him, he’ll going in the woods, not to move.</span> <span id="s79">I stood behind it – a wide tree so nobody can see me, which I waited there, and the man never came back.</span> <span id="s80">So I went to look for the man, and I saw him lay on the floor, with blood in his mouth, and his eyes open.</span> <span id="s81">So I start talking to the man to take me with him, and why he doesn’t talk?</span> <span id="s82">Why he look at me and doesn’t say nothing?</span> <span id="s83">So suddenly a woman come out from the woods, and she told me, this man is dead.</span> <span id="s84">I said, what does it mean dead?</span> <span id="s85">And she told me, a person that cannot talk, cannot breathe, and cannot speak and can do nothing.</span> <span id="s86">That’s it.</span> <span id="s87">And I ne – I do not know who was that man.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And this woman took you with her afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I don’t remember no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I don’t remember if she took me, and I don’t remember any more who she was, and what was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Your mother – when did you learn about your mother’s fate?</span> <span id="s93">Do you know the circumstances, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I learn – I learn in – after a – I learned in 1960 in Israel, 1960 or 1962 in Israel.</span> <span id="s95">But I did not know much about my mother, nothing.</span> <span id="s96">I just knew that she died, my parents died.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What exactly had happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: That she joined the partisan, and the Germans attacked the partisan, and she was guarding at the time the partisans, and they shot her.</span> <span id="s99">They – she was fighting with the Germans, and she killed quite a few Germans too, I was told.</span> <span id="s100">So it wasn’t like she just went and they killed her.</span> <span id="s101">There was a big fight between the partisan and the Germans, and she got shot off.</span> <span id="s102">She was fighting with them – against the Germans too, at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Let’s go back to your – to your experiences in a nursing home.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: So, I look at her as a hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Yeah, you should.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: We all

home?</span> <span id="s113">I don’t remember very much, I only remember that they used to beat me up with a stick, because I was doing – something happened, I stopped making pee-pee.</span> <span id="s114">I urinate in a bed.</span> <span id="s115">And they used to beat me up with a stick, a big bamboo stick.</span> <span id="s116">They used to go and have the kids surrounding me, and especially bef – during the – a Christian holiday, they beat me up so hard, and they make – made the kids and every – the kids were getting present, except me.</span> <span id="s117">I didn’t get

used to beat me up ev – particular almost every day, until they told me if I stop screaming from the pain I got, then they’ll stop beating me.</span> <span id="s121">So I had to stop screaming, and then they stopped beating me up with the stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Were there other Jewish children as well, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I do not know, I’m not – I don’t recall

<p><span id="s140">A: Yeah, in front of the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: How much time did you spend in this home, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I think that was until 1946 or ’45, I don’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So you were still very young when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yeah, I was very young, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What happened afterwards, after this experience in –</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: My uncle, Max Pajewski(ph), he’s a brother of my father –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: He was fighting during the war against a rush – against the Germans at the Russian front in Russia.</span> <span id="s149">And then the war was over.</span> <span id="s150">The Russians allow any Polish citizen to return back to Poland.</span> <span id="s151">So, he was allowed to return back, so he went back to the city.</span> <span id="s152">And Helena Westerly was looking for him, because they said, Mina Pajewski(ph) did not come back from Poland – I mean, from the war.</span> <span id="s153">And what’s going to be with Sonja?</span> <span id="s154">My name was Sonja, Sonja Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s155">What’s going on with Sonja Pajewski(ph) is still there?</span> <span id="s156">And so – and that nobody came to pick her up.</span> <span id="s157">So she went to the bazaar places to look for somebody from the family, and one day she met my uncle there, and she told him that – that – where I am, and he didn't even know I was born.</span> <span id="s158">And – because he left the place in 1941, before I was born.</span> <span id="s159">And he – the Russian took me.</span> <span id="s160">They move into a remote area, that’s why.</span> <span id="s161">So meanwhile, I was born, and all that, and I – now he found out that I’m – that he has a niece there.</span> <span id="s162">So he went to the children home, and he told them that he is my father.</span> <span id="s163">So they let him to take me out, and he went with me – he did tell me that he bought me a piece of – a bread with piece of butter – with – a bread with butter to eat, and he says, somebody came and stole the bread from my hands, and I cried.</span> <span id="s164">Now he did say that I had a lot of bruises all over my body, and I suffer from severe malnutrition, I looked so bad.</span> <span id="s165">And he – we went to Poland, to Warszawa, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s166">And at that time, I think Slonim became part of – part of Soviet Union already, I think, at the time.</span> <span id="s167">So we – we went to rush – he brought me to Warszawa, to – and he’s staying some Jewish place, the Jewish agency helped two of us, and there was a place they were – they helped different de – different refugees, and so they helped me and my uncle.</span> <span id="s168">And he told me that I – I slept in bed – in one bed, because they didn’t have enough beds there.</span> <span id="s169">And I again did wee-wee on the – you know, pee-pee on the bed, and he got all wet from that.</span> <span id="s170">And that’s was my problem at that time.</span> <span id="s171">Then he – he was very sick, so he couldn’t take care of me, and he – he sent – he gave me to a Jewish agency, and tha-that was to send me to Palestine, at the time was Palestine, not Israel yet.</span> <span id="s172">So the Jewish agency took me and put me in Lódz, in a children home.</span> <span id="s173">I do not know where in Lódz, what city – I like to know all these particular.</span> <span id="s174">If you can find out this information, please allow me to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: All right.</span> <span id="s177">In Lódz, I was staying sometimes there, and – until maybe ’48, and then we – we traveled from one place to another place.</span> <span id="s178">In the middle of the night the – they brought big truck, military truck came up – came in, pulled me out of the bed, put hand on my mouth and said, don’t talk, be quiet.</span> <span id="s179">And they took me and put me in that truck, and they told me we going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s180">But meanwhile, I don’t – I don’t remember if they took other kids or not with them.</span> <span id="s181">It – I’m not really remember very well.</span> <span id="s182">But they took me and they – we went to different places, I do not know where, what.</span> <span id="s183">From one place to another place, again traveled through Europe again, illegally, just like I did with my mother when my mother escaped from the ghetto and went and traveled, and somehow went back to the city, I think to her husband.</span> <span id="s184">That’s why she returned back, because she couldn’t – nobody help her there and she couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s185">So she had to return back.</span> <span id="s186">But she – I was in Belgium before, and France and other countries, and somehow we return back to Poland.</span> <span id="s187">I mean, that’s when my mother was still alive.</span> <span id="s188">This time I was moving from one country to another country.</span> <span id="s189">And the paper, according to the paper, they put me on the ship Sylvania(ph), and they – we – to Palestine.</span> <span id="s190">In the boat, I had a friend, the name Natala(ph), and she is in Israel today.</span> <span id="s191">And she was in my children home too, because I visited Israel in 2004, and we see that we [indecipherable] together, Natala(ph) and me.</span> <span id="s192">And on the boat, I do not know – the British caught us on the boat when we were close to Palestine – everybody was so happy – the British caught us and arrested us and put us in a prison.</span> <span id="s193">So, I think I was about six year old at that time, I became a prisoner of United Kingdom.</span> <span id="s194">And I don’t know how long we were, but in a prison for long time.</span> <span id="s195">I was freezing, was not much – I remember they put fences there, and we were sleeping in a tent in Israel because there was not enough space, and – and it was very cold and freezing, and not enough food over there to – and, by the way, on the boat to – to Israel was not enough food to eat also, and every day we ate only fish.</span> <span id="s196">And I hated fish so much because all – every meal was only fish, too, there was no other food to eat, any more left.</span> <span id="s197">And that was very tough, and that boat was also – people were, I think, Turkish, Arabs, Turkish were on that boat, too.</span> <span id="s198">And they wear the red hat that Turkish wear, and I think they were Turkish, and I used to be afraid of them so much.</span> <span id="s199">And somebody was saying on the boat that they stealing the kids, too.</span> <span id="s200">So I always frightened from them.</span> <span id="s201">Anyway, on the way back in – back to – I mean Palestine, and then Israel was declared as a state, I was taken out of the prison and later on they send me to a foster family in Israel.</span> <span id="s202">And the name of the family, Goldschmidt [indecipherable] DDR [indecipherable] near Netanya.</span> <span id="s203">And I had foster family, and that was – life was not easy beginning because I had – I had to get used to new – to a family life, which I never had family before.</span> <span id="s204">And a home I had never had before.</span> <span id="s205">And they were very tough, they were Germans from Germany.</span> <span id="s206">And – Jewish Germans, and they were very, very tough disciplinary people, and they discipline me with the – a lot of hitting.</span> <span id="s207">I got again a lot of hitting.</span> <span id="s208">And I did, again, pee-pee in the bed.</span> <span id="s209">And they hit me for that also.</span> <span id="s210">And so the wa – life wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s211">But then first grade I didn’t do good because in the school, first grade, I used all the time to dream about the fox who eated the kids, except me not.</span> <span id="s212">So I couldn’t concentrate in the class, and I was – I didn’t do good in school.</span> <span id="s213">So they decided I’m going to be left over, and take the class first grade again.</span> <span id="s214">So the foster family said no, she cannot.</span> <span id="s215">I’m going to sit with her during the summer, and don’t leave her, because she has friends there now, and she used to them.</span> <span id="s216">And this will be a crime for her to – to move to new fr – kids, and again the same class.</span> <span id="s217">So my foster mother sat with me every day, teach me math and teach me to read and write, and believe me on that, by the end of the summer I took a test for the first grade, I passed it.</span> <span id="s218">Second grade I became the best student in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: That’s fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s221">And from then on I became very, very good student, and I focus on school very much.</span> <span id="s222">When I became a – when I became a – a 10 year old – so far they knew my name was Esther Pajewski(ph), but they – they did not know anything about my family, and they thought everybody died during the war, for me.</span> <span id="s223">And I took their name, their name was Goldschmidt.</span> <span id="s224">The father name was Elie Goldschmidt, and the mother name was Shoshanna Goldschmidt.</span> <span id="s225">Both were from Berlin, Germany.</span> <span id="s226">They immigrated to Israel in 1939, but they lost all their family in Germany.</span> <span id="s227">In 1939 they still were able to immigrate to Israel, and that’s why they survived, this family.</span> <span id="s228">And in Israel they worked in agriculture.</span> <span id="s229">The – and they had a house there, and it was a nice village, I – the life – and they were very, very disciplinary people.</span> <span id="s230">Everything had to be just right.</span> <span id="s231">Everything on time exactly, and I got used to all this.</span> <span id="s232">If I came five minutes late, was almost like a crime, how you did such a thing?</span> <span id="s233">You have to be exactly by 12 o’clock for lunch [indecipherable] exactly.</span> <span id="s234">Well, I got used to all this, and that was very nice.</span> <span id="s235">But then I had something happen at the age 10.</span> <span id="s236">I got sick, and they took me to the hospital to take x-rays, something happen.</span> <span id="s237">And the doctor over there say, you know what?</span> <span id="s238">There’s a doctor by the name Dr. Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s239">Maybe he’ll relate to this, because my last name Pajewski(ph) was.</span> <span id="s240">And they say, well, the do – the doctor in that hospital in Netanya say, you know what?</span> <span id="s241">We’ll come talk to him, and see if he related to her.</span> <span id="s242">A – after – within short time, Dr. Pajewski(ph) come with a Jeep to the village, and they – he wanted to see Sonja Pajewski(ph), which is me.</span> <span id="s243">And he came and found out that we are family members.</span> <span id="s244">And then he contacted my uncle in Italy, the brother of my father was station – was in Italy at the time.</span> <span id="s245">And I think it was 1950.</span> <span id="s246">And – 1950, and then I got a letter from Italy – they got a letter from Italy, and that was written in Italian.</span> <span id="s247">And, that he, my uncle, and he’s happy that I’m alive, and all that.</span> <span id="s248">And then sunny – one day came somebody from United States, a man, that he say he my uncle – he – I have an uncle here, and he is – his name is Isaac Makowski(ph), a brother of my mother, and he want to meet me.</span> <span id="s249">And he came to see how I am, and to meet me finally.</span> <span id="s250">Not my uncle, but he send somebody else to meet me there.</span> <span id="s251">And tha – to – to see I’m alive, he found out that I’m alive.</span> <span id="s252">That’s happen after the accident with the – that – th-the Dr. Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s253">So, they discover I have family members.</span> <span id="s254">Now became another problem.</span> <span id="s255">My uncle in – Isaac Makowski(ph), who lives in – who at that time lived in Brooklyn, New York, in United States, he was not happy with the family that I was living, because they were not religious Jewish.</span> <span id="s256">They were nice people, Jewish, but they were not Orthodox like he was.</span> <span id="s257">He was Hassidic Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s258">So he contacted [indecipherable] my uncle, my other uncle, and – and he ask him to sign that my parents were Orthodox, and they wanted me to be Orthodox.</span> <span id="s259">So my case became in a court, in Israeli court, and it took long time in Israeli court, and finally the Israeli court decided that I have to be removed for religious reason from – from Goldschmidt, from my foster family.</span> <span id="s260">So, after living in the house four and a half years, I was ordered by the court to remove, if not the ca – the fa-family would be arrested.</span> <span id="s261">So the family had to give me up, and they put me in a – in a Orthodox boarding school in Israel, and that was in a – and I’m thinking a la – not Ramat Gan, that’s was in Benai Brak, very religious place, and they send me to a religious school there, public school, a religious public school there, and to learn the religion.</span> <span id="s262">Well, my uncle aimed to bring me to United States, that was in 1953.</span> <span id="s263">And I refused to come to United States at the time because I hated him for doing what he did.</span> <span id="s264">So that came another family, and they told me that my uncle died, and they wanted to bring me to their house, to give me a home.</span> <span id="s265">I do not know who they were.</span> <span id="s266">And that family had twins.</span> <span id="s267">Babies, two ba – twins, and I do not know.</span> <span id="s268">I found out later on that – that my uncle just send me a letter, that couldn't be that he died.</span> <span id="s269">So, it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s270">But then [indecipherable] so it didn’t work out that way.</span> <span id="s271">And then I moved to Ramat Gan, that’s another religious boarding school Ra’anana.</span> <span id="s272">Ra’anana in Ra’anana – Ra’anana, I’m sorry, in Kfar Batya, Ra’anana.</span> <span id="s273">That’s a boarding school that I lived there, a elementary school, I was there a few years until 19 – until my first year – I finished there my first year high school, and then I asked to be moved to kibbutz.</span> <span id="s274">I went to Kibbutz Yavne, that’s a religious school, high school, my second year high school in Israel, and I wasn’t happy there.</span> <span id="s275">I didn’t like the place.</span> <span id="s276">So – kibbutz life, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s277">So I took a test and I got into a school, for lab technician school.</span> <span id="s278">That’s a high school combination with a profession with a lab.</span> <span id="s279">So we had four year – four hours a day, five days a week laboratory, and the rest is a – mainly was concentrate on chemistry.</span> <span id="s280">That’s how I started my [indecipherable] learning chemistry.</span> <span id="s281">Well, it started in high school.</span> <span id="s282">I was very good in math and sciences.</span> <span id="s283">And that’s due to my foster family, maybe, they taught me the – when my foster mother was sitting with me every day to teach me, when I was living in their house, and that’s how I got good in all these areas.</span> <span id="s284">I now focus a lot on school now, no more – I didn’t have nothing else to focus on, so it was school.</span> <span id="s285">I was a very good student, and I lived one year in – in the Kibbutz Yavne.</span> <span id="s286">And then I went to Ramat Gan, to another family, a family that was also Holocaust survivor from Hungary, I forgot the names.</span> <span id="s287">And they had the number on their hand.</span> <span id="s288">She was one of that that made experiment on her, that doctor –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Mengele, he made experiment on her so she could never have children.</span> <span id="s291">Now, her sister had five children, and when her sister had the sixth one, and she bought some – a nice outfit for the baby, she used to tell me, this, I don’t want to leave it to my sis.</span> <span id="s292">I really want – I’m thinking maybe I could have another chi – maybe I could have a child one day.</span> <span id="s293">I would like to have it for my child.</span> <span id="s294">But, that’s how the reality.</span> <span id="s295">I felt sorry for her.</span> <span id="s296">But anyhow, I lived in the house, and I went to the lab technician school in Ramat Gan every day.</span> <span id="s297">And when I finished school, two years was, I got a job in – in Israel, in the Weizmann Institute.</span> <span id="s298">I work there two years in Israel, and after two years – after two years in Rehovot, Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, after two years I decided I wanted to come to United States to meet my family.</span> <span id="s299">I never met my family.</span> <span id="s300">Meanwhile, my uncle from – from Italy immigrated to United States, and he lived in – in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s301">So I came to United States, and they send me the visa, my uncle in Brooklyn, a brother of my mother, and Isaac Mikowski(ph), and we met in Ellis Isl – Ellie Island.</span> <span id="s302">And I tell you, I do not know – they did not know how I look, I did not know how they look, but somehow we met.</span> <span id="s303">I did tell them what I’m going to wear, so they’ll look for a gi – a girl tha-that wearing so and so clothes, and tha – this, and special for them I would dress up in clothes so they can recognize it, not clothes li-like other people, otherwise they will never know who I am – where I am, right?</span> <span id="s304">So we met, and th-they – I went to their house.</span> <span id="s305">I stay in the house for two months, and we didn't get along, they were too religious, Hassidic.</span> <span id="s306">And I – they found out that I’m not religious [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s307">So they didn’t want to see me, and – and they wanted me to move out of the house, and to – they will rent for me a room in a family, and I’ll leave them, and they’ll pay for it.</span> <span id="s308">And at that time I was already 20 year old.</span> <span id="s309">I didn’t want it, so they decided to send me to Michigan, to my uncle who was married to Italian woman, not Jewish, but she converted, she became Jewish, and it – they’re not religious, so it would be good for me.</span> <span id="s310">So I went to Detroit, Michigan, and I went to a – I went to a midrasha to become Hebrew teacher while I was there in the house.</span> <span id="s311">But I didn’t get along again with my uncle, Max Pajewski(ph), so I stayed very short time with them, and then I contact with the Jewish agency, and they found me a woman that wants somebody to have companionship at night only, for a free room and board.</span> <span id="s312">I say, I’ll take that deal.</span> <span id="s313">No pay, free room and board.</span> <span id="s314">So I live with that woman and I went to the midrasha to become Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s315">On the side I did a little Hebrew teaching, I was not allowed to work, but I did on the side, teaching Hebrew.</span> <span id="s316">And so, it give me some money.</span> <span id="s317">All right.</span> <span id="s318">And then, meanwhile, I – I went at the same time, I took a test for college, and I went to Wayne State University to become a chemist.</span> <span id="s319">So here a Hebrew teacher and here’s a chemist.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: And meanwhile, I – I met my husband, was Paul Cohen, and I met him, and we got married a-at the same day when John F. Kennedy was shot.</span> <span id="s322">Civil marriage, not Jewish marriage.</span> <span id="s323">And at the same time, the same time, 10 o’clock, the same time when he got shot.</span> <span id="s324">So when we got married I went to the car, and suddenly I’m listening to the news, and I say, oh my God, John F. Kennedy was killed.</span> <span id="s325">The same date, the same time, everything.</span> <span id="s326">So that’s was a disaster.</span> <span id="s327">All right, my marriage also, my marriage lasted 10 years, and then after 10 – and then I took a job, I worked as a – as a lab technician in a hospital – in a private lab, and then in a hospital in – in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s328">And then – but the marriage wasn’t working, my husband was abusive husband, and I had to leave him quick, because he didn't treat me right.</span> <span id="s329">So I – I left him, and moved to New York.</span> <span id="s330">From New York to new j – New Jersey, I got a job in New Jersey in a hospital as a medical – as a leptic – no, oh, in Michigan I – I went to internship for medical technology, and I became a medical technologist also.</span> <span id="s331">And when I move out of Michigan, I got a job in New Jersey as a medical technologist in one of the hospitals.</span> <span id="s332">So I was very happy.</span> <span id="s333">Meanwhile I used to come to New York, and I met my o – my other husband, Ralph Fol, I me – I met him, and so I went to Dominican Republic to get my divorce, and I divorce my ex-hu – my ex – which – Mr. Cohen –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: – I divorced him, and I married my husband, Ralph Fol.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: During all these years, had you been in contact with Miss Westerly, or ha – did you hear anything from her?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, I never knew yet nothing.</span> <span id="s338">Remember, at that time, Soviet Union was a communist country and you couldn’t get in touch.</span> <span id="s339">I-I knew this story, that there was a Christian woman who saved my life during the war.</span> <span id="s340">My uncle wrote me a letter.</span> <span id="s341">I got this information from my uncle, Isaac Makowski(ph) that there was a woman that saved my life, but they didn't know who – what’s her name was.</span> <span id="s342">And so my uncle, Max Pajewski(ph) told me the same story.</span> <span id="s343">And what’s happen, in 1999, this learning organization from Israel, they came to – meanwhile – meanwhile what’s happened, the Soviet Union was dissolve, I forgot what year –which year, 1990-what – ’99?</span> <span id="s344">Something in the 90s, the Soviet Union dissolve.</span> <span id="s345">So different countries, Poland, then become Belarussia, so my city Slonim became part of Belarus now.</span> <span id="s346">And so I am – my uncle went to Belarussia, my uncle Max Pajewski(ph), he went to Belarus, and to the s – to s – to Slonim, with the Slonim organization from Israel, and – to put monument for the dead people who died during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s347">And there is coming a woman by the name Helena Westerly looking for Mr. Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s348">And she found him, and she ge – to – ask him – she told him who she is, and she ask him about Sonja Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s349">And he told her that – where I am, that I live in United States, he – they talked.</span> <span id="s350">And he say, please ask her to write me a letter.</span> <span id="s351">She gave her address.</span> <span id="s352">So he, when he came back to United States, he send me a letter and he told me she asked to write her.</span> <span id="s353">So I start to correspond with her, and in 1999, I – I wrote her a letter, I’m coming to unite – to Belarus to meet you.</span> <span id="s354">So, we – there’s a person by the name Jakob – he’s living in United States, Russian, that he is – he – he claimed that he is a president of the Belarusian jewelry – Jewry.</span> <span id="s355">The Jew – all right.</span> <span id="s356">So he helped a lot of things to do with the cemetery of – of the Jewish cemetery, so they don’t desecrate the Jewish cemeteries and other thing.</span> <span id="s357">So I got in touch with him, he lives in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s358">I got in touch with him, and we arranged for me to go there.</span> <span id="s359">I went to Belarus, I said, when you go to Belarus, I meet him – now you – I meet him in Belarus, and which I did, and he arranged for me to be on TV in Belarus, which I did, and my name – it was [indecipherable] in the newspaper there too, the story of me coming back to Belarus to meet Helena Westerly, that she saved my life during the war, etcetera.</span> <span id="s360">And so we had – we been corresponding ever since, and is a – I remember that woman when I was young, the same face, she was a very fat woman.</span> <span id="s361">Now she was very fat.</span> <span id="s362">And she seemed to be that her face, the – the features similar to what she was at the time, because of the fat that she had in her face now.</span> <span id="s363">And they – I ni – all these years, I had somebody in my neighborhood look like that face, and I used to look at her.</span> <span id="s364">Every time she pass by, I would sen – and stop and just stare at that woman.</span> <span id="s365">And then I start to understand why I did.</span> <span id="s366">I knew somebody by that – by – that looked like her.</span> <span id="s367">And Helena Westerly, and we became good friends.</span> <span id="s368">I look at her like somebody important to me, that was important because she did visit at me, not every day, was too dangerous during the war, while it was in a children home there, in Slonim.</span> <span id="s369">But, very occasionally.</span> <span id="s370">It was too dangerous to come, otherwise, they will be suspicious that she knows me.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: When you – when you m-met Miss Westerly, could she provide you with one more detail –</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Oh, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: – of your background story, your mother, your background, where you said, this is wonderful –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: – that I could learn this –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: – after all.</span> <span id="s378">After all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: She did tell me about – I spoke some German, I knew German from the foster family because they spoke German.</span> <span id="s380">And – but my German was not that good.</span> <span id="s381">But I learn Russian by myself, before I went to Belarus, because I know eastern Europe, they’re all speaking Russian, so what I need to learn Polish?</span> <span id="s382">Polish I forgot already, when I lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s383">And when I went to Belarus, I found out that everybody there speak Russian.</span> <span id="s384">So I was very pleased that I learned Russian.</span> <span id="s385">I was able to read and write Russian, but not much, because just – I learn a little bit for myself to get along, just to be able to move around, so I could [indecipherable] different thing, but not a lot.</span> <span id="s386">So with the Russian and the German, we were able to communicate.</span> <span id="s387">Meanwhile, there’s a – was a – a woman there, a – a – a daughter of her friend, that she major in English in Belarus, and she became interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: So, that cost me plenty of money to do interpreter, believe me, they all want money.</span> <span id="s390">They all take opportunity to do that.</span> <span id="s391">But that’s okay, it didn’t matter to me.</span> <span id="s392">I was very happy, so she to – I had also a lot of thing translated – I mean, a lot of thing on the tape in Polish, on the tape I have that – that she spoke.</span> <span id="s393">Now, she died March 2008, unfortunately, and she never met my daughter.</span> <span id="s394">I wanted to bring my daughter there, and she died, it’s too late.</span> <span id="s395">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Did she tell you something – was there – do you remember some things she told you, where you said, oh, thank you s –</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: She explained me certain things, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: – she did.</span> <span id="s400">When I told her that the – the kids were shot and not me, and she explaining what’s happen.</span> <span id="s401">The kids were Jewish who were circumcised, that’s how they know that they’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s402">I was a girl [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s403">She did say I did have – I was [indecipherable] headache a lot, because I did have malnutrition.</span> <span id="s404">I suffered from very severe malnutrition, she say.</span> <span id="s405">I look so bad, so when my uncle came to pick me up, he – she say he – it was like seeing a ghost, that’s how bad I looked.</span> <span id="s406">But basically – and when I was a – a – now, what I’m doing now, I’m semi-retired from my full time job, and I teach in college part time chemistry, and I have a daughter who is now 29 year old, from Mr. Fol, not from Mr. Cohen.</span> <span id="s407">Mr. Cohen did – never had children.</span> <span id="s408">Basically, that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s409">And I came to the conference here to meet – maybe to meet some people, to see what is the conference.</span> <span id="s410">But I’m still working, teaching in college part time.</span> <span id="s411">And I just lost my husband, Mr. Fol a year ago.</span> <span id="s412">And so right now I’m alone, and I’m – I lost my best friend, I – he was my best friend really, my husband, Ralph Fol.</span> <span id="s413">He was original – Ralph Fol, my husband, he was from Russia, he was born in Russia in 1916.</span> <span id="s414">In 1917, his father, Ike Fol, his name was Folchuk(ph), he escaped from Russian revolution in 1917, he came to United States, and he was unable to get a job as I – Ike Folchuk.</span> <span id="s415">So he cut – he split his name to Fol, and that’s where the name become Fol, f-o-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Now you know.</span> <span id="s418">Because nobody wanted to hire somebody who come from Russia [indecipherable] and they call him Russian communist, with the name Folchuk(ph).</span> <span id="s419">So that’s why he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s421">I had one more question about – I’m just thinking about your being on the ship and going to Palestine –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: – back then.</span> <span id="s424">So your uncle was with you during this time?</span> <span id="s425">This was the only per –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: We – no.</span> <span id="s427">My uncle, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Who was the person you could relate to during this –</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: The – during the what was – they put me with a family –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: – in the – on the boat, on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: And the family told me this way.</span> <span id="s434">We have the same last name, Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s435">But always remember, you are not our daughter.</span> <span id="s436">And they went with me to Palestine, and then, after the British arrested us and all that, I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s437">So I do not know who was that family, where they went to and who they were, and I would be happy to find out.</span> <span id="s438">What I’d like to know from all this, I want to know who were the passengers on [indecipherable] boat, and tell me information about these passengers.</span> <span id="s439">I would like to know if somebody that knew who I was, and – and my journey from Lo-Lódz – Lódz to Palestine, what year, or when did I left children home in Lo-Lódz – Lódz is actually Lódz, Lódz, Poland, and – and how I traveled to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s440">And I want to know also, I’d like to get also, information about the – the – the court order about removing me from Goldschmidt, my foster family, and by the way, I’m still in touch with my foster family.</span> <span id="s441">Their parents died, but I’m in touch with their son, Suri(ph) Goldschmidt, he is like my brother, I look at him as my brother, and his sister, Newey(ph) Goldschmidt, she died about a month and a half ago.</span> <span id="s442">They called me up and they told me she died.</span> <span id="s443">And that’s basically what is told, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: There was no further family, so your mother was – apparently you were the only child.</span> <span id="s445">Your father died very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I was the only chil-child, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: So there was no further fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: The whole family wiped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: The-They killed the whole family.</span> <span id="s451">There’s one Dr. Pajewski(ph).</span> <span id="s452">He is a relative, he is not very close family, he is a relative.</span> <span id="s453">I don’t bother with the family at all.</span> <span id="s454">We had a lot of feud in the family because what’s happened, taking me from Goldschmidt.</span> <span id="s455">So it became a feud in the family because of that.</span> <span id="s456">So one side don’t like another side because of that.</span> <span id="s457">So – and I’m in between, so I’m – neither one good friend with me, and this is how the family ended.</span> <span id="s458">And, unfortunately, that’s what’s happened.</span> <span id="s459">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: It’s interesting, if you think of it being a child with a strange family on a trip, leaving your country, going to Palestine, I wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I don’t know who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Do you have any – any memory what the ship was like, what – what was life on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: It was a very big ship, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You s – you said you had nothing to eat, it was fish.</span> <span id="s465">How would you prepare the food?</span> <span id="s466">Was it raw fish, was there any –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: They – I did not know what – oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Did you have any devices to prepare the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: They – they prepared the food there, and every meal was only fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Fish, raw f – did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: And I – for many years I wouldn’t touch fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Yeah, I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: For many years, if you showed me fish, I would run away from it.</span> <span id="s474">Because fish is one thing, I hated that.</span> <span id="s475">And just the word fish is – was enough to hate, be-because o-of all this.</span> <span id="s476">But anyhow, one thing I remember on that boat was, there was a – like a – a big place with water, and they used to go and threw in the – with a net, some people to the water.</span> <span id="s477">And I didn’t understand what ed – why, and what does it mean?</span> <span id="s478">So some people – now people tell me could be people who came from a concentration camp were afraid to take shower because a – a – they were taking shower in the gas, and they got killed in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s479">So people were afraid to take shower because they were thinking that’s what happen again.</span> <span id="s480">So maybe they threw them to – they forced them to wash themself, to throw them to the water.</span> <span id="s481">So, I do not know, I’m just telling you what I saw.</span> <span id="s482">But life on the boat, I had one good friend on the boat, Natala(ph).</span> <span id="s483">She came with me to Israel.</span> <span id="s484">She was in [indecipherable] also, Natala(ph), and that’s all that I know of.</span> <span id="s485">But she was a little bit older than me.</span> <span id="s486">And that’s how it is, but I went back to Slonim, and I went also to Poland.</span> <span id="s487">I went into the archives of the Jewish History Museum, and they got my pictures in the archive, and on the picture is say, Sonja Pajewski(ph), in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s488">So I’m happy, I ha – that’s the first time I have pictures from – that I’m a – little.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Oh, this is fantastic.</span> <span id="s490">One cannot – I can’t even imagine how it must be, to be, you know, on a ship in a strange world, being on this long trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: But I so got used to move from one place to another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: To the ‘nothers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s494">But one thing I’m lucky I had the family, because when I arrived to pa – to my foster family, how tough they were beginning, and I was very fortunate, because they – yeah, I was afraid beginning, because the Palestinians would come to – to the village.</span> <span id="s495">We lived in Kfar Yedidya next to Netanya.</span> <span id="s496">And they would come at night, the Palestinians, to the village and steal cows, and do all time sabotage in a lot of thing.</span> <span id="s497">So I would be so afraid.</span> <span id="s498">They would send me at – in the evening, purposely in the evening, to bring newspaper from the neighbor, because at that time people didn’t have money, and they share a newspaper bet-between three, four different families.</span> <span id="s499">So one family read the German newspaper – the – the newspaper was in German.</span> <span id="s500">So, the all – the – the village were all come from Germany.</span> <span id="s501">They all either Austria or Germany, but they all were German origin and they all spoke German.</span> <span id="s502">And I didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s503">I felt very bad that I couldn’t catch the language.</span> <span id="s504">And they tried to teach me and I couldn’t catch the language.</span> <span id="s505">I couldn’t learn one set from the a – Polish language became th – and I know only [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s506">Language became very difficult for me to learn.</span> <span id="s507">And this was my problem, language.</span> <span id="s508">And they – they would send me to the library, th – the family had the books in German, and they will say, you have to bring a book, and they would teach me how to say it in German.</span> <span id="s509">And by the time I get there, and I said book.</span> <span id="s510">And I had difficulty say th-the rest of it.</span> <span id="s511">So they knew that I have to bring a book for them, and that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s512">But I got used to all this, but when I came to Israel, they have the – I remember I was with my friends, the neighbors were my friends, and they were the same age I was, and they – the plan was, that time, I think, after the war of ’48, or whatever, I do not know, the plans was there from the [indecipherable] that everybody tells me, you got to go down on the ground.</span> <span id="s513">So, I was still, at that time, so I went on the ground, until the plane go.</span> <span id="s514">So, all kind of things that.</span> <span id="s515">And then we see that the British, and the British left.</span> <span id="s516">Some places we found a lot of bullets, ammunition that the British left i-in the – in our areas.</span> <span id="s517">So we were the kids that played with those things, and one of the kids got wounded from that.</span> <span id="s518">So this kind of thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: You – you had experienced a lot of violence –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: – during, as a long chi – as a young child, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah, a – a lot of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Do you remember the shooting th – Miss Westerly was talking about?</span> <span id="s524">Do you remember any details about this when she said you were not her –</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No, I – I only remembered –</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: – I was – I was two year olds, two.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah, how can – two or two and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I just rem – from the –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Could she give you more –</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: When I was in a class, sitting in school, first grade –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: – always I was thinking about the fox with the black boots, and the black – the black fox, as animal, because I was afraid from fox, and the fox were always in the woods there, in the – in the village Kfar Yedidya.</span> <span id="s536">So I would think always, the fox eating all the kids except me.</span> <span id="s537">It came in my head as a fox, not as the Germans.</span> <span id="s538">So when – when I met her the first time, I ask her, tell me, what’s happened to the kids, why they were killed?</span> <span id="s539">I realized that something happened with the kids, that’s why it’s come as a fox.</span> <span id="s540">And she did tell me yes, the kids were shot.</span> <span id="s541">And she explain about they were circumcised, and you were a girl, so you didn't have to worry about.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s543">So, you were the only girl among a group of – of boys, Jewish pop –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I do not know the only girl, there pa – there [indecipherable] others.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s546">Were there more survivors, could she tell you if there were more children who survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, we – I tell you interesting, in the village Kfar Yedidya, there were a few [indecipherable] from Poland, and there were – there were – she went th – a lot of families in that village took children from Poland at – to – to be foster parents.</span> <span id="s548">And they became as a family.</span> <span id="s549">In my situation, my family took me out of there because of the religion.</span> <span id="s550">But these children stayed with them until they – all the time with them, and all the years.</span> <span id="s551">They didn’t – nobody took them out.</span> <span id="s552">But later on, when I came back to Israel, 2005, I went to reunion in Kfar Yedidya, near Netanya there, and I met all [indecipherable] of people that I went with them to school, and I went – it was very nice, the reunion.</span> <span id="s553">And they’re all about my age, maybe some a little older.</span> <span id="s554">And then I found out like a na – one neighbor who was from Poland, he was adopted by the Polish family, only one Polish family in that village.</span> <span id="s555">And that was one Polish family adopted one from Poland, his name was Chaim.</span> <span id="s556">And he – he found out that he has a family too.</span> <span id="s557">He send to the newspaper in United States, and here they responded to him, that he had a good family in United States.</span> <span id="s558">And then he found out that he have a family all these years in Netanya also, near the village.</span> <span id="s559">And the – a person who, uncle who looked just like him.</span> <span id="s560">So, he was telling me that story.</span> <span id="s561">And then somebody else tell me a story that he went – he – when he went to the military, he – he had met a good – he met a ba – ha – had a good friend over there, somebody about his age, and they became very good friends.</span> <span id="s562">Later on they found out they were brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah, they did not know, because of the war.</span> <span id="s565">So, different people had different things happening.</span> <span id="s566">And, very interesting.</span> <span id="s567">So, that’s a wonderful, wonderful to hear in the village, different thing – different people found their families.</span> <span id="s568">But I – when I live in Kfar Batya [indecipherable] is a boarding school, a very good ed-education was there, and a wa – I remembered there were people who did not know who they were.</span> <span id="s569">None of them knew who – I have a few people that I knew, they picked them up from the woods, and bring them to is – to Israel, but they never knew who they were.</span> <span id="s570">They gave them names and everything.</span> <span id="s571">They’re little kids with nobody, just in a wood by themself.</span> <span id="s572">So they take and send them to Israel.</span> <span id="s573">They figure that children of Holocaust survivors also.</span> <span id="s574">So, otherwise they would die alone in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: So, there are people who do not know who they are.</span> <span id="s577">That’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s578">So, there are a lot of things happen that in a – I think a – I think what you’re doing is a wonderful thing, take information.</span> <span id="s579">I think that information should be left to the next generation, so they know that there was a Holocaust, whoever deny the Holocaust, they hate Israel, and the one destruction of Israel.</span> <span id="s580">That the hol – that the Holocaust – I believe the Holocaust – the purpose of the Holocaust was to create the state of Israel, because that’s how the state of Israel was created.</span> <span id="s581">That’s what I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: This is a fascinating story.</span> <span id="s583">You’ve experienced many, many interesting things, from a very young age on.</span> <span id="s584">I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p>

to know more things about me; what year I arrived to Israel, I do not know; and what year I arrived to – I would like to write a book about my life, really.</span> <span id="s593">So –</span></p>

resources in the museum –</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I cannot put the times to frame together –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: – when or wh – or why, when this happened, and what these – I know so many things happened, and – in a – and that a lot of things happened to me, but when I ca – that’s what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s603">When I red – arrived to the foster family, after – I was beginning getting to be very sick in my head.</span> <span id="s604">I could – I could like hear something saying to me, and I said, go away.</span> <span id="s605">And – and I didn’t want nobody see it.</span> <span id="s606">But it took time and eventually I got healthy.</span> <span id="s607">I di – I had good food, I put weight on.</span> <span id="s608">I no more look like a – a starving – and then I had a good life there, and I become healthy again, without going to doctors and without anything, just with the right environment.</span> <span id="s609">Right food and right environment was good.</span> <span id="s610">So that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: In your homeland.</span></p> <p><span
