17th, 2010 at the Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia Kindertransport Association conference.</span> <span id="s13">The interviewer is Noemi Szekely-Popescu, and the interviewee is Herbert Friedman.</span> <span id="s14">Welcome.</span> <span id="s15">Could you first give me your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: My name is Herbert Friedman, born on December 11th, 1924, in Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s17">Can you stop the tape for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s19">[break] So Mr. Friedman, you just told us what year you were born, and I’d be curious to know what your parents did.</span> <span id="s20">What – what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My father was a shoe designer, working on ladies’ shoes, and he worked for, initially, as far as I remember, for a Czech shoe factory called Bachia(ph).</span> <span id="s22">This was in the 20s.</span> <span id="s23">But then, with the depression, the factory f-folded up and he went into the leather business, selling supplies to shoe repair shops.</span> <span id="s24">And it was a – I imagine, a-as a child I really didn’t appreciate the – the difficulty that – that it was for him to earn a living, but we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Now, what did your mother do?</span> <span id="s26">Did she stay at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No, she was a housekeeper, and there were three children.</span> <span id="s28">And my grandmother, and of course my parents, we all lived in one apartment.</span> <span id="s29">And the apartment was about a – consisted of about two and a half rooms.</span> <span id="s30">A-And in the bedroom – all six of us slept in that one bedroom.</span> <span id="s31">It was a big bedroom, but I would sleep with my brother, and then that was the custom.</span> <span id="s32">And if we had visitors, by the way, which happened from time to time, people who came from Radom, where they had originally come from, then the two boys, my brother and I would sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s33">Spread out a blanket on the floor, and the guests would stay in the bed.</span> <span id="s34">But that was the custom, and the – we really expected that this would happen, and di-di-didn’t affect us in any way, or didn’t bother us sleeping on the floor, because we slept just as well on the floor as in bed, as – as – as kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What part of Vienna was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well, we lived in the 20th district, known as the Brigittenau, about two blocks from the Danube.</span> <span id="s37">And we lived on the fourth floor, no elevators, no running water in the apartment.</span> <span id="s38">You went out in the hallway, where there was a cold water faucet that you got the water from, and then would bring it in the home, and – and then there was a – a bathroom, it was sort of a – just a – a toilet, which was shared b-between two apartments.</span> <span id="s39">A-And that – and that was the style, an-and that’s all I saw, and any people I came in contact with, they all seemed to have a similar setup except sometimes the apartment was even smaller than ours.</span> <span id="s40">So, there was no – living in the fourth floor, there was no elevator, you walked.</span> <span id="s41">And my grandmother would many times say, oh those steps, they’re killing me.</span> <span id="s42">You see, but at the time I says, you know, I don’t know why she’s complaining, there’s nothing to it.</span> <span id="s43">You know, I could take two steps at a time as a kid, running up and down.</span> <span id="s44">But the last time when I was in Vienna, two years ago, I walked those steps.</span> <span id="s45">The house is still there.</span> <span id="s46">And – and – and I understood what my grandmother was talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So you said that you had siblings.</span> <span id="s48">Can you tell me their names, when they were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yeah, well, my brother was two years older.</span> <span id="s50">His – his name was Benny, and he was born February of – of ’22.</span> <span id="s51">I have a sister born March 8th, ’26.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Lilly.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Did you have an observant family?</span> <span id="s55">What denomination did you belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yeah, ultra-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s57">Ultra-Orthodox, yeah.</span> <span id="s58">Come – come Friday, you know, the light would go off.</span> <span id="s59">And we all, we’d have a light by the Shabbas candle, and we would have no heat, because it’s Shabbas, you know, you have to suffer.</span> <span id="s60">A-And, you know, I remember – of course, you can’t get it on tape, but to show you, my grandmother would sit there, in va – in Vienna it really gets cold, and sh-she would [indecipherable] she’d back and forth, you know, with her – with her feet and arm, trying stay warm.</span> <span id="s61">But, no heat, until Shabbas was over, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So – so what did they – what did your family do for a Shabbat meal, given that there’s no heat?</span> <span id="s63">Did they leave the stove on, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Oh, we had the – a cold – I mean we had – we have a warm meal before going to synagogue on Friday, and on Saturday we had something cold, that didn’t require any – any heating un-until Shabbas was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Which synagogue did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: It was called – well, my father would go to the Kasha(ph) temple.</span> <span id="s67">And I didn’t like to go there, so at first I – he would drag me with him.</span> <span id="s68">And I didn’t like it because I didn’t understand what was going on, and it was stand up and sit down and stand up and sit down and you know, and – and it went on forever.</span> <span id="s69">So I would go to the Klikee(ph) temple.</span> <span id="s70">The Klikee(ph) temple was located on the Klikee(ph) gasse.</span> <span id="s71">Many times in Austria they – they would name the temple after the s – the street that it was located on.</span> <span id="s72">And I liked the – the Klikee(ph) because after services, they would give candy to the kids.</span> <span id="s73">So it was – so naturally that was a big attraction for me, the candy.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Now, when you say ultra-Orthodox, do you – do you mean Hasidic, or – or Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No.</span> <span id="s76">N-No, just ver-very much adherent, but not [indecipherable], no.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: And you say that your family had originally come from Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s79">First my father came.</span> <span id="s80">He came from Radom to – because he was going to be drafted into the Polish army.</span> <span id="s81">He didn’t want to serve in the Polish army, so he ran away.</span> <span id="s82">And he heard about Vienna, so he came to Vienna.</span> <span id="s83">And my mother later f-followed.</span> <span id="s84">And as a matter of fact, she told me once that if – and you want me to say in German?</span> <span id="s85">[speaks German here].</span> <span id="s86">When I arrived in Vienna, I thought I was in heaven.</span> <span id="s87">That’s how different it – living conditions were in Poland, Radom, compared to the modern city of Vienna, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And your – your father was trying to escape being drafted, was that during the run up to the first world war, or when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: No, this was after.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: After?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yeah, this was af –</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So what year did they come to Vienna?</span> <span id="s93">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I’m – I’m not quite – I think my father came there around maybe ’20, and my mother came a year later, ’21 or ’22, something like that.</span> <span id="s95">Many questions tha-that I’m being asked now, I-I wish I had asked.</span> <span id="s96">That’s why when I talk to – to my children, and when I talk to schools, I always urge people – young – young children, to ask their parents while you still have an opportunity, or grandparents, what life was like for them.</span> <span id="s97">Because I know you wi – are going to regret.</span> <span id="s98">We all do, no matter how old, or – or – at the time, but eventually you – you’re going to regret that you did not ask certain questions while you had the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: So they came – both of them came from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yeah, Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did they speak Polish amongst each other, or Yiddish –</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yeah, as a matter of fact, they spoke Yiddish normally, but Polish when they didn’t want us to know what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s103">So they’d switch to Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So you didn’t grow up to – to know Polish, to learn Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s106">We spoke yi – they would speak Yiddish, we would speak German.</span> <span id="s107">So – so I understood what they were saying, but we didn’t really speak Yiddish, w-we spoke German.</span> <span id="s108">The children.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Di-Did your father have to speak German in his business life, or did – could he get by on Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Well, he spoke both.</span> <span id="s111">So whatever the circumstances were, he could respond.</span> <span id="s112">But the – most of the time, the people that he dealt with likewise were immigrants from adjoining countries, because Austria was a more modern place and it offered greater opportunities than smaller countries, I mean – not smaller countries, you know, but – but th – not as advanced countries.</span> <span id="s113">So he would speak – when he dealt with Gentiles, he spoke German, and with Jewish people, yeah, it was always – Yiddish was the international language.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Can you tell me about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s116">I always attended elementary school, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Jewish school, or a state school?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, a state.</span> <span id="s119">Yeah, public school.</span> <span id="s120">Which was very good.</span> <span id="s121">I attended public school, f-four years of elementary, and then we switched over to something called hauptschule, which was a sort of a – I guess in America you’d call it middle school.</span> <span id="s122">And in my case, I – I couldn’t even finish the middle school, because once Hitler came in, none of us were able to attend any school, we were kicked out of school, and – and I sw-switched over to a Jewish school for a while, called Talmud Torah in the second district in Vienna.</span> <span id="s123">The second district was heavily populated by Jewish people, and they used to call it Matzoh Insel.</span> <span id="s124">Matzoh Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So bef – before the annexation, when you’re still able to go to – to a state school, did you take any supplementary, or so-some sort of Jewish classes at the end of the day, or – or on Sundays, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, n-not really.</span> <span id="s127">Only training for Bar Mitzvah, where a year ahead of time, I would sit down with someone, not a rabbi, but one of the Hassids, who would teach me the Torah portion that I was supposed to read at my Bar Mitzvah, which occurred in ’37, actually four months before Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s128">And it happened to be a very momentous occasion in my life.</span> <span id="s129">You might find it funny, my grandmother was at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the Klikee(ph) temple.</span> <span id="s130">Why?</span> <span id="s131">Because the Klikee(ph) temple had an organ.</span> <span id="s132">And having an organ in a temple, that – that was not kosher enough, so she wanted me to have it somewhere else.</span> <span id="s133">But I liked the Klikee(ph) temple, and I was going there.</span> <span id="s134">So I had to tell her that although they have this organ, they never use it.</span> <span id="s135">And the only time they use it was on Sundays when on occasion they have a wedding.</span> <span id="s136">But the mere fact that the organ was there, that was enough reason for her not to particularly enjoy being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Since you went to a non-Jewish school until the annexation, did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s138">What was the distribution of Jews to non-Jews in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: In – from grade one, I experienced anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s140">Six years old, I go into grade one, another kid – they find out very soon whether you’re Christian or not, even at six.</span> <span id="s141">And he called me a Christ killer, and you know, I didn’t know what that was.</span> <span id="s142">I said – you know, what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s143">And – and it was not – when I came home, I asked my mother.</span> <span id="s144">And she said, oh, pay no attention, or this is something that they’re – where they’re taught at home not to like certain people, but you’re gonna hear this, just – h-he doesn’t know what he’s saying, so just forget about it.</span> <span id="s145">But you mean – you very soon learn.</span> <span id="s146">Later on actually, we would frequently have fights, wh-which – which occurred mainly when the priests came to school, and started showing movies.</span> <span id="s147">And it dealt – you saw people with beards, and – and th-the payos and so forth, so you knew that – and they showed the crucifixion.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Do you remember what grade this was?</span> <span id="s149">How old were you when these movies started to be shown?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I think I – I probably was around eight or nine, a-an-and – and when class lets out, then we started fights.</span> <span id="s151">And many a day I’d come home with a bloody nose because at that time, when somebody hit you, you – you struck back.</span> <span id="s152">And I was never hesitant, so it’s oh – you know, even as I went on to middle school, you know, I – somebody said something to me, called me a dirty Jew, you know, I’d let him have it.</span> <span id="s153">And you learn that if it’s one person, you take him on, but if there’s a group, I figured I’d better run.</span> <span id="s154">But I was never scared, al-although my mother in particular always told me not to get involved, or – or – you know, walk away, run away, but I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: How did your father feel about this?</span> <span id="s156">Did he have an opinion about confrontation, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I was always scared to tell my father, because – because he was the enforcer, you see, so I dealt mostly with my mother.</span> <span id="s158">I – I had a mean – when I was – and – and also, many times, I – I admit, I didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s159">I – I was – my mother would say, a reckless person.</span> <span id="s160">In the summer of ’34, I asked my mother if I could go swimming.</span> <span id="s161">And I loved swimming, even as a child, you know.</span> <span id="s162">And she said no, you stay home.</span> <span id="s163">So I said to – okay, well, can I go downstairs, you know, be on the street?</span> <span id="s164">All right, be on the street, but I want you home before too long.</span> <span id="s165">So I sai-said fine.</span> <span id="s166">So, I ran downstairs with my bathing suit to go swimming, that she had told me not to do.</span> <span id="s167">And I – in my eagerness to cross the street, didn’t look, and I was hit by a truck.</span> <span id="s168">And I had several fractures and lacerations and concussion and spent three months in the hospital.</span> <span id="s169">That was an important lesson.</span> <span id="s170">But being somewhat reckless, rising to whatever challenge that came along, has always been a part of me.</span> <span id="s171">I-I was, to some extent, not to make myself some sort of a hero, I was always aggressive.</span> <span id="s172">And sometimes it got me into trouble, but it never changed my mind.</span> <span id="s173">This was in ’34.</span> <span id="s174">I have another event in ’37, when – wh-which had a great impact on my life.</span> <span id="s175">There were three boys, and we were walking along the Danube [indecipherable] only a three or four minute walk from where we lived, so – and this was in the winter of ’37, late October, when, as we’re walking along, we notice something bobbing up and down in the wa – in the water, and we didn’t know at first what it was.</span> <span id="s176">And then we recognized that this was a person, you know, what is she doing in the water?</span> <span id="s177">So – so it dawned on us that this person is about to drown.</span> <span id="s178">So two of us ran down the embankment and jumped into the water.</span> <span id="s179">I was 13 – not quite 13, and my friend was not quite 15.</span> <span id="s180">And the third person ran to get the police.</span> <span id="s181">So, if you know anything about the Danube, and I know, since you are from Hungary, you know the Danube, it’s a very swift river.</span> <span id="s182">You’re not going to swim against the current, you just can’t, it just knocks you down.</span> <span id="s183">So – so if you go in here, you’re gonna come out way, way down on the other side.</span> <span id="s184">So after a while we – we struggled, but we were able to get her to th-the embankment and – and ou-out of the water.</span> <span id="s185">And by that time, the third person had run to get the police, and when we got to – when we got her out to the side o-of the river, the police was there, and the ambulance was there.</span> <span id="s186">And they picked her up and th – it was a woman, and they took her away.</span> <span id="s187">And then the police took the two of us to the police station.</span> <span id="s188">And there they gave us some hot chocolate and d-dry out.</span> <span id="s189">And a man came and started questioning us and then he took a picture.</span> <span id="s190">And we paid no attention as to who he was, or what was up, what – we were there several hours, and then they said to us, oh, now you can go home.</span> <span id="s191">So I went home, and I ha – I hate to describe to you what took place when I got home.</span> <span id="s192">First of all, it was Friday evening, and I’m supposed to go with my father to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s193">And I wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s194">And, where were you?</span> <span id="s195">[indecipherable] So, I was so scared to tell what happened to – to my mother, so I said, do you know what?</span> <span id="s196">We were playing by the water, and I fell in.</span> <span id="s197">Then came, how many times have I told you to stay away from the water?</span> <span id="s198">When are you finally going to listen, and so forth.</span> <span id="s199">And – and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand, you know, n-no food, you know, we’re not going to give you anything.</span> <span id="s200">And of course I – I was so disheveled, you know, and tha – look – looked terrible.</span> <span id="s201">A-And it wasn’t until the next day, when people stopped my mother on the street and started congratulating her, and she didn’t know what for.</span> <span id="s202">And then she found out that there had been a picture in the newspaper, which described what had taken place.</span> <span id="s203">And then she came back and started questioning, what – what really happened, you see, so sh-she was of two – two – two different feelings.</span> <span id="s204">In the one, she says, do you realize how dangerous it was for you, what you did?</span> <span id="s205">A-And, this was very reckless.</span> <span id="s206">And the other way she – she was proud that I had participated in – in saving a person.</span> <span id="s207">But th-the recklessness was a major factor, that you would go to such an extreme, which was very, very unusual.</span> <span id="s208">And by the way, I have a picture here, as it appeared in a newspaper, blew up and I’ll – I’ll show it to you later; and also comments that were about me specifically.</span> <span id="s209">It just so happened that this particular event became a bone of contention between the Austrian more or less public press, which for the most part was anti-Semitic, and the Jewish press, an-and the Jewish publications, who took the German newspapers to task.</span> <span id="s210">It – it just so happened that the two boys who jumped into the water were Jewish.</span> <span id="s211">The boy who ran to get the police was Gentile.</span> <span id="s212">It never occurred to us that this would ever be a problem, but it was a big bone of contention, a big discussion.</span> <span id="s213">The – I mean, in particular th-the Jewish press, because the Jewi – the Jews were always characterized as being cowards.</span> <span id="s214">Jews – Jews didn’t want to be in the military, and Jews were afraid and – and unreliable, and – and they’re not really Austrian and so forth, and – but here was an example where two Jewish boys jumped in the water.</span> <span id="s215">We didn’t hesitate, we didn’t ask who it was, we didn’t ask what religion she was.</span> <span id="s216">We just acted because we – we felt we – we should do something, you see?</span> <span id="s217">And I have various correspondence which refers to that particular event, in – in several organizations who got involved.</span> <span id="s218">This was in October or – late October of 1937.</span> <span id="s219">One month later I had my Bar Mitzvah, and at the Bar Mitzvah there was a lot of congratulation, because this was only a month later, and the Kultusgemeinde – the Kultusgemeinde, it’s called a cultural association, but really it’s not a cultural association, i-it was a sort of a semi-government authority for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s220">And every Jew in Austria had to deal with the Kultusgemeinde at least three times in their lives.</span> <span id="s221">The Kultusgemeinde issued the birth certificate, the marriage certificate and the death certificate.</span> <span id="s222">So – so every Jew had to register with the Kultusgemeinde, which later on also turned out to be a detriment for the Jewish people, because when the Nazis came in and wanted a list, all they had to do is go to the Kultusgemeinde and have a list of any – of a Jew living anywhere in the city.</span> <span id="s223">So at that time the Kultusgemeinde representative came to the temple, and th-they gave me a di-diploma of recognition for what I had done, and – and also a watch.</span> <span id="s224">And this was the first watch that I had ever owned, so – so to me that – that was a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: You mentioned that there was a point of contention between the Jewish press and the mainstream press, and then you gave some great background about how Jews had been perceived, and – and obviously you being part of this heroic act was kind of going counter to the prevailing notion of – of how a Jew would act.</span> <span id="s226">But I’m curious exactly how the Jewish press was making use of this.</span> <span id="s227">What were they saying, and what was – what was the conversation between the two presses?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Mostly it – it dealt – they were attacking the press for their attitude toward Jews, the reason for their hostility to Jews, and their idiocy as pertaining anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s229">And their failure to recognize what we had done.</span> <span id="s230">The majority of press had nothing, no comment whatsoever.</span> <span id="s231">There was only one particular newspaper, it’s called “Das Kleine Blatt,” which carried a small picture of the two of us, and – and our age, and our name, and one paragra – one sentence, actually; and that was it.</span> <span id="s232">An-And no other publication – public – publication, who certainly at that time in the country, if it had been anybody else, it would have been played up big, you see?</span> <span id="s233">So, it’s interesting, no attention was – was paid to it.</span> <span id="s234">Forty – 40 years later, my son, who was working in Congress, and I had just given an interview in Norfolk, Virginia, where I was living at the time, and they wrote up the experience that I had, and my – my background and so forth.</span> <span id="s235">And when he read it, h-he showed it to the congressman.</span> <span id="s236">And congressman was Whitehurst from Norfolk.</span> <span id="s237">He says well – well, we’ve got to do something, this is not right.</span> <span id="s238">So he wrote a letter to the ambassador, giving him a – a copy of the article in the newspaper, and that I had never received any recognition.</span> <span id="s239">So the ambassador at that time was Thomas Klestil.</span> <span id="s240">Thomas Klestil went on from the embassy, the ambassador being there in Washington, to become the foreign minister of Austria.</span> <span id="s241">And then, from the foreign ministry, became the president of Austria.</span> <span id="s242">So the ambassador said that he had never heard of this, but he was going to investigate.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: How old was the ambassador?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I don’t know how old he was.</span> <span id="s245">I – I suppose he was in his 40s, you know.</span> <span id="s246">But he would investigate, and it was maybe a couple of months later he came back and said yes, we have a record of this.</span> <span id="s247">And they arranged a reception for me, and I met the ambassador, and he asked me if I would be willing to come back at the government’s invitation to Austria, they want to honor me.</span> <span id="s248">And eventually I was given a gold medal for heroism, 40 years after the event.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So this would have happened in the 70s and the 80s?</span> <span id="s250">When did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I-It probably – I – I don’t have the – th-the date now.</span> <span id="s252">It – probably in the 70s.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: That’s a fascinating story.</span> <span id="s254">He –</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: It was a – let’s see now, I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s256">Yeah, ’78 maybe, something like that.</span> <span id="s257">But this is not the end of the story.</span> <span id="s258">When Hitler came in, as soon as Hitler and the Nazis took over in Austria, my mother was the driving force.</span> <span id="s259">She felt that we could not possibly stay on in Austria, we had to get out.</span> <span id="s260">But there were many people at first, when Hitler came in that says, well, you know what’s going on, the – you know, with the plundering of shops and the beating up of Jewish people, and people s-stationing themselves, Nazi personnel in uniform stationing them – in front of Jewish shops, from – not to let anybody in.</span> <span id="s261">I mean, not to let any Gentiles in to – to patronize the Jewish shops.</span> <span id="s262">They recognized right away that we cannot live – go on living in Austria, we had to get out.</span> <span id="s263">So she wrote the letter to, you know, who – who do you write?</span> <span id="s264">A cousin of a cousin of a cousin that yo – she once heard of, and so forth.</span> <span id="s265">But she wrote a letter and she described our plight, that my –</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Where was this cousin?</span> <span id="s267">In the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yeah, lived in Baltimore, a-and whether or not he would be willing to send an affidavit, and then she asked for an affidavit for my father and my brother, and she – and at that time she felt, you know, let me get the men out.</span> <span id="s269">You know, th – nobody’s going to touch the women, and you know, and children and such, you know, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Is this still 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: This was ’38, yes.</span> <span id="s272">Probably as early as April ’38.</span> <span id="s273">Hitler came in in March, 13th, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: I’m sorry to cut you off all the time, but I’m very interested in this progression.</span> <span id="s275">So your mother realizes pretty much immediately that there’s danger.</span> <span id="s276">So I’m curious about the years ’33 through ’38.</span> <span id="s277">How are your parents, or adults around you, reacting to what was happening in Germany?</span> <span id="s278">Did they talk about it at all?</span> <span id="s279">Were you aware of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes, they talked about it.</span> <span id="s281">And – and we knew about it, but we felt that the Austrians are very patriotic, and oh, we are social democrats, and oh – no, Austria’s not going to become involved, you know – you know, this is Germany.</span> <span id="s282">And communications at that time were not what they are today.</span> <span id="s283">So whatever was written in the paper and so forth, i-it was like a different world, going from one country to the other.</span> <span id="s284">You – you – actually, you couldn’t go, un-unless you – you had to have visas.</span> <span id="s285">You ri – you – you can go to – to Hungary in an hour and a half, I’m in – in – today I’m in Hungary.</span> <span id="s286">Not in those days.</span> <span id="s287">You had to have a – a visa or – to leave, and a visa to enter, a-and it was – you had to have a passport, and it was a complicated affair, you know, and – and transportation was not what it is today.</span> <span id="s288">I mean, for me, as a – as – as a child, it w – it was a big deal to – to get on a bus, and to – and to – and to get on a streetcar.</span> <span id="s289">Oh, oh, that was an exciting event.</span> <span id="s290">As a matter of fact, somebody asked me once, how old were you when you first rode in a passenger automobile?</span> <span id="s291">And the first time I rode in a passenger automobile, I-I was a-around 16 years old, in – in London.</span> <span id="s292">In London, trying to take a taxi to – to the train station.</span> <span id="s293">That was in 1940, you know, and – and I’d never ridden in a – in taxi before, but this was the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: W-Well, had you taken like a fiaker, you – you were taking horse-drawn buggies, or there was absolutely no –</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: N-N-N-No, you – you took a – first of all, the first means of transportation was to walk, you see, that was custom, the – no matter how far it was, you walked.</span> <span id="s296">A-And aside from walking, you took the streetcar.</span> <span id="s297">And if you – buses were not available, except if you wanted to leave the city, that’s where they had buses.</span> <span id="s298">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you ever bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I didn’t have a bicycle, no.</span> <span id="s301">Because if I had a bicycle, I’d have to drag it up four f – four floors of steps.</span> <span id="s302">And I-I think that my parents would have been more concerned with safety, e-even then, because the – th-they knew that I probably would use the bike to go to areas where they wouldn’t want me to go.</span> <span id="s303">Where there’s maybe some traffic and so forth.</span> <span id="s304">So most of the time I-I just walked.</span> <span id="s305">I walked to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: How long did it take to walk to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, the public school was around the corner, the elementary school.</span> <span id="s308">And the other one was a little further, m-maybe a 15 minute walk.</span> <span id="s309">Now, when I went in Talmud Torah School, sometimes I’d see a horse-driven wagon, and we would jump on that, and when the – when the driver was – wasn’t looking, you know.</span> <span id="s310">So I’d jump on it and – and take a ride with him, and then jump off.</span> <span id="s311">Which too was not that safe.</span> <span id="s312">But that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So amongst your siblings, were you – were you the – th-the little devil?</span> <span id="s314">The one who always got into trouble, or was your brother similar?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No, no, he was very conservative.</span> <span id="s316">I – I was the trouble maker.</span> <span id="s317">I – I don’t know why, but the – I’ve done that throughout my life, you know, army service, I did things that – on reflection now, when I think back I says, oh my God, that was dumb.</span> <span id="s318">And working – I’m a pharmacist and we – we – we had our own business in Norfolk, Virginia, and in the 80s, I experienced two hold-ups, and had a gun to my head twice, you know, and you know, people would say, well, were you scared, and so forth.</span> <span id="s319">I say, yes, of course I – I was scared, but – but it – but one thing I can tell you, I did not panic.</span> <span id="s320">Of course, you know, I’m skipping the story back and forth, maybe.</span> <span id="s321">So – so the first time that I had a gun to my head, it was by two black men, and they wanted Talwin, which mimics opium, but it wasn’t even a narcotic, and I was astonished when they asked for it, you see.</span> <span id="s322">But then he asked for my wallet, so I gave him my wallet.</span> <span id="s323">Then he said to me, kneel down.</span> <span id="s324">And I said to him, if you’re going to shoot me, you’re going to have to look at me, I’m not kneeling.</span> <span id="s325">And he says – and he says, all right.</span> <span id="s326">And he turned around and walked – and ran out.</span> <span id="s327">By the way, he got shot and killed two days later, trying to rob another pharmacy.</span> <span id="s328">The second time maybe was – maybe three – three weeks later, and this time it was by two whites.</span> <span id="s329">And they were more knowledgeable, they were prepared.</span> <span id="s330">They came with an empty pillowcase, and they knew – they probably had shopped us, and they knew where I kept the narcotics.</span> <span id="s331">So – so they wanted the morphine, and the Dilaudid and the Demerol, and the codeine and opium and so forth that we had; so they got all of that.</span> <span id="s332">And then, you know, he’s holding a pistol, while the other one is loading up on – on whatever we had in narcotics.</span> <span id="s333">And then he said to me, ge – let me have your wallet.</span> <span id="s334">So I said to him, let me – I says, give me – give you my wallet?</span> <span id="s335">I says, do you realize what problems that is?</span> <span id="s336">I says, I gotta run here and there to get new identification and new driver’s license.</span> <span id="s337">I got to stop all the credit cards, I says, it’s a whole lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s338">And so he says, all right, keep the wallet.</span> <span id="s339">And people couldn’t believe, you – you actually did that?</span> <span id="s340">I says, yes.</span> <span id="s341">So, I – I – throughout life, I don’t panic.</span> <span id="s342">I-I size up the situation a-as to what I need to do and – and act accordingly.</span> <span id="s343">And – and I feel that when you panic, then many times the person who is the aggressor, will also panic, and then you don’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s344">People would ask me, they would – found it strange that the first time that you were held up, you had two blacks, right?</span> <span id="s345">Yeah.</span> <span id="s346">And the second time it was two whites?</span> <span id="s347">Yeah.</span> <span id="s348">Don’t you find it strange?</span> <span id="s349">I says, no, I says, my – my pharmacy was an equal opportunity pharmacy.</span> <span id="s350">So – so they – they would laugh, it was fun.</span> <span id="s351">But after that, I hired the police to come in and – an-and they were – every – every afternoon and evening I would have police in – in the pharmacy, and my sons urged me, you know, it’s time to get out.</span> <span id="s352">You know, you – you can’t keep this up.</span> <span id="s353">Because it was true, because you – you become apprehensive that every time the door opens, you don’t know who is coming in.</span> <span id="s354">And the problem with drugs today in America is so – so pervasive, that you just don’t know what to anticipate.</span> <span id="s355">A-And you live and work in a form of tension.</span> <span id="s356">So although I was only 59 at the time, I – I decided to call it quits.</span> <span id="s357">I sold the pharmacy and retired at 59.</span> <span id="s358">And I took a three month vacation, you know, traveled to Europe; your country, Hungary, I was there for about a month.</span> <span id="s359">Enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s360">A-And when I came back I was restless and didn’t know what to do, so I went to work for the navy, the navy hospital in the – as a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s361">And I worked until the 90s a-and then I quit a-and stopped working.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Well, now we’ve gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Let’s go back to Vienna, and – and I – I was very curious about one thing.</span> <span id="s365">You said that during the – this heroic rescue, you had one friend with you who was non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s366">Did you have many non-Jewish friends, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: No.</span> <span id="s369">Was he the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s371">He happened to live on the floor below us.</span> <span id="s372">And it was interesting that when Hitler came in, although we were very close friends, he stopped me on the stairways one day, and he told me that Herbert, you understand that we can’t be friends any longer.</span> <span id="s373">So I said yes, I understand.</span> <span id="s374">An-And that was the end, I thought.</span> <span id="s375">A couple days later, we meet up again on the steps, and th – he stopped me, and he said, would I do him a favor?</span> <span id="s376">I says, what – what is it you – you want?</span> <span id="s377">He says, well, I need a pair of white socks, and I know you have some.</span> <span id="s378">Would you loan me your white socks?</span> <span id="s379">So I said, well, why do you need my white socks?</span> <span id="s380">He says, well, he says, you know, he says, I belong to the Hitlerjugend, and white socks are part of the uniform.</span> <span id="s381">And I was told to stand downstairs in front of Herr Gros’(ph) shop, to make sure that no Christian people go in.</span> <span id="s382">So I need the socks.</span> <span id="s383">So I – his name was Bertie.</span> <span id="s384">So I said, Bertie, I – I – I have no idea where the socks are, or if I still have them.</span> <span id="s385">I don’t – I don’t think that I have it.</span> <span id="s386">And maybe he understood that – what I was saying, but I – I gave him no socks.</span> <span id="s387">But as close a friend we were, overnight, Hitlerjugend, y-you know – you know.</span> <span id="s388">And this was the biggest surprise that I had, that the – the very same people who lived with you in – in the house, an-a-and knew the family and – and guten tag and guten naft(ph) and this and that an-and they’re friendly, and suddenly yo – tell you they have been in the underground f-for years, under – as Nazis.</span> <span id="s389">And this is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s390">I remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Th-They told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yeah, when Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s393">They said, yeah, we been in underground.</span> <span id="s394">I remember a neighbor came in that we were very friendly with – as a matter of fact, the family – they were a tailor, and my folks wanted to have a – a big table when they had the reception after the Bar Mitzvah, th – in our apartment.</span> <span id="s395">They didn’t have a big enough table so we – so they loaned us the – that – their work table where they made suits or coats or whatever the – a tailor does.</span> <span id="s396">So – so – so the woman came over, Frau Bodichka(ph), and she’s friends with my mother a-and she’s saying to my mother, you have nothing to fear.</span> <span id="s397">Yo-You are good Jews.</span> <span id="s398">Nobody’s going to touch you.</span> <span id="s399">But, she says, maybe the people who live across the street, she says, maybe they got it coming to them.</span> <span id="s400">And as young as I was at the time, you know, just 13 years old, I said – I says, how do I know that the people across the street aren’t saying the same thing about us?</span> <span id="s401">You see, but wa – one thing that I-I later became aware of, that i-if I was 13, it was just a number.</span> <span id="s402">I really overnight became an adult.</span> <span id="s403">A-And you recognize right away that things are not going to be the way they were.</span> <span id="s404">And for instance, when my mother had written to America, to distant cousins for an affidavit, they responded and were willing to send the affidavit.</span> <span id="s405">But I was going to be there, wi – stay in Vienna.</span> <span id="s406">And I felt I was ju – in as much – in as much danger as anybody else.</span> <span id="s407">And there was a Jewish boy across the str-street, Teddy Katz, he told me one day, let’s run away.</span> <span id="s408">Don’t say anything to anybody, we’ll run away.</span> <span id="s409">I says, where do you want to run?</span> <span id="s410">He says, well, we’ll go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s411">I says, who do we know in Czechoslovakia?</span> <span id="s412">I says, ha – I says, we have no money.</span> <span id="s413">I says – I says re – we gonna cross the border illegally?</span> <span id="s414">Yes.</span> <span id="s415">I says, when we get there, then what?</span> <span id="s416">So, I said no, I – I – it just doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s417">But I wanted to get out, so I had registered with what was known then as the Palestina(ph) office, the Pales-Palestine office, for aliyah.</span> <span id="s418">But – but I didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s419">So I deci –</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I – I’m sorry to cut you off again, but this is another point that I’m particularly interested in.</span> <span id="s421">What was your family’s relationship to Zionism as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: So, registering with the Palestina(ph) office, this was something completely new?</span> <span id="s424">It hadn’t been in your mind before?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Oh, no, I had no intention of going to Palestine, or – for the most part, you know, life was okay.</span> <span id="s426">You know, it’s – it’s our country, you know, I’m Austrian.</span> <span id="s427">I was very patriotic, you know, because it’s drilled into you in school, you know, and you know, Austria, our homeland and the Austrian history, Austrian-Hungarian empire, the Kaiser and so forth, so – so – the imperial Austria, oh we – we stopped the – the Turks when they attacked and – and if you go downs – downtown in the first district, you can see where the – the last shell is still imbedded in – in the concrete and so forth.</span> <span id="s428">S-So Austrians are quite patriotic.</span> <span id="s429">But th – I felt that I was in danger, and I wanted to get out of the country, especially after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s430">On Kristallnacht, after the assassination of the diplomat in Paris, and with Hershel Grynszpan, who shot the embassy personnel in – in Paris.</span> <span id="s431">It wasn’t ambassador, but the – an assistant to the ambassador, whatever his position was, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s432">But I knew that something was going to happen, that there would be revenge.</span> <span id="s433">I mean, I-I just – you – you could almost smell it in the air, that something was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: This is November ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: But the annexation happened –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: In March.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: – at the beginning of that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: In March.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Ca-Can you tell me whether – how things were going in th – in that six month period, leading up to Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s441">How many things were changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well, I can tell you I – I was a – a member of the Hakura(ph) swim team.</span> <span id="s443">Hakura(ph) means strength.</span> <span id="s444">And I was member of the swim team.</span> <span id="s445">On March the 10th, I believe it was a Thursday, I had just gone there for a practice session.</span> <span id="s446">When I walked out, I saw a large mass of people, and were yelling and screaming, and as – as a kid I’m – I’m always attracted to something that – that’s different as a – I want to know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s447">So – so I approached them, that was only across the street from Dianabad(ph).</span> <span id="s448">I don’t know if you’re acquainted with Vienna or not.</span> <span id="s449">So, if you cross the street you come to Schwedenzplatz(ph), so – so there they had a big demonstration.</span> <span id="s450">Gra – a great mass of people, with this social democratic flag and whatnot.</span> <span id="s451">And on – and the police standing in front of me.</span> <span id="s452">And on the other side, a small group of Nazis, and yelling at each other, and so forth.</span> <span id="s453">This was Thursday.</span> <span id="s454">And on Sunday we’re gonna have a plevicide whether or not Austria wants to join with Hitler.</span> <span id="s455">This wa – this was by order of the chancellor of Austria, Schuschnigg, Kurt Schuschnigg.</span> <span id="s456">So when I saw that, I says oh, Austrians will never vote for Hitler.</span> <span id="s457">As I – so as – I really wasn’t concerned until the next evening, when over the radio, suddenly I heard that the plevicide had been cancelled, and the government had abdicated, and new people were coming to – into government, and they were all Nazi officials.</span> <span id="s458">I says – then I recognized re – this does not sound good.</span> <span id="s459">Something is gonna happen.</span> <span id="s460">And it – and true enough, why – on Sunday, German troops marched in, and announce a gov – overthrew the government, and we – we were part of Germany.</span> <span id="s461">We had been annexed, or anschluss.</span> <span id="s462">And this – and suddenly we’re oven – over-overnight we’re pri – night, I was confident that Austria would never become part of Germany, suddenly e-everyone – everyone that you met wu – seemingly seemed to be connected to – with the Nazi party all along, in the underground [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s463">And everybody ha-had this – the armband on with the Nazi insignia, and flags all over the city, and I couldn’t understand how suddenly people that I – I felt if you give them the chance to vote would have voted against the Nazis, now everybody seemed to be for it.</span> <span id="s464">The – the cardinal of Austria, Innitzer, welcomed Hitler as, you know, the native son returning to his country and so forth, and – and it seemed so unbelievable, how overnight something as dramatic a-as a – as giving away everything and becoming a devoted Nazi, a-and the Jewish people going to be the target, you see, because we heard it con-consistently, with the editor of the newspapers, or ev – ev – everything became pro-Nazis, a-and you saw no opposition whatsoever.</span> <span id="s465">Everybody was for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s466">And the people were f-for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s467">Either that, or afraid, because seemingly 100 percent were not necessarily in favor of what was taking place, but it seemed to be the vast majority were.</span> <span id="s468">And the plundering took place, and the beating took place and the dem – the humiliation took place, you know, all the graffiti that had been anti-Nazi – they take elderly Jewish people, and sometimes religious people, whoever they were, peop-people of recognition, professional people, you know, and would humiliate them, give him a toothbrush and tell him to scrub the streets and so forth, and spit at them and make fun.</span> <span id="s469">And the people would stand around and laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: And this is still the run-up to Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah, before.</span> <span id="s474">Could – could we stop one second?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I-I want to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s478">Stop the track.</span> <span id="s479">[break] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Where wer – where are we now?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: We are at the preceding events that are leading up to Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: On Kristallnacht, no – November nine, we saw what was going on on the street, that the shops are being plundered, a-and the Jewish people are – on the street were being beaten up, so you’re afraid to – as to what may happen.</span> <span id="s483">And the greatest fear was to hear the knock on the door.</span> <span id="s484">When you – when you heard that knock on the door, we froze.</span> <span id="s485">And I could see the expression on my – my father and my mother’s face, and I – and I knew they – they were scared.</span> <span id="s486">And it passes onto the children when you – wh-when they see that the – the parents are – are frightened.</span> <span id="s487">And the – there’s a knock on the door and the order, open up.</span> <span id="s488">So, we opened up the door, and to – two uniformed SA people walked in, one a little older tha-than the other one.</span> <span id="s489">The other one licked – looked to be sa – someone maybe 18 or 19 years old, something like that.</span> <span id="s490">And they demanded to see my brother, specifically asking for ba – for him by his name, but he was not home.</span> <span id="s491">So they didn’t believe it, so they went through the apartment, searching for him, and he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s492">So, since he wasn’t there, one of them, the elderly one said, we’ll take him, pointing to me.</span> <span id="s493">And it was then that my mother started pleading and crying, saying he is only a little boy, he hasn’t done anything, and please leave him alone, you know – you know, just begging him.</span> <span id="s494">And – and it was then that the younger SA man said, it wasn’t him.</span> <span id="s495">Tha-That’s it, it wasn’t him.</span> <span id="s496">And they said oh – okay, we’ll come back in a little while.</span> <span id="s497">So, when I heard it wasn’t him, a-as I – I surmised that maybe my brother had gotten into a fight, and now was the time to get even, you see.</span> <span id="s498">And the mere fact that it wasn’t him, saved me.</span> <span id="s499">And because my mother, as soon as they left, told me to run downstairs and intercept my brother from coming home, and telling him to stay with a friend, not to come home.</span> <span id="s500">And – and then she sent me to tell my uncle not to go home, and to stay with his mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s501">That was interesting too, and h-he – he told me later on, that they came to his mother-in-law’s home, you know, everybody knew already where most likely somebody would – would go if you want to pick him up.</span> <span id="s502">And when he heard the knock on the door, he crawled under the table, and the table had a long tablecloth.</span> <span id="s503">So they were searching the house, the – the apartment that they lived in, and they didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s504">And they were pounding the table, saying well, you be sure to – to let us know as soon as he comes here.</span> <span id="s505">Well, he was under the table.</span> <span id="s506">He survived.</span> <span id="s507">His wife and his son did not survive.</span> <span id="s508">But i-it was, th-the following day, on the 10th of November, when I wa – was on my way to go to the Palestina(ph) office to check on the – on my aliyah, which is immigration to then known Palestine or Israel.</span> <span id="s509">When I came downstairs, I saw a – a big truck and a lot of people around the truck jeering and laughing and enjoying themselves.</span> <span id="s510">And the police is there also, just standing there.</span> <span id="s511">And I was wondering what the heck is going on here, what’s it all about, you know?</span> <span id="s512">And – and the house right next door to us, there was a shop, a shop carrying bedding equipment, blankets and pillows and pillowcases and towels and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s513">And I noticed that they were carrying stuff out from the shop, and putting it on the truck.</span> <span id="s514">Well, you recognize right away, it doesn’t take long, as to what’s going on.</span> <span id="s515">They’re just confiscating whatever goods he has and putting it on the truck.</span> <span id="s516">And then I saw the owner standing there beside the – the shop.</span> <span id="s517">Hi-His name was shp – H-Herr Schpringer(ph).</span> <span id="s518">A Mr. Schpringer(ph).</span> <span id="s519">A-And he’s white-faced, scared.</span> <span id="s520">And when they had just about emptied the shop, Mr. – Herr Schpringer(ph), being a business man, walks up to the head honcho Nazi there, and asks for a receipt.</span> <span id="s521">And th-the storm trooper turned around and yelled to the crowd, Herr Schpringer(ph) wants a receipt.</span> <span id="s522">And everybody starts laughing and cheering and screaming.</span> <span id="s523">And then he grabs Schpringer(ph) by the neck, the collar of his neck, and turned him around and gave him a kick in the rear, and Schpringer(ph) fell down on the pavement.</span> <span id="s524">And he said, here Jew, this is your receipt.</span> <span id="s525">I – I witnessed that.</span> <span id="s526">A-And I-I felt that even going to the aliyah office may not be such a good idea.</span> <span id="s527">I says – so I decided to go to the home of the chief rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Now, let me cut you off once again, cause this is very interesting, the dynamics of this.</span> <span id="s529">You’re witnessing this, does that mean you’re a part of the crowd?</span> <span id="s530">Where are you standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Just standing be – not part.</span> <span id="s532">I’m standing ba – little distance away, y-you know, maybe – but I’m a – nobody’s paying any attention to me, you see, I’m just a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: So you didn’t feel like you were in danger of being recognized as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Y-Y-You know – you know, a-again, I-I did things a-as a kid, that when I reflect now, I says, this was really stupid.</span> <span id="s535">I mean th – I had no awareness.</span> <span id="s536">I – spontaneous response to different things.</span> <span id="s537">For instance, if I told you I saw Eichmann, and asked him to put a country on my passport, it’s only years later that I even became aware who he was.</span> <span id="s538">I had no idea Eichmann, I never heard of him.</span> <span id="s539">But I went to – to the Rothschild palace, which was the Nazi headquarters, and I walked in there – well, when you walk in there, everything is heil Hitler, you know, an-and I’m not going to come in and say heil Hitler, so wha-what am I going to say?</span> <span id="s540">Grüss gott.</span> <span id="s541">Which was the way we normally greeted each other, grüss gott, and – greet God.</span> <span id="s542">And – and everybody looks up, you know, what’s this Jewish kid doing here?</span> <span id="s543">You see, so I asked – when Eichmann asked me what it is I want, and I told him, I need to get a country entered – because I ca – I can’t remember exactly what – you had to choose on the passport what country you n – had to have on the passport.</span> <span id="s544">And if it wasn’t listed, then you couldn’t go to that country.</span> <span id="s545">And England wasn’t listed.</span> <span id="s546">I never thought of going to England.</span> <span id="s547">And so of course, this is somewhat later.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: So I’m going to stop the track right now, we’re going to switch tracks, one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Beginning File Three</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: All right, we’re on track three.</span> <span id="s552">So, let – let me just stop you, and – in terms of the chronology.</span> <span id="s553">So you –</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yeah, because – because I’m – I’m not t-telling you step by step.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Well, this is very exciting, but – but I – I just – I want to get my bearings in the story.</span> <span id="s556">So you witness Herr Schpringer being brutalized, and you decide that maybe you should go to the Palestina(ph) organization, but then –</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Oh, orig – originally had planned to go, th-then I said to myself, no, no, this may be too dangerous.</span> <span id="s558">So – so I went to – actually, it wasn’t that night either, on recollection.</span> <span id="s559">I – I went – I did go to the aliyah office.</span> <span id="s560">I’m sorry, I had to correct myself.</span> <span id="s561">I went to the aliyah office, a-and when I came there, it was packed with people; men and women.</span> <span id="s562">And I wasn’t there very long when the SS showed up, and they sent men to one side, and the women and children to the other side.</span> <span id="s563">And I had had my Bar Mitzvah, so it came up to me to decide which side should I go on?</span> <span id="s564">And I felt that maybe I better play it safe.</span> <span id="s565">So I decided to go with the women, although you know, people who had had their Bar Mitzvah, they regard themselves already as men.</span> <span id="s566">But, you know, I – I says, I – I better play it safe.</span> <span id="s567">And it wasn’t very long thereafter, when we had separated and we were in different rooms, that all the men were taken away by truck.</span> <span id="s568">And later on I learned that they had been taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s569">Had I stayed with the men, I would have wound up in Dachau, but I was with the women.</span> <span id="s570">So they kept us there for an hour, an hour and a half, til they decided what to do with us, what – they let us go.</span> <span id="s571">And here again comes the recklessness.</span> <span id="s572">They let us go, and I’m going out on the s – from the building.</span> <span id="s573">So I thought that more and more men will be coming to the building, and they’re gonna get arrested, and maybe I ought to warn them.</span> <span id="s574">But in back of me, there’s an SS man, right in the building.</span> <span id="s575">If you’ve been to Vienna, I am – the building is still there, and it’s not far – the Hotel Metropol was Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s576">It’s only one block away.</span> <span id="s577">And maybe two blocks away is the Kultusgemeinde on the Juden – on the Judengasse.</span> <span id="s578">So this was in the – on the – on the Aurelia street, you see, which on – only short walk where the aliyah office was.</span> <span id="s579">Years later I took my wife there and I showed her where it was.</span> <span id="s580">A-And so I stood at the edge of the – the pavement – pedes – pedestrian pavement, not the street, and as men were approaching me to go into the building, I would turn my head away and say, don’t go in, Gestapo.</span> <span id="s581">And invariably, they would say, what did you say?</span> <span id="s582">And I would repeat, you know, but not looking directly at him, as if I – but the Gestapo in back of me was a trooper, noticed that people were coming up to me and turned around and walking away.</span> <span id="s583">So a-after three or four had done this, he comes out and yells for me to come back.</span> <span id="s584">And he wants to know, what did you say to the men?</span> <span id="s585">Was hast du gesagt?</span> <span id="s586">I says, I didn’t say anything, I – I – I – I – I said I – oh, you said something.</span> <span id="s587">I said, the only thing I said was I was here for some time and I just got out.</span> <span id="s588">That I waited a long time, but I just got out.</span> <span id="s589">That’s not what you said, tell me what you said.</span> <span id="s590">So I stuck by my story.</span> <span id="s591">So yeah, they – he wanted – he really beat me, and then he kicked me down the steps.</span> <span id="s592">There were about three steps as – as you entered the building.</span> <span id="s593">So I fell over the three steps, and I got up, and I ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Now, when you were turning people away, were you turning any passerby away, or did you know who –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, people were coming from the other side, apparently they – they may have come from the Kultusgemeinde, approaching aliyah office, you see.</span> <span id="s596">I don’t know if the Kultusgemeinde was open at that time or not, because this was right – Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: This is November 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s599">This is still part of the – the pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: So whoever is passing by at that point is – is Jewish, because that’s the section of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Okay, so you knew that these people are in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Oh – oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s606">And I knew if they got into the building they’d get arrested.</span> <span id="s607">And the – many years later, I felt that what I did at that time probably was more dangerous than jumping into the Danube.</span> <span id="s608">And didn’t even think of it, I just acted spontaneous.</span> <span id="s609">It came to my mind that I can – I wish I had a name, or had recognized who – who any of these people were, but I had no idea.</span> <span id="s610">But you know, once I – I fell down the steps, and you know, I had the black eye and I went home and my mother, she was really in – in a panic.</span> <span id="s611">She says, we told you to stay home, we told you not to go here, and told you this and that, you know, that – berated, you know, because parental concern, they know that when you’re home, you know, at least we know who you are or where you are, and – a-and we don’t worry.</span> <span id="s612">But once a child – a-and I don’t know if you have children yet, but when y – when you do, y-you become aware that if you don’t know where the child is, you begin to worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Had you succeeded in intercepting your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: What happened to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yeah, I intercepted him, told him not to come home, and he went with a friend.</span> <span id="s617">But he – the f – it was on the following day that I decided, first of all, it was useless to go to the Kultusgemeinde, because the Kultusgemeinde, th-the line was for blocks, people standing in line, trying to get into the building to see the officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: What were they hoping for?</span> <span id="s619">A: An idea, information, maybe financial help because nobody was working, y-y-you see, so yo-you want to eat, you see, you need money.</span> <span id="s620">So maybe – maybe they’ll get a tip, which country, anywhere in the world, affords an opportunity that you can go to and so forth.</span> <span id="s621">I-I decided that s-since I was known, with the notoriety of saving this girl, that maybe this could be of help to me.</span> <span id="s622">So I went to see Israel Taglicht, a rabbi asr – Israel Taglicht, who was the chief rabbi of Vienna.</span> <span id="s623">I – I still remember, it was the first time I had been in – at his residence [indecipherable] really f – beautiful home, the flush red carpet.</span> <span id="s624">Cause this something that I hadn’t seen before, you see, so I rem – I remembered the red carpet.</span> <span id="s625">And he asked me what he could do for me, a-and I asked him, you know, that I had applied for aliyah, I hadn’t heard, is there anything th – he could help me with.</span> <span id="s626">So, h-he refers me to see the executive secretary of the Kultusgemeinde, who was Josef Löwenherz, Dr. Josef Löwenherz, and he f – phoned him apparently, and he got through to him and I had a pass.</span> <span id="s627">So, the following day, I went to see Löwenherz, and I didn’t have to stand in line.</span> <span id="s628">I see all these people standing in line and he does – right away e – allowed to enter, with this pass.</span> <span id="s629">And I came to his office, and he knew about me, he knew about having saved this girl, and he said, you know, what can I do for you?</span> <span id="s630">And I told him again I had applied for aliyah, I hadn’t heard, can he do anything for me?</span> <span id="s631">And it was then that he lifted the phone, and he started talking to somebody.</span> <span id="s632">And it was all about a Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s633">And, I don’t know what he’s talking about.</span> <span id="s634">So when he put the phone down, I says, what – what is the Kindertransport?</span> <span id="s635">So he explained to me that he is in negotiation with Eichmann.</span> <span id="s636">He didn’t say Eichmann, he said the Nazis.</span> <span id="s637">He did not know whether he’s gonna be successful or not, but the idea is to have a transport of 1,000 children; 800 would go to England, the first 800.</span> <span id="s638">The last 200 would be dropped off in Holland.</span> <span id="s639">And he said to me, I don’t know whether we will be successful in negotiation with Nazi authorities, he says, but if you like, he says, I’ll put your name on the list.</span> <span id="s640">So I said yes, what I got to lose, I says, yeah, put my name on the list, and I didn’t think anything o-of – more about it.</span> <span id="s641">I went home, and again where have you been, and this or that, you – why aren’t you – how many times to we have to tell you to stay home and so the litany of – of complaints that my mother had.</span> <span id="s642">But it was a – a week later that I was notified that I’d been – I had been chosen to participate in the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: How did your parents react?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Th-They was fine.</span> <span id="s645">I was old enough that I want to get out.</span> <span id="s646">My mother was satisfied that all the men, so c – old men will be go out of the way, a-and it will just be my mother and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: At this – at this point, has your father and uncle been successful in leaving the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yeah – no, they – they’re still there, they – but they have received the affidavit.</span> <span id="s649">And now the problem was w-we had to find the money for pa-passage.</span> <span id="s650">And they got assistance for – some money that came from the cousin, and – and some money they had saved up.</span> <span id="s651">Other than that, I don’t know if they got anything from the Kultusgemeinde or not.</span> <span id="s652">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s653">But I – I knew when I left that my father was going to – I left in December, and – and my father was leaving in January.</span> <span id="s654">See, th-they had the visa and then – and the affidavit.</span> <span id="s655">It was a week after I had talked to Dr. Löwenherz that I was notified to participate in the Kindertransport, which was to leave on the – late at night, it was around 10 o’clock at night from a station – not the Westbahnhof.</span> <span id="s656">Many people will tell you I left from the Westbahnhof, they didn’t leave from the Westbahnhof, the – they left from one station afterward, called Hütteldorf.</span> <span id="s657">And the requirements as to – we were given a notification as to what we would – allowed – were allowed to take out of the country.</span> <span id="s658">And it’s interesting, you were not allowed to take anything out of the country, including clothing that was new.</span> <span id="s659">Anything that you took out of the country had to be in your possession one year ahead of time, ’37.</span> <span id="s660">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: How would you prove this?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Y-You know, at that time, I didn’t think of it, but we obeyed it, yeah.</span> <span id="s663">It’s a – nobody, as far as I know – I mean, I have no way of knowing, but my – my parents did not buy anything, a pair of socks, o-or a shirt, or underwear, no-none of that.</span> <span id="s664">It was true that then – everything that I took with me, I had had be-before.</span> <span id="s665">And – and under penalty of punishment, whatever the punishment would have been, my father had to swear a signed affidavit, that whatever I was taking out had been in my possession as of 1937.</span> <span id="s666">An-And by the way, I have that document, with his signature, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: What’s happening to your brother at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Well, he left with my father in – in January of ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So then, the – the three male members of your family leave together in the – January of ’39, your father, your uncle and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No, no, my uncle had nothing to do with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: It’s just my fa – my uncle, before they left, my uncles – I – I took him to the train station, he was smuggling himself across the border into Yugoslavia to go to Palestine because it – i-illegal immigration was more productive and successful than trying to wait for admission by any authorit – any country.</span> <span id="s673">You’re not supposed to be in Yugoslavia, you’re not supposed to be in Italy wi-without p-permit, and – which you couldn’t get, so you – you just crossed the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Di-Did he take a train?</span> <span id="s675">How was he going to cross the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yo-You get to the border, the Austrian border, and you get off the train.</span> <span id="s677">And then at night, th – wi – there was a smuggling operation going on at that time.</span> <span id="s678">People got paid to take you, and – and th – and I-I guess there was bribery to look another way in the – you know, th-that must have gone on for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And this is the winter of ’38, when he’s escaping to Yugoslavia?</span> <span id="s680">It’s after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, yeah, no December –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: December.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: December ’38, yes.</span> <span id="s684">What day?</span> <span id="s685">I don’t know, maybe a third week of December, or the second week of December.</span> <span id="s686">No, it had to be – it had to be probably the first week of December, because I left on – on my birthday, the 11th, so it had to be before that, cause I took him to the train.</span> <span id="s687">A-Again, there was [indecipherable] nobody else.</span> <span id="s688">Even when any kind of form needed to be filled out, they called on me.</span> <span id="s689">My – my parents, to a large extent felt that I would know what to do, you see.</span> <span id="s690">So – so the – my brother would do something foolish, you see, so – so he – and he’s smaller – see, my brother was taller.</span> <span id="s691">So he’s taller [indecipherable] more of a child, you know, tha-that – he –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Nobody suspects a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Ye-Yeah, he can get by, you see.</span> <span id="s694">Maybe they – their judgment was correct in – in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So what happens to your uncle?</span> <span id="s696">Does he get through to Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: He wa – he got through Yugoslavia, and Romania, into Turkey and from Turkey to Israel.</span> <span id="s698">His wife was left behind, and his son was left behind.</span> <span id="s699">And they were deported.</span> <span id="s700">You didn’t ask me about my friend, who was –</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Let’s talk about your friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: – who was involved with me in saving the girl.</span> <span id="s703">We had, you know, when – when you think back, you know, as – as children, the type of conversation that we had compared to the conversation that kids have in this country, yeah, you know, it was a – it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s704">You’re talking about life and death, and they’re talking about football, or baseball, you know.</span> <span id="s705">So I – his name was Ernst, I used to call him Ernsty(ph).</span> <span id="s706">I said, why don’t you try to get out also?</span> <span id="s707">He couldn’t get on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s708">He was two years older, so the cut-off age was, at that time was 16, and he – he was almost 17.</span> <span id="s709">He says – in any event, he says, I – I can’t leave my parents.</span> <span id="s710">The sister had left for Israel, she had made aliyah early o-of ’38.</span> <span id="s711">So he – he s – he said, in any event, he says, you know, my – my father is – is a decorated from World War I, and he says, I can understand where they’ll bother you because you – you – your parents are –</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: One – one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: So – so he – he felt that his father having been a veteran of the World War I, and decorated and you know, au – Austrian citizen to begin with, whereas my parents were naturalized.</span> <span id="s714">And nothing is gonna happen to us.</span> <span id="s715">So – so I – he wasn’t too – he says, in your case, your – your parents are Polish originally, and he says yeah, I can see where – so he stayed and what would happen eventually is that like everybody else, they were kicked out of the apartment.</span> <span id="s716">I was in England ba – by that time and lost contact.</span> <span id="s717">My problem also was, I had no money.</span> <span id="s718">Somebody was give me – have to give me a stamp.</span> <span id="s719">Then sometimes I got a postcard from someone.</span> <span id="s720">And that’s the only means I had to write.</span> <span id="s721">And I heard nothing any more fr-from Ernsty(ph).</span> <span id="s722">Later on I heard that the parents were deported to Theresienstadt, and they died there.</span> <span id="s723">And he was living with some girl in the second district, and they were deported [indecipherable] down here.</span> <span id="s724">And when they arrived in – in Poland, the following day they were all shot, including him.</span> <span id="s725">And tha-that was what – I didn’t hear that until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s726">I had no idea that – often wondered what happened to him, but we never knew.</span> <span id="s727">Of course, I didn’t know what happened to my uncle, I didn’t know what happened to my cousins or my aunt, or – or my grandparents or, you know, in – in Poland my father’s parents’ family, most of them are still in Radom, and there were 10 brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s728">And they – and they had married and they had children.</span> <span id="s729">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s730">So that – that was one aspect.</span> <span id="s731">I don’t know where I am i-i-in – in this story, yo-yo-you better take me back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: – a particular event, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Well, what I’d like to know at this point is, what’s happening to your sister?</span> <span id="s735">Is she just staying home and –</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: She – she was two years younger, so she was around 11, and she stayed home.</span> <span id="s737">And in the meantime, while I’m in England, I am – e-even today i-it bothers me, I-I am put in a very, very stressful position.</span> <span id="s738">My uncle writes to me – and this is my mother’s brother – the other uncle was my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s739">But he writes to me that he’s smuggled himself across the border into Italy.</span> <span id="s740">And he says, help me, I’m eating grass.</span> <span id="s741">[phone ringing] And do you – are you getting the phone I’m hearing?</span> <span id="s742">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Okay, we’re back on.</span> <span id="s744">He writes to you and you’re in England and he says that he’s eating grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yeah, a-and help me.</span> <span id="s746">Well, I-I’m 14 years old, I have no money.</span> <span id="s747">Absolutely not – not one penny, nothing.</span> <span id="s748">And I don’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s749">I don’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s750">I’m at this place in Dovercourt in Lowestoft(ph), freezing cold.</span> <span id="s751">I mean, this cabin, no running water.</span> <span id="s752">Every bit of clothing that I had, I’m – I’m – I’m putting it on at night, trying to stay warm, and – because we’re right on the ocean, and this wintertime.</span> <span id="s753">I couldn’t stay warm.</span> <span id="s754">So aft – they gave us sort of a canister, was supposed to be filled with hot water, and – and when I woke up in the morning the second night, it was – it was frozen ice.</span> <span id="s755">And I said, you know, to – to my friend who is staying with me, I says, you know, I can’t take this any more, I says, I’m not gonna stay here.</span> <span id="s756">So – so I just took the blanket, and I went into the dining hall, and there they had a fireplace, and I put the blanket on the floor.</span> <span id="s757">And for the rest of the time that I was at this camp, I slept on the floor in front of the dining place, ju-just ha-had to stay warm.</span> <span id="s758">But this is a different story now.</span> <span id="s759">As far as my uncle is concerned, he writes to me from time to time that he – he also has no money, and he’s hungry.</span> <span id="s760">And then in one letter he’s saying that – now that you’re safe and out of the country, it’s your responsibility to help me, to help me get out of the country.</span> <span id="s761">Well – well, I get this letter, a-and then o-on a – on a personal note from my mother, she’s getting, as time goes on, more worried and more concerned.</span> <span id="s762">My father is in United States, a good looking man, and maybe it went on in her head that maybe he’s met somebody, which later on I hear, was not that unusual.</span> <span id="s763">So sh – the pressure went on, with me caught in the middle.</span> <span id="s764">She’s writing to me that he’s not doing anything to help her get out of the country.</span> <span id="s765">In the meantime, he’s in this country, he doesn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s766">He doesn’t know who is what, or where to go or what do you do.</span> <span id="s767">He doesn’t have any money either.</span> <span id="s768">He’s dependent upon the assistance from – from the distant cousins who have no relation whatso-whatsoever.</span> <span id="s769">I don’t know what their finances were at the time.</span> <span id="s770">So, you know, one letter I get, that I should write to my father, that if he doesn’t do something to help my mother to get out of the country, that I should write to him – oh, she said, send a cable – h-how am I gonna send a cable – tha-that I would have nothing to do with him, if he wasn’t more active in helping.</span> <span id="s771">I realized the situation she’s in, I – I don’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s772">So I wrote him what she told me.</span> <span id="s773">And then I get a letter from my father, that this is no way to talk to me.</span> <span id="s774">A-And you know, I – I’m in the middle of this thing, in the – in the back and forth, and you know, th – i-it was for me a very, very uncomfortable and stressful and it’s – if you can put yourself in the situation where – where you are put in the situation of choosing between your father or your mother, I mean how – how do you do this?</span> <span id="s775">A-A-And – and – and who is right and who is wrong, an-and what’s going on?</span> <span id="s776">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s777">Bu-But you ask me to do this, all right, I’ll – I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s778">You see, so – but I mean, th-that has always bothered me that – that I wrote that letter.</span> <span id="s779">And I – he s – my father berated me, that this no way to talk to me, and it was disrespectful.</span> <span id="s780">But i-it was – you know, the war broke out and my mother is still over there, and finally she did get an affidavit, cause America and Germany, there was still correspondence going on because America was not at war in ’39.</span> <span id="s781">So she – she got the affidavit and she’s able to leave through Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: With your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: With my sister, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: What about your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: My – my grandmother, I’ve almost forgot about her.</span> <span id="s786">She – she left before any of us did.</span> <span id="s787">I-I really – I really loved her.</span> <span id="s788">She [indecipherable] she was put in touch, I don’t know how, she took a train t-toward the Belgium border, and there she was ma – we had two aunts – two – my mother had two sisters who lived in Paris, so – so they have arranged where one of the husbands of – of one of the sisters were to go to Belgium and arrange with a smuggler, and they smuggled her across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: How much earlier is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: This probably was e-either very – at the end of November, or maybe early – early – first week of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yeah, ’38, yeah.</span> <span id="s793">So she crosses the border, and she gets arrested.</span> <span id="s794">And the French put her in prison, illegal entry.</span> <span id="s795">An elderly woman, and she only speaks Yiddish, and she’s very frum.</span> <span id="s796">So in prison she doesn’t want to eat, because it’s treyfa.</span> <span id="s797">So she dies.</span> <span id="s798">In-Interesting that, since talking about what – Paris, that she was arrested by the French police, the two sisters were deported to Auschwitz, picked up by the French.</span> <span id="s799">Collaborators.</span> <span id="s800">I-I-I’m skipping a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: No, no [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: My mother e-eventually, she gets the affidavit, she meets up with the brother who had written to me, you know, for help, and whatever money she has, not much, it’s some spending money, she – she gives it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: This is in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: In Italy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And in the meantime, the Italian police had picked him up because he’s got no place where to stay.</span> <span id="s806">And he went to the Jewish welfare service of some kind, and the building, an-and the Italians had closed it, because too many people were coming there for – asking for help and – and so forth.</span> <span id="s807">They didn’t want any Jewish immigrants to come to the country.</span> <span id="s808">So – so when they picked them up, they asked them what – what is your source of income?</span> <span id="s809">He has no income.</span> <span id="s810">We give you 24 hours to get out of the country, or else we’ll return you to Germany.</span> <span id="s811">So he crosses the border illegally, into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Do you know how he did it, given that he couldn’t bribe anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: I don’t think so, no, he didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s814">Cause the minute he crossed the border, he got picked up and sent to Gurs.</span> <span id="s815">And then he, from Gurs he went to Drancy, and from Drancy he went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s816">He had a son, Julius.</span> <span id="s817">The son, had smu – had smuggled himself across the border.</span> <span id="s818">It’s a little chilly here.</span> <span id="s819">Are you uncomfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: No.</span> <span id="s821">Let me press pause [indecipherable] [break] So, pressing record.</span> <span id="s822">If I remember correctly, you had mentioned that you had some interaction with Eichmann.</span> <span id="s823">Was that – was that a personal eyewitness on your part, or was that through –</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: No, I – I didn’t know anything about Eichmann.</span> <span id="s825">I needed to have an entry made o-on – on an immediate basis, because I’m going to go to England an-and I needed a passport, and England was not listed on the passport, so – so how do I do this?</span> <span id="s826">So – so I decided that the best way – a-and by the way, it has to be certified on the passport, each country that you want to go – emigrate to.</span> <span id="s827">So I decided to go to Nazi headquarters.</span> <span id="s828">They were located at Rothschild palace.</span> <span id="s829">And I just went in and – and right away I meet the person in charge, the – you know, they’re – they’re referring me from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s830">And he wants to know what it is that – that I’m there for, and so I told him.</span> <span id="s831">And he – he [indecipherable] agreed and he gave it to me, wrote in there and put the stamp on it and – an-and that was it.</span> <span id="s832">And it was only years later that I learned that the person who was in charge was Eichmann.</span> <span id="s833">So if he was in charge, so – so – so it must have been him.</span> <span id="s834">You know, he didn’t introduce himself to me.</span> <span id="s835">But, you know, my assumption.</span> <span id="s836">I don’t know who else had the authority, except f-for hi – for Eichmann, once you are in – in the headquarters of the Nazi government.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: How did people treat you there when they were referring you from one place to the next?</span> <span id="s838">Was it just all business?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: There was – there was no un-pleasantry?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s843">I said grüss gott, th-they gave me a – they stared at me.</span> <span id="s844">I – I – I think they were surprised, they didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s845">I mean, a little boy comes in, and there’s – with grüss gott, a-a-and you know, who – who – who do you want to see?</span> <span id="s846">An-And I probably said th-the person in charge.</span> <span id="s847">A-And so the – from one office to the other, to wind up with Eichmann, I – I – I – I – I did hear, when he was tried in Israel that he made some claim that on occasion he tried to save Jews.</span> <span id="s848">I mean, that was par – so-some small part of his defense.</span> <span id="s849">But he did o – also admit that one mistake that he made was that he slapped Löwenherz.</span> <span id="s850">And tha-that he – he apologized for having slapped his face, because he had much respect for Löwenherz, and – and Löwenherz survived.</span> <span id="s851">And by the way, ma-many people felt that Löwenherz was a collaborator.</span> <span id="s852">I spoke to his son, his son survived, and I was able to get ahold of him, lived in New York, name – changed his name to Lavary(ph).</span> <span id="s853">I have a letter that he sent me, talking about his father and how glad he was to hear from me, because I had written to him and told him about the father, and – the father being responsible for my sur-surviving.</span> <span id="s854">And he says, the father would have been happy to hear from me.</span> <span id="s855">And he put me in touch with his daughter, who lives in California, and she’s a professor at one of the universities there, and he – he felt that the daughter should hear my story.</span> <span id="s856">So we got the daughter to call me, and we were in a conference phone call, and I told her story, and then she – because the father was criticized for having supplied the lists to the Nazi authorities, who were then picked up and deported.</span> <span id="s857">How else do you find out who lives where?</span> <span id="s858">But they had the information.</span> <span id="s859">My knowledge of Löwenherz, he had no choice.</span> <span id="s860">So – so they’re gonna get that list no matter what.</span> <span id="s861">He’s not the only one who knows where the lists are.</span> <span id="s862">So if they kill him [indecipherable] so – so he is in a difficult situation.</span> <span id="s863">Might – you might also find of interest that the rabbi at my Bar Mitzvah was Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s864">There you have a different story.</span> <span id="s865">He was part of the Judenrat in Vienna, and then he became part of the Judenrat at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s866">It is reported that he acted shamefully, that he molested women, and if they didn’t cooperate, he’d put them on the list to be deported.</span> <span id="s867">There are books written about his deed.</span> <span id="s868">He too survived, and wound up in Italy.</span> <span id="s869">They wanted – many of the people who knew him from – who also had survived Theresienstadt wanted to hang him up.</span> <span id="s870">He a – with the church’s help, he wound up in Rome, and the Vatican supposedly helped him, and he started working for the Vatican, and he died in Italy.</span> <span id="s871">And the wife wanted to have him buried in the Jewish cemetery, and they refused.</span> <span id="s872">And with the Vatican intercession, to cooperate or to yield or whatever, so – so they agreed, but only at the edge of the cemetery.</span> <span id="s873">I understand that there is some sort of a custom that if you are an apostate, or you’ve done something disrespectful to the Jewish people, they let you be buried in the Jewish cemetery, but away from everybody, only at the edge.</span> <span id="s874">So that is where he’s buried, in Italy.</span> <span id="s875">That’s the story of the rabbi, Benjamin mermu – Benjamin Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s876">And I have – I can’t remember the name of the book, but there’s a – a book written about the – the Judenrat, he was the head of the camp at Theresienstadt, and he s – replaced Edelman, who was the former head.</span> <span id="s877">And Edelman, before being deported, advised the committee there, don’t trust Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s878">And if you like, I’ll give you name of the – of the – of the book, and – and you can Google M-Murmelstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: I’m sure [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: It doesn’t make reference to what he did, only the position that he held.</span> <span id="s881">So – so he – he became quite prominent as Benjamin Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s882">I don’t know if – you didn’t write down the name.</span> <span id="s883">Benjamin Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s884">I still have the Bar Mitzvah book that I received.</span> <span id="s885">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s886">It was about two or three days before we left.</span> <span id="s887">We had to take our suitcases and to have it inspected by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s888">And you were not allowed to take any money, you’re not allowed to take any cameras, no jewelry, nothing of any value.</span> <span id="s889">You – a-anything in your possession had to be in your possession as of ’37, as I mentioned earlier.</span> <span id="s890">No – no typewriters, nothing – no musical instruments, an-and the only thing that was not listed was books.</span> <span id="s891">And since it wasn’t listed, I felt, you know, I always liked books, and the nicest present you could give me for my Bar Mitzvah would be a book.</span> <span id="s892">So, I – I had received quite a few books, so I put them in a suitcase.</span> <span id="s893">And when we went to the Kultusgemeinde, where we had taken our suitcase to, the Gestapo agent said, what’s with these books?</span> <span id="s894">And my mother said, well, he likes to read.</span> <span id="s895">He doesn’t need them.</span> <span id="s896">So he started – took some of the books and tossed them all out.</span> <span id="s897">You know, just threw them away, but he left some books there.</span> <span id="s898">And one of the books he’d left was the Bar Mitzvah boy – prayer book, which I still have, with the date and everything.</span> <span id="s899">Another document.</span> <span id="s900">German Bar Mitzvah prayer book.</span> <span id="s901">So where are we in the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Well, tell me about the day that you left.</span> <span id="s903">So, it was from Hütteldorf.</span> <span id="s904">Who did you go to the train station with?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: O-Only my mother.</span> <span id="s906">My father was – oh, she felt my father may be arrested, you know, so he – because fo-for a while he just didn’t leave the house.</span> <span id="s907">So it was – I-I had no idea what to expect, but when w – when we got there, each child had to be dropped off at the foot of the steps.</span> <span id="s908">That was in the requirement that we had received, as to what procedure to follow for the transport, and – and we were to arrive at a certain hour, and in my case late in the evening.</span> <span id="s909">The child had to be drop off at the steps of the foot o-of the entrance.</span> <span id="s910">The parent was not allowed on the platform.</span> <span id="s911">Only one parent could come, and we would be given a number, and that was it.</span> <span id="s912">A-And now we arriving at the station.</span> <span id="s913">And there are hundreds of parents with a child, and well, I’m almost 14, only one day away.</span> <span id="s914">This is a – late in – at night, on the 10th of December, and I’m listening to some of the conversation that was going on, you know, with the – the conversation between my mother a-and me, we – we – we knew what to accept.</span> <span id="s915">I wanted to be part of it, my mother wanted me out of the country, so it was, write to me, we’ll get together, we’ll be okay an-and so forth, and you know, my – each – each one encouraging the other, y-you see, so – so I’m not – I – I recognize what is taking place, but I’m – I’m not emotionally carried away, because I know we’re gonna meet up again, you know.</span> <span id="s916">My father, a month later is leaving, so I know we’re gonna get together some – at some time.</span> <span id="s917">When or what, of course, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s918">But I’m listening to what goes on around me, which I found very heartrending.</span> <span id="s919">I had no idea that on this transport would be children between two and 16.</span> <span id="s920">And the conversation of some of these children, four, five, six years old, they had no idea what was taking place, and what – why they were there and where they were going and why they were going an-and – and are you not coming with me, or – or I don’t want to go, I want to stay.</span> <span id="s921">You don’t love me, or – I get emotional even today when I talk about it because at the time I – I was not as em-emotionally affected as I am now, because now I have children and grandchildren and I don’t know if I would have the courage of the parents, the sacrifice that they made, to take a kid at that age and send him away.</span> <span id="s922">I-It took a lot of guts, I mean, cause I don’t want you to worry, or write to me, or we’ll soon get together, and it’s all fabricated.</span> <span id="s923">They don’t know.</span> <span id="s924">And as finally happened, close to 90 percent of the children never saw their parents again.</span> <span id="s925">So i-it – it was a very, very stressful period.</span> <span id="s926">A-And you know, give them a number, I – you know, my number was thr – 325, so I knew I was going to England – because until then I didn’t even know where I was going for sure.</span> <span id="s927">So – so I knew I was going to England.</span> <span id="s928">And they took the younger children, they put them in one wagon, the older children in another wagon.</span> <span id="s929">And the girls in one wagon, the boys in another wagon, so – and I remember on the – f-for the – for the most part we had a certain amount of fear as to what was going to happen, even on the train, whenever it stopped and the Nazi personnel came on an-and then they walked through and – because they could kick you off the train, you know.</span> <span id="s930">Somebody – there was a rumor that somebody was taken off the train.</span> <span id="s931">If there was or wasn’t, I have no idea, you know, rumor circulates.</span> <span id="s932">So we had some social workers from the Kultusgemeinde who came with us and they had – they were going to be allowed to leave the country, but their family was held hostage, they had to return.</span> <span id="s933">And we a-arrived to the [indecipherable] i-in – late – late at night, after a day and a half of traveling on the train, we arrived in Holland and the train stopped on the German side first, and they inspected, and whatever and then they let the train proceed across the border.</span> <span id="s934">And once we crossed the border all hell broke loose, and everybody started yelling and screaming and cheering and you know, because now we knew we were free; no longer to be afraid of the Nazis or what they could do.</span> <span id="s935">And I remember people coming up to the train and th-they offered us drinks and – and sandwiches and so forth, a very friendly reception i-in Holland.</span> <span id="s936">And after a little while, I-I was so tired from the day and a half on th – on the train that I – I-I could – I could barely stay awake.</span> <span id="s937">So – so all I remember is I got on this boat and the crossing of the channel is very stormy, I – and I got motion sick.</span> <span id="s938">I’d never been on any ocean, I – first time I – I’m seeing an ocean.</span> <span id="s939">And in the morning the – the next morning we – we arrived in Harwich, England, and I faintly remember – I don’t know how – being taken to Lowestoft(ph) in Dovercourt.</span> <span id="s940">And there I stayed maybe three weeks, something like that, and my – my problem started, I was there three weeks then – then they – they sent me to Ipswich, and I was there 10 days, and being – and then I went to another place, it was a convalescent home for sick people, and – and in each time i-i-in the – in Dovercourt every weekend, they – they would line us up and – and people would come down a-and pick out certain children.</span> <span id="s941">And you know, I asked them what’s going on?</span> <span id="s942">These are people that – private people want to take a child in their home.</span> <span id="s943">But I noticed that whenever they picked anybody out, they wanted a small, small, young children.</span> <span id="s944">Nobody wanted to get a teenager, you see, so nobody picked me.</span> <span id="s945">So – so I was going to this convalescent home, and then I went another place.</span> <span id="s946">Each time I’m – I’m staying a week or two, or three weeks, and then I go another place, and then finally I was sen – we went to a place called – they always cut down the number of boys, always – you know, th – by then, I think we’re down to a dozen boys a-and – and we’re going to a – San Remo hotel in Margate, near – near Dover.</span> <span id="s947">And th-that was sort of a family run hotel, small hotel, and I really liked it.</span> <span id="s948">I said oh, this is beautiful.</span> <span id="s949">I sa – th-the ocean, a-and – and it’s – it’s gotten warmer and the food is great, and we were there maybe two and a half weeks, and the proprietor tells us that you’ll have to leave, you know, some other place.</span> <span id="s950">I says, why, I says, you know, we like it here.</span> <span id="s951">We said, we want – I want to stay here, I said, this is – this is very nice.</span> <span id="s952">He said, I’m very sorry, but I can’t support a group of boys and nobody pays us.</span> <span id="s953">So that was the first time that I realized that – what was going on.</span> <span id="s954">That we’re being shifted from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s955">Maybe they said, all right, I’ll take them for a few days, and so forth, you see, but nobody was paying anybody, you see, so these people were – were offering to house some – some boys until they realized that th – they’ll have to make room for us, and there’s certain expense involved, and – and you – there’s no funds available.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: I-I’m – a-at this point I’m curious about the people around you.</span> <span id="s957">First off, did you know anyone on the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: And then once you get to England, are you making any kind of friendships and how well are you able to communicate in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I’m not communicating with – I’m living with German boys, Austrian boys, and we’re talking German.</span> <span id="s961">Spoke German almost the whole time I lived in England.</span> <span id="s962">A-And f-from San Remo Hotel, we were sent to Croydon, an estate.</span> <span id="s963">Then we – we hearing the possibility of war, and the – that be – you know, now the – England is rearm – finally re-rearming itself, you know, a-and there’s more and more talk about the possibility of war because Hitler wants Danzig and – a-and England has a pact with Poland and France and so forth, they’re gonna come to the assistance of the Polish government.</span> <span id="s964">A-And in Croydon, it was around September first, war starts.</span> <span id="s965">A-And there we stayed at a school that had been evacuated of British children, it was a private school, a girls’ school.</span> <span id="s966">Kendra Hall was the name.</span> <span id="s967">And so we stayed there on – on the first night when war star – started.</span> <span id="s968">And – and we experienced the first air raid alarm, supposedly German planes were si-si – flying overhead.</span> <span id="s969">A-And we went into the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s970">And we were there – nice place, by the way – we were there maybe two weeks when we were told that we had to leave the place because near us was a – the RAF, Royal Air Force had a base, and they needed to house their personnel, so they were going to take over the school, and we would have to leave.</span> <span id="s971">So, the next thing we were being sent to London, to another school.</span> <span id="s972">I don’t know if you know anything about London, Eaton(ph) Avenue, [indecipherable] school.</span> <span id="s973">And the same thing, it’s a private school, it was empty, children had been evacuated.</span> <span id="s974">And the building is empty, if you want to stay there, fine.</span> <span id="s975">So a group of boys stayed at this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: These are still German speaking refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yeah, all was, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s978">We just speak German.</span> <span id="s979">Hardly anybody knew any English.</span> <span id="s980">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Well, the nine months that you’re in Britain before the war breaks out, you’re not receiving any kind of schooling?</span> <span id="s982">You’re just being moved around?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: No school.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And how frequently are you able to communicate with – with anyone back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Perhaps once a month or every six weeks or something like that.</span> <span id="s986">Not – not a – not on a daily basis or even weekly basis, it’s just that – because I – I have the stamps.</span> <span id="s987">I mean, it sounds silly today, you know, when you talk about it, you know, I have a stamp.</span> <span id="s988">But you know, I was there maybe a week, and I’m told by the headmaster that they had a phone call from the refugee committee.</span> <span id="s989">And the refugee committee tha – informs him that they have no money for my support.</span> <span id="s990">They’ve run of – out of funds, and that I would have to get a job.</span> <span id="s991">So he – he told me that the – you – you got to find a job.</span> <span id="s992">I-I don’t know how I found it, whether he found it for me, or whether somebody told me about it, I just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s993">But I went for interview for the person who was going to employ me, and he hired me, and the job was to be a delivery boy, a-and that’s what I was, a del –</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: In London?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s996">A delivery boy for Lady Garmin(ph) Taylor(ph), and I’ll be a delivery boy, and he’s going to teach me – first he’s going to teach me how to sew, and he’ll see how I do, and if I do real well – he was telling me about how much money you make as a – as a tailor of – s-and how much money you make as a cutter.</span> <span id="s997">He says – he says, if you really do well, he says, I’ll teach you to be a cutter, and he says, a cutter makes something like 40 pounds a week, or something like that.</span> <span id="s998">As – as a delivery boy I make one pound.</span> <span id="s999">One pound a week, you know, I thought that was great, one pound a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Was that enough for you to feed yourself for a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: That’s what I lived on, one pound a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: What were you eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: I ate – I ate one meal a day.</span> <span id="s1004">And sometimes, y-you know, when people I’ve worked with – not – not – not every day, but maybe ca – two, three times a week, because we – we have these lunchtime periods, you know, in the afternoon, th-the – 10 o’clock or so they ha – they serve tea.</span> <span id="s1005">When I say serve tea, we ma – we made tea, a-and in f – in – in the afternoon at two o’clock, the teatime again, we – sometimes they would bring an extra sandwich, not – not – not all the time, but sometimes, and that – that was a big deal for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And these were the other delivery boys, or – who would bring the sandwiches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No, no, no, they were wor-workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Tailors, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yeah, women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Women workers or a-adult, women workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Were they British or foreigners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: No, no, British, yeah British.</span> <span id="s1014">And you learn English listening to them, you know, many times – they liked me and they laughed about the way I spoke, and the accent I had and so forth, and – but that’s what I was doing, whatever.</span> <span id="s1015">Maurice Skark(ph) was the owner.</span> <span id="s1016">And he would do the cutting, I would pick up the cloth from the wholesaler, and I would take the cloth and bring him the cloth, or – and he had the – what do you call it Joyce, a design?</span> <span id="s1017">No, no, no, how to – how to cut th-th-the fabric out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: A template, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Th-There’s a di – a – a paper design that you lay – put down and cut accordingly.</span> <span id="s1020">So – so – so he had the design which was drawn out on paper and he had a picture of what the dress ought to look like and so forth, and – and this was high – high expense fashions for the day.</span> <span id="s1021">And the – and he would start from scratch and make the dress and then I – or the coat or many times was a – women’s overcoats, or – or a skirt, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1022">A-And then I would take the finished product and take it back to the wholesaler and the wholesaler would inspect it, and tha-that’s – when it passes inspection, that’s when he gets paid, you see.</span> <span id="s1023">Now, on one pound a week, I paid 15 shillings fo-for room and board.</span> <span id="s1024">Three shillings I had to pay for transportation, cause I lived at this Swiss cottage.</span> <span id="s1025">And where I worked was off a street called Poland Street, which was near Oxford Circle, if you’ve ever been to London.</span> <span id="s1026">It’s a – it’s a block away from Oxford Street, which is the main drag.</span> <span id="s1027">A-And I worked there until the day that I actually left London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: The war had already broken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: The war had already broken out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Oh yes, yes, I lived through the bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: And you were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1034">As a matter of fact, I – I – I was an air raid warden.</span> <span id="s1035">I had volunteered to be in – become an air raid warden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: So your English had improved by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yes, yes, I o – well not fluent, but well enough to – to know what’s going on and I could read the paper.</span> <span id="s1038">But as an air raid warden, when the – when the air raid warden – warning came on, I would be on the roof.</span> <span id="s1039">They – they would call the spotters to spot the airplanes.</span> <span id="s1040">Yo-You know, didn’t really know what were – what I was supposed to do, but you know, I – I had a helmet, and I was an air raid warden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: So you would spot an airplane and you’d get everyone down in the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yeah, yeah, to so – go undercover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: I’m going to stop you here, and we’re going to sw-switch tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">End of File Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Beginning File Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: How did you become a volunteer air raid warden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: You know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1048">I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1049">An-And any-anybody who wants to do anything, you know, it – it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1050">Had I been 18 years old, I would have been arrested as an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s1051">And since I don’t reme – you know, I don’t remember whether you had to be 18 or 16 when they considered you an enemy alien and they would put you in some sort of a camp.</span> <span id="s1052">At 18 you could volunteer for a pioneer – what they called Pioneer Corps, and in England, you know, I wasn’t old enough to – to be in anything at the time.</span> <span id="s1053">I was waiting f – you know, I-I can imagine how my – my parents were in this country at the time, and in the newsreel when they went to the – the movies on occasion, they would see th – oh, what – they have a movie – what they would ca – what they called Movietone News.</span> <span id="s1054">This is way before your – your time.</span> <span id="s1055">They would show London ablaze, and they would show the – the – the searching f – search lights a-and f-fire – buildings were put aflame and – and heavy bombing.</span> <span id="s1056">An-And – and I lived through that and I – I – we had sandbags all around the building, the school; it was not a very big building, it was small.</span> <span id="s1057">But sandbagged all around, and we would sleep in – in the cellar, the basement, or – and wa – one particular night, if you ever – I’m sure you’ve seen it on television maybe, when a bomb falls down, there is that searing noise, and as it comes closer to you it’s louder and louder.</span> <span id="s1058">And this particular time I felt, that’s got my number – that’s got our number on it, a-and it’s gonna hit our building.</span> <span id="s1059">And a-as it came closer a-and I – and suddenly I heard a huge explosion, and the building shook and the glass broke and I had been sleeping, you know, I – I sat up quite alarmed.</span> <span id="s1060">And the headmaster of the school saw me, and he said to me, Mr. Friedman, would you like to have a cup of tea?</span> <span id="s1061">Br-British stoic behavior.</span> <span id="s1062">Years later, I had described Joyce many times, that particular event, and – and I showed her and told her how close that bomb fell.</span> <span id="s1063">And I said, you know, it wiped out that entire building.</span> <span id="s1064">So – so years later, in the 60s, we went back, and I – and I wanted to show her the building, it’s a – and st – the place was still vacant, nothing was there.</span> <span id="s1065">So I says, look, this is where the bomb fell.</span> <span id="s1066">And th-the school had been converted into apartments, and knocked on the door in one of the apartments and talked to the people if they’ll let me come in.</span> <span id="s1067">And we came in, and I was telling them the different things.</span> <span id="s1068">And I said, you know, around here, there used to be a – a dumbwaiter.</span> <span id="s1069">You know what a dumbwaiter is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: The one that goes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yeah, yeah, it goes down ba – he says, oh, he says, I was wondering what was back there.</span> <span id="s1072">So he – he liked the fact that I could explain that to him.</span> <span id="s1073">So, li-living through the London blitz, my parents, knowing that I was there, I-I can imagine that they were very worried.</span> <span id="s1074">And they were anxious to – to get me out.</span> <span id="s1075">My father sent me an affidavit, the affidavit was rejected by the American embassy.</span> <span id="s1076">Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy was the ambassador at that time.</span> <span id="s1077">It was rejected because my father’s income was insufficient.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Wh-Wh-What was he doing?</span> <span id="s1079">What was his job at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: He wa – he was working in some sort of a shoe factory, and he was making – I have the – a re – a receipt home – either he was making 12 dollars a week, or 15 dollars a week, th-that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Was your mother working too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: No, my mother never worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: But they had been reunited by this time, they were both in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yeah, they were both –</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Were they in Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes, in Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: With your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: And your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: A-And my brother.</span> <span id="s1091">And my brother was living someplace else, and he had a job m-making 10 dollars or 15 dollars a week as a tailor, that he had learned in Austria.</span> <span id="s1092">So, I was supposed to be on – on a ship.</span> <span id="s1093">I – I left in late November of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: But your affidavit is first rejected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: So then how – how do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Well – well, they – my mother went to the Jewish welfare system, HIAS, and the person there was a Julia Strauss, she was in charge of the off – o-of the Jewish Welfare System – Ser-Service, or whatever they called themselves at the time.</span> <span id="s1098">And she had a friend who, through marriage was a-an owner or a major shareholder of Amico Oil.</span> <span id="s1099">It was called a st – first it was Standard Oil of – of Ohio, and dus – she apparently talked to him and so forth, whether he would be willing to help and so – send an affidavit and described to him the circumstances – and he agreed.</span> <span id="s1100">And he offered 150 dollars for part o-of my passage f-for the ship, because m-my folks didn’t the money, and I didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s1101">And – and in – and with the stipulation that the other half be paid – and this is also strange, often, you know, I – I thought at the time you – it was a very wise, outstanding thing for him to agree, first to give the affidavit, which guarantees that I would not be dependent upon any kind of social welfare once I arrived in this country; e-even though, you know, had my parents, my family is here, it makes no difference, according to the American laws at the time.</span> <span id="s1102">So – so he agrees to give 150 dollars, with the stipulation that an equal amount be spent by somebody in England.</span> <span id="s1103">He wasn’t going to pay the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: So, who did you find in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1106">I don’t know, a-all this – I mean, I – I had no control over booking, or over – for – for much of what went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Do you know what organization was handling your case?</span> <span id="s1108">Was it a – a Jewish welfare organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: I-It no – evidently some welfare agency – incidentally, while I was living in England – I left out that story – my mother writes me a letter that I should try to be placed – I mean, she sees I’m changing my addresses, ever – every two, three weeks I got a different address that she – she’s seeing.</span> <span id="s1110">Why don’t you stay in one place?</span> <span id="s1111">Every time you write you have a different address.</span> <span id="s1112">So she writes me a letter saying that I should write to the refugee committee, asking them to be placed with a family.</span> <span id="s1113">And when you are placed with a family, you could ask them to send papers over to me, perhaps they need a domestic.</span> <span id="s1114">And I’ll come over and I’ll be a domestic.</span> <span id="s1115">And then Lilly can be a babysitter.</span> <span id="s1116">But that – that was not unusual, by the way, at the time.</span> <span id="s1117">Maybe you’ve heard it from other – so – so – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: But she’s writing this still from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1120">So – so – so now I get that letter, so, like an obedient son, I write to the committee, the Bloomsbury House or whatever it was ca – and abou – about a week later I get an answer.</span> <span id="s1121">And – and here’s the strange part of the answer; how did you get to this country, who is taking care of you, and are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1122">And I still have that letter, you see.</span> <span id="s1123">And I – I got that letter, I was so astonished.</span> <span id="s1124">I says, who is doing what for me?</span> <span id="s1125">I’m going from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s1126">Wh-Who is doing this?</span> <span id="s1127">And they don’t know I exist, you see, so nevertheless I’m – I’m answering the letter, you know, answered each question.</span> <span id="s1128">And then I got another letter saying back, thank you for writing to us and giving us the information.</span> <span id="s1129">We will do our very best to place you with a family, but we ask that you be patient, because it may take us some time.</span> <span id="s1130">That’s the last I heard, I was never placed with a family.</span> <span id="s1131">I – I had – at the same time, I – I don’t want to create the impression that I’m angry with anybody or disappointed with anybody.</span> <span id="s1132">It was war time.</span> <span id="s1133">The people who were working in these offices had families of their own, and they are concern, there is bombing going on.</span> <span id="s1134">It’s a – ya – you know, you don’t know from one day to the next whether your home will be destroyed, you see, so i-it – it’s more or less everybody’s looking out f-for them – for – first of all to – for their own family, rather than look out for what happens to some kid here or there, you see.</span> <span id="s1135">Although sa – many children were evacuated, you know, a – I was not, a-and m-many others were not.</span> <span id="s1136">I-It’s – that’s the way it was, it – it’s war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: You mentioned you were being – at – at first, you were being moved around every two weeks or so.</span> <span id="s1138">Do you have any sense of how the decisions were made?</span> <span id="s1139">Were your – did they – did these people know each other, was it private charity?</span> <span id="s1140">You have –</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: I had no idea, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1142">Just kept on being shifted.</span> <span id="s1143">A-And it was on – onl-only boys, and sometimes the boy would come and sometimes not.</span> <span id="s1144">Sometimes he was going different direction.</span> <span id="s1145">I-I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1146">But once I was in London, I was in contact with some of the boys that I’d been with at – particularly in Croydon, I had a very good friend, Martin Lerbl(ph), I have much of his correspondence with me, he wanted me to go t – to Australia and become farmers.</span> <span id="s1147">And – and – and I wrote my mother that we’re thinking of going – of volunteering to go to Australia and become farmers an-and she was all for it.</span> <span id="s1148">You know, she already had me running a big farm and – and becoming prosperous that way, and so on, so – and then I wrote my father, told him that we’re thinking about going to Australia, although I hadn’t – I didn’t have the foggiest idea how I get to Australia.</span> <span id="s1149">I mean, just child talk, but he would have none of it.</span> <span id="s1150">So it – my mother yes, my father no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Did your father say that you need to come to the United States, what was his response?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1153">He wants the family together i-in the United States.</span> <span id="s1154">Now, a-arriving in the United States, for two weeks everything is fine.</span> <span id="s1155">But I meet people here, a-and gradually I-I’m becoming quite concerned, an-and finally I didn’t – I didn’t like this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Wha-What were you seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Stupid questions.</span> <span id="s1158">People who – y-you speak with an accent, where you from?</span> <span id="s1159">I don’t know – which I got quite often.</span> <span id="s1160">Where you from?</span> <span id="s1161">Vienna.</span> <span id="s1162">And then I would say oo – a-and then I – I begin to question, I says, do they know where that is?</span> <span id="s1163">And I was astonished when I asked them, do you know where that is, and they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1164">I says, my God, these people are re-really stupid.</span> <span id="s1165">A-And I didn’t like the weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: You were in Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Yeah, I didn’t like the weather, I didn’t like the winter, I didn’t like the summer.</span> <span id="s1168">I had disagreements with my parents.</span> <span id="s1169">Frankly, I wanted to go back to England.</span> <span id="s1170">Tha – I didn’t say that to them, but I felt that way, because I f –</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: What was it about the English that made you feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: That – that was my home already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: You had been there how long at that point, you had been there about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: About two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah, see it – the boys, you know, w-we were that close, you know, that was my family.</span> <span id="s1177">A-And here, you know, my mother wants me to go back to school.</span> <span id="s1178">I says, well, why should I go back to – I-I – I had no school for three years now, none.</span> <span id="s1179">So – so I thought, no, I don’t want to go back to school, I want to get a job.</span> <span id="s1180">And they said no, no, you got to go to school.</span> <span id="s1181">And I was in a position where – where either way I couldn’t find – I didn’t know how to go about finding a job, and at the same time I didn’t want to go to school.</span> <span id="s1182">So, in desperation, I went to see Dr. Tahlheimer(ph), the one who had send me the affidavit to – so – so I went to see him in his office, and I told him what my problem was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Was he an American Jew, or was he a refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: No, he’s a – he’s an American, very, very, extremely wealthy.</span> <span id="s1185">And I told him what my problem was an-and his answer was, you better listen to your mother.</span> <span id="s1186">So I went to school, an-and – and that was a very – the first year, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1187">Ver – because I – I-I was the dummy in the class, and whenever the teacher called on me, you know, I – I – I-I didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1188">And – and I remember a class in plane geometry, you know, trapezoids and angle this and angle that, I don’t know what she’s talking about.</span> <span id="s1189">A-And she’s asking me, because th – i-it went in rotation, the questions, so how’s she gonna leave me out?</span> <span id="s1190">So when she calls on me, there’s a cal – class starts laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Were you older than the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Maybe about three-quarters of a year, something like that.</span> <span id="s1193">Because when I graduated, I was 18.</span> <span id="s1194">Many of them are 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: So you had missed out on three years of school, and you were not put back, you were put at the level where you should be, and expected to catch up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Although another boy – I did – I left out the story, it’s of interest to us.</span> <span id="s1197">The first ride I ever took was in a taxicab in London.</span> <span id="s1198">I didn’t have enough money to go to the train station, so I took a subway to go Oxford – Oxford Street on the Oxford Circle.</span> <span id="s1199">And because of heavy bombing, you couldn’t just find a cab, but a cab came along, and I stopped it.</span> <span id="s1200">And the cab driver said, where you going?</span> <span id="s1201">I said, I’m going to Liverpool station, if you’ll take me.</span> <span id="s1202">He says, hop in.</span> <span id="s1203">So I got in the cab, and inside the cab is another boy.</span> <span id="s1204">And after a while we start talking to each other.</span> <span id="s1205">He is my age.</span> <span id="s1206">He is going to Liverpool train station.</span> <span id="s1207">Here you’re gonna take th – a ship – you know, the train, it goes to Liverpool, there he’s gonna take a ship, the same ship.</span> <span id="s1208">Going to the States?</span> <span id="s1209">Yes.</span> <span id="s1210">What city?</span> <span id="s1211">Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1212">It was – his name was Bert Grumwalt(ph).</span> <span id="s1213">He had been with a private family, and he’s telling me that when he left, the family gave him 10 pounds, going away present.</span> <span id="s1214">I said, 10 pounds, you’re kidding.</span> <span id="s1215">10 pounds?</span> <span id="s1216">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1217">I didn’t have – even have one.</span> <span id="s1218">I had noth – you know, wa – but anyhow we – we gu – he was placed in the 12th grade.</span> <span id="s1219">I’m going into the 10th grade, that was the difference.</span> <span id="s1220">His eng – his English was fluent, mine was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Even though you had stayed for two years in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1223">My speech was not.</span> <span id="s1224">So there was a girl in school that I lamented to many times, Dorothy, because many time I just wanted to quit.</span> <span id="s1225">In 10th grade they teach [indecipherable] English.</span> <span id="s1226">And sh – she was right, but I was upset.</span> <span id="s1227">She said, I know e-eventually you’ll know it, but right now you don’t.</span> <span id="s1228">I mean, how different it is today, where they pass you no matter what.</span> <span id="s1229">She says, you don’t know it.</span> <span id="s1230">If you don’t know it, I can’t pass you.</span> <span id="s1231">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1232">But, by the time I graduated, I graduated with honors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Now, you’re saying that Bert Grumwalt(ph), you went to the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: No, no, different school.</span> <span id="s1235">He went to City College.</span> <span id="s1236">It’s not – it’s called City College, but it’s not a college, it’s a high school.</span> <span id="s1237">He was in 12th grade; I was in the 10th grade.</span> <span id="s1238">That bothered me.</span> <span id="s1239">Incidentally, he went to the European theater during the war; we lost track of each other.</span> <span id="s1240">He fought at the Battle of the Bulge, and was taken prisoner by the Germans, was wounded, almost died.</span> <span id="s1241">He recovered.</span> <span id="s1242">He’d spent several months at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, where he recovered.</span> <span id="s1243">He joined the si – h-he got a Master’s degree, I don’t know what in.</span> <span id="s1244">Do you remember – did he ever mention it?</span> <span id="s1245">I-I can’t remember, but – but he – he joined the CIA, and they sent him back to – to Germany.</span> <span id="s1246">He came back to the States and he went to work for Grundell(ph), a brokerage – Wall Street firm.</span> <span id="s1247">He became the manager of the Baltimore office, became very, very rich.</span> <span id="s1248">And I – I mean wealthy.</span> <span id="s1249">Lived in a penthouse in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1250">But we were good friends, and go out together.</span> <span id="s1251">He died, well, this February will be three years.</span> <span id="s1252">But you know, we had many memor – shared memories, although he was with a family and I didn’t know him in England, and – but he knew my cir – the circumstance that I lived on, and also my – my – my war experience.</span> <span id="s1253">He was sent to Europe, I – I – when I joined up they asked me what branch of service do you want to be in?</span> <span id="s1254">I – I said, you know, army.</span> <span id="s1255">Y-Yeah, but what particular service in the army?</span> <span id="s1256">So I – I don’t know, what’s my choice?</span> <span id="s1257">So they rattled off artillery, or the paratroopers, th-the tank corps, the infantry, you know, different – you know, quartermaster corps and so forth.</span> <span id="s1258">And then he said medical corps.</span> <span id="s1259">So I said medical [indecipherable] I think I’ll take the medical corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: What drew you to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1262">I thought that would – I would learn more.</span> <span id="s1263">I feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: 18.</span> <span id="s1266">I says, what am I gonna learn in the artillery, how to fire shell?</span> <span id="s1267">How – how’s that gonna be of help to me?</span> <span id="s1268">So I said, I’ll take the medical corps.</span> <span id="s1269">So when I – you’ll read the story there about how I got shipped to the Pacific, because I had no idea how to wind up in the – in the – going to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1270">I protested when – when I was given shipping orders that I was going to be sent to the Pacific, I – I protested.</span> <span id="s1271">I – I – is [indecipherable] one time they had a special program where they would send you to college.</span> <span id="s1272">In-Incidental, when I finished high school – I keep on going back and forth – the principal called me in, and re – we had become friends, a-and he said to me, how would you like to have a scholarship?</span> <span id="s1273">And I didn’t know what that was.</span> <span id="s1274">I – I said, what’s a scholarship?</span> <span id="s1275">So – so he’s – he’s explaining to me.</span> <span id="s1276">He said, Loyo-Loyola College is offering you a scholarship.</span> <span id="s1277">And he’s telling me that this is a Catholic school and – and – and what it’s like and so forth.</span> <span id="s1278">I says, a Catholic school is offering me a scholarship?</span> <span id="s1279">I says – I couldn’t believe this.</span> <span id="s1280">I says, do you – you mean it’s a Catholic an-and – I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1281">He says, oh la – no, do-don’t worry about that, they offered.</span> <span id="s1282">He says, the only thing is, is that you have to have an interview with the dean of admissions, but I don’t anticipate any problem.</span> <span id="s1283">So – so I went to see the dean of admission and everything is fine with him, except he wants me to promise that I will attend the school, if given a schol – made enough of a scholarship that I will actually accept it.</span> <span id="s1284">And the problem was that I already had received orders to go into the army.</span> <span id="s1285">I says, I can’t promise.</span> <span id="s1286">I don’t know when I will be called.</span> <span id="s1287">So – so I never accepted the scholarship.</span> <span id="s1288">But th-the surprise was the orders that I received after basic training, was to go to the Pacific, which I didn’t want, but I had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: You didn’t want because you wanted to go back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Europe, yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s1291">I speak German.</span> <span id="s1292">Why do you send me out to the Pacific?</span> <span id="s1293">And in college they have a special training where they – i-in the army they have a special training where they – the army will pay to send you to college.</span> <span id="s1294">So I said oh that – how wonderful.</span> <span id="s1295">So I applied.</span> <span id="s1296">So in order to be accepted, you – again, you have to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s1297">The only program available was German.</span> <span id="s1298">So the first question he is asking me, he says, I see in your resume here that you speak German, is that right?</span> <span id="s1299">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1300">He says, then why should we send you to college to study German?</span> <span id="s1301">By the way, it was called ASTP, Army Special Training Program.</span> <span id="s1302">I said, I want to go to college and this is the only thing you offer.</span> <span id="s1303">So, he rejects, whi-which made sense.</span> <span id="s1304">But then to turn around and send me to the Pacific made no sense.</span> <span id="s1305">But this is the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: In the meantime, in – while this is all happening, how much are you aware of what was happening back in Europe and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: – especially Nazi occupied Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1312">We have family over there, we have no idea what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1313">We ar-are very worried, very worried, but we – we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1314">We – we hope that somehow or other the – they’re okay, but we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Are you able to contact the uncle who made it to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Th – no.</span> <span id="s1317">The one whom – to Palestine?</span> <span id="s1318">No.</span> <span id="s1319">Don’t hear anything about him either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: What I-I – as a matter of fact, I don’t even know if he got to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1322">I mean, at that time, all I knew is he crossed the border into Yugoslavia, I never heard any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Just before the war ended was the first time I got a letter, where he wrote me how happy he was to find me, and described him – his situation in Israel.</span> <span id="s1325">And you know, I was his favorite and this and that and – but nos – I had had the medical training in the States and I had been made to believe that I would wind up in some sort of a hospital facility in the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1326">So I looked forward to that, working in the hospital, fine.</span> <span id="s1327">And we were on the water over a month, maybe five weeks on the water.</span> <span id="s1328">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1329">And if you read the description there, it was a freighter that had been converted into a troop ship.</span> <span id="s1330">And we were, as I say there, packed in like sardines, thousands of troops, and one on top of the other, we stacked on – on sort of a canvas bunk a-an – and – and there’s non – you can’t turn around, because it’s so close, and you got to climb up a for – four or five high, as to whe – where you’re gonna stay, a-an – a-and if you – you take a shower, but it’s salt water, and there’s no way that you can lather yourself in soap water, it just doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s1331">So – so it’s – it’s always sticky, and you ya – and you feel crummy.</span> <span id="s1332">And th – an-and – an-an-and it’s the same clothes, yo – you know, and there’s no change of clothes.</span> <span id="s1333">A-And you feel real miserable.</span> <span id="s1334">You get – i-in the – in this article I saw it was a – a preparation for jungle warfare.</span> <span id="s1335">But we were about five weeks on the water.</span> <span id="s1336">Today you can fly over there in one day.</span> <span id="s1337">But when I – we landed in [indecipherable] and I was there maybe a little over a week and then was back on the ship again, and where we going?</span> <span id="s1338">Everything was always secret, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1339">I mean, who am I gonna tell?</span> <span id="s1340">You see, but I was on – on the – even on the first sh – o-on the first troop ship [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: They were telling you that you can’t tell any – you were saying you can’t tell anyone where you are, but you didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: No, they weren’t telling us not to say anything, because there was nothing to say.</span> <span id="s1343">In other words, we – we were told nothing.</span> <span id="s1344">Where am I going?</span> <span id="s1345">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1346">So I made reference to that in – in the article that I hope you’ll find of interest, and wound up in [indecipherable] and then I’m put onto another troopship, and again, I ha – I don’t have the faintest idea.</span> <span id="s1347">But they have a roster and one day I’m being told that there was watch duty.</span> <span id="s1348">Watch duty you are on the deck with a rifle, and for about two hours – two hours off and – and four hours off.</span> <span id="s1349">I mean, two hours on and four hours off.</span> <span id="s1350">A-And I see my list as being chosen for on – for – for on duty.</span> <span id="s1351">I says, wait a minute, I says, I’m a medic.</span> <span id="s1352">We don’t carry weapons.</span> <span id="s1353">I says, why – why – so – so I says, wait a minute, there’s a mistake here.</span> <span id="s1354">I don’t do anything with weapons.</span> <span id="s1355">So the officer says to me, well, I don’t anything about what you tell me, I have nothing here about medic here.</span> <span id="s1356">He says, you in the infantry.</span> <span id="s1357">I says, no.</span> <span id="s1358">Well – well, that’s your assignment.</span> <span id="s1359">That’s the first time that I heard anything about the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Had you received any combat training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: No, we-well, yes, i-i-in basic training you receive – but – but not with weapons, if you’re a medic.</span> <span id="s1362">One time the – they took us out and we fired a machine gun and I fired the – a carbine and an M-1 rifle, yeah, I fired one time.</span> <span id="s1363">But th – but how to clean it, how to handle it [indecipherable] no – no extensive training.</span> <span id="s1364">Yeah, that one time it was a wa – how to disarm somebody who comes to – at you with a – with a bayonet on the rifle.</span> <span id="s1365">How to disarm that person.</span> <span id="s1366">That’s a-another story.</span> <span id="s1367">But I was assigned as a medic to the infantry, and from day one I hated it.</span> <span id="s1368">It is – first of all, the living conditions were so terrible.</span> <span id="s1369">The food was horrible.</span> <span id="s1370">Ev-Everything was powdered, we – we got nothing fresh.</span> <span id="s1371">You living in the jungle, a-and you know, i-insects crawling all over you.</span> <span id="s1372">And you know, I’m a city boy, I’m – you can’t take a bath, y-yo-yo-you know, it’s a – it takes weeks to get a letter.</span> <span id="s1373">A-And we were not directly – at least I was not directly involved in – in combat, but we – we got the wounded, and – an-and my job was principally thr-three directions; overcome shock, hemorrhage and fractures.</span> <span id="s1374">A-And you learn, it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s1375">Really, you know, I was astonished how much you can learn just by watching what somebody else does, and then sometimes having somebody who knows, come over and – and work with you, and so you learn those things.</span> <span id="s1376">How to apply traction, and how to apply support, and sa – and put on a cast and all that.</span> <span id="s1377">You know, you learn that, because later on, toward the end of the war, I was assigned to, you know, shipped to Hawaii, a-and – and there I became an instructor and the draft was still going on, and new recruits were coming in and I was lecturing in – in two subjects – three subjects; sanitation, first aid and venereal diseases.</span> <span id="s1378">And I always started off my lecture in venereal diseases, telling them that many times – at that time, when you got a venereal disease, you could be court-martialed and put into prison.</span> <span id="s1379">You may not know this, and it’s totally different today, but then, you know – so – so – so gonorrhea was a major problem to – to many, and disabling, and because it’s so infectious.</span> <span id="s1380">So – so I wou – I would start off my – my lecture with contrary to what you may have been told, that you cannot catch gonorrhea off a toilet seat, I want to assure you that that is incorrect.</span> <span id="s1381">It is possible to get gonorrhea off a toilet seat, but it’s a hell of a place to take your girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1382">You see, because many times, when you asked a soldier, how did you get this?</span> <span id="s1383">You see, oh, I don’t know, maybe off a toilet seat, you know.</span> <span id="s1384">It’s really nonsense, you see it was – so but this was – got a big laugh, and – and – and I would have the attention of the audience.</span> <span id="s1385">A-And when the war had ended, but I was still in Hawaii, and troops were being repatriated back to the country, I asked the commanding officer if he will authorize me to go to the university there, so he said okay.</span> <span id="s1386">So I went to the – for a little while to the University of Hawaii.</span> <span id="s1387">An-And then when I came back, I-I – you know, I thought I’d become a doctor, until one day I met a guy who had graduated from high school with me, and you know, hi Herb, you know, Phil, how are you doing?</span> <span id="s1388">We start talking to each other, where – what are you doing now?</span> <span id="s1389">I says, well, I’m going to college park, I’ve been accepted to be pre-med.</span> <span id="s1390">So he says, why do you want to go to pre-med?</span> <span id="s1391">He says, you know, when you finish it, what do you got?</span> <span id="s1392">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1393">Then you still gotta go to med school, right?</span> <span id="s1394">I says yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s1395">He says, well, why don’t you go to pharmacy school?</span> <span id="s1396">I says, why should I go to pharmacy?</span> <span id="s1397">I want to become – he says, no, he says, you use that as your pre-med.</span> <span id="s1398">And this way you at least have a degree as a pharmacist and you – and you can work during the summer and then pay for medical school – because I had no money.</span> <span id="s1399">So I thought it was a good idea.</span> <span id="s1400">The – the problem was that it was mid-August and school starts in September.</span> <span id="s1401">So – so, how do I get in?</span> <span id="s1402">Because at that time so many thousands of soldiers came out, an-and they all wanted to go into – applied to Hopkins.</span> <span id="s1403">Hopkins turned me down and said, reapply next year.</span> <span id="s1404">Well, you’re not going to sit around for a whole year.</span> <span id="s1405">Now I’m in my 20s, 21 or 22 years old.</span> <span id="s1406">So I – you know, I’ve – I thought about it, I says, you know, it’s not a bad idea, but would I get in?</span> <span id="s1407">So – so I-I went there, and I asked to meet th-the dean of admission, was a elderly woman.</span> <span id="s1408">And she gave me the same answer, she says, we – we can admit you next year, but our classes are closed.</span> <span id="s1409">I don’t think it’s gonna be possible.</span> <span id="s1410">She says, well, if somebody last minute doesn’t want to come in, you know, maybe.</span> <span id="s1411">I’ll give you an application, she says, but I wouldn’t bet on it.</span> <span id="s1412">I-I-I don’t think that it’s gonna be possible.</span> <span id="s1413">So I said to her – her name was Kohl(ph).</span> <span id="s1414">I-I-I said, Dean Kohl(ph), if you admit me, I’ll come back and kiss you.</span> <span id="s1415">The whole of – the whole office there overheard this conversation, they all burst out laughing.</span> <span id="s1416">But I got in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: And did you come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: I – I came back, but I didn’t kiss her.</span> <span id="s1419">So – so I – I guess that’s the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: I have just one last question.</span> <span id="s1421">How did you end up learning about what happened back in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: We thr – through the Red Cross, got the notification that my uncle, you know, my mother’s brother had been sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1423">And – and then gradually we heard that his son, my cousin, he was 18 years old, he was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1424">And the most difficult thing for my mother was to learn that the husbands of her sisters and the children had survived, but the sisters had not.</span> <span id="s1425">A-And mentally, she was finished after this.</span> <span id="s1426">I-It was – life at home was o – was, from then on was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1427">Later on when the – I – I went back into the army, by the way, during the Korean War, an-and became a commissioned officer.</span> <span id="s1428">But – and we lived in Virginia for 40 years, but every time I went home, all I had to do was open the door an-and – and it was – she’d talk about the brother and the sister, and the brother and the sister and why and this and that.</span> <span id="s1429">An-And a certain regret.</span> <span id="s1430">It’s just difficult.</span> <span id="s1431">She should have left me in England and should have worked on getting out the brother.</span> <span id="s1432">I was safe.</span> <span id="s1433">And maybe she could have helped the brother at that time.</span> <span id="s1434">And I – I knew she was right.</span> <span id="s1435">So – so you carry that burden, you know, am I responsible, you know, and – you know, I just – could I have done something, you know, who – who – about my uncle, who should I have talked to?</span> <span id="s1436">I mean, I didn’t know anybody, I – you know, where, what?</span> <span id="s1437">I mean, I don’t even know where – where is he?</span> <span id="s1438">What’s the address, you know?</span> <span id="s1439">And – and even if I have the address, I mean, who – who – who is gonna do what?</span> <span id="s1440">I don’t know what’s happening to me from day to – one to the next day, so – so how am I – well, but – but you have that complex of guilt, you know, that he is my friend, I didn’t do anything for him.</span> <span id="s1441">A-A-And then you hear about the other kids, a million and a half, you know, and I survived and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1442">And why did I survive?</span> <span id="s1443">A-And you know, for many years, while I was busy working in the off – in the – in the pharmacy, and my wife can tell you, I was okay.</span> <span id="s1444">It was when I stopped working that all this came back to me, a-and it to – to this day, you know, I’m very much troubled.</span> <span id="s1445">And – and for a while, I had to get some help.</span> <span id="s1446">Well, that, I guess is enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: A-As an interviewer, or interviewee, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: You’re the interviewee, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: I’m the interviewee.</span> <span id="s1451">I don’t want you to get carried away with my story, or – or – or for me to unload my troubles onto you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: No, I’m – I’m honored that you chose to speak to us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: I – I thought I had a mental problem for many years.</span> <span id="s1454">A guilt complex.</span> <span id="s1455">And then I saw a film, “Into the Arms of Strangers.”</span> <span id="s1456">If you have seen the film –</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: I’ve seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: The documents that you see in that film, are mine.</span> <span id="s1459">If you look at the line of credits, you will see my name.</span> <span id="s1460">By the way, you can even get a much clearer picture, since you are at the Holocaust Museum, go into the library, ask for the book, then look up my name.</span> <span id="s1461">An – because – an-and by the way, the – Deborah Oppenheimer, the producer, gave me a copy of the book, an-and thanked me for the contribution I made to it.</span> <span id="s1462">I don’t mean financially.</span> <span id="s1463">I would love to – and they gave us a copy, but it’s a – o-of the film, but it’s a VCR, a-and – and – and if they have it now on the CD –</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1465">I watched it on DVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: I would love to get ahold of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1468">I can – I can look into that for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: And the Austrian attaché asked me how she – how she could get ahold of the film.</span> <span id="s1470">But in the film, if you go back to it, you’ll see other people talking about survivor guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: You see.</span> <span id="s1473">So when I saw that film, in a way, I felt better.</span> <span id="s1474">Because for a while I thought it was me going crazy, you see, but then I saw that, you know, it was quite normal, because others had felt the same way.</span> <span id="s1475">So – so yo-you spend a couple of hours together, a-and I hope I didn’t overwhelm y-you with my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Not at all, I thought it was fascinating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: And if you have any additional questions, y-you have my phone number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: And if you want to visit us, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: A-And maybe – maybe we’ll talk about other things, more pleasant –</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: – that you’ll find of interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">End of File Four</span></p> <p><span
