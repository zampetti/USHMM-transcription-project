Abraham was sent to gymnasium in Czechowice, and then attended university in Krakow.</span> <span id="s7">Although he had the best grades, as a Jew, he was not admitted to medical school in Poland, so he attended medical school in Prague for a year or two.</span> <span id="s8">He returned to Poland and attended law school in Krakow.</span> <span id="s9">He had a thriving general law practice at the family home outside of Rozwadów for two years before the Germans invaded Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">When they learned of the German invasion, Abraham, their sister Hanna, and a brother went to Russian-controlled Lvov, a four or five hour train ride.</span> <span id="s11">They walked and rode on a horse-drawn wagon part of the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Germans later evicted Laura and her parents from their house, and they headed toward Lvov.</span> <span id="s13">“Nobody knows where to go…It was just a terrible thing to live it through,” Laura says.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">They found Laura’s brothers and sisters in Lvov, and lived together.</span> <span id="s15">After a few weeks or months, Russians took Laura and her parents from the house, and sent them to Russia.</span> <span id="s16">Abraham and Hanna were out at their jobs.</span> <span id="s17">The Russians had given Abraham an office job.</span> <span id="s18">He moved in with a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">In 1940 or 1941, Russians sent away rich Poles and others in cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">After the war, Laura found the woman with whom Abraham had lived.</span> <span id="s21">.</span> <span id="s22">She told Laura that Abraham said a man had warned him that the Russians were coming for him.</span> <span id="s23">He said he would not sleep at her apartment that night.</span> <span id="s24">Neither she nor anyone else ever saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Question: If you could just state the names and date of birth and place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Answer: Of those two, this is my brother so he would be now – he was born in 1908.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Do you remember his birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yeah, 17 of January.</span> <span id="s29">I still remember.</span> <span id="s30">(indistinct)</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What was your brother’s full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A:

was three years older than you are?</span> <span id="s40">And he’s the eldest in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s42">But my sister is older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: You had a sister in between your older brother and yourself?</span> <span id="s44">What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Her name is Clara.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your brother, what you remember about him from your childhood?</span> <span id="s47">What was he like as a little boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Like every little boy.</span> <span id="s49">When he was 10, 11 years old and he finished public school so my parents send him in a bigger town where they have a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s50">That means a high school like here.</span> <span id="s51">Because they were family so he was there and he finished school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Which town was the school in, do you

parents sent him to Czechoslovakia, to Prague, in a medical school.</span> <span id="s113">He was there only a year or two, I don’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Before the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah, this was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: You said only a year or two before the war.</span> <span id="s117">That’s when he went to

<span id="s132">The produce and the machines and everything.</span> <span id="s133">But there were places in Poland that they had more than now it—a place, or now an estate or something.</span> <span id="s134">So he was going there and buying like variants (76).</span> <span id="s135">A big amounts, ten tons, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s136">For those people, that was much cheaper than to buy there because they didn’t have in the industrial (81) state where we were living.</span> <span id="s137">So that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s138">He was always on the go.</span></p> <p><span

Rozwadów?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: From our house.</span> <span id="s307">So we start to go in the same direction.</span> <span id="s308">I don’t know why they are because when they left, they didn’t know where they go and we didn’t know where they go.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Oh, so they didn’t have a specific plan to go to Lvov?</span> <span id="s310">They were just running to the East?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No, from other towns they run to Rozwadów.</span> <span id="s312">From Rozwadów, they—nobody knows where to go or why they go.</span> <span id="s313">It was just a terrible thing to live it through.</span> <span id="s314">What else you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Did you--?</span> <span id="s316">Now you were with your parents, right?</span>

doing in Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: {Yeah, before the war.</span> <span id="s394">I think that’s why, in fact, they had an individual--.</span> <span id="s395">Not before the war, during the war.</span> <span id="s396">I think that’s why, in fact, he’s got that individual article in there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s397">I don’t remember it that clearly but he was working to help other people to get out or do different kinds off—to save themselves in some way.</span> <span id="s398">In the process, somehow, he was caught up.}</span> <span id="s399">Helped the people, he sent
