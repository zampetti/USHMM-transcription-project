Harry Tabrys in Potomac, Maryland.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Tabrys, could you please tell me your name, your name during the war, your date of birth, your place of birth and then anything you possibly can about your childhood and growing up in your town; and where you went to school and about your family, and--, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">My name is Harry Tabrys.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Vilna, Poland in 1924.</span> <span id="s7">The exact day would be March 4.</span> <span id="s8">We were a family of six children and my parents, of course, were a family; I mean a larger family of aunts and uncles and grandparents.</span> <span id="s9">I myself was the second one after my older brother.</span> <span id="s10">I went to school in Vilna.</span> <span id="s11">Actually I went to three schools.</span> <span id="s12">I started out with a Hebrew school, then I went to a Jewish school and then switched to a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Could you tell me the difference between a Hebrew school and a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Hebrew was a cheder--was strictly a cheder.</span> <span id="s15">Jewish school was mostly Jewish language plus the Polish language.</span> <span id="s16">The public school was strictly, everything was taught in Polish.</span> <span id="s17">The reason was financially because public school was supported by the government and didn't cost you as much whereas the others you had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s18">In other words, like you go to private schools here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Was the Jewish school run by a particular organization or was it private Tarbut (24) schools or something like that or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">I actually don't remember.</span> <span id="s21">As far as I know, you used to pay monthly.</span> <span id="s22">You used to have pay monthly because it was privately.</span> <span id="s23">By what kind of an organization it was run, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Also, were you called Harry in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">In Poland my name was Aaron.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Aaron.</span> <span id="s27">Then you were called Aaron by your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Aaron.</span> <span id="s29">In fact, the town where I come from, you know.</span> <span id="s30">They didn't call me Aaron.</span> <span id="s31">My name as it is written in Polish is written Aron but they called me Arke (30).</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Arke?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">How would you spell that in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">In English, A-r-k-e.</span> <span id="s36">Because in the town, everybody by whatever name you had, had the end of the name was always k-e, always k-e.</span> <span id="s37">My childhood, of course, I mean in a family where there's six kids and the sole provider was my father, was not easy.</span> <span id="s38">As the time progressed and it came closer and closer towards 1939, the anti- semitism was growing and the Jewish worker was losing more and more as far as his source of support.</span> <span id="s39">The situation, the economic situation got worse and worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">What was your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">My father's occupation was, actually he was a chimney sweep.</span> <span id="s42">Besides that he used to do all kinds of masonry.</span> <span id="s43">He made a living I mean as far as I can remember.</span> <span id="s44">When my older brother got of age, for instance, I would say about the age of 14, he was already helping out with my father.</span> <span id="s45">I was still going to school.</span> <span id="s46">Life, I mean, as far as social life was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s47">Vilna was know as town most progressive in Jewish and Hebrew education.</span> <span id="s48">It was renowned for the Yivo (53), they call it.</span> <span id="s49">Also that--one of the biggest rabbis comes to Vilna, they call it Vilna Goan (55).</span> <span id="s50">We enjoyed ourselves amongst, the Jewish population I'm talking about, enjoyed ourselves spiritually and intellectually very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Was your family observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">No, the fact of the matter is that my grandfather, the one that I do remember, my mother's father and mother, they were very observant.</span> <span id="s53">They forced us, in other words the boys, my brother and myself, they forced us to go to temple with them until about the age about 12 or 13, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s54">But my father and mother, they were not too observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">You didn't keep Shabbos?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Yes.</span> <span id="s57">There's no question about it.</span> <span id="s58">Was a kosher home.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Oh, it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">But they were not too observant.</span> <span id="s61">By that I mean they didn't go to temple as a lot of them did in--especially when it came Friday and Saturday.</span> <span id="s62">But our parents, they forced us to go with them.</span> <span id="s63">Till it came to the age when we seen a lot of others started to belong to organizations which were more or less freethinkers.</span> <span id="s64">We stopped to go, rebelled and started to go around in groups and join for instance, some of them joined Hahomer Hatzair; some of them joined Betar, some of them joined the Bund.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Were you involved in any one of --?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Yes, I belonged to the organization, the underground organization supposedly that a lot of them thought because of the Polish anti- semitism and Russia right there next to, bordering Poland--they thought it was best to belong to the communist organization.</span> <span id="s67">What did I know much in--as far as life in Russia, at age 12 or 13.</span> <span id="s68">So you used to get together, illegally supposedly because the communist organization was in Poland, they were underground.</span> <span id="s69">In other words, they were not allowed to be open.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">What was this organization called?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">I don't remember the name of it but there was always around a little older, an instructor we used together for a couple of years before the war started.</span> <span id="s72">We didn't do any special activities, just indoctrinated us.</span> <span id="s73">Then again as the time went further and much closer, it was 1939, things happened in our household.</span> <span id="s74">Rather it was already in 1939 when the war started and Germany occupied half of Poland and Russia occupied the part where I was born.</span> <span id="s75">The time of the occupation occurred, I've heard my older brother, because of the economic situation, my older brother started to go and organize some food.</span> <span id="s76">Went to the Russian side and one day was caught crossing the border.</span> <span id="s77">He was arrested and he was sent away.</span> <span id="s78">Because of it, me, being the second one in the household, the oldest one, at that time, my father had an accident, you know.</span> <span id="s79">He lost the sight almost, in both eyes.</span> <span id="s80">Because he was unable to provide for the family, I was the one to take over it.</span> <span id="s81">I was the sole provider.</span> <span id="s82">You can imagine the next two years, me a fourteen year old boy providing for the family with the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s83">It happened that my father, thank God, he had an operation.</span> <span id="s84">Both retinas were detached--he had an operation and somehow he regained most of his sight.</span> <span id="s85">But still he wasn't able to do much because he can't; in an operation like that you're not supposed to lift, or strain yourself or anything like it.</span> <span id="s86">It was very, very rough.</span> <span id="s87">Then it came the time, all of a sudden in 1941 when Germany started a war against Russia and the whole thing turned upside down.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">How was it though during the occupation, the early occupation?</span> <span id="s89">You were allowed to work?</span> <span id="s90">It was, I mean, the Russians didn't persecute you?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">The fact of the matter is that while the Russians were there, they formed what they call--like unions.</span> <span id="s92">Each trade--they formed a union of each trade and each trade--and I mean there was foremen and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s93">Me, being already the age of 15, almost 16, I started to belong to the same trade organization, all these that are chimney sweeps for instance, Poles or Jews, all belonged to this trade organization.</span> <span id="s94">They took away private enterprise.</span> <span id="s95">For instance, people that had stores, they confiscated it.</span> <span id="s96">Any trade, you had to belong to one group, like you call a union here.</span> <span id="s97">Being that I started to belong to these organization, our situation a little bit improved because of the fact that they didn't discriminate.</span> <span id="s98">Somehow, we managed a little bit better because we didn't have this anti-semitism that used to be before the Russian came in.</span> <span id="s99">Then, in between the government changed.</span> <span id="s100">Russians gave the town to the Lithuanians; Lithuanians were there nine months.</span> <span id="s101">After that were kicked out and Russians took it back until the moment when the war between Germany and Russia broke out.</span> <span id="s102">Everything went haywire, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Can I ask you, can I back up for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Mostly Jewish, Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">When the Russians came, did you know Russian or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">I started to learn by myself.</span> <span id="s109">As a matter of fact is I have learned to a point.</span> <span id="s110">Didn't go to school, didn't have the time because I had to support, had to work.</span> <span id="s111">But they brought in Russian films, Russian literature and everything.</span> <span id="s112">By myself, I learned the language, learned to speak because the Slavic language, Polish and Russian are little bit, you might say, more or less, related.</span> <span id="s113">I even learned how to write by myself in those two years.</span> <span id="s114">But I've since forgotten.</span> <span id="s115">I still hear when somebody speaks to me Russian, I understand what they're saying.</span> <span id="s116">Lithuanian language, I never learned.</span> <span id="s117">There wasn't much time for it.</span> <span id="s118">They were only there about nine months.</span> <span id="s119">The main language that we spoke in our family was Yiddish which was the main language of all the Jewish population in Wilna.</span> <span id="s120">Then, like I said, again when the war broke out at that time, I happened to be--there was an epidemic, typhoid epidemic in town.</span> <span id="s121">I got sick a few weeks before.</span> <span id="s122">I was laid up in hospital and when the war broke out, I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s123">But still and all and as much as I could, I got together the few friends because we knew already what was going on in Germany all these years before the Germans occupied half of Poland, especially after they occupied, we knew what was going on, we heard a lot.</span> <span id="s124">If your friends started to run away as much as you could toward the Russian side.</span> <span id="s125">Problem was because of my previous illness and without any proper transportation, we couldn't go too far.</span> <span id="s126">The Germans in the blitzkrieg, went so far ahead, way ahead of us.</span> <span id="s127">We had no choice but to return home.</span> <span id="s128">When we came back at home all the decrees started, every single day a new decree started.</span> <span id="s129">Little by little, first it started out by grabbing the young or the middle-aged man, they started to grab for work.</span> <span id="s130">Some of them never came back.</span> <span id="s131">Then, all of a sudden, they changed their policy and we thought that they're going to grab the men and the young boys so we started to hide out.</span> <span id="s132">One of these days, they reversed the policy.</span> <span id="s133">Instead of taking the young men and the grown-ups, they took all the women, the elderly and the children.</span> <span id="s134">The first time they did that, I remember there's more intent housing or something like that.</span> <span id="s135">They gathered them together and about six kilometers out of town was a place called Ponari (189).</span> <span id="s136">That's where they killed them all.</span> <span id="s137">We didn't know at the time but that's what it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">This was the Issacs group then?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">There was the Issacson group (194) together with the Lithuania.</span> <span id="s140">That time already they forced, not they forced, they volunteered.</span> <span id="s141">They, Lithuanian a lot of them, volunteered in the SS and they did it together with them.</span> <span id="s142">There was a place that had some dug, some big trenches for oil storage, the Russian did that.</span> <span id="s143">That's where the first killing started.</span> <span id="s144">As a matter of fact, over the years, they killed half, at least half of the population, the Jewish population were killed down there.</span> <span id="s145">This how it happened that my mother and the youngest four children, they took them; it was six weeks after the occupation.</span> <span id="s146">I remained with my father.</span> <span id="s147">My older brother was in Russia and about a week or two later, they formed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s148">At first they formed two ghettos.</span> <span id="s149">We were lucky in a sense in the beginning that one of the ghettos that they formed, we lived right on the premises.</span> <span id="s150">We didn't have to move.</span> <span id="s151">The rest of the family, for instance, my father's brother and his family, my uncle; my father's sister, my aunt; the grandparents were already--they were killed also in the first massacre.</span> <span id="s152">They were forced and could take whatever belongings they could and they were brought into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s153">After a couple of weeks, they decide to liquidate one of the ghettos in which I was and they transported, some of them transported, the more able, the younger ones, transported to the bigger ghetto which was only, you might say, just across the street.</span> <span id="s154">The first one, the smaller ghetto, they liquidated it.</span> <span id="s155">Whoever was again according to them, too young, too old, mothers with children, they sent to Ponari.</span> <span id="s156">In the beginning, nobody knew exactly where they went but it didn't take long.</span> <span id="s157">Later on we found that out.</span> <span id="s158">This is how life started in the ghetto and the ghetto there was only about six streets.</span> <span id="s159">The six streets and the six streets they squeezed together in the beginning, they squeezed together about 50 or 60 thousand people.</span> <span id="s160">Little by little, the ghetto took about two years.</span> <span id="s161">Every now and then they came and they cleaned out as they say, they pulled out a certain amount of people.</span> <span id="s162">They requested, let's say the Jewish police, they should help them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">What did you do, did you work while you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">I did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Oh you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s167">I was fortunate while I was in ghetto, I was fortunate enough to be able to go out on the outside by myself because according to my occupation, I was--.</span> <span id="s168">They divided the town into nine zones and I was given one of the zones.</span> <span id="s169">I was given with three Polish workers in the same occupation.</span> <span id="s170">I had to join them every morning and go to work with them.</span> <span id="s171">This way, I was fortunate that I could go by myself without a guard and come back by myself without a guard.</span> <span id="s172">Of course, you weren't allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s173">You had to wear the yellow star on both sides but most of the people that went out to work on the outside of the ghetto, they had to go with a guard to work and back home to the ghetto, My father remained working in the ghetto and I was going on the outside.</span> <span id="s174">On the outside you had opportunities; you meet people, I mean the Polish population, of course.</span> <span id="s175">You had opportunities to somehow organize as far as food was concerned.</span> <span id="s176">You bartered clothing for food whatever you could and you smuggled food into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s177">Of course, it was life-threatening.</span> <span id="s178">If you got caught, you could be shot.</span> <span id="s179">In fact, the same group that was working on the outside the same trade, we formed a group, we organized it so we could smuggle in as much food as we could.</span> <span id="s180">We couldn't say that we starved for hunger as far as food is concerned.</span> <span id="s181">But we lived in always you lived in ghetto without knowing what the next day is going to bring.</span> <span id="s182">Because every couple of days, every couple of weeks we had different rules and different--how should I say?</span> <span id="s183">they came out with--in Yiddish they call it gzetzin (284)--</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Ordinances?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Ordinances.</span> <span id="s186">Every day and everything was designed so to make you feel more secure.</span> <span id="s187">It was always the opposite what you thought is going to be.</span> <span id="s188">Little by little as the time went on, they were taking out more and more people and the ghetto is getting less and less and less.</span> <span id="s189">Still in the ghetto, while we were there, surprisingly enough, the ghetto was organized with a lot of self-help.</span> <span id="s190">We had should I say, clinics, for instance.</span> <span id="s191">There was a hospital there in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s192">Everything was manned by the Jewish.</span> <span id="s193">There was kitchens, people couldn't afford meals.</span> <span id="s194">There was even the organized concerts, within ourselves.</span> <span id="s195">Of course, it was illegal.</span> <span id="s196">Was a little library that you could go in and to read something.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Where did you live in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">In the ghetto, wherever there's left, I mean, from the six streets.</span> <span id="s199">Five story houses mostly.</span> <span id="s200">All five story houses and they squeezed us in, you might say, in a room, you could have three or four families.</span> <span id="s201">It was--the sanitary conditions was horrible because you didn't have no running water.</span> <span id="s202">Electricity, they had.</span> <span id="s203">Some of them had, for instance, a toilet but it was a general toilet for the whole--could have been in this house, it's a big house, could have been fifty or sixty apartments.</span> <span id="s204">Imagine each apartment was about God knows how many families.</span> <span id="s205">There was one toilet in the whole house, all the way down.</span> <span id="s206">Sanitary conditions is much to be desired.</span> <span id="s207">Was going on like that, you know, for almost two years until it came, I suppose, the order to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s208">When the order came to liquidate the ghetto, by that time already we knew where the rest of the families went.</span> <span id="s209">Before that already our resistance formed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s210">Resistance consisted of people that belonged to organizations before the ones I mentioned previously.</span> <span id="s211">They tried to organize, to some armaments, like guns, ammunition.</span> <span id="s212">In fact many times, me being able to go out by myself, they required my help by bringing in guns that were bought on the outside.</span> <span id="s213">I helped them with that.</span> <span id="s214">Most of the people that belonged to the organizations were in their twenties and they somehow contacted Warsaw and they heard what was going on in Warsaw, how they organized themselves.</span> <span id="s215">They wanted to do the same thing there but it didn't work out that way.</span> <span id="s216">Not too long before the liquidation of the ghetto, the Germans knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s217">I suppose because there was a lot of people, especially in the Jewish police, they hoped that they're going to survive and they squealed.</span> <span id="s218">They knew where they were and one day they came in in the ghetto---.</span> <span id="s219">One day they came in the Germans, the SS and they knew exactly where the underground people were hiding.</span> <span id="s220">They put dynamite in one of the buildings and they blew it up.</span> <span id="s221">With that, the resistance collapsed and whoever could, run out of the ghetto through the underground tunnels, the water, the sewers and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s222">Most of them went to the forest where they organized themselves as partisans.</span> <span id="s223">The rest of us remained until the last minute until the liquidation of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">So you remained in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">I remained in the ghetto until about two weeks before the complete liquidation I was caught and I was shipped away to Estonia.</span> <span id="s226">In Estonia I was there for about a year.</span> <span id="s227">In Estonia they call it working camps, it's not liquidation camps, I mean.</span> <span id="s228">There were numerous working camps in Estonia.</span> <span id="s229">I happened to be in seven of them.</span> <span id="s230">I was shipped around from one to the other.</span> <span id="s231">Then I mean the situation in the camps was not the same like in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Was this between 1942 or '43?</span> <span id="s233">.</span> <span id="s234">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">That was between 1943 and '44.</span> <span id="s236">The liquidation of the ghetto was in '43.</span> <span id="s237">The year I was there was from 1943 to '44.</span> <span id="s238">Like I mentioned before, I was in seven different camps.</span> <span id="s239">What I went through there and everybody with me, it's undescribable because--just to give you a for instance--.</span> <span id="s240">When it came first to one of the camps, was a transition camp.</span> <span id="s241">There a couple of weeks and they send us out another camp.</span> <span id="s242">It started out to be colder at that time, winter was approaching.</span> <span id="s243">We were given, for the first time we were given the stripes, jacket and the striped pants.</span> <span id="s244">The shoes were wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s245">The winter started out with snow and the snow accumulated on the shoes, you couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s246">It was from one camp to the other and one camp became--we went out in the morning, we came back at night, the camp burned down completely.</span> <span id="s247">There was nowheres to go.</span> <span id="s248">Now this camps, I contacted typhoid again.</span> <span id="s249">How I survived almost three hundred--I think a tenth, ten percent survived.</span> <span id="s250">I remember like today, it was on New Year's Even, took the ten percent of us and they transported us from this camp to another.</span> <span id="s251">One of the camps we came, we were there the longest; we were about six months that was better already because each day when they took us to work, I used to escape and rifle information and went to work and scrounged whatever I could in order to survive.</span> <span id="s252">Then before they came in, I mean came back to the ghetto, to the camp, I used to smuggle in and went to the ghetto with them.</span> <span id="s253">In the end, we were as far away as Narva (423) which is a town not too far from Finland.</span> <span id="s254">Then the Russians started to come closer and closer.</span> <span id="s255">As they came closer, they took a lot of us and transported us back to Germany.</span> <span id="s256">In fact, they took a transport, if I remember correctly, for about four or five thousand and put us on a ship and transported us all the way to the Baltic Sea to Stuthof (432) which was concentration camp.</span> <span id="s257">There were Germans, if I remember correctly, there were Germans standing there right on the dock.</span> <span id="s258">They were begging army they should take them because they felt that the Russians were right there behind them.</span> <span id="s259">They let them stay and they took us instead.</span> <span id="s260">Why, I never could figure out.</span> <span id="s261">They brought us back to Stuthof.</span> <span id="s262">We were there in Stuthof, it was a big concentration camp; we were there for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s263">They had us formed again brooks and send us into Germany, somewheres in Bavaria, a place called Daumer_____-(44).</span> <span id="s264">A thousand people.</span> <span id="s265">This was the worst of them all.</span> <span id="s266">How I survived, I can't imagine to this day.</span> <span id="s267">There wasn't a thing I didn't do in order to get something extra to eat.</span> <span id="s268">There you couldn't go out, you couldn't scrounge, you couldn't beg, you had to work.</span> <span id="s269">Sanitary conditions were unbearable.</span> <span id="s270">The place was just full of mud.</span> <span id="s271">If anybody was, let's say, a little bit weak and had to walk through the mud especially now when it got a little bit colder and the mud froze a little bit on top.</span> <span id="s272">If anybody had to walk there, to the latrine what they call it, a toilet, outside toilet and they sunk into the mud, they couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s273">They died there on the spot.</span> <span id="s274">There were deaths every single day and every single night.</span> <span id="s275">They had the latrine in a barrack.</span> <span id="s276">The barrack consisted, they used to bring you later on more and more people, the barrack consisted of a thousand people approximately.</span> <span id="s277">There were a lot of nationalities brought in, Poles, Russians, people were dying there like flies.</span> <span id="s278">So in order to survive, there was a latrine, it was like a wheelbarrow except without wheels, just with handles.</span> <span id="s279">The front handles in the back.</span> <span id="s280">People with all kinds of diseases used to go to the latrine and they had to have a couple of volunteers to get it out this here on the outside and dump it.</span> <span id="s281">I volunteered for an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s282">This is somehow how I survived.</span> <span id="s283">To tell you about the sanitary conditions, there were operations being performed and I mean by Jewish doctors, people had gangrene and all that stuff, with real butcher knives.</span> <span id="s284">Didn't have no instruments, didn't have anesthesia.</span> <span id="s285">The lice are crawling all around us.</span> <span id="s286">They had one stove, a big stove, a pot-belly stove in the middle of the barrack.</span> <span id="s287">Talking about a barrack, it looked like a hanger and from both sides, it was a-- sleeped three rows, we sleeped on straw, bunks.</span> <span id="s288">I used to go at night, used to go down there to the stove, the pot-belly stove because they had to use a lot of coal.</span> <span id="s289">The stove was red hot, take off my clothes and by the stove, try to kill the lice.</span> <span id="s290">I'm shivering while I'm talking about it because if I remind myself, it's no wonder.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">We'll stop and turn the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Okay.</span> <span id="s293">(End of Side A, Tape I) In this camp I was talking about, last point out when I was there for about nine months.</span> <span id="s294">One day, a few months before we were shipped out of there, all of a sudden the conditions started to improve.</span> <span id="s295">We couldn't figure out why.</span> <span id="s296">We found it out after we were liberated; we found it out what was happening.</span> <span id="s297">Turns out Himmler was negotiating with some Jewish organization or with the Red Cross about a certain amount, to spare a certain amount of Jewish, mostly kids for a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s298">Because they already knew, they figured that the Third Reich is not going to last too long.</span> <span id="s299">They were willing to show the Red Cross the conditions in certain camps how they are, not as bad as the whole world was talking about.</span> <span id="s300">So they started to improve the conditions.</span> <span id="s301">First of all, what they did is, they cleaned it up.</span> <span id="s302">For instance, in our camp like I told you, there was mud mostly so they made sidewalks out of planks that you could walk on.</span> <span id="s303">They changed everybody's _____(18); they changed the clothes and they send us, they bathed us and unloused us, what they call it.</span> <span id="s304">In other words, got rid of the lice; improved the rations a little bit.</span> <span id="s305">That itself was a little bit help.</span> <span id="s306">Nobody came, nobody looked into it, until it came the time they shipped us out from there and the main reason they shipped us out is because the war was closing in.</span> <span id="s307">They tried to save themselves; they tried to--hoped to take a certain amount of the, what they call the heflinger, which were us, the prisoners, together with them.</span> <span id="s308">They were talking about that in the Alps they had some tunnels in the mountains there and they would survive there.</span> <span id="s309">They needed some ______(29) to work for them.</span> <span id="s310">They transported us--first they brought us into Dachau.</span> <span id="s311">In Dachau, I was there for about three weeks.</span> <span id="s312">As the Americans was coming closer from the west and the south and the Russians from the east, little by little, it got more and more dangerous for them and they transported us from Dachau.</span> <span id="s313">In Dachau we were there we weren't doing a thing.</span> <span id="s314">We weren't given anything to eat practically and we weren't doing--we were unable because we didn't have no strength.</span> <span id="s315">They transported us by cattle cars of course, along towards the Alps.</span> <span id="s316">In May, it was April 30, 1945, May 1st, I remember like the day--.</span> <span id="s317">It was a very, very cold and snowy day.</span> <span id="s318">It was coming down, snow was coming down, wet snow was coming down from April 30th at night to May 1st.</span> <span id="s319">American planes was coming overhead.</span> <span id="s320">We woke up on May 1st, we didn't find no more SS guards, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s321">We were left in our own.</span> <span id="s322">It was a little town and the-- nearby was where the train stopped.</span> <span id="s323">We were all started to walk towards it and tried to get some clothing, some food, whatever we could from the German population there.</span> <span id="s324">The town was called Stathga (49).</span> <span id="s325">Everybody more or less in groups, I was in a group with another four guys.</span> <span id="s326">We found a place where to sleep and we organized some food and didn't take too long, the Americans, the army, they came--the kitchens with food.</span> <span id="s327">With special, in other words, to delouse us again, to clean us with, like showers and stuff like that; with powders to clean us up and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s328">Some of the people dispersed themselves in private houses and took over where the Germans lived.</span> <span id="s329">They were more able to do, stronger.</span> <span id="s330">Some of them, like me, I didn't have the strength to stand on my feet.</span> <span id="s331">If I weighed 90 pounds, it was a lot.</span> <span id="s332">They give us food and the food was very, very greasy, a lot of pork and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s333">People being hungry ate anything in sight.</span> <span id="s334">They got diarrhea a lot of them, died from it.</span> <span id="s335">How I survived, I got diarrhea too, how I survived, I still don't know.</span> <span id="s336">I remember one thing--about two nights before we were liberated, the Red Cross dispersed for all these--for each one of us, a care package.</span> <span id="s337">The care package if I remember correctly--there was a can of ham, piece of chocolate and a pack of cigarettes, Camels.</span> <span id="s338">I used to smoke before.</span> <span id="s339">I saw the Camel cigarettes; I started to smoke.</span> <span id="s340">I thought I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s341">I mean there was--too strong for me, too overpowering.</span> <span id="s342">Anyhow, after this, after the food and everything else, we were there for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s343">They gathered us and they brought us, all of us, to a DP camp called Wel___________(78).</span> <span id="s344">It's not far from Munich and it used to be; there it used to be a Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s345">They had their, not headquarters, I would say, their barracks and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s346">It was nicely built and they brought us back there and from other parts, they brought us together.</span> <span id="s347">Quite a few thousand people.</span> <span id="s348">In this DP camp we started to get together back our lives, little by little.</span> <span id="s349">I was there for four years, from 1945, I would say, June 1945 until about April 1949.</span> <span id="s350">In this camp, people started to court, a lot of them started to get married.</span> <span id="s351">We did get married in 1946 and started to live more or less a normal life.</span> <span id="s352">By normal, I mean they used to give us rations there.</span> <span id="s353">The rations weren't sufficient so we tried to do some black-marketeering, as they call it, in order to have something more to eat.</span> <span id="s354">But we enjoyed ourselves there, the couple of years we were there.</span> <span id="s355">We decided, my wife and I decided, we shouldn't have any children on the German soil and I went to a school there and tried to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s356">She was working there in a, what you call it, a sewing place where they made various things for--I don't know what for, honestly, but she was occupied.</span> <span id="s357">It was a carefree life you might say, for three or four years.</span> <span id="s358">But we tried, from the first moment on, we tried to get out of there.</span> <span id="s359">We tried to emigrate.</span> <span id="s360">At that time, it started out with the illegal immigration to Israel and a lot of people decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s361">In fact, we had friends that we lived together and they decided to go to Israel in 1947 that they went.</span> <span id="s362">They went with the Exodus and they were sent back to Cyprus and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s363">Being that my wife had here family, and family from before the war.</span> <span id="s364">She had a few uncles, her mother's brothers and she also had family in Argentina.</span> <span id="s365">We tried to get from them papers sent to us so we can immigrate there.</span> <span id="s366">In Argentina, Argentina didn't allow anything, any immigration, so they got us papers to immigrate to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s367">We weren't too anxious about it.</span> <span id="s368">Then her uncles tried to get us papers to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s369">Finally it came Truman and passed a law and Congress where everyone from the survivors, from the DP camps, as long as it wasn't a underworld person or something like it, you didn't commit any crime or anything like it, was allowed according to the new immigration laws, was allowed to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s370">This is-- Have you located any members of your family?</span> <span id="s371">You have tried to, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Members of my family, while we were there, in W_______ DP camp, there was always lists right from the first moment on.</span> <span id="s373">There were lists circulating among all the DP camps because there was a lot of DP camps all over Germany.</span> <span id="s374">People that were liberated in Poland or any other parts of--Romania, Czechoslovakia or any other parts--these lists circulated.</span> <span id="s375">When the circulated people were looking for the relatives who have survived--stuff like that.</span> <span id="s376">In my case, for instance, I had my brother was in Russia; he was sent away in Russia, in Siberia.</span> <span id="s377">Because he was a Polish citizen, you might say, in Poland became a communist country so they allowed all the Polish citizen to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s378">Of course, he registered himself right away and he came back.</span> <span id="s379">Where did he come back?</span> <span id="s380">to Wilna, not knowing what happened.</span> <span id="s381">When he came back in Wilna, he found my father's brother, my uncle, he was there.</span> <span id="s382">Once he found him, he already stuck with him together.</span> <span id="s383">Then they closed the border and they made Wilna part of Lithuania, a republic with Lithuania but also a republic of Russia.</span> <span id="s384">Before they closed the border, they let him go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s385">Where they came, they came to the town of Lodz.</span> <span id="s386">There my uncle, he lost his family before, he lost in the same time that my mother and all the other children perished, he lost his whole family too, he found someone in Wilna, he remarried.</span> <span id="s387">The three of them looked and they found the names of me, that I was in a camp in Germany, a DP camp.</span> <span id="s388">My father, again, he was also liberated in one of the concentration camps, I think it was Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s389">He went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s390">Over there he found out that I was liberated in Germany.</span> <span id="s391">A group, a couple of the women or men, I don't know exactly how many, they tried to go, at that time already, the borders were formed, they tried to go from one border to the other.</span> <span id="s392">From Poland to Austria, from Austria.</span> <span id="s393">I think, to Italy, from Italy somehow they got here to Germany.</span> <span id="s394">Because they knew I was there.</span> <span id="s395">He came and then my brother came.</span> <span id="s396">My uncle decided to stay in Lodz.</span> <span id="s397">He was there, in fact he was up to 1960 until he, legally, my father brought him in, brought him back.</span> <span id="s398">This is how we got together--my father, my older brother and me--we got together in a DP camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s399">Then in 1949, I was the first one, my wife and I, were the first ones to emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s400">Then they came afterwards in 1950.</span> <span id="s401">My wife, again, she was with her younger sister.</span> <span id="s402">They were the only two survivors in the family; she was with her in all the camps together, never separated.</span> <span id="s403">They got liberated together.</span> <span id="s404">They came together in the same camp that I was, they brought them there.</span> <span id="s405">That's how we got acquainted.</span> <span id="s406">We got married in 1946 and we came back here in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">You came to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">At first, we came to Boston and from Boston we came by train to New York.</span> <span id="s409">In New York, my wife's family, her uncles, they awaited us at the station and took us to their, one of the uncles' homes.</span> <span id="s410">We were there in the uncle's home for about four to six weeks, that's all.</span> <span id="s411">Right away, it didn't take too long, we started to look for occupation.</span> <span id="s412">Eight days after we arrived here, one of her uncles found her a job and she went to work immediately without knowing the language, without knowing how to travel.</span> <span id="s413">Me, I found myself a job in three weeks.</span> <span id="s414">We stayed by one of her uncles.</span> <span id="s415">We couldn't stay too long, her aunt was too religious, we couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s416">We rented a room in the Bronx, we lived in the Bronx at that time.</span> <span id="s417">We rented a room by a Jewish couple there, and we lived there for about a year.</span> <span id="s418">A year later, we purchased an apartment, paid money for it, purchased an apartment up in the Bronx, in New York.</span> <span id="s419">We were there and there were the kids, our daughters were born, in the first apartment in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s420">In 19--when was Helen born--in '51 was the older born, and in 1955, Susan was born.</span> <span id="s421">She stopped working after a while and I was the sole provider.</span> <span id="s422">Little by little, I worked nearby-- What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">I worked in a supermarket.</span> <span id="s424">I worked nearby and always was thinking of how to go into business for myself.</span> <span id="s425">After seven years of working for somebody else, got together with a partner.</span> <span id="s426">We purchased a little superette in a poor, not-so-hot neighborhood in New York.</span> <span id="s427">We were there for a couple of years until we sold it.</span> <span id="s428">We went to a better neighborhood, a little bit.</span> <span id="s429">Then we split up, the partnership didn't work out and we went, my wife and I went together.</span> <span id="s430">That was in the Bronx, we moved to Brooklyn, from Brooklyn to Long Island.</span> <span id="s431">From Long Island I purchased, what you call a candy store.</span> <span id="s432">At that time it was a candy store and a luncheonette.</span> <span id="s433">We were there, we worked in that store for 14, almost 15 years hand in hand, my wife and I.</span> <span id="s434">It was long hours, six in the morning until eleven at night.</span> <span id="s435">Used to close one day, on a Monday in a town called Valley Stream in Long Island, New York.</span> <span id="s436">We paid off mortgages and we worked very, very hard; accumulated a little money and we purchased a house nearby.</span> <span id="s437">It was a hard struggle, the kids grew up, the kids went to school there.</span> <span id="s438">The kids helped us in the store; they worked with us.</span> <span id="s439">The older one went to college; then the younger one started to go, went to college, went to _____(238) State.</span> <span id="s440">One by one, first the older one found a boy in college.</span> <span id="s441">They got married and then the younger one got married with a boy from the same town.</span> <span id="s442">Thank God, they married very nice boys and they have their families of their own.</span> <span id="s443">The older one has two girls, the younger one, two boys.</span> <span id="s444">We happy that it turned out, the family turned out fine, decent, in other words, a real Jewish family and we are very thankful, thank God for that.</span> <span id="s445">We visit, we visit them especially now with the younger one who is here in Potomac, Maryland.</span> <span id="s446">We visit quite often, she visits us.</span> <span id="s447">I, myself, sold the business in 1978.</span> <span id="s448">I retired at 54 and not long after we purchased a condo in Florida and since then we go back and forth.</span> <span id="s449">For the time we're down there, every time we're up in New York, we have friends, mostly friends who were more or less either in concentration camp or in Russia.</span> <span id="s450">We enjoy our lives more or less as much as we can.</span> <span id="s451">We only hope and pray to God for help.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">I want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s453">Before we end your--talking with you, are there any specific incidents or episodes from, during the war period or from before the war period, that stand out in your mind, that you might not have mentioned?</span> <span id="s454">Any images or things that happened that you didn't talk about, that you might want to add to the tape for the sake of _______(266)?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Well, there are so many incidents, it is impossible to mention them all.</span> <span id="s456">The main incident that stands out in my mind is the time when they took my mother and the rest of the children.</span> <span id="s457">When they rounded them up and sent away.</span> <span id="s458">We didn't even see them sent away because we were hidden but in our minds, there remained to this day it will never be erased.</span> <span id="s459">All the rest of the incidents that happened personally to me or to my father, for instance, I mean the incident that happened to every one of us.</span> <span id="s460">Each one has a particular story to tell.</span> <span id="s461">This is the main incident that I can never erase it from my mind, knowing especially where they are buried.</span> <span id="s462">Imagine till about a year or two ago, there was no mention especially from the Russians, that so many Jewish were buried there and especially from the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s463">A couple of years ago, a year or two ago, they erected a monument on the site.</span> <span id="s464">For the first time, they recognized that so many, I think it's about 60 thousand, they were shot and buried there.</span> <span id="s465">Then eventually it came to the point where the Russians were closing in so they got Jewish prisoners who dug them out, all these bones and they buried them in piles that nothing should remain there.</span> <span id="s466">In other words, there shouldn't be anything to accuse them of or something like that.</span> <span id="s467">It's more or less the same story like Babi Yar.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Have you been back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">I always wanted to, never had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s470">It's either in the beginning we didn't have the means and later on we were so occupied, we didn't have the opportunity.</span> <span id="s471">Afterwards, after we got out of there, for some reason or other, we didn't have the heart.</span> <span id="s472">Some people did, some people did that.</span> <span id="s473">A lot of people go now back to Auschwitz especially to organize, I mean the March of Life, the youngsters which commend very because the youngsters, especially the younger generation, should know what happened and they should know the history.</span> <span id="s474">I hope and pray to God that they should learn from history because history has a tendency to repeat itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">I want to thank you very much for telling your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">You're quite welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">It's very important to the Museum (?)</span> <span id="s478">.</span> <span id="s479">Is there anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Well, there's more or less, in short, what I can tell you if I had the time, if I had the means, I would start down, I would write a book.</span> <span id="s481">I don't think one of them would be enough.</span> <span id="s482">But I guess everybody else could do the same thing.</span> <span id="s483">I thank you for the interview.</span> <span id="s484">I appreciate it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">It's quite all right.</span></p></body></html>
