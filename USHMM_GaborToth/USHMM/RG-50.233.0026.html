was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s5">Went to school in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Can we start before -- tell me your name and your date of birth on the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Yeah, all right.</span> <span id="s8">My name is Sevek Fishman.</span> <span id="s9">Born in Poland, 14th of July 1918.</span> <span id="s10">Okay, I went to school in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: What type of --?</span> <span id="s12">Did you go to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s14">You see, over there, in Poland, the Jews were a separate nation.</span> <span id="s15">Jews were Jews.</span> <span id="s16">Naturally we were going in a school what was Jews, Poles and -- like here.</span> <span id="s17">The same thing like here.</span> <span id="s18">Naturally I had to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s19">You know why, I think my father was a very wise man.</span> <span id="s20">He used to say, malucha is maleecha.</span> <span id="s21">What this is in English, if you have a trade, you have a kingdom.</span> <span id="s22">You know, he was a businessman but he said anything can be taken away from you.</span> <span id="s23">But what you learn and you have -- how to say in unet, an education, nobody can take it away from you.</span> <span id="s24">He was very wise.</span> <span id="s25">Thank my trade, the truth is I survived.</span> <span id="s26">So now I can tell you, you know, the way I growed up.</span> <span id="s27">I growed up, I learned my trade and my father, my mother they had a business.</span> <span id="s28">Was a factory and my oldest sister was in the business.</span> <span id="s29">You know, it was not a small business.</span> <span id="s30">As a fact, when the Germans come in, they come into Poland, in 1939, in the fall.</span> <span id="s31">In 1940, right away, they put it up laws like everybody knows.</span> <span id="s32">They confiscated everything what it up laws like everybody knows.</span> <span id="s33">They confiscated everything what the Jews have.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: You lived in -- you grew up in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No.</span> <span id="s36">I was living in a suburban from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s37">I born in Kaluszyn, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Okay, that’s suburb of Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s40">It is a -- Kaluszyn is about 45 kilometers from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s41">But in the meantime, before the war, we moved in another city, B_______.</span> <span id="s42">That’s -- took us about 15 minutes to go into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s43">That’s nearer.</span> <span id="s44">The Germans, when they come in, in 1939, this was the fall.</span> <span id="s45">In the fall, they took about seven, eight days, the war was over.</span> <span id="s46">Poland didn’t fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Can we back up though?</span> <span id="s48">Before we get into the war --.</span> <span id="s49">I’m sure we’re get involved in talking about that.</span> <span id="s50">Can you tell us anything else about your home?</span> <span id="s51">What was it like in your home?</span> <span id="s52">What did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My home was a Jewish home.</span> <span id="s54">I remember, you know, I don’t know if you know, it was a habit.</span> <span id="s55">On Saturday, Jewish people didn’t travel.</span> <span id="s56">If a Jewish man, after sundown on Friday, passed through, not to break the Sabbath, he used to go in, in the synagogue and every Jew what was able had to take home a couple orchan.</span> <span id="s57">This mean guests, what they take home for Sabbath and they sheltered him and they fed him.</span> <span id="s58">Saturday night when the stars come out, it was already no more Sabbath, he was ready to continue his -- how to say in English -- his -- to go where he wants to go, travel.</span> <span id="s59">He can begin to travel.</span> <span id="s60">So like I told you before, we had a business and we were making a living.</span> <span id="s61">Talking about my family, a lot of time I asking myself, how come I survived.</span> <span id="s62">I was already that time, not Hasidic, was a freethinker.</span> <span id="s63">I already like today, the younger people, begin to think their own way.</span> <span id="s64">In this my father and mother was very charitable people.</span> <span id="s65">Because I know when you live in a smaller city, in the suburban, then the neighbors, some neighbors, not all of them, certain people in the community, they didn’t have no fish, they didn’t have no meat, they didn’t have no challah.</span> <span id="s66">To us, the mother used to call up and it was delivered and it was not like here, papers.</span> <span id="s67">Because that’s what I learned.</span> <span id="s68">If you give something, don’t brag about it.</span> <span id="s69">Is a fact, if I donate money, I don’t want it to even -- people should know what I do.</span> <span id="s70">This comes from the household.</span> <span id="s71">Okay, in the forty already, my father opened up a shop for me.</span> <span id="s72">I was already, I had my education in tailoring --.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How did you do that?</span> <span id="s74">Were you apprenticed to somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Apprenticed, absolutely, oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: After high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: After the school, after the school you had to go and learn a trade.</span> <span id="s78">In a trade, take you several years.</span> <span id="s79">You know, in the beginning they give me two dollars a week.</span> <span id="s80">I said two zloty you couldn’t buy too much for it.</span> <span id="s81">But look, if you want to learn, you got to learn.</span> <span id="s82">My father used to say, look anybody can be a businessman but if you have a trade, you have a kingdom.</span> <span id="s83">I want you to learn.</span> <span id="s84">Why he was thinking this way; because my father’s brother in Warsaw had a big business from the stores where they used to sell clothing.</span> <span id="s85">He used to have cutters, designers.</span> <span id="s86">He was very good off and he wanted me in case I need it, I should have something to fall back on it.</span> <span id="s87">My father said, in Europe, you know a guy what used to sell shoelaces or used to sell some cigarettes, he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s88">Anybody cannot do this without education.</span> <span id="s89">So he want me to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s90">I learned my trade pretty good.</span> <span id="s91">When the Germans comed in, I already had my shop and I had two people working with me already.</span> <span id="s92">I already was teaching somebody else, younger kids.</span> <span id="s93">This was going on, this was the style in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you -- was it like a Jewish neighborhood, your shop?</span> <span id="s95">Were your patrons mostly Jews or not, or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: We had Jewish people, Polish people, you know.</span> <span id="s97">Yeah, everybody.</span> <span id="s98">It was not that time, a ghetto.</span> <span id="s99">No, we were living together in a smaller place.</span> <span id="s100">We were living neighborly.</span> <span id="s101">It was not a --.</span> <span id="s102">The truth is we didn’t in the city of B _______, it was not a big population from Jewish people, the opposite.</span> <span id="s103">Kaluszyn was the population from 90% Jews.</span> <span id="s104">Sabbath, you couldn’t get even a glass of water.</span> <span id="s105">It’s the truth -- Sabbath -- when they were calling to go to the synagogue -- it was a style.</span> <span id="s106">You know what I mean, they were calling when it was around three o’clock, they used to call _________.</span> <span id="s107">You know they used to call to go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s108">The stores were closed and everybody was preparing to go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s109">Over there in B _______, it was already a little more advanced, a little difference, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s110">The people when there was sundown, everybody was dressed and they went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s111">A different style, was already more to the south.</span> <span id="s112">This was in southern Warsaw, south, and Kaluszyn is to the east, on the other side of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s113">You have Warsaw, Prager and then you have Minsk, Mhzowiecki, you have Kaluszyn, you have Wegrow, you have S_____, you have more to the Russian side, to the east.</span> <span id="s114">And so it was a difference, a different city, a different setup between the Christian population and the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s115">We didn’t have this kind of --like it was in some other places.</span> <span id="s116">But naturally, the German influence, the propaganda after ________ passed away.</span> <span id="s117">You know what I mean, the anti-Semitism propaganda began to influence, you know, the Polish people.</span> <span id="s118">It’s a fact when the Germans comed in, in 1939, like I told you in the fall, the war didn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s119">It last maybe eight, ten days.</span> <span id="s120">The Poles didn’t want to fight.</span> <span id="s121">The Germans, what I know about it, the Jewish people, the Jewish boys what they was in the Polish army, they would do the fighting.</span> <span id="s122">Because we expected from the propaganda, when the Germans will come in, what is going to be.</span> <span id="s123">It’s a fact that the Germans already took Poland, it was divided Poland by the book, between Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s124">The Germans comed in, the Germans took away the quarters of our house, from our house.</span> <span id="s125">A big officer happened to take up from our house, half a house.</span> <span id="s126">When he comed in, he was like a hyena, like an animal.</span> <span id="s127">But you know, a Jewish woman, a Sabbath, she cooked fish and meat and mached a yulk an aroma.</span> <span id="s128">The German officer was over there and you know, little by little he became domesticated.</span> <span id="s129">My mother used to bring him something to eat.</span> <span id="s130">After several weeks, four weeks, or six weeks, he used to come in, he used to say Frau Fishman, v _____ didn’t you go to Russia?</span> <span id="s131">Because Hitler what he said, he’s going to do it, he’ll kill everybody.</span> <span id="s132">He stood in the light and he said, I’m sorry, such a nice people, they should be wasted.</span> <span id="s133">But in the meantime, you know what I mean, he realized, he said something what he shouldn’t say it.</span> <span id="s134">So he said, please don’t repeat what I said because he looks like he was afraid for himself, you know.</span> <span id="s135">Anyway, you know, after several months, you know what I mean, the Germans begin to tighten up the city like they used to take --.</span> <span id="s136">The first thing they took away everything what the Jews have.</span> <span id="s137">The radios, if you have a motorcycle, or you have something, they took it away.</span> <span id="s138">You couldn’t have nothing, they cut it off everything.</span> <span id="s139">We had a housemaid.</span> <span id="s140">The housemaid, her name was Marta.</span> <span id="s141">She happened to marry a guy by the name, Bernard from Zh ____.</span> <span id="s142">He was a very educated guy.</span> <span id="s143">He was a director of a Swedish factory what makes matches.</span> <span id="s144">You know, strikels are matches.</span> <span id="s145">When the Germans comed in, he put it down a big eichenkrist a red belt with a black eichenkrist and he became a big man in the German thing.</span> <span id="s146">Over there, we have the German neighbors, Volkdeutschen.</span> <span id="s147">Volkdeutschen, a lot enlisted themselves to the Germans.</span> <span id="s148">The Germans naturally give the order they shall take the Jews for work.</span> <span id="s149">Naturally, they took me too.</span> <span id="s150">I knew them and they knew me.</span> <span id="s151">Lazora’s son, they has son from the west.</span> <span id="s152">You know, a young man like me, I know the guy what they grabbed me for work.</span> <span id="s153">I used to say then, Poland was a Poland and you didn’t act this way.</span> <span id="s154">He said to me, keep shout and kicked me in my behind, otherwise, you’ll get shot.</span> <span id="s155">I realized that this is the truth.</span> <span id="s156">I have to do what I have to do.</span> <span id="s157">When I’ll come to talk about this Bernard --.</span> <span id="s158">You know, he happened to marry the Marta, he didn’t hurt nobody.</span> <span id="s159">He didn’t hurt nobody.</span> <span id="s160">Is a fact, every time when I -- when they pushed us out from the city --when it come the time when every Jew have to get out from B______, go into the Warsaw ghetto, he was the guy when he used to drive through with a truck, he used to drop me off azach.</span> <span id="s161">You know, it was a big -- with bread.</span> <span id="s162">He used to go through the ghetto.</span> <span id="s163">Opened up the door, he used to say, stay in this corner and I’ll throw you out a sack of bread for my family.</span> <span id="s164">While when we was in B ______, he had a bag radio.</span> <span id="s165">We used to hear the BBC from the underground.</span> <span id="s166">Between me and you I think he was working for some government.</span> <span id="s167">Not for the Germans, it is the truth.</span> <span id="s168">Otherwise, we used to close the door and we used to sit and hear from BBC received from England.</span> <span id="s169">Why did he have the honor to have the thing?</span> <span id="s170">His brother was a captain in a U-boat.</span> <span id="s171">But he was speaking a perfect French, a perfect English, a perfect German, a perfect Russian.</span> <span id="s172">Till today, I have only a suspicion that he was working for a foreign government, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s173">Or for England, or for America.</span> <span id="s174">He did good.</span> <span id="s175">He saved maybe three times from my death.</span> <span id="s176">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s177">Because when you’re young.</span> <span id="s178">We had the kids.</span> <span id="s179">Not far from B______ was a factory from sugar.</span> <span id="s180">We need sugar.</span> <span id="s181">I took the bicycle, it was not too much, a few kilometers, I run down and get sugar over there.</span> <span id="s182">Took off the armband and went down over there.</span> <span id="s183">In the meantime, it was, what do you call this, a roundup.</span> <span id="s184">Why was the roundup?</span> <span id="s185">The Poles killed a couple Germans and they took the helmets, excuse me, they shit in the helmets.</span> <span id="s186">They put it in their chests, the helmets.</span> <span id="s187">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s188">While they was there, they making a roundup, I was over there too, in the middle.</span> <span id="s189">In the meantime, they grabbed me and I was laying on the ground.</span> <span id="s190">I’ll never forget a German come through.</span> <span id="s191">He had three squares on his shoulder.</span> <span id="s192">I was laying on the ground and a German was staying with a gun over me.</span> <span id="s193">He said to me, he said to the guy, the kerl is a strong kerl, why you keeping him like this?</span> <span id="s194">He asked me what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s195">I said Bernard sent me to get some sugar.</span> <span id="s196">Who’s Bernard?</span> <span id="s197">I said he has this number, here is his card.</span> <span id="s198">He said to me ________, get lost.</span> <span id="s199">Believe me, on the bicycle I was flying.</span> <span id="s200">I was not pedaling, I was flying.</span> <span id="s201">I come back to him and he said to me, why you didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s202">In other words, you know, check us.</span> <span id="s203">Why you didn’t tell me you’re going over there.</span> <span id="s204">You’re doing things, one of these days, I’m not going to be able to help you.</span> <span id="s205">It was several times what he saved me.</span> <span id="s206">That’s the reason I can say about him.</span> <span id="s207">That is the chapter.</span> <span id="s208">All right so we was in Warsaw now.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Can I stop you for a second?</span> <span id="s210">The Warsaw ghetto wasn’t, didn’t --.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s213">So between ‘3 - --?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Was still an open ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s216">Between ’39 and ’40 then, what happened, how was, what were things like for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, what it was, it was still --.</span> <span id="s218">The ghetto was still open.</span> <span id="s219">In 1940, the ghetto was still open.</span> <span id="s220">So you could trade with the Poles.</span> <span id="s221">If you have something to give them, they will sell you bread or they’ll sell you potatoes or something.</span> <span id="s222">You know, it was still --.</span> <span id="s223">But they were typing down.</span> <span id="s224">When they shift us in -- when they had a law, all the suburbans have to go into the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s225">You see, all around Warsaw, all the suburban little cities, had to go in one place, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: You went with your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yeah, still the whole family, yeah.</span> <span id="s228">In 1940, I got married in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s229">I was the oldest son and I knew my wife already for a couple years.</span> <span id="s230">My father said he wants to bring the first child to the hippa, you know to the altar.</span> <span id="s231">When I got married, it’s a tradition.</span> <span id="s232">When I got married, he said to me, my son now you have to think about how you’re going to survive.</span> <span id="s233">So after the wedding, naturally I begin to -- I’m the oldest son -- my father was that time maybe, maybe 42 years old.</span> <span id="s234">The Germans already begin to put out laws, a law they needed young people to work.</span> <span id="s235">Everything was covered, how to say, they didn’t know what they needed people.</span> <span id="s236">If they give the order in Warsaw, they need 500 people for work, the Jewish gemeinde, they had to give them 500 people, a thousand people.</span> <span id="s237">You know how many people they want, there to bring it.</span> <span id="s238">I was the oldest, I begin to smuggle in some food for the family.</span> <span id="s239">You know, don’t forget there was still six people, father and mother, everybody we had some things what we were able to cash in, trade whatever you had.</span> <span id="s240">People begin to do business in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s241">I’ll never forget there was a Jewish man by the name Rubinstein.</span> <span id="s242">He used to stay in the corner and used to make vixin.</span> <span id="s243">You know what vixin is -- jokes.</span> <span id="s244">He used to say schmaltz.</span> <span id="s245">That means fats will be cheap.</span> <span id="s246">People would ask him why.</span> <span id="s247">___________.</span> <span id="s248">That mean the rich people melting out, they don’t have no more money.</span> <span id="s249">Everybody’s going to be poor, you know.</span> <span id="s250">In the morning, in the ghetto, life in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s251">People used to be laying in the streets, in the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s252">Used to go around a horse and wagon and picking them up.</span> <span id="s253">It was not even enough what to bury them.</span> <span id="s254">They used to wrap them up in gasha you know in papers.</span> <span id="s255">Wrap them up and bury them.</span> <span id="s256">I was going around, it was already so bad, --.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: After how long, just a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s259">It was already more than six months, eight months.</span> <span id="s260">You know when the -- they already made, how to say, when you going in, you had to open up a piece of wood like in the military to open up, to go in.</span> <span id="s261">I used to smuggle in sometime with horse and wagon, you know, some bread, potatoes.</span> <span id="s262">He used to bribe the guard.</span> <span id="s263">The guard used to ask me what you have there.</span> <span id="s264">I used to leave the horse and wagon over there in the corner and approach the gate.</span> <span id="s265">It was soldiers, my lieber, my lovely men, would you please let me in.</span> <span id="s266">My father sick, my mother sick, the kids are sick, I have some bread, I have some potatoes.</span> <span id="s267">You never said how many you have because if he’ll step on the wheel and look it in, you have more -- I used to say a bisel, a little, never say how much.</span> <span id="s268">Because he could say _________ why did you like to me?</span> <span id="s269">Always a little.</span> <span id="s270">It was going on for weeks.</span> <span id="s271">You know I used to bring it in -- one time it was a rainy night.</span> <span id="s272">I approached the gate to drive in and I give them a golden watch to drive in with my loot, what I had.</span> <span id="s273">They stepped on the wheel, they looked in.</span> <span id="s274">He says to me, why did you lie to me?</span> <span id="s275">I say, my lovely sir, I never lied to you.</span> <span id="s276">I told you a little of this, a little of this, a little of this.</span> <span id="s277">He turned around his butt from the gun.</span> <span id="s278">He smacked me over the head, opened up my neck.</span> <span id="s279">The blood was running, but you couldn’t run away.</span> <span id="s280">Then you give him a leverage to shoot you.</span> <span id="s281">You had to be near him till he gets sick and tired from hitting you, then he said, get lost.</span> <span id="s282">I turned around the horse and wagon, bloodied like a slaughtered animal.</span> <span id="s283">I went to another gate, I went over, I give them my briefcase.</span> <span id="s284">He looked at me, I’m so bloodied, he opened up the gate, I give him the briefcase.</span> <span id="s285">You drove in, you unloaded what you had in the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s286">Then you was asking yourself, why didn’t you go right away to this gate?</span> <span id="s287">It’s a question, how do you know which is good and which is no good?</span> <span id="s288">You taking your chances.</span> <span id="s289">In 1942, I went out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s290">It was already so bad.</span> <span id="s291">Old people were laying in the streets, you know, dying.</span> <span id="s292">Climbing their hands and knees and begging a bissel water, a drop of water.</span> <span id="s293">Nobody could help them, nobody could help each other.</span> <span id="s294">Or you die or if you can, survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: What was happening to your family at this time?</span> <span id="s296">Were they --?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: At that time, they were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Were they all together, in one place?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah, they were living in one place.</span> <span id="s300">In the sixth floor, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s301">You know, in ________ Street.</span> <span id="s302">You know by mine father’s brother.</span> <span id="s303">They had a big -- they were moved in over there to them.</span> <span id="s304">They were living over there.</span> <span id="s305">Is a fact for a couple of months after this, when I went out from Warsaw, you know, I went to _____ where she was born, ___________.</span> <span id="s306">Polaski.</span> <span id="s307">I went over there.</span> <span

id="s518">Because that time already.</span> <span id="s519">The Jews knew they made double walls, they climbed in, in the chimneys to hide; they hide in the attics.</span> <span id="s520">It was outside the toilets.</span> <span id="s521">A lot let themselves in the shit up to the chest, just to breathe, just to breathe.</span> <span id="s522">Over there in a small city, they had cows, they had chicken.</span> <span id="s523">The cows were without food, without a thing, were making moo, you know.</span> <span id="s524">When I, in the morning had got gray, I looked through the window.</span> <span id="s525">I saw a cat passing by.</span> <span id="s526">I said look, how lucky, they’re not going to shoot the cat but if I stick out my neck and somebody saw it, bingo, I get a bullet in my neck.</span> <span id="s527">But it got a little lighter, I went down back to the hole.</span> <span id="s528">The Germans come in, in the house.</span> <span id="s529">I heard them.</span> <span id="s530">They were shooting in the walls because a lot of Jews had double walls, they were hiding in the walls.</span> <span id="s531">But a lot of Jews made mistakes, they took it

Jews they found between the double walls.</span> <span id="s535">They took them out and they took them to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s536">They had to dig their own graves, they shot them.</span> <span id="s537">I come to this, I’ll tell you how I know how they did it.</span> <span id="s538">After sitting in this hole, for ten days without food, without water, I’ll never forget, the walls in the grave were so shiny from my sweating, from frighten, it was like a mirror.</span> <span id="s539">Finally it come on me such a -- I got so scared -- I said to my wife, let’s get out from

already surrounded around by the Polish police, the fire department, ________ gendarmerie, the Ukrainian, the Litvakian, all around.</span> <span id="s549">She wanted to get out, she couldn’t get out, she had to come back in the same hole what I was there.</span> <span id="s550">She couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s551">Otherwise, she tried to get out as a Christian girl.</span> <span id="s552">She had to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: I need to flip this over now, it’s running out.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">AS: Okay, let’s ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Here we go, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: All right.</span> <span id="s557">So when everything -- she got so scared and I got scared, we went up in the attic over there where the painters were living.</span> <span id="s558">The first thing when I come up in the attic, I opened up a t __ a little door.</span> <span id="s559">You know what I mean, from the old side was in the pitch from the roof is a little door.</span> <span id="s560">I say to take away the suspicion open up.</span> <span id="s561">If it’s closed, they’ll put it up a ladder, they want to see if somebody’s there.</span> <span id="s562">I count up over there, it was the family from the painters.</span> <span id="s563">So what I did the first thing, I put them under the eave and took all the rest and covered them.</span> <span id="s564">My wife the same thing, I covered them.</span> <span id="s565">I opened up the piece of rope from the desk, opened up.</span> <span id="s566">I, myself, took a

id="s568">That is -- mine thing is over.</span> <span id="s569">Lucky enough, they didn’t come up to this attic but they went in another house where the door was closed and they took down a whole family.</span> <span id="s570">They were manufacturing leather, leather.</span> <span id="s571">They took down the whole family over there to the cemetery to be slaughtered.</span> <span id="s572">How

age and he said to her ________, get lost.</span> <span id="s578">Oust but get lost.</span> <span id="s579">She come to us.</span> <span id="s580">She told us what was going on over there in the cemetery when they brought the people.</span> <span id="s581">They had to dig their grave, a trench.</span> <span id="s582">They undressed them and they shot them with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s583">They fall down and the Poles were staying over there and taking off the rest what is over there -- for sample, the stockings or the underwear.</span> <span id="s584">They robbed them.</span> <span id="s585">That she told me what was over there.</span> <span id="s586">Otherwise I wouldn’t know what they doing over there.</span> <span id="s587">Okay, now it will come when they took me the

rope.</span> <span id="s591">You know, this was the last.</span> <span id="s592">They shipped us off.</span> <span id="s593">My plan was when thy put us up in trucks -- they put it up, the Germans with machine guns.</span> <span id="s594">My plan was when they’ll take a curve, the truck has to slow down, I’ll jump.</span> <span id="s595">I couldn’t jump because if I would jump, he was on the truck, I would get a machine gun.</span> <span id="s596">My plan was if I’ll come down to the camp, I’ll bury myself under the truck.</span> <span id="s597">When the truck will go out, I’ll drop myself.</span> <span id="s598">It didn’t work either.</span> <span id="s599">When they took us out from the truck, we went inside, the truck went away.</span> <span id="s600">Now comes preparation
