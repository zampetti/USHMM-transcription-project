ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Answer: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: Just by a -- having you say your name and identifying yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Yes, m-my name is Jan Nowak Jezioránski.</span> <span id="s7">The Nowak is the nom de guerre, and my real family name is Jezioránski.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: I’d like to begin with you telling me where you were, and what was happening in your life at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Well, I was the first survivor of the Warsaw uprising who was sent as an emissary by the Polish commander in chief of the underground army, and of the Warsaw uprising to London, with microfilms, with the archives of the uprising.</span> <span id="s10">And the first one who reached London, on 22nd of January, ’45.</span> <span id="s11">And of course, I did work for some time with the Polish authorities, debriefing them, and also British and American authorities, lecturing, writing, until I was hired by the Polish section of the BBC, in ’48.</span> <span id="s12">And that was the beginning of my radio career.</span> <span id="s13">[sneezes] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s14">I was trained in my profession as a broadcaster by the BBC, and I stayed with the corporation until the end of ’51.</span> <span id="s15">And th-then I was appointed the first director of the Polish service of Radio Free Europe in Munich.</span> <span id="s16">And I had to organize the entire operation, all day operation, from the scratch.</span> <span id="s17">I was the first Pole who was hired, and my job was to recruit people to organize the operation, to create, you know, the schedule, the programming, and all that, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s18">So I started a sort of a second chapter of my life with Radio Free Europe, and this was probably, from the perspective of my life, the most important job I had.</span> <span id="s19">Much more important than during the war, because during the war I was an emissary, and I was very active in the Polish underground movement.</span> <span id="s20">But as an emissary I was rather a witness, an eyewitness of the game between Moscow, London, Washington, and I saw the moon from both sides, from the perspective of London, and in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s21">But I cannot say that I did really influence any -- any decisions or events.</span> <span id="s22">While in the radio, we learned really that we have much greater influence that could have been expected.</span> <span id="s23">And I feel, and this is what the audience say, including such people as [indecipherable] opposition leaders, that we did have a considerable impact on the development in Poland between ’52 and ’89 when -- when Poland was liberated, in a way.</span> <span id="s24">So this was my most important period of -- of la -- of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: I want to talk about that, I -- I’d like to go back to the -- the -- just at the end of -- at the end of the war, w-where you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: -- a-and -- and -- and what you were doing.</span> <span id="s28">I understand you were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I was -- I was only once arrested by Swiss authorities, when my wife and I illegally crossed the border.</span> <span id="s30">I was very lucky; I was never arrested by Gestapo.</span> <span id="s31">If I would be arrested Gestapo, I would probably not be here.</span> <span id="s32">But I was very lucky, and never -- never really fall into the hands of -- of Gestapo, but when we crossed the border near Basel, we were immediately caught by the Swiss border guards, and arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: This was the end of ’44.</span> <span id="s35">It was just, you know, the -- the end of ’44, and the very beginning of ’45.</span> <span id="s36">And under pressure from British, we were released by Swiss, and allowed to cross into France, which was already liberated.</span> <span id="s37">And from France by the military plane, we are -- we were taken to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So when the war ended, you were in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I was in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And can you tell me what -- what was going through --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Well, a-as I told you already, I was -- my job was really, to tell British and Polish about the situation in Poland.</span> <span id="s42">The history about the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s43">This was the time before Yalta, and before the formation of the puppet su -- Polish government in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s44">So we -- we were at that time deeply involved in -- in a very desperate struggle to really prevent what happened in Yalta.</span> <span id="s45">In other words, to s -- to rescue the independence of the country.</span> <span id="s46">And that took me my first -- first years in London.</span> <span id="s47">And I mainly was focusing -- focusing on what was going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s48">I was a kind of a advisor to the Polish exiled government, which still existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And where were you living for the brief period after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: In London.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: In London, how long did you live in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Until ’50 -- until the end of ’51.</span> <span id="s53">In other words, I spent six years in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And how would you say your life changed after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, unfortunately, I was in exile.</span> <span id="s56">All my plan, my -- really, my -- my objective, I did want to be -- to be a scholar, an economist, and I was just on the point of finishing my doctorate thesis when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s57">That was all lost.</span> <span id="s58">I had no chance, and no wish even, to return to my scholarly career.</span> <span id="s59">Frankly, you know, the objective was how to regain freedom for my country.</span> <span id="s60">And that was the main objective and there were only two -- two ways of -- of doing something.</span> <span id="s61">One was to try to influence public opinion in the west, a-and the governments in the west.</span> <span id="s62">And that was very difficult at that time, because immediately after the war.</span> <span id="s63">Still some kind -- the hopes existed that -- that wartime friendly relationship with Russia could continue.</span> <span id="s64">And second was, to try to influence and educate people in Poland.</span> <span id="s65">And the -- the only way of doing it was by radio, because in Poland there was a monopoly of media in the Communist hands.</span> <span id="s66">And the only way people could learn truth, and learn about even their own situation was by listening to foreign radio.</span> <span id="s67">So it suited me very well to join BBC because I had a chance to broadcast to Poland, although the contribution was negligible because the British really did not allow so-called exiles to make any [indecipherable] contribution.</span> <span id="s68">Most of the programs were written by British, and our job was simply to translate it into Polish, and to deliver it.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I could interrupt you for one second, I’m going to readjust this.</span> <span id="s70">So for those six years you were working for the BBC in London, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: You know who I was working for s -- no, I -- for the BBC I wor -- I worked fr-from -- since ’48 until the end of ’51, for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What about the years from ’45, the end of w -- the war [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I already told you that I worked for the Polish government in exile, I mean, this is the answer, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s75">Did -- when was the first time you went back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: After 45 years, the first time I was in Warsaw in a -- a -- at the invitation of Lech Walesa on the 10th anniversary of the Solidarity, or Solidarnosc.</span> <span id="s77">And that was at the time when the first non-Communist government of Poland was being formed.</span> <span id="s78">So it was -- I was there, yeah, I went to [indecipherable] to see for myself, on 20 -- on 30 of August, ’89, after 45 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Can you tell me what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Well, i-it was a very moving experience.</span> <span id="s81">For 45 years as the director of Radio Free Europe, I was on the top of the blacklist as the enemy of Communist.</span> <span id="s82">And of course, I could not go back.</span> <span id="s83">And I never -- I was convinced that one day Poland will be free again, because I sensed that the Soviet system has so many inherent contradictions, that sooner or later these contradictions will bring down the -- the system.</span> <span id="s84">But I never hope that it may happen in my life.</span> <span id="s85">And it came unexpectedly really, and without bloodshed.</span> <span id="s86">And the people were -- felt that Radio Free Europe did make a considerable contribution to this bloodless liberation.</span> <span id="s87">And so I went privately on the [indecipherable] of, I believe it was TWA plane, or a -- or Pan American plane, and didn’t expect any welcome.</span> <span id="s88">I -- I thought some members of my family will be there, bu-but I didn’t know that Radio Free Europe did broadcast the news of -- that I will be in Warsaw, and the time of arrival, the plane.</span> <span id="s89">So, after 45 years, the plane -- I touched again the Polish soil, I was very moved, I saw the terminal with the -- this [indecipherable] Warsaw.</span> <span id="s90">And I saw many people, crowds of people on the terrace and around the building.</span> <span id="s91">And I ask myself, why, how’s it?</span> <span id="s92">I mean, it’s Tuesday, a weekday, why they should be there?</span> <span id="s93">And they -- when we were going towards the exit, two Americans were behind me and they said, there must be a VIP on the boat, because a group of people are waiting in front of the plane.</span> <span id="s94">That was for me.</span> <span id="s95">And the entire leadership of Solidarity was in the front of the plane, I had fantastic welcome, and -- by this hundreds of people who came to the airport.</span> <span id="s96">And the next -- I -- the next day, the hostess, my hostess, offered that she will take me to the downtown, to the city.</span> <span id="s97">And I said no, because after all, I was born in Warsaw, and I would like to be -- to see my city alone.</span> <span id="s98">I said, you will have a -- it was in suburb -- you will have a problem to find a taxi, because they don’t stop, you have to find the taxi stop.</span> <span id="s99">I said, okay, I will manage.</span> <span id="s100">I went to the main street, and here was a taxi.</span> <span id="s101">So I raised my h -- my hand and su -- the taxi stopped.</span> <span id="s102">So I jumped in and the taxi driver said I know who you are, because you were on television, on the evening.</span> <span id="s103">Okay, he took me to the place which I requested, and the fare was [indecipherable] it was 27 cents, because of the dollar was very high.</span> <span id="s104">So I decided, no, I will give him a dollar at least.</span> <span id="s105">I gave him a dollar and he said, keep this dollar for yourself.</span> <span id="s106">I said, why?</span> <span id="s107">How much?</span> <span id="s108">He said nothing.</span> <span id="s109">Why nothing?</span> <span id="s110">Because I was listening to Radio Free Europe for so many years, free, wh -- I -- I want to give you -- offer you one free drive.</span> <span id="s111">And that was to me very moving, you know, this one dollar was the best reward I got for 25 years of work [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you go back to your old neighborhood, or your old home?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, Warsaw was destroyed, the house where I lived was rebuilt, but the place where I actually lived, nonex -- was non-existing.</span> <span id="s114">Where -- so that, no, I could not find any of my old places.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Did your visit to Warsaw bring back memories of -- of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Oh yes, definitely, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Well, you know, this was the city when I spent my childhood.</span> <span id="s119">My school, times of my -- my high college, and where I spent my -- the time of -- of my underground activities, until I left for the west, what ak -- what more can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Was it -- were they -- the memories, whether it -- was the feeling the positive, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, the po -- feelings -- th-there was a feeling of tremendous happiness, really, that I can be back in my own city, among my -- my old people.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: In 1951 is when you began --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: -- working for Radio Free Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Radio Free Europe, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Well, I moved to Munich.</span> <span id="s128">I got the housing there, and since that, until -- [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: I was asking about your move to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes, well I moved to Munich, it was December ’51, and took over my job and was organizing my -- the Polish service.</span> <span id="s131">I was involved in recur -- recruiting people.</span> <span id="s132">Run, dry run, training them, and organizing the program.</span> <span id="s133">The inauguration of our program was on May third, May third, ’52.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did your experience in the underground help you in your job as -- as --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Oh yes, well it gave me a very good knowledge of the -- of the situation in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And you stayed as director from 1951 --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: From 1951 until first of January, ’76.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: During that period is there -- is there any one story or any one thing that you remember that stands out the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Look, I mean, there were so many stories.</span> <span id="s140">I -- I wrote the book in two volumes.</span> <span id="s141">I cannot possibly single out one story.</span> <span id="s142">There were so many.</span> <span id="s143">It was a fascinating life, full of stories, and full of, let’s say adventures, different kind that -- during the war.</span> <span id="s144">But they were adventures.</span> <span id="s145">After all, the -- we had the -- I had several fronts.</span> <span id="s146">I worked with the American management and had to argue about the policy with the Americans.</span> <span id="s147">I had the -- my team, which was very large one.</span> <span id="s148">At one moment they were more than 100 people.</span> <span id="s149">And finally, the main front was Communism, I had to -- to fight Communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How large was your staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: It di -- it started with about 80 people, but later on it was much more -- m-more than -- more than 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And can you tell me a little bit about the -- the programming, how many hours a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, it was the only all time programming.</span> <span id="s154">We did start at five in the morning, and we ended after midnight.</span> <span id="s155">It was a sort of a continuation of the free Polish radio which did exist before the war.</span> <span id="s156">And we even adopted some features of the Polish radio.</span> <span id="s157">For instance, the cra -- the -- the program did end with the Polish national anthem.</span> <span id="s158">In the middle we had, in the Polish radio at noon, they would transmit the so-called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s159">You know, the very old tune, which was played by trumpeter on the top of the tower of the old gothic church in Kraków.</span> <span id="s160">We did broadcast this, so in fact it was a kind of a substitute and continuation of the Free Polish Radio.</span> <span id="s161">And we had everything, first of all news, every hour on the hour.</span> <span id="s162">10 minutes news so that everybody in Poland knew that when, with the strike of an hour, you can turn on [indecipherable] and he will hear the recent news.</span> <span id="s163">There were, of course, political commentaries, round table discussions, press reviews, all kind of, you know, political future, such as you find in the public radio, public television.</span> <span id="s164">But there was -- there were also the program for a -- for a th -- for the country, for the village, for -- for the farmers.</span> <span id="s165">And the program for women, program for workers.</span> <span id="s166">There was sport, musical programs, everything that you expect from the normal Polish -- normal h-home radio.</span> <span id="s167">This was, as I say, a substitute.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Were you yourself on the air?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Oh yes, but not -- not regularly.</span> <span id="s170">I broadcast when something really very important happened.</span> <span id="s171">I did not broadcast every day, or even every month, but when something of great importance happened, then I was on the air.</span> <span id="s172">And people knew that it was -- that there was some -- something important in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Can you give me an example of -- of one of those times?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Well, for instance, in 1956, there were a big upheaval [indecipherable] and the Russians did -- or for instance when the Polish [indecipherable] was arrested, which was a big blow against the church, I would go -- go on the air and make my comments about it.</span> <span id="s175">When they were anti-com -- anti-Communist party upheavals in October ’56, then I would make comments about it.</span> <span id="s176">So, whenever there was something very important, I was on the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: You -- when you went back to Warsaw, you understood the impact that you had on those lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Oh yes, because people were telling me.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: How -- how did you know what impact you had on people’s lives in Poland during the time that you were broadcasting?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s181">Well, in the first place, we did meet people who went to the west.</span> <span id="s182">Two, the most important indication of effectiveness were attacks -- propaganda attacks by the regime, which were very intense.</span> <span id="s183">Attempts to discredit us, discredit me, and jamming.</span> <span id="s184">I mean jamming was a very expensive operation, and the jamming, that indicated that they considered our broadcast as effective and dangerous.</span> <span id="s185">And finally the Americans did have a contract with the measure audience analysis institutions in Demark, in Austria, and they were conducting, you know, public opinion polls among people who were coming from Poland.</span> <span id="s186">So we had pretty good indications of our effectiveness.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: And letters, but we didn’t attach too much importance to letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Were any other -- did you stay in touch with any other members of the underground that you associated with during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: First of all, there was no underground movement after the war.</span> <span id="s191">There was for sometime, and was eliminated by the political police.</span> <span id="s192">But I had my friends, and some of them would, in great secret, contact me when they were in the west.</span> <span id="s193">So yes, I did -- I was in contact with my old friends and associates.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Are you still today?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Oh, by -- by all means.</span> <span id="s196">Y -- y -- even more, because it’s no longer any risk to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Y-You talked about how your experiences a -- underground gave you experience to -- to do your job --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: -- at -- as -- at Radio Free Europe.</span> <span id="s200">Can you -- can you talk a little bit about how you applied some of those experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, first of all I believed that I had a very good knowledge of people, of mood, of the situation.</span> <span id="s202">Therefore, I could build the program in such manner that it is best tune to the mentality, interests, traditions of the Polish audience, something I could not do in BBC.</span> <span id="s203">In the BBC, British were deciding what to broadcast and how.</span> <span id="s204">Here we had -- Americans gave us considerable editorial autonomy.</span> <span id="s205">They believed that only free Poles know how to broadcast to their compatriots.</span> <span id="s206">And therefore I could use my knowledge of the audience to make broadcast as effective as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I did come to United States in November, ’77.</span> <span id="s209">I spent almost two years in a sort of a [indecipherable] we had a small house in Austria in the Alps, [indecipherable] lonely house, with beautiful views and we spent almost two years there, and I wrote my book co -- called, “Courier From Warsaw,” which was later published, in underground in Poland and here in United States in English, then also in France, in Holland, in -- in Sweden.</span> <span id="s210">And we spend this two years time, almost, not quite, simply to -- I -- I wrote my -- my wartime memoirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And you moved to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: In November, ’77.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And why did you decided to move to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Because I felt that I still was not old enough to retire, that my personal friend, Dr. Jezinski was the director of National Security Council, and I did decide that I could serve my old country by being here and by trying to influence American policy towards -- towards Poland and my part of the world.</span> <span id="s215">This was an ideal place, close to the administration, to the Congress.</span> <span id="s216">And with -- as I say, with few influential friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Zbigniew Brzezinski</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Was one of them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: But you see, people whom I knew in Radio Free Europe when they were very young, in the meantime they had high positions in the American life, so I had a lot of contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What -- what was your position when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I became the consultant to the National Security Council, and I was the consultant al -- until the present administration.</span> <span id="s223">In other words, to the end of President Bush term.</span> <span id="s224">And I became national director of the Polish American Congress, which is an umbrella organization.</span> <span id="s225">A spokesman for 10 million of American citizens with their roots in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Can I -- can I ask you about your personal life, meaning your wife, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, we met in the underground.</span> <span id="s228">She was a liaison girl, she was very active in the underground.</span> <span id="s229">And when I came back from my secret trip to Sweden, I brought with me the mail in mi-microfilms.</span> <span id="s230">And the liaison girl who came to pick up this film was my future wife.</span> <span id="s231">This is where we met.</span> <span id="s232">And we were married during the Warsaw uprising, with the enemy lines only 100 years from the chapel where we married.</span> <span id="s233">And since that, we are staying together.</span> <span id="s234">It’s 52 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Have you had children?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: We have no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Did you leave the Polish American congress at -- at the end of the Bush administration?</span> <span id="s238">Have you no -- no longer --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: No, because the Clinton administration no longer con-continued consultants.</span> <span id="s240">There were no consultants.</span> <span id="s241">I was de facto consultant, and I am still in daily touch wi -- with -- with the -- with the NSC, National Security Council.</span> <span id="s242">But I was -- I am no longer on the list of consultants.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: I wanted to ask you how -- how often you think about the experiences during -- during the war, and in the underground, if -- if there are certain things that trigger your memories, music, or food, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No, because frankly, I wrote my memoirs, I wrote my two books about my career in the radio, and I hoped that I can put it behind me.</span> <span id="s245">Unfortunately, then the -- I had the interviews, and people asking, but I prefer to think about the present time and about the future, rather than about the past.</span> <span id="s246">It’s not very productive to live in the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: So you feel as though writing your memoirs helped you move beyond --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I -- I hoped it will be, but the people like yourself come and ask about my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: You had said that your time at Radio Free Europe was the most important time.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: It was definitely, by far the most important.</span> <span id="s252">Frankly, you know, I never thought that the -- the words, as a vehicle carrying ideas and information may have such a tremendous impact.</span> <span id="s253">A-And first of all, frankly we eliminated effectiveness of censorship, because it was enough to tune to us to learn everything that the censorship was trying to keep from preventing to know, to learn.</span> <span id="s254">So we destroyed the monopoly of media, ne -- monopoly of information and education.</span> <span id="s255">As long as this monopoly existed and people were isolated from the outside world, and flow of information, th-they could have been brainwashed.</span> <span id="s256">But once they had access to free sources of information, they wou -- they remained independent in their own mind and in drawing their own conclusions.</span> <span id="s257">The -- that was our role.</span> <span id="s258">Also, we did play a role of opposition and I discovered that the ruling group fights the opposition by doing what the opposition wants them to do.</span> <span id="s259">In other words, the [indecipherable] when it is widely known, government reacts to the opposition.</span> <span id="s260">They don’t want people to believe in what they say.</span> <span id="s261">And therefore they try to prove that you were wrong by acting exactly like you want them to act.</span> <span id="s262">We -- our first rally, probably it was the most important event in the history of political broadcasting.</span> <span id="s263">After Stalin’s death, and after Beria was -- was killed, a very high official of the Polish political police, who had -- knew all the secrets -- all the state secrets and party secrets, defected to the west.</span> <span id="s264">And after being debriefed by the CIA, we could use him and he was broadcasting all the secrets of the party.</span> <span id="s265">And th-there were -- the -- the entire Poland was listening.</span> <span id="s266">And political -- they had to find scapegoats because he was revealing all kind of crimes committed by the leadership.</span> <span id="s267">In order to defend themselves, they put all the blame on the political police and they -- it was reorganized completely.</span> <span id="s268">And the resulting chaos really -- I mean, decreased the terror.</span> <span id="s269">You know, people were no longer afraid because the entire apparatus of the repressions was paralyzed.</span> <span id="s270">And it was bef -- because of the effect of [indecipherable] that opposition in Poland could became much more articulate.</span> <span id="s271">They could speak.</span> <span id="s272">They could, in a sense, organize themselves.</span> <span id="s273">And that was our major contribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s275">I -- I was curious ha -- how you at Radio Free Europe dealt with the issue of anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, you see, right after the war, I believe that anti-Semitism was pretty dormant, but the regime, which was under great attack from the west, for violating democratic institutions, for forging the election, in a way that they want to -- to compromise the Polish people, and there are strong suspicions that so-called [indecipherable] was instigated by the political police in order to, you know, compromise the Polish people, but in fact, th-the sad part of the story is that this kind of provocation is that there was a provocation, did find a fertile ground.</span> <span id="s277">There was people who did the -- the d -- the fact, historical fact is that 42 innocent Jews who survived the -- the Holocaust and lost many, many of their relatives and friends, were murdered by the Poles in Kielce, and this is something that I myself, as a Pole, I am very am -- ashamed of.</span> <span id="s278">And I believe that we should and we did -- Poland did apologize for it.</span> <span id="s279">Then, you know, there was a anti-Semitism made in Russia.</span> <span id="s280">Stalin -- Stalin was anti-Semi -- was anti-Semitic, and shortly before his death, he ran so-called doctor’s plot, accusing his doctors of Jewish background of plotting against his life.</span> <span id="s281">And that was a signal for kind of anti-Semitism that was instigated by Russians in order to divert the attention of people from their poverty, from the inefficiency of the Communist regime, and to find a kind of a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s282">Jews were to be a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s283">And this was the kind of anti-Semitism spread by the Stalinist faction, called [indecipherable], in the Communist party.</span> <span id="s284">And they were opposed by intellectuals, liberal intellectuals.</span> <span id="s285">And among the intellectual [indecipherable] there were many Jews.</span> <span id="s286">And this is when we first really started to fight against anti-Semitism, ’54 - ’55, after Stalin’s sudden death, when this was the means to compromise, liberally minded Jews who were in opposition to the party line, to the party system of work.</span> <span id="s287">And there were some very outstanding intellectuals, who were opposing this kind of anti-Semitic trend, and we did a lot to support them to compromise the anti-Semitism as a -- something that is imported from Russia.</span> <span id="s288">Seeing as the people at that time hated Russians, this was probably the most effective way of fighting anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s289">We did -- dedicated lot of time and work to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You had a lot of programming that --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s292">Scripts, they are still in -- in existence, scripts.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: I think you had said in -- in the other interview that the -- your time in the underground was the most fascinating time of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: It was fascinating.</span> <span id="s295">Well, in the underground I had adventures.</span> <span id="s296">There wer -- this was a time a -- war time adventures.</span> <span id="s297">And the -- in Radio Free Europe, it was much less romantic.</span> <span id="s298">We were simply broadcasting, writing program.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: What is your attitude now toward -- toward Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Well, first of all, I hate hatred.</span> <span id="s301">In other words, I am strongly against the idea of eternal enemies.</span> <span id="s302">The Germans inflicted terrible, you know, blows to Poland.</span> <span id="s303">They not only murdered the -- most of the Jewish population, but the -- but about two million Poles were killed in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s304">They were executed, or deported.</span> <span id="s305">And the -- the years of German occupation were years o -- of terrible human tragedies.</span> <span id="s306">So frankly, you know, of course I had very strong feelings against the Germans.</span> <span id="s307">But after the war, when I was in Germany, I discovered that you cannot generalize, that there are also some Germans who are decent, and who would like to frankly, compensate in some way f-for what they did to the Poles.</span> <span id="s308">I --I -- well, this is probably a postman.</span> <span id="s309">Yeah, I -- I can do -- do it later.</span> <span id="s310">And ma -- the only problem I had with the Germans is their territorial claims against Poland, which were extremely dangerous to our existence because Poland was moved westward.</span> <span id="s311">We lost one-third of our territory and our people were annexed by -- by the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s312">And we were compensated by the big powers in the west.</span> <span id="s313">A considerable part of former Germany was incorporated into post-war Poland.</span> <span id="s314">We couldn’t possibly lost it again, it would be then a sort of a remnant state.</span> <span id="s315">And so this was the main problem between the Poles and the Germans, but in 1990, Germans recognized the border as final.</span> <span id="s316">It was ratified by the parliament.</span> <span id="s317">And as of that date, it was a turning point.</span> <span id="s318">And once the Germans reconciled themselves with the post-war borders, they are no longer a threat and there is a tremendous improvement in the Polish - German relationship, which I’m very happy about, because I -- I believe that hatred is a boomerang.</span> <span id="s319">If you hate other people, they will hate you.</span> <span id="s320">And so the reconciliation between Poland and Germany, which is very real, is probably the best achievement of -- of this Solidarity government.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: When you see that kind of hatred in -- in Bosnia and other places --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Oh, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: -- wh-what -- what does it --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well, you know, this is -- you know, the hatred brings about unspeakable human sufferings, loss of life, tortures, everything.</span> <span id="s325">Senseless.</span> <span id="s326">Senseless.</span> <span id="s327">So ethnic hatred, and any kind of ethnic or racial prejudices are extremely dangerous to humanity, and to everybody, including to Poles also.</span> <span id="s328">So I am very happy that Poland, after it go rid of its -- the Communist and Soviet domination is working towards reconciliation with all its neighbors, with Germans, with Lithuanians, with Ukrainians, Czechs and so on.</span> <span id="s329">And restored all the minority ethnic rights to -- to the -- its -- its ethnic minorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: In -- in the video interview you did, you talked about how angry you were, that it was a crime that the world didn’t do more to stop the Holocaust, that it didn’t listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s332">You know, this was my very tragic experience, because frankly, I was again an eyewitness.</span> <span id="s333">Of course the Jews were isolated, they were behind the walls.</span> <span id="s334">But we could -- I could still see the starving Jews who would escape from ghetto and die on the pavement from -- from starvation.</span> <span id="s335">So it was s -- it was a tragedy, human tragedy without any precedent.</span> <span id="s336">We did lose two million ethnic Poles, but only Jews were really condemned to death simply because they were born Jews, and had no chance to survive.</span> <span id="s337">And I was the -- the first envoy who brought this information about the Holocaust, with my colleague, Jan Karski.</span> <span id="s338">And then I will -- I followed.</span> <span id="s339">I was in Stockholm at the time of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, and I knew about it, and I wrote a memorandum to the Polish government that they should exert their influence on the British that some kind of retaliatory measures should be threatened to stop the extermination of Jews.</span> <span id="s340">And I know that the memorandum was passed to Churchill, but he was not prepared to any -- to any -- the only thing he -- I believe that my memorandum did contribute to the decision to prosecute after the war wa -- German Nazi war criminals, because soon after the decision was made to install the tri-tribunal, and announcements was made that Nazi criminals will be brought to justice.</span> <span id="s341">Then I came back, it was July ’44, and the ghetto no longer existed, but there were many Jews in hiding.</span> <span id="s342">And I got instructions to pre -- to b -- to prepare myself for my second mission to London.</span> <span id="s343">And to be briefed, to learn about the whole thing, so that I could again bring about some message, about what’s -- what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s344">So there was a man by the name of Volitski, who has his, you know, plaque in Yad Vashem, he -- he was -- who was the kind of a liaison with the Jewish militant organization.</span> <span id="s345">I spent hours with him.</span> <span id="s346">He told me all about the -- the uprising and all that.</span> <span id="s347">He was himself in touch with it.</span> <span id="s348">And I got on microfilms the report of the survivor of the Jewish ghetto uprising, and also photographs, documents, which I brought in my secret [indecipherable] as microfilms.</span> <span id="s349">And I was the one who brought this report of the Jewish militant organization to London.</span> <span id="s350">I reached London in December ’50 -- ’43, and th-this report was passed by the Polish government to the British government, to the organization and I was -- I did see many members of the British cabinet, members of the Parliament, intelligence -- people from intelligence community, and I was telling about what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s351">And, frankly, you know, as far as the British cabinet, there was no response.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: And when I talked to Eden, Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, he told me, Mr. Nowak, the best way and the only way we can help Jews is by winning the war.</span> <span id="s354">If we divert our limited war, you know, military resources to such objectives as bombing the tracks, it will delay the end of the war.</span> <span id="s355">And you know, when I came back to London with my wife, when I was writing my memoirs, and we went to Her Majesty’s records office, archives, I found piles of documents concerning my mission, including the reports from Eden to Churchill about our conversation.</span> <span id="s356">Not one word about the Jews.</span> <span id="s357">Not one word.</span> <span id="s358">I took to all of them, I raised the question of Jews.</span> <span id="s359">And I -- I strongly believe that retaliatory measures would have offered at least a moral help.</span> <span id="s360">That they would know they are not ignored, that the -- the world is -- sees that trad -- trade -- tradegy -- tragedy.</span> <span id="s361">So I feel that -- but even Jews would not believe me.</span> <span id="s362">I mean, I wa -- there was a Polish Jew by the name of Schwarzbat, who was in the Polish, you know, sort of a -- a parliament in exile, and he put me in contact with the American Jewish organization, Joint and others.</span> <span id="s363">And I spent hours with them, they didn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s364">When I said that two million -- at least two million Jews were already killed, they thought that this is unacceptable exaggeration, and that I must have some political motives --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: -- in telling this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Di -- it would seem that your frustration during that period made you more determined in your work later on --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: -- to see that changes occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s371">I must say that I used this very powerful instrument, Radio Free Europe, to fight anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s372">But all -- also we did not generate hatred toward Germans or Russians.</span> <span id="s373">We were, you know, defending our national aspirations, but the per -- th-there was no purpose of really generating feelings of hatred, because I strongly believe that hatred is a boomerang that would hit the Polish people back.</span> <span id="s374">And I was pa -- at the times when you know the -- the -- there was again the outburst of party anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s375">In times of a man who was in charge of political police, poli -- poli -- by the name of Motcha, and he was anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s376">And he really unleashed anti-Semitic propaganda.</span> <span id="s377">And the [indecipherable] of Jews, there were many Jews in the government, many Jews in the all kind of position, and there were many Jews among the university youth.</span> <span id="s378">And h-he started a campaign of anti-Semitism, like in Russia.</span> <span id="s379">And by discrimination, by persecution, by threats, he forced these people of Jewish background, who considered themselves Poles, to leave the country.</span> <span id="s380">There was a -- an exodus of young Jews who didn’t even know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s381">They were completely assimilated with the Polish culture.</span> <span id="s382">And there were Polish writers, Polish scholars.</span> <span id="s383">And this was again unspeakable tragedy for them.</span> <span id="s384">And we were going out of our way to at least offer these people a moral help by condemning it.</span> <span id="s385">And I had a lot of satisfaction when, for instance, a Polish essayist and -- and writer by the name of Roman Cast, who had to leave the country under this kind of purge, and he became a professor at what it’s called, Brooks -- Stone -- Stonebrook University.</span> <span id="s386">He came to mean and said, Mr. Nowak, if not for Radio Free Europe, I and my daughter wou -- would have committed suicide.</span> <span id="s387">And we were on the -- on the verge of doing it.</span> <span id="s388">But your broadcast made us believe that we are not alone, we are not isolated.</span> <span id="s389">That our -- and -- and the kind of moral comfort that we got by listening to Radio Free Europe, really, we decided, no, we w -- we will leave the country, we -- but we -- we -- we will live on with all this.</span> <span id="s390">And this was for me a tremendous reward.</span> <span id="s391">There were my former colleagues, Jan Kott, who is a very highly respected American scholar, was my schoolmate.</span> <span id="s392">He was of Jewish background.</span> <span id="s393">And they were all really highly appreciative of our -- of our efforts.</span> <span id="s394">Also, during the Israel six -- Six Days War, we were on the air from the morning until night, and the Israel embassy got I don’t know how many flowers, messages, from our listeners.</span> <span id="s395">Because of course, since it was -- since Russia, Soviet Union was on the Arab side, Polish people on the -- were on the Jewish side.</span> <span id="s396">So I think it was -- I am very proud of -- of this effort, which under my leadership was undertaken by Radio Free Europe, in fighting hatred and prejudice.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Do you think the world is capable of experiencing a -- the -- the kind of hatred that -- that the Germans had, an-and the kind of killings that they carried out during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, Germans themselves did a lot to weaken this feeling.</span> <span id="s399">After all they -- they made the democratic Germany, did not deny what they have done -- what -- what was done in the name of Germans, but they were trying to first of all make truth known to every German.</span> <span id="s400">And they were trying to make g-good for what -- th-these are things -- nobody can restore life to six million people.</span> <span id="s401">But they have done a lot to recons -- for reconciliation with the -- with the Jews in Israel and in the [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: But do you think that the world is capable of -- of -- you know, s -- you talked about your frustrations in -- in -- in -- inaction --</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: -- for the rest of the world seem -- seemingly didn’t do enough --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: -- during the war.</span> <span id="s407">Do you think that could happen again?</span> <span id="s408">Do you think that the world could stand by?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Well, you look at Bush now.</span> <span id="s410">I mean, this was ethnic cleaning, which may be an o -- perhaps was not a systematic murder in the factories of death, but nevertheless, people were being killed simply because they happened to be born Muslims.</span> <span id="s411">Or -- or Serbs, but mostly [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s412">This is again the same tragedy.</span> <span id="s413">The world should really encourage by every possible means, exchanges of people, personal contacts, reconciliation.</span> <span id="s414">And I am very happy the Polish gover -- government, after the fall of governments, are doing their best to seek reconciliation with their neighbors, not only with Germans, but also with pole -- with Lithuanians, for instance.</span> <span id="s415">So that before the war, Poland was at -- at the war with all its neighbors, no longer so.</span> <span id="s416">And I am very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: I wanted to ask you about one thing you said, that you thought your report to -- to Churchill I believe it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: -- helped with the investigation of --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: -- Nazi war criminals.</span> <span id="s422">Can you talk a little bit more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, that was not a matter of investigation, because Germans were still occupying power.</span> <span id="s424">But against warning Germans about some kind of retaliatory action, that if you don’t stop this systematic mass murder of Jews, you will be puni -- punished.</span> <span id="s425">And I said, you bombed Germany anyhow, why not to say these are our retaliatory measures for what you are doing, for instance, to Jews.</span> <span id="s426">And that was not -- not accepted, this kind of SOS.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: I wanted to ask you about, you have these pictures around your living room of -- of -- o-of you meeting with, I think every president from --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Carter.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: -- Jimmy Carter, and also the Pope --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: -- and Lech Walesa.</span> <span id="s432">Can you tell me about those experiences, what it --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Well, I really -- as you said, I worked with all of them, and with their stuff.</span> <span id="s434">And I must say that all of them did play a very constructive role in restoring democracy in east central Europe and in Poland.</span> <span id="s435">U.S. policy since the end of 70’s, is a story of success.</span> <span id="s436">And -- and I am non-partisan and I believe that both democratic administrations of Carter, and now Clinton, and of Reagan and Bush, contributed greatly to rebirth of democracy, and regaining sovereignty by these countries.</span> <span id="s437">And so to each of them we owe some debt of gratitude.</span> <span id="s438">I must say that since the time of Woodrow Wilson, no other president did more to Poland than George Bush.</span> <span id="s439">And this is not my partisan view.</span> <span id="s440">It’s simply that he was -- got deeply involved in support for Walesa, support for Solidarity, and then he made possible take off, successful take off of the free market economy, by offering considerable assistance, economical assistance, by reducing debts.</span> <span id="s441">So, I must say that I consider Bush, on the Polish sector as the president who did a lot to combat the Communists for the overthrow of government, and for installation of democracy.</span> <span id="s442">Democracy and a free market economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Do you remember anything significant that -- anything stand out from what these men told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I would have to -- to think about it.</span> <span id="s445">There were some stories, the problem is to remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Can you tell me about the Presidential Medal of Freedom that you received recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well, ni -- I wa -- it was a very unexpected honor, which I never s -- either sought or expected.</span> <span id="s449">But of course, once if -- I got it, I am very happy about this.</span> <span id="s450">It’s a recognition of many years of work and struggle for the common values, because since the beginning of the Cold War, United States goals and objectives were identical with our asp -- Polish aspirations.</span> <span id="s451">We did want to regain freedom, sovereignty and democracy.</span> <span id="s452">And you na -- it was in the interests of United States, and United States spent a lot of money, a lot of efforts to support our aspirations.</span> <span id="s453">So whatever I have done for my country of birth, I have also done for my adopted country.</span> <span id="s454">And th -- I am happy that my contribution was recognized by the president.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Would you mind reading that?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Well, you -- you should read -- please do read it.</span> <span id="s457">I don’t want to read it because I don’t want to advertise myself.</span> <span id="s458">If you want to read it, okay, I’m not going to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Wi -- it -- the award mentions your -- your work in the underground as well as your --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: -- work for Radio Free Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s463">Well, I guess that even by bringing, you know, secret reports of our intelligence, I did make some -- some contribution to the w-wartime effort.</span> <span id="s464">They were important reports, I am told, although I would never know the content of it.</span> <span id="s465">It were -- they were hidden in these small objects, and th-they are -- they were a key, [indecipherable], shaving utensils, and I never really read them, but I was told they were important.</span> <span id="s466">The British gave me the King’s medal for courage -- King’s Medal of Courage, which was very rare decorations, reserved to the foreigners who contributed to the British war effort.</span> <span id="s467">And this is the highest civilian distinction that United States is offering and I am proud of it, I am very happy about.</span> <span id="s468">I did -- this -- the decorations were never my objectives.</span> <span id="s469">I did not work to get honors and positions and all that.</span> <span id="s470">But when I get them, I am very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: What -- i-it -- I keep thinking of how your -- your work in -- in the underground was never your objective.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, you were reacting to circumstances, and what happened then led you to the path that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: -- you took, and had it not been for your experiences in the underground, you probably never would have --</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: True.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: -- gone in the direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s478">I think it was a kind of interlude.</span> <span id="s479">Bi -- I would never get into BBC without my wartime record.</span> <span id="s480">And then my wartime record brought the attention of Americans to my person.</span> <span id="s481">So, I was -- became pretty well known, and I -- I believe yes, the radio career was a kind of a continuation of my wartime activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Can you tell me what you’re working on now [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Well, I -- I am still, informally speaking, an consultant.</span> <span id="s484">I was until recently national director of the Polish American Congress.</span> <span id="s485">I was national director for 18 years, and I resigned last July, and -- in protest, frankly, because I didn’t like some kind of a statement of the president of the Polish American Congress, which in my view had an a-anti-Semitic undertones.</span> <span id="s486">It was in connection with the K-Kielce pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What was the statement?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: The statement was that Poland should not apologize for the pogrom, and I violently disagree on that.</span> <span id="s489">I think if you made a sin, the only way is to admit, and to say I am sorry.</span> <span id="s490">So I, frankly, you know, believe that I have to be faithful to my values, and I resigned.</span> <span id="s491">But I am still very active as a sort of informal consultant, almost in daily touch with the NSC, with the State department, with the agencies that deal with Poland, and with the members of the congress.</span> <span id="s492">It’s a kind of lobbying.</span> <span id="s493">On a -- in addition, I write a lot.</span> <span id="s494">I have a fortnight -- 10 minutes talks on the Polish radio in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s495">I record them every fortnight.</span> <span id="s496">And I -- I publish a lot in the -- in the Polish media, in spite of my late age, in spite of my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Have you been --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I am -- I am pretty busy, I must tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">It’s -- it’s apparent.</span> <span id="s501">Have you been to the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Many times.</span> <span id="s503">I was immensely impressed.</span> <span id="s504">I think Holocaust Museum is fantastic success, and it -- first I was really looking at -- at the exhibits.</span> <span id="s505">But when I went for the third time I was not looking at the exhibits, I was looking at the public.</span> <span id="s506">And I was impressed by the fact that there were crowds of young Americans.</span> <span id="s507">There were teenagers.</span> <span id="s508">And I watched -- watched how impressed they were.</span> <span id="s509">And you know, they -- when they were coming, they were laughing, they were you know, talking, whispering, everything.</span> <span id="s510">When they came to see one of these exhibits, shoes, total silence.</span> <span id="s511">They were so impressed, they stopped talking.</span> <span id="s512">And then I overheard one girl telling other, look, each shoe is a human being.</span> <span id="s513">So I think that educational importance of the museum is fantastic, and -- and became a landmark of Washington, I -- I can -- anybody that comes from Poland wants to go to see the museum.</span> <span id="s514">And -- and I think it’s a great success, the museum is a great success, and it -- I hope it will have a considerable educational impact on public.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s516">It was really such a short time ago, I mean it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s518">But it’s extremely well planned.</span> <span id="s519">I mean, people who were building the museum had the imagination, sort of a strategic way of thinking, and it is so well done, thought out, that it is really one of the most interesting things that you can see in -- in -- in the capital of -- of United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Do you -- have you had any contact with -- with survivors of the Holocaust [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s522">They -- I do meet them, and have very friendly.</span> <span id="s523">Mice Lederman is my personal friend.</span> <span id="s524">We are -- we are very close to each other.</span> <span id="s525">He is a survivor.</span> <span id="s526">His wife is -- is -- is -- was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s527">As a matter of fact, I was with Mrs. Lederman in Auschwitz, and she has said, this barrack, this is the barrack when I and my two sisters were living.</span> <span id="s528">So I -- I do know many, many survivors and we are on very good terms.</span> <span id="s529">As a matter of fact, as a eyewitness of the Holocaust, I was many times invited by Jewish survivors to tell about my story, to tell what I saw, particularly o -- by -- by the children of survivors.</span> <span id="s530">There were huge meetings.</span> <span id="s531">I was in Chicago, long time ago, in Skokie.</span> <span id="s532">I don’t know, there were probably 3,000 people there.</span> <span id="s533">Then I was invited to Los Angeles by Simon Wiesenthal Institute and they offered me a kind of a diploma that I am on their roll of honor.</span> <span id="s534">And I was telling them the story.</span> <span id="s535">And then I was invited to -- to Ottawa -- Ottawa in Canada.</span> <span id="s536">Again, big gathering of survivors.</span> <span id="s537">And I -- I always have a standing ovation.</span> <span id="s538">And I asked, look people, I am not telling you anything new.</span> <span id="s539">After all, y-y-you -- if you didn’t go through it yourself, then your parents who survived, told you all about it.</span> <span id="s540">Why are you so very interested in?</span> <span id="s541">And they said, because we sense compassion in the way you tell the story.</span> <span id="s542">And we still believe that the world is still indifferent.</span> <span id="s543">And when we saw the man who is emotionally involved in this, it gives us some kind of a good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: I will have to finish very soon, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: I’m -- I’m just --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Quarter to two.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: I’m just about finished myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I -- I’m wondering what kind of affect the -- the war experience had on your faith, and on -- on your spiritual outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes, well I am a -- a Catholic, and I am a believer, and I think that the war was just a chain of miracles.</span> <span id="s552">I mean, how I survived?</span> <span id="s553">I was trying to count how many times I was one inch from death, and I couldn’t count it, there were so many of the situation and I always felt that some invisible hand is really carrying me through all these dangers.</span> <span id="s554">It’s -- it’s -- the -- the fact that I was never arrested is a miracle in itself.</span> <span id="s555">But also you need the -- after the war in ’62, I believe, the governors who had the plan to kidnap me when I was in Helsinki, to watch the festi -- you -- youth festival, sponsored by Communists.</span> <span id="s556">And I believed that the g -- the g -- American intelligence intercepted some messages, and I was just left -- I was warned, go back immediately to Munich, take the next plane.</span> <span id="s557">And I did, and there are many indications that they were, in fact, trying to, you know, lure me into a boat, boy scout’s boat, which -- boy scouts came there and they were trying to invite me to visit their boat, and of course, I would never go there, I mean I realized this is dangerous.</span> <span id="s558">So I was miraculously saved many times.</span> <span id="s559">And I -- I am a believer, and I -- I -- I -- I am a Catholic, and -- and I will be to the end of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: The story that stands out in my mind is -- is when you were helping the young Jewish girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: -- through some sort of checkpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: And you were so close to being found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Well, this was again a miracle, you know?</span> <span id="s566">The je -- the girl was -- had a s -- Semitic features, you know?</span> <span id="s567">I was crossing the border very often, illegally, with the forged documents, but it was not written on my forehead that I am a member of the underground.</span> <span id="s568">Here was a girl who was obviously Jewish, and they were not allowed to go outside the ghetto, and to use public transport.</span> <span id="s569">And they we -- she would have been executed instantly.</span> <span id="s570">But I would be with her, this -- with the same -- same pistol.</span> <span id="s571">And never in my life I was so afraid at that -- this moment.</span> <span id="s572">My -- my -- my knees were trembling when it was all over.</span> <span id="s573">But I was -- frankly, I was happy I have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: I was going to ask you if there was anything that you would have done differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: You know, I remember one thing that my mother could never forgive herself and my brother and I.</span> <span id="s576">There were two Jewish children, and probably she was no more than nine or 10, and her brother was maybe four.</span> <span id="s577">And it was before the ghetto was sealed, and they were going from house to house, asking for food.</span> <span id="s578">So they were immediately, my wife -- my mother immediately invited them inside, gave them bread, soup, everything.</span> <span id="s579">And she said, well maybe you -- maybe you would like to stay tha -- and she said no, because the parents are in ghetto.</span> <span id="s580">We have to go back.</span> <span id="s581">And what happened, these probably poor children were later, you know, killed, and we always felt we should have persuaded them to stay.</span> <span id="s582">And my wi -- my mother would never forgive herself, that she didn’t use -- tell them don’t go back, because sooner or later you will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s583">Stay with us, we will put you in -- in hiding, we will change the color of your hair and all that.</span> <span id="s584">And we [indecipherable] to the end of her life -- she died 95, she said, why did we not really persuade these children to stay?</span> <span id="s585">Yeah, and this -- this was the story that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s588">But they -- they were not -- she was -- said no [indecipherable] Mommy is in the ghetto, y -- and Daddy’s in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s589">They send us for food, but they expect us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Do you ever have dreams about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: No, I -- no, I really don’t di - have any dreams, and I try not to live in the past, because it’s -- it’s useless.</span> <span id="s592">I wrote down whatever I had to, I am telling you the story willingly, but I wo -- I prefer to think about the present day today, and tomorrow.</span> <span id="s593">It’s much more productive.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: I’ve asked all the questions that I have, if --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: -- anything else you’d like to -- to say that we didn’t talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Well, I think -- as I say, the Radio Free Europe, I had three chapters in my life.</span> <span id="s598">The first was underground, the second was radio, the third is now.</span> <span id="s599">And I believe of all three, radio was the most productive, because we did support effectively, evolutionary, non-violent change.</span> <span id="s600">And we are told by the people in Poland that without this instrument of supporting evolutionary changes, bloodless changes, there would be no -- no end of Communism.</span> <span id="s601">And so many people wrote me about it, told -- Walesa was the one who said, with a -- if you -- not for you, we stay symbolic because not my work, it’s the w -- collective work of all my friend, I would not be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: He told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yes, and so did Garamic [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s604">I was invited to speak before the Parliament and Garamic said, here is the man, without this man we would not be here, which is exaggeration, at least in this sense, that I was part of a collective effort.</span> <span id="s605">And all the, you know, attention is focused on me, but I only personalize the effort of many people who worked together, and with the same kind of dedication.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Thank you for talking with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">End of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s612">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s613">PAGE 19 Interview with
