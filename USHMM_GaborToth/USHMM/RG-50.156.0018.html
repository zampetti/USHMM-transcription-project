Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is June 24, 1981, and I’m at the home of Max Grosblat, and this is Riv-Ellen Prell.</span> <span id="s5">I want to begin by asking you a set of questions just about your background in general, so where you were born, in what town and country?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I was born in Dubno, Poland, that was Polish Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: 1922.</span> <span id="s9">March 7, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: What size of a town was Dubno?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I would say it was about 60 to 70,000 Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What was the nearest big city that people lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: The nearest big city was Rovno and the next big city was Lutsk, which had about 500,000 people.</span> <span id="s14">Rovno had about 300,000 people.</span> <span id="s15">The area where I lived is mostly agriculture and a lot of fruits.</span> <span id="s16">They had apples, pears and a lot of orchards.</span> <span id="s17">We used to ship even to all over Poland from that part of the country.</span> <span id="s18">And a lot of eggs, poultry producing eggs.</span> <span id="s19">We used to ship into Warsaw, to Lodz.</span> <span id="s20">It was a very rich, agricultural part of Poland.</span> <span id="s21">The Polish Ukraine is famous for its agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My Dad’s name was David, and he was a cantor in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s24">My mother’s name was Feige.</span> <span id="s25">I don’t know if there is any name in the English to translate Feige.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And your name was Grosblat.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: In fact, in Poland, it was with a “j” in the middle.</span> <span id="s28">Grojsblat.</span> <span id="s29">Like you see in the Swedish name with a “j” in there, but we dropped it out because it was so hard to when we first came in, to start telling with a “j” in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Did you know your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s32">One of my grandfathers was a Chaim and he lived forty miles away from our town -- a small little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Was he a Grosblat?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: He was a Grosblat.</span> <span id="s35">And the other grandfather was Benjamin Ludler and he lived in our town.</span> <span id="s36">He was a meshkiach, so he was with the rabbi.</span> <span id="s37">And Benjamin, my grandfather passed away before the Nazis, before the war started.</span> <span id="s38">But the other grandfather, Chaim, perished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Do you know your grandmothers’ names too?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s41">They both passed away before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s42">Chaya was one grandmother’s name and the other grandma’s, I can’t recall right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Chaya was the Grosblat?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">The other name I can’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And do you know any farther back from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: No, not farther than my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Do you know where your parents and grandparents were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: (Sigh) In that general area of Poland, but it might not have been Dubno.</span> <span id="s50">Their parents or grandparents, when they had the Crusaders in Germany start after the Jewish people, they moved and settled in Poland.</span> <span id="s51">That’s what I heard from their conversations.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: You said your father was a chazan.</span> <span id="s53">And what was his father?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: His father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s55">Like custom-made tailor.</span> <span id="s56">You used to go in and he’d take your size and do it from scratch.</span> <span id="s57">My father was also a tailor, but he was a chazan and a tailor, both.</span> <span id="s58">And believe me, he needed another occupation to make a living there!</span> <span id="s59">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: But his primary income was from tailoring?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Tailoring, yes.</span> <span id="s62">And as a chazan, during the High Holidays, he usually got hired out, synagogue, but he was not on a steady income from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Did he have formal training to be a chazan?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s65">Everybody went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s66">And if you had a voice, you could become a cantor.</span> <span id="s67">He had a nice voice so he became a cantor.</span> <span id="s68">But I don’t think he had formal training for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span> <span id="s71">She had five children to take care of, so it was quite a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Which number are you of the five?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I’m the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: We spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Did anyone know Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s78">We went to Polish school.</span> <span id="s79">I also spoke some Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s80">In fact my dad knew quite a few languages.</span> <span id="s81">He knew German, he knew Ukrainian, Polish, Russian, because most of the clientele were Ukrainians, Czech people, Russian people.</span> <span id="s82">So he spoke to them in their own language.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: But at home you only spoke Yiddish to one another.</span> <span id="s84">And your grandparents, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I find this question a funny one, but was your family secular or religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: My grandfather was very religious, and my family was religious also.</span> <span id="s88">I am secular.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: But in Poland you were religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yes, I was religious.</span> <span id="s91">I didn’t eat no ham.</span> <span id="s92">Didn’t eat butter with meat, or stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did your father work on the Sabbath ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No.</span> <span id="s95">He never worked on the Sabbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: You said there were 10,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s97">That’s a lot.</span> <span id="s98">Does that mean there were many synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A; Yes.</span> <span id="s100">Quite a few synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did your family belong to one little one?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A; Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s103">It was called the Hasidisha Synagogue.</span> <span id="s104">Some of them were called the Triska, some of them were called the Triskasidim, some of them were called the Quoisushear -- all different sects of Hasidism that had their own synagogue.</span> <span id="s105">Right off hand I can think of one, two, three, four, five, six, about seven synagogues.</span> <span id="s106">I might have missed some too.</span> <span id="s107">And each synagogue had their own cantor and their own rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Do you know what distinguished your family’s Hasidic shul from any other?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well they were members of a Hasidic sect.</span> <span id="s110">I can’t remember the rabbi’s name that we were following, but my grandfather followed him, so naturally my father followed him, and then I followed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Can you tell me about the kind of Jewish education that you got growing up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, I had a good Jewish education.</span> <span id="s113">I could read the Talmud, I could read the Torah.</span> <span id="s114">I went to a Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: How old were you when you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Oh, about fourteen, fifteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Did you leave your town to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, our town had quite a few Yeshivas.</span> <span id="s119">First it started out with a heder, and then we had a secular school, after the heder.</span> <span id="s120">We went to secular school to learn Polish, and then after I finished the heder, I went to Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: I want to now ask you some questions about how you became aware of the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s122">The first question I want to ask you: What were the major events that you were aware of from about the mid-1930s -- that decade from ’35 to about ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well what was going on in Germany, we listened to the radios, we read in the paper, and then we met some people that the Germans expelled from Germany, because they were not German citizens, they were Polish citizens, so as they came back.</span> <span id="s124">We heard from them what was happening in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Were they people from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Some of them were from our town; in fact, some of them stayed with us when they came back.</span> <span id="s127">They didn’t have a place to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Were there any events locally -- in your town or region?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Besides a fight between the Ukrainians and the Jewish groups, there wasn’t anything of significance.</span> <span id="s130">But anti-Semitism in our town -- we knew we had to stay away from the church after Sunday services, because when they came out of the services, all they were looking for was Jews to start a fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did your family have contacts with the gentiles?</span> <span id="s132">Did you, for example?</span> <span id="s133">Did your father do business with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Most of our customers were gentiles.</span> <span id="s135">In our town they used to come to the city, sell their agriculture products, and buy some material to make clothes.</span> <span id="s136">And they used to come into our house, and we used to talk their language.</span> <span id="s137">Some of them didn’t have enough money to pay, so they used to bring some agriculture products to pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Did you exchange information about the war in Germany with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: (Sigh) We did not talk any politics or anything like that with the gentile people.</span> <span id="s140">What we talked about, it was just whatever he wants to have, a suit or pants or a jacket.</span> <span id="s141">Business.</span> <span id="s142">That’s all we talked with them.</span> <span id="s143">We never talked any politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: The next question you in some way already responded to, and that is what kind of encounters you had with anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Well, like I said, there were some groups -- not all of them -- but some groups were picking on Jews, and we were a bunch of rough Jewish guys in there too.</span> <span id="s146">We never stepped away from a fight, so we used to have fights with some of those roughnecks.</span> <span id="s147">I used to come home with a black eye.</span> <span id="s148">And we already knew what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you have relatives who lived outside of that region that you described?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s151">I had, in the city of Lusk, an uncle -- my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s152">In our town I had two uncles and two aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Do you know what happened to them during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, one aunt left before the war.</span> <span id="s155">She is in Israel now.</span> <span id="s156">And the rest of them perished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Did you ever serve in the military in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: No, I did not serve in the military.</span> <span id="s159">But I joined the underground.</span> <span id="s160">They called it the Partisan group.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: That’s what I want to talk to you about next.</span> <span id="s162">From the sheet you filled out, it said that you were in a ghetto for a year.</span> <span id="s163">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Our part of the country, when the war started in 1939, the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s165">The Germans took over part -- and our part, where we lived, the Russians came in September, 1939.</span> <span id="s166">We were two years under the Russians until the war started between Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s167">So the Germans came in in ’41 -- on June 24, I think.</span> <span id="s168">Right away they ordered all the Jewish people to move into a certain area which was south of the city, near a river, and they gave us about three blocks from east to west, three blocks wide, and seven blocks ling from north to south.</span> <span id="s169">This was our area, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Those 10,000 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: At that time there were a lot less, because when the Russians came in, some people that were wealthy moved to Russia.</span> <span id="s172">Some people volunteered to go to work in Russia.</span> <span id="s173">And when the war started with Germany, a lot of people ran away.</span> <span id="s174">So I would say maybe 6,000 Jews were in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Did any members of your family leave, other than the aunt you described who went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: My aunt went to Israel in 1937, two years before the war started.</span> <span id="s177">It was hard to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s178">You had to join the Zionist organization and work two or three years before you could go.</span> <span id="s179">But my aunt married into a family that they had family in Israel, and for them it was easier.</span> <span id="s180">They sold everything and they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: At the outbreak of the war in ’39 you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Seventeen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: How did you receive the news of the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, in ’39, the Polish government wasn’t that crazy for the Jews and so it didn’t really matter that time when the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s185">Some people it mattered more, because if they had some wealth, the Russians said, “bourgeois,” and they took everything away.</span> <span id="s186">And they sent them to -- maybe it’s not Siberia -- but to deep Russia someplace.</span> <span id="s187">But it didn’t affect us because our family was more or less a working family.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Had you started working?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes, I started working.</span> <span id="s190">I worked as an assistant manager.</span> <span id="s191">You see, the Russians have a system where everything is under the government.</span> <span id="s192">If you want to buy something, groceries or whatever it is, it’s all government owned!</span> <span id="s193">And they had stores opened up and I was assistant manager in one of those stores where it was in a military compound.</span> <span id="s194">It was called “Moientork”, which means for military personnel only.</span> <span id="s195">They could only buy things there.</span> <span id="s196">Civilians couldn’t even get in.</span> <span id="s197">And then, in 1941, they had what they call “maneuvers”.</span> <span id="s198">So I had to go with this military compound that went 200 miles away in the woods where they conducted their maneuvers, and I had to set up a store which I was running there by myself.</span> <span id="s199">I was, by that time, nineteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: That’s when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: We were supposed to stay there for six weeks and all of a sudden, everything left in a hurry.</span> <span id="s202">I heard that the Germans attacked and there is a war, so I just came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What was the reaction of the people around you in the community to the war?</span> <span id="s204">Were there meetings or some such thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No, people were just talking -- standing on the street and talking, and expecting rough times.</span> <span id="s206">But nobody expected the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Does that mean that you had no information of how badly the Jews had been treated in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: We heard about it, but from hearing to living it are two different things.</span> <span id="s209">We didn’t live through it, so we didn’t really realize how bad.</span> <span id="s210">At that time they weren’t killing anybody.</span> <span id="s211">Some Jewish businesses, they broke into or destroyed or broke windows or whatever, but we didn’t hear of anybody getting killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: At that point in ’41, was there any discussion about trying to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I wanted to get out, but there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s214">My sister managed to leave into deep Russia, and she survived.</span> <span id="s215">When she heard the Germans were coming, she and a group of other girls just left for Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: How old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: My sister was two years younger.</span> <span id="s218">I was nineteen, she was seventeen at the time.</span> <span id="s219">But she belonged to the Komsomol.</span> <span id="s220">The Komsomol was the youth organization of the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s221">So they actually encouraged them to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: She was the only Communist in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah, she was the only one, but you can’t really call it a Communist.</span> <span id="s224">It was a youth group.</span> <span id="s225">Thanks to that she is alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Do you know if your parents tried to discourage her from going to Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s228">One of my cousins left too.</span> <span id="s229">He was not in the youth group.</span> <span id="s230">And he survived also.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: How did life change, economically and socially, after the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s232">Was the first thing the move to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Well, fortunately, we lived in that part of the town where the ghetto started, but in our house of four rooms, we had to take in one aunt and her family, and one uncle and his family.</span> <span id="s234">So there were three families in the house, four rooms.</span> <span id="s235">Each had a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And you obviously couldn’t keep working for the Russian army, so what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No, they left.</span> <span id="s238">(Sigh) The Germans had some work -- like I was cutting wood.</span> <span id="s239">In our part of the country, you used to heat the stove, with wood.</span> <span id="s240">So we had to saw it and cut it.</span> <span id="s241">I was working for the outfit that was called the Gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s242">The Gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s243">It’s like the police.</span> <span id="s244">Nobody wanted to go there, so they sent me over there.</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t have no choice.</span> <span id="s246">It turned out that the guy I worked for, a German, was a decent person and he used to give me some food.</span> <span id="s247">And then I took my cousin in there, to work with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did your father continue to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, my father didn’t continue to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So you were supporting your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I was supporting my family, and they were selling everything, whatever they could, to get some food.</span> <span id="s252">There is a story behind this -- that my father didn’t work.</span> <span id="s253">The Germans used to come up with different “shtiks.’</span> <span id="s254">Like.</span> <span id="s255">“The ghetto is going to be divided.</span> <span id="s256">On this side of the ghetto, let’s say, on the east side -- two blocks, three blocks -- are the people that don’t work, and four blocks on the west side, the people that work are supposed to live there.’</span> <span id="s257">So my father didn’t work, and we had to move out on the other side, and you couldn’t find no place where to go.</span> <span id="s258">So I went to Otto, that guy I worked for, and I told him.</span> <span id="s259">“We have to move over on the other side and I haven’t got no place where to move.’</span> <span id="s260">He said, “You know me.</span> <span id="s261">You know everybody around here.</span> <span id="s262">So don’t worry.</span> <span id="s263">Just stay there.’</span> <span id="s264">He wouldn’t come out and tell me that if you move on the other side, you won’t live long.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: You mean these people were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: They surrounded it and they took them all out and they shot them!</span> <span id="s267">Behind the city, five or ten kilometers, they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And that was within just the beginning of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Within three or four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Do you know how many people that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Must have been about 3,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So you must have known immediately what they were up to.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s274">Sure we knew it.</span> <span id="s275">There was nothing we could do about it.</span> <span id="s276">I did, but most of them didn’t.</span> <span id="s277">At first we didn’t know what happened there, but one fellow, he was on top of the pile.</span> <span id="s278">The bullet just went through his neck and they left him for dead, but he crawled out and came back to the ghetto, and he told the people what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Well, forgive me for asking the question again, but -- what was the response?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: What can we do?</span> <span id="s281">They took all the leaders away, they took the rabbis away.</span> <span id="s282">The minute they made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s283">There was nobody left to organize or to do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: I know that you joined the underground.</span> <span id="s285">Can you tell me when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: When I found out what was happening, I was still working, like I said, for the Gendarmerie, and we had a double garage.</span> <span id="s287">On one side of the garage we were sawing and cutting wood.</span> <span id="s288">On the other side of the garage we were collecting these weapons that the Russians threw away.</span> <span id="s289">And I told my cousin, “Let’s get some of the weapons out of there.”</span> <span id="s290">And he said, “How are you going to do it?”</span> <span id="s291">I said, “I’ll get the key somehow.”</span> <span id="s292">And I went in the office and put a pile of wood for the stove, and I reached for the key.</span> <span id="s293">I got out two rifles.</span> <span id="s294">One was a cut-off short one, one was a long rifle.</span> <span id="s295">I had a two-wheeler that they used to allow me to take the sawdust home so I took the two rifles and I put it in the bottom of that two wheeler.</span> <span id="s296">The long one was so long that it went all the way out that frame, so I took some rags and put it around there, and I filled it up with sawdust and I wheeled it all the way from work to the ghetto, all the way home.</span> <span id="s297">They looked at me, but everybody knew me because I worked for the Gendarmerie, so they didn’t stop me.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: This was in ’41?</span> <span id="s299">A few months after the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: It was about three, four months after that.</span> <span id="s301">And I had dug out a place.</span> <span id="s302">I hid them in there.</span> <span id="s303">But when I took them out, some people saw me.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Some other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s306">And when the word got around, people said, “We’re organizing something.”</span> <span id="s307">Got in touch with me if I want to join them.</span> <span id="s308">I said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s309">It’s more to the story than just this.</span> <span id="s310">When I was cutting wood in there, there was one Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s311">They had Ukrainian helpers -- the Germans did.</span> <span id="s312">They were called Ukrainish Militsia.</span> <span id="s313">That’s like the police.</span> <span id="s314">And when I was cutting the wood, one of those guys came in with a rifle and he said to me, “You see this rifle?</span> <span id="s315">With this rifle I’m going to shoot the Germans.’</span> <span id="s316">I was afraid that he wants to trap me and I moved away from him.</span> <span id="s317">I didn’t want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s318">Somehow he did make contact with somebody else.</span> <span id="s319">He was the one that took my rifles and took them out of the ghetto to transport them to a certain area in the woods where we were supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s320">He used to come to the fence and we used to give it to him through the fence.</span> <span id="s321">He had a bicycle, and he used to take it on his bicycle.</span> <span id="s322">And one time the Germans were there and they grabbed him, his jacket.</span> <span id="s323">He just threw the jacket off and ran away.</span> <span id="s324">(Sigh) He knew already.</span> <span id="s325">I knew too, when it was going to happen, because a lot of those Ukrainish policemen came into town, and a lot of SS people came into town, two or three days before they were going to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s326">I just told my parents, “I’m going to leave.”</span> <span id="s327">On the other side of town there was a factory making all kinds of meat products like sausages, and Jewish people used to work there.</span> <span id="s328">So we decided we’ll take a group of people and have some of those Jewish policemen escort them through the town.</span> <span id="s329">I’m not sure whether it was the second of October or the third of October that we left the ghetto, and the fifth of October they liquidated the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Did you go with your cousin?</span> <span id="s331">Is that who the “we” is?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: He didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s333">He had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s334">He didn’t want to leave his girlfriend, so he perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: So you went by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: With another group of Jewish people I knew from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Who all wanted to join the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Were there men and women or all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Mostly young boys, 19, 20, a few of them older.</span> <span id="s341">There weren’t any women.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: How did you make this plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, I didn’t know about this plan, but since they knew about my rifles, they contacted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So they had been organized.</span> <span id="s345">Were they Zionists?</span> <span id="s346">Were they Socialists?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: They were just people that were trying to stay alive.</span> <span id="s348">I couldn’t put a label on any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: How many were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Originally, a group of fifty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: I’m not sure I understand how all of you got out through that sausage factory.</span> <span id="s352">Try to explain it to me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Well, (sigh) when you used to go to work, they put you four in a row, all in a group -- a matching group.</span> <span id="s354">And two Jewish policemen guarded us like they were marching us to work.</span> <span id="s355">So we just marched through the ghetto and through the town like we are going to work in that factory, but we had to turn right to the factory, and we turned to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: And there were no German guards there.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No.</span> <span id="s358">Because we was about five miles behind town already.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: And those Jewish policemen also joined the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Oh yes, they joined us too.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: So you got out, and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: They told us that we’re going to meet in the woods.</span> <span id="s363">The woods were divided in sections.</span> <span id="s364">And section fifteen we were supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s365">And he said over there I’m going to get my rifles back.</span> <span id="s366">But when we came into the woods, nobody knew where section fifteen was.</span> <span id="s367">Besides that, the leader who took us there to the woods -- we went to sleep at night, we got up in the morning -- he was gone!</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: The Jewish person from the ghetto had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: The Jewish person from the ghetto that took us out was gone!</span> <span id="s370">We didn’t know what to do!</span> <span id="s371">And we didn’t know how to get to section fifteen.</span> <span id="s372">So we decided we better go out and start asking!</span> <span id="s373">So we went out there, on the road, in the woods, and there’s a wagon with a peasant and a boy, and we stopped them and we asked them for section fifteen.</span> <span id="s374">He described to us where it was.</span> <span id="s375">We told him we’re hungry, and he said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s376">I’ll show you where it is.”</span> <span id="s377">He went away and he left us there, and after a couple of hours he came back with two buckets of soup and hard boiled eggs, and bread, but he said, “I’ve got to have some money.”</span> <span id="s378">So whoever had some money, we paid him some money, and he kept it up for a couple of weeks like that -- he brought us this food in there.</span> <span id="s379">It was getting towards winter and we started to think, what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s380">We’ve got to have a permanent shelter someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Had you made contact yet with anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So you were all just on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Just a group of people without any leader, without any contact, without any weapons, without anything.</span> <span id="s385">So we started thinking about finding a permanent place where to stay the winter.</span> <span id="s386">And the group of fifty started dividing into smaller groups, because too big a group, too much attention.</span> <span id="s387">So six of us went our separate way and we went into an area where there was pines.</span> <span id="s388">And the pines are staying green all year around, so we started digging a shelter underneath, and we covered it with wood on top, and twigs, and put some sand.</span> <span id="s389">It was just like a hole in the ground, enough for six people to stay in there.</span> <span id="s390">In the meantime, we met up with some families too, that escaped from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: From your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s393">There were families -- husband and wife and children.</span> <span id="s394">They were about two miles away from our place, and were going out into the villages and getting food, and they were cooking.</span> <span id="s395">Everybody knew that there are some Jews in that area, but they had to go out and get some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: They were little peasant towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Villages.</span> <span id="s398">Before we decided to get into smaller groups, we were a larger group -- like maybe twenty-five.</span> <span id="s399">We started to dig a winter shelter.</span> <span id="s400">Our camp was about two miles to where the pine trees were.</span> <span id="s401">We worked all morning, and while we were working, we heard some shots.</span> <span id="s402">There were two people that were left to guard the camp, whatever possessions we had, and when we came back, both of them were dead.</span> <span id="s403">So we decided we better move out of there altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: You had no idea who shot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes, we knew who shot them.</span> <span id="s406">There was one informer, he was a local man.</span> <span id="s407">He was getting two pounds of sugar if he finds Jews in there.</span> <span id="s408">So he brought a group of Germans with him to show them where the Jews were, but lucky for us, there were only two in there, guarding.</span> <span id="s409">So we left that area altogether.</span> <span id="s410">We went to a village called Kaminagurah.</span> <span id="s411">Kaminagurah in English translation would be “Stone Mountain.”</span> <span id="s412">And while I was in a house there, I was telling to the peasant man the story about my two rifles and this guy, Joska Schuher was his name, who took my rifles and disappeared.</span> <span id="s413">This peasant, Joga Larich, knew my father and my brother, because when times were tough, my father and my brother used to go in the village and do some sewing, and they sewed some garments for this Joga Larich When I told him who I was, he asked me, “Where’s your brother Shlomo?”</span> <span id="s414">I said I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s415">Well, when I mentioned Joska Schuher, that I gave him the rifles, he called -- I was in one room -- “Joska Schuher, come here!”</span> <span id="s416">And Joska Schuher was with him!</span> <span id="s417">In the house there!</span> <span id="s418">He came in.</span> <span id="s419">and Larich said, “show me your rifle!”</span> <span id="s420">He was carrying my sawed-off shotgun.</span> <span id="s421">I said, “Yeah, this is my shotgun.”</span> <span id="s422">Larich said, “Give him the shotgun right away.”</span> <span id="s423">So he gave me the shotgun and he gave me some bullets with it.</span> <span id="s424">And I said, “I’ve got one more that you’ve got.”</span> <span id="s425">He told him, “You’d better give it to him -- the other one.</span> <span id="s426">It’s his!</span> <span id="s427">Give it to him!”</span> <span id="s428">They were fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s429">They were this group -- three brothers and two Jewish guys from the ghetto joined them, and they had two paratroopers from the Russian underground -- and they were hit-and-run with the Germans from one end of the town to the other end, and the Germans couldn’t catch them.</span> <span id="s430">So this group helped me get my rifles back.</span> <span id="s431">So I left for that area where I was supposed to collect my other rifle</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, with the other people that I was with.</span> <span id="s434">I got there and Joska Schuher said, ”I don’t have a rifle.</span> <span id="s435">What do you need two rifles for?</span> <span id="s436">I’m going to keep your rifle.”</span> <span id="s437">And I said, “Okay, keep my rifle.”</span> <span id="s438">So we stayed in the woods, and they had a group of people in there, and there was a family man with his wife in there, and he knew the area very, very well.</span> <span id="s439">He was a forester.</span> <span id="s440">So we stayed with them until the Ukrainians surrounded us and they started shooting at us.</span> <span id="s441">So we start shooting back, and we got out of there.</span> <span id="s442">Then we split.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Can you tell me roughly, is it in the winter-time?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yeah, it’s the winter time of ’42, December, around there.</span> <span id="s445">Because 1941, in June, the war started.</span> <span id="s446">We were in the ghetto one winter, because I remember we didn’t have no wood for heating the house.</span> <span id="s447">I had to go out and break some fences to bring some wood home.</span> <span id="s448">So it was ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You said they liquidated the ghetto in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: October ’42, not ’41.</span> <span id="s451">I think there’s a reference to our ghetto, when they liquidated it, in the book The Third Reich.</span> <span id="s452">One German engineer testified at the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s453">He was in Dubno working on some engineering project when he heard machine gun shooting and he went to investigate and that’s what he saw.</span> <span id="s454">He described it, and it’s written in the book.</span> <span id="s455">It was October 5, 1942, when that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So you’re now talking about December, ’42 or the early winter in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s458">So after they surrounded us and started shooting at us, we split again -- in smaller groups.</span> <span id="s459">We got out of there and we went to a different area.</span> <span id="s460">In our group, like I said before, there were only six of us.</span> <span id="s461">Pully Shuk was one’s name.</span> <span id="s462">Another one was named Chaim Riklis, and one I can’t recall his name, and one was a Russian engineer, a Jew from Russia, and one was from central Poland, and he escaped in ’39 to our area.</span> <span id="s463">So there were six of us.</span> <span id="s464">And the shelter that I described that we were building for the winter-time, one morning we woke up, and somebody was walking on top of our shelter, and it was a Jewish guy from the other camp.</span> <span id="s465">He called us and he said we should come out.</span> <span id="s466">“There are partisans here.”</span> <span id="s467">Chaim Riklis -- he was my friend -- he grabbed my shotgun and said, “I’m not going out there until I investigate a little more.”</span> <span id="s468">“Leave the shotgun here.”</span> <span id="s469">And three of them went out and as they went out, I heard shots.</span> <span id="s470">They shot ‘em!</span> <span id="s471">So I started shooting back.</span> <span id="s472">I think I saw one was wounded in the leg.</span> <span id="s473">They started jumping on that roof that we made to cave it in, but it didn’t give.</span> <span id="s474">I started shooting a few more shots and all of a sudden it’s quiet.</span> <span id="s475">We went out and they were gone.</span> <span id="s476">Chaim Riklis, my friend, was wounded, and two of them were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Of those six?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yeah Two of them died right there, so we buried them.</span> <span id="s479">We didn’t bury them right away.</span> <span id="s480">We got out of there and started running but we came back the next day and we buried those two.</span> <span id="s481">In the meantime -- Chaim Riklis -- another group took him with them, but he died later on because there was no medicine.</span> <span id="s482">There was nothing to heal his wounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Who was it, who was outside your shelter, who killed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Ukrainians working for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: They were working on their own!</span> <span id="s487">They were just trying to salvage whatever they could from whatever we had.</span> <span id="s488">Some of our people came out with some money, gold pieces, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: How were you living?</span> <span id="s490">How were you eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Well, we used to go out to the closest village and try to buy some food.</span> <span id="s492">Or else we used to go out in the fields, when the fields had some potatoes or kraut -- cabbage -- and take it from the fields.</span> <span id="s493">And carrots.</span> <span id="s494">Whatever we could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did you leave the ghetto with some money?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I personally had very little money, but some of the people had some gold pieces.</span> <span id="s497">Like that fellow that got killed from that shelter had some gold pieces with him, and we used to trade in the gold pieces to buy some food with it.</span> <span id="s498">But after this incident, I told the rest of the guys, “I’m not going to sit and wait till they come and get me.”</span> <span id="s499">At that time, the Polish population in the villages, the Ukrainians gave them trouble too.</span> <span id="s500">They wanted to chase them out of there.</span> <span id="s501">Off that land, because the area was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s502">So we guarded the Polish settlers in these villages, and we used to stay in houses, and we used to get food for guarding the villages!</span> <span id="s503">When they started coming shooting at them, we start shooting back.</span> <span id="s504">And word got around.</span> <span id="s505">When the Russian partisans came in there, they heard there’s a Jewish group in here that has weapons.</span> <span id="s506">So they sent somebody to see if we want to join up.</span> <span id="s507">And nobody wanted to join up except myself and that Joska Schuher -- that fellow that took my two rifles and then I got them back from him.</span> <span id="s508">So the two of us joined up with the partisan group.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Why didn’t your Jewish friends want to join?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: They were comfortable already.</span> <span id="s511">They were living in the peasant house where they had shelter and they had food.</span> <span id="s512">They didn’t feel like they want to go and join up with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And why did you want to join up?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Mainly for taking revenge for what happened to our people.</span> <span id="s515">And I figured if I’m going to be with a big group like that, I’ll be able to do it!</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So how did you join up with them?</span> <span id="s517">How did you find them?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: They sent word that they are in this village, which was about fifteen kilometers from where I stayed.</span> <span id="s519">I went there, in the area where they were staying.</span> <span id="s520">I went by myself.</span> <span id="s521">They asked me, “How many of you?”</span> <span id="s522">And I told them that so many people fought.</span> <span id="s523">And they said, ‘Do you want to join up?”</span> <span id="s524">I said, “I’d like to join up, but I don’t know about the other ones.</span> <span id="s525">I’ll have to go back and ask them.”</span> <span id="s526">So they said, “Okay, you go back and ask them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: What languages were you speaking to one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you know Russian that well?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well when the Russians came in to that area where I lived, from ’39 to ’41, in two years, I learned Russian.</span> <span id="s531">Not perfect Russian, but I learned enough that I was managing one of these stores in there.</span> <span id="s532">So I spoke to them in Russian.</span> <span id="s533">And when I got back, only Joska Schuher said, “Okay, I’ll join.”</span> <span id="s534">So the next morning, when we went to that area where they’re supposed to be, they were gone, but they left word with one local Polish resident where they were going to be, where we can find them.</span> <span id="s535">And he was joining up.</span> <span id="s536">So we went through woods, and the Germans caught up with us, we got out of fighting with the Germans, and Ukrainians caught up.</span> <span id="s537">In one area we saw Germans and we start shooting at each other, and it turned out these were partisans dressed in German uniforms, and this fellow, recognizing a Polish guy, said, “No, these are partisans.</span> <span id="s538">They’re just dressed like Germans.</span> <span id="s539">.”</span> <span id="s540">So we quit shooting, and they showed us where they were, and we joined up at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: How long did it take you to get to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I would say about three days before we caught up with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: When you said that you met up with Germans and Ukrainians, tell me what…</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Well, the Ukrainians were looking for Jews in the woods.</span> <span id="s545">In fact there was one Jewish guy killed.</span> <span id="s546">He was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s547">He was going to join up too, but he got killed.</span> <span id="s548">But this was not with my group.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And you found the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: We found the partisans and I joined in with a group of ten.</span> <span id="s551">We used to go out and do some underground work, like blowing up bridges and blowing up railroad tracks and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Do you know much about that whole partisan organization?</span> <span id="s553">Your ten were part of a larger organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s555">When I joined up with them, there were about 200 people.</span> <span id="s556">And the name of the partisan group was called Soyadinninya Oducha.</span> <span id="s557">It was named after the person who organized it.</span> <span id="s558">By the time I left it, there were about 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s559">I was with the general staff at that time, and they had different groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: What was the general staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: The general staff was the people that gave orders to the rest of them, what operations that you do.</span> <span id="s562">I was reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s563">I was with them from, January, ’43, until March or April of 1944.</span> <span id="s564">It’s about fourteen months.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: That whole time, were you living in the forest, or did you have a place in a village?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Part of the time we had camps in the forest.</span> <span id="s567">But the Ukrainians -- they were Ukrainian nationalists -- they surrounded us in order to chase us out of there, or to destroy us, because they were against the Russians too.</span> <span id="s568">They wanted a homeland of their own.</span> <span id="s569">And we knew they were going to surround us, but the general staff wanted to test the fighting of the people to see how they were for fighting against.</span> <span id="s570">So we had a good fight in there.</span> <span id="s571">We fought for two days.</span> <span id="s572">We had to leave everything and we got out of there just whatever we were able to take with us.</span> <span id="s573">We left all our wagons and supplies and everything, because there were so many of them.</span> <span id="s574">There was one friend of mine in that fight that perished.</span> <span id="s575">Sossick.</span> <span id="s576">He was from my wife’s town -- from Poland.</span> <span id="s577">When I got to the partisans, he was there already, a Jew.</span> <span id="s578">There were very few Jews in the partisans The Jews they wouldn’t take in unless they had their own weapons.</span> <span id="s579">All the other nationals, they could come in without any weapons, but a Jew they wouldn’t take in if he wouldn’t have the weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Discrimination.</span> <span id="s582">Call it whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: It was anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Anti-Semitism!</span> <span id="s585">The Russians killed some Jews, supposedly for violating some rules.</span> <span id="s586">I almost got it, too!</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: How is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Well the first encounter was they gave me horses to take care of.</span> <span id="s589">I didn’t know anything about horses.</span> <span id="s590">So when we camped, I was supposed to put on the front feet some ropes so the horses wouldn’t be able to go away to escape.</span> <span id="s591">I didn’t know nothing about it!</span> <span id="s592">I just put them in the pasture, and then when we were supposed to start up again.</span> <span id="s593">I was looking for my horses and my horses were gone.</span> <span id="s594">So they took me in and the general staff started asking me all these questions.</span> <span id="s595">How come I didn’t take care of the horses.</span> <span id="s596">I told them I didn’t know anything about horses!</span> <span id="s597">Nobody told me what to do with the horses.</span> <span id="s598">There was one fellow, when I was managing the store over there, he knew me from coming in in the store, and he told them, “What do you expect of him?</span> <span id="s599">He’s a businessman, he’s a clerk!</span> <span id="s600">He worked in a store!</span> <span id="s601">What does he know about horses?”</span> <span id="s602">And that saved me right there.</span> <span id="s603">But they did kill some Jews!</span> <span id="s604">Like for instance, two of them were standing guard duty -- one Jewish fellow and another one -- so the other one came back and told them the Jewish fellow was sleeping on duty.</span> <span id="s605">So they killed him for that, shot him.</span> <span id="s606">Just for what the other guy said!</span> <span id="s607">There was another young fellow, we were close to a village where his mother was hiding at a peasant house, and he wanted to see his mother, so they let him go.</span> <span id="s608">And the Ukrainians took his rifle away from him.</span> <span id="s609">He came back without the rifle.</span> <span id="s610">So what they did to him, they asked him where did it happen, and he went and showed them where it happened, and it was in a barn.</span> <span id="s611">They told him to go in the barn.</span> <span id="s612">They locked him up, and they burned the barn!</span> <span id="s613">And another Jewish fellow, a Russian Jewish guy, didn’t want to admit that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s614">He probably knew how big the anti-Semitism was.</span> <span id="s615">So he said he was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s616">What they did to him is, they had a record player, and they played a Jewish tune on the record player, and he was humming the Jewish tune.</span> <span id="s617">They watched him humming the Jewish tune, and then they accused him that he was a German spy, and they took him out and shot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Even though he was willing to fight?</span> <span id="s619">And that you understand was just anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Pure anti-Semitism!</span> <span id="s621">Just pure anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: But you described your rising in the ranks.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Because I was not afraid!</span> <span id="s624">Anything -- blowing up trains, or doing that kind of work -- they knew they could depend on me.</span> <span id="s625">They called me, in Russian, “Fearless Reconnaissance Man,’ or something like that.</span> <span id="s626">I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s627">I was in there to kill as many as I could.</span> <span id="s628">Just to take revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: If I can ask a hard question, is that how you understand your fearlessness?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: At that time, yes, I was fearless.</span> <span id="s631">I didn’t care if I get shot or if I get killed.</span> <span id="s632">I just wanted to kill as many as I could.</span> <span id="s633">That’s all I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s634">And every time we went out on an operation they were raving, “Mishka!</span> <span id="s635">Mishka!”</span> <span id="s636">they used to call me Mishka -- my name there.</span> <span id="s637">They made me commander of a group, because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Can you tell me, if you want to, about some of the operations you organized when you were a commander?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Well, we were close to where the trains were going to the front with German ammunition and weapons and everything, so we went out there and put some dynamite under the tracks and we had to pull a string to ignite it.</span> <span id="s640">We hid about 200 feet behind the tracks, and nobody wanted that job, to pull it.</span> <span id="s641">I was there pulling that string and then escaping after the explosion.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Sometimes it backfired?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: But you pulled it.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I pulled it.</span> <span id="s646">And then when they wanted to find out if the Germans are in certain areas, they sent me out there for reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s647">And I used to go out so close, they knew I was fearless.</span> <span id="s648">And so they gave me assignments like that all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: You had all Russians with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s651">All my people were Russians.</span> <span id="s652">In fact, some of the people were career officers!</span> <span id="s653">But they were under me!</span> <span id="s654">It’s a story to it.</span> <span id="s655">They joined up with the Germans to fight against their own people -- against the Russians -- these people.</span> <span id="s656">There was an officers school.</span> <span id="s657">They were training them for officers (Russian officers) in General Vlasov’s army!</span> <span id="s658">This German, he was a Communist, he came, and he told us about it.</span> <span id="s659">It was about 50 kilometers from where our camp was, so we decided to make contact with some of them and see if they were willing to join up with us.</span> <span id="s660">But you could only get one or two people on it, because if somebody found out that wasn’t in favor of it, you were done.</span> <span id="s661">This German we had encountered, he said, “We’ll just tell them we’re going on maneuvers.</span> <span id="s662">And you just bring your men here.”</span> <span id="s663">That’s what he did.</span> <span id="s664">He woke them up early in the morning.</span> <span id="s665">“We’re going out on maneuvers.”</span> <span id="s666">It was a group of about fifty of them and they brought them all in.</span> <span id="s667">And they started questioning some of them.</span> <span id="s668">The leaders were against the Russian system, so they killed some of the leaders there, but the rest of them stayed with us.</span> <span id="s669">So this is how I got some officers working under my command.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Where did you acquire your supplies from?</span> <span id="s671">You talked about horses, wagons…</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Well we used to go out and just raid!</span> <span id="s673">Just raid villages, especially those that were unfriendly to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Was there any contact from Russia to the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s676">We had an airfield!</span> <span id="s677">At night we used to make fires on four corners of the airfield and planes used to come down and bring us automatic weapons, explosives, and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did you have radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s680">Personally, I didn’t have no radio, but the general staff was in contact with Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You knew what the allies were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: You knew when the war was coming to an end?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So tell me how the war ended for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: We had instructions to go behind the lines in Poland when the Germans were pulling back, and we went to a river.</span> <span id="s687">The Germans gave us a good licking over there!</span> <span id="s688">Some of them crossed -- I have a brother-in-law that crossed there -- but I couldn’t make it across.</span> <span id="s689">There were just remnants of us.</span> <span id="s690">So we went back to report what happened, and they dismissed us.</span> <span id="s691">That was April, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: What does that mean that they dismissed you?</span> <span id="s693">In a forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s695">I went back to town!</span> <span id="s696">Where I lived!</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: You went back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s699">I went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: In all of this, how far did you get from your little town?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Well, I would say we went as far as Zhitomer from Dubno, about 800 miles or a thousand miles.</span> <span id="s702">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: On foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Well later on, when I was in the reconnaissance, I had a horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: But you went back home by foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: We just hitch-hiked.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And who was picking you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Anybody that was driving a truck or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Were they Russians?</span> <span id="s710">Or Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Mostly the military, Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s712">In fact -- this is another good story -- they gave me an assignment before they let me go.</span> <span id="s713">We had to take the horses back to Zhitomer.</span> <span id="s714">I was driving a number of horses, I don’t know how many of them…</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Why did they want you to take them back?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Well, there’s a Polish Ukraine and there’s a Russian Ukraine.</span> <span id="s717">The horses came from the Polish Ukraine and they wanted to take them to the Russian Ukraine to give them to the collective farms there, because in this part of the Ukraine there weren’t any collective farms.</span> <span id="s718">There were individual owners.</span> <span id="s719">While I was driving these horses, a truck passed by and a group of Jewish people from my town recognized me.</span> <span id="s720">I thought I was the only one left, but I saw a group of people waving to me.</span> <span id="s721">They didn’t stop.</span> <span id="s722">They just waved, and went on their way.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: But you didn’t abandon the horses!</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: I couldn’t!</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: I take it that you didn’t become a Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Oh, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Even though you worked so long with them and were willing to take the horses back to a commune.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Well, that’s something I had to do!</span> <span id="s729">But I never became a Communist!</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: So you dropped the horses off and went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Came back to Rovno.</span> <span id="s732">Rovno was about 60 miles from my town.</span> <span id="s733">I reported to where I was supposed to report, and the partisans were broken up.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: So who did you report to?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: The government in there!</span> <span id="s736">Whoever was in charge of the government.</span> <span id="s737">He told me, “Okay, you can go back home now.”</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: And who was left?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: A few people.</span> <span id="s740">I found out from one of the survivors in there that my father lived.</span> <span id="s741">About two, three months after the liquidation.</span> <span id="s742">He was hiding out in a shelter with some of the people that survived.</span> <span id="s743">And he went to the villages -- to the peasants that he used to know, used to work for -- and he thought maybe he’d make it through there, but he never made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: You imagine he was killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s746">Not the Germans -- the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s747">The Germans had plenty of helpers!</span> <span id="s748">The Germans you could fool.</span> <span id="s749">The Germans didn’t know whether you were a Jew or a gentile or what.</span> <span id="s750">But the local Ukrainians -- you couldn’t fool them.</span> <span id="s751">They would point out, “This is a Jew!</span> <span id="s752">This is a Jew!”</span> <span id="s753">-- even if you had papers says a gentile!</span> <span id="s754">Couldn’t fool them.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Do you know what happened to the rest of the members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: They got killed.</span> <span id="s757">Like I said, I read it myself in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s758">I told you about it.</span> <span id="s759">I imagine that’s how they got killed.</span> <span id="s760">My mother, and three brothers, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Some of your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: One grandparent that lived not in our ghetto but thirty, forty kilometers from us in a little town -- he perished there, and another son --my uncle -- and his three daughters.</span> <span id="s763">The whole family!</span> <span id="s764">There’s nobody left.</span> <span id="s765">The only one that’s left is my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Where is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: She is in Israel.</span> <span id="s768">She lives in Rehovot.</span> <span id="s769">She’s the only one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Do you know how your father got out?</span> <span id="s771">Did anyone explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Well, I built a hiding place before I decided to run away.</span> <span id="s773">I built a hiding place at our house and he probably stayed in that hiding place.</span> <span id="s774">And after a while, he joined up with the other people that had secret hiding places.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: There was no deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No.</span> <span id="s777">They killed them at the airport.</span> <span id="s778">They just dug big (sigh) holes, caves -- whatever you want to call them.</span> <span id="s779">We knew about the digging, too, because the word got to us before it even started, but as they told us, that’s going to be for keeping potatoes for the winter (laughs) So, I know exactly where it happened.</span> <span id="s780">And then when I read the book it described exactly what they did.</span> <span id="s781">They told them to undress.</span> <span id="s782">And they killed them one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s783">That’s what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: So what happened to you then -- after you were in your town?</span> <span id="s785">There were still a few people, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s787">Our house, for some reason, was demolished -- was rubbish.</span> <span id="s788">But across the street there was a gentile, Polish neighbor.</span> <span id="s789">When the ghetto was there, they moved out to a different place, but after the ghetto was liquidated, they moved back to their house.</span> <span id="s790">So I stayed with them for a while.</span> <span id="s791">I met my wife in the partisans too.</span> <span id="s792">I have to go back, where she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Oh, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I don’t remember what was the name of the outfit, but she belonged to our general staff.</span> <span id="s795">We were in a town named Kubichev, and some of my people told me, “There is a Jewish girl there.”</span> <span id="s796">So I went to see her, and that’s the first time I met her.</span> <span id="s797">She was released, and she’s going back to look for her sister and her brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: She was release by?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: By the partisans, already.</span> <span id="s800">There was that church where it was liberated, already, so they released this partisan -- her.</span> <span id="s801">My brother-in-law and her sister -- they were in the same outfit that I was.</span> <span id="s802">I knew her sister because when we were surrounded by the Ukrainians, she came and gave me some water to drink.</span> <span id="s803">But I never knew my wife.</span> <span id="s804">So when I met her, she told me where she was going to look for her sister.</span> <span id="s805">My brother-in-law, like I said, we split -- he wasn’t my brother-in-law yet -- he was on one side of that river they managed to go across, and I was on this side.</span> <span id="s806">So it took him a long time before he got out of there.</span> <span id="s807">Anyway, she told me she is going to Ostruk.</span> <span id="s808">When she came to Ostruk, I don’t know whether she found her sister, but there were some Jewish people, and the Jewish people kept her until she got united with her sister and with her brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s809">Then they moved to another little town, Stubenhoff.</span> <span id="s810">I was there in Stubenhoff, also, and I started taking her out on dates.</span> <span id="s811">And then when there was the repatriation back to Poland and Stubenhoff was under the Russians, and they left for Lodz, Poland so they got their papers and went back.</span> <span id="s812">I was also a Polish national -- even though I lived there in that area that the Russians annexed, I wasn’t born under the Russians -- so I got my papers and I went also to Lodz.</span> <span id="s813">And I looked up my wife; at that time, she wasn’t my wife, yet.</span> <span id="s814">From there I went to Gliwice.</span> <span id="s815">That’s another town that Poland annexed, it used to be German.</span> <span id="s816">And I lived there for a while.</span> <span id="s817">I did some bartering with suits, and I used to come from there to Lodz, and, I asked her, after courting her, if she would like to marry me.</span> <span id="s818">And we got married, on July 12, 1945, and we lived in Gliwice.</span> <span id="s819">We opened up a store.</span> <span id="s820">It’s kind of a butcher store.</span> <span id="s821">You could buy all kinds of meat products.</span> <span id="s822">In December ’45 we decided to go to the West.</span> <span id="s823">We will get out of Poland altogether.</span> <span id="s824">So we left Gliwice and we came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s825">We stayed in Berlin -- January, February -- in March, I think, we left Berlin and went to the American zone.</span> <span id="s826">Eschwingen, Germany.</span> <span id="s827">There was a D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Had you considered going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: And how did you make your choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Well, my sister was in Israel already, and my aunt was in Israel, but my brother-in-law had a brother here, in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s832">And in 1947, he emigrated here to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s833">So my wife didn’t want to split with her sister.</span> <span id="s834">She had only one and only a sister, and she said, no, she’d like to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s835">So I gave up my plans and we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: In 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: So how long were you in the D.P. camp in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A; From ’46 to ’49.</span> <span id="s840">Three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: I didn’t realize people stayed that long.</span> <span id="s842">What was your life like in the D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Well, I was taking up auto mechanics.</span> <span id="s844">And I guess I was good in theoretical auto mechanics.</span> <span id="s845">After I graduated, they offered me a job as an instructor.</span> <span id="s846">We got a ration.</span> <span id="s847">I worked for the UNRRA, the United Nations relief organization, and I had a higher ration than everybody else had, because I worked there.</span> <span id="s848">And then I got some pay, too, so we had one room and we shared a bathroom.</span> <span id="s849">We had a kitchen set up, a little electric stove, and we cooked in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s850">Somebody had to go to the bathroom, you had to leave your cooking.</span> <span id="s851">So for three years, we lived like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Were you waiting to be admitted to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: We were waiting to go someplace.</span> <span id="s854">They wouldn’t let us go to Israel at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: They would not?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No.</span> <span id="s857">The only way we could go to Israel is to go illegally.</span> <span id="s858">That’s the only way we could go.</span> <span id="s859">So we had to sit there and wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Were you aided by any agencies to get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s862">HIAS was involved and there’s another agency in the United States that takes care of overseas.</span> <span id="s863">The Joint Distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Do you consider yourself a part of the Jewish community here?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s866">I’m a member of the J.C.C. I’m a member of ‘B’nai Emet Synagogue.</span> <span id="s867">I don’t take any active part, but I am a member of the Jewish community!</span> <span id="s868">Send my kids to Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Two.</span> <span id="s871">The daughter you met, and I’ve got a son which hasn’t found himself yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: They were born here?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Son was born in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: In the D.P. camp?</span> <span id="s875">In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: In 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: And your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Daughter was born here in 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Do you keep in active contact with other survivors of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Not as much now as we used to in the beginning.</span> <span id="s881">In the beginning we had a club and we used to meet, we used to be in contact in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s882">After our daughter got married and you have grandchildren, you kind of take what’s closer to your heart, you know, and so that club doesn’t exist any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Have you been in contact with any partisans in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A; I haven’t been in contact with any partisans.</span> <span id="s885">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Now I want to ask you a number of questions that they would like to have your personal responses to, that are a lot more abstract.</span> <span id="s887">The first question is: What it means to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yeah, it makes sense to me.</span> <span id="s889">What it means to be a survivor is to show the world if you have guts and if you have nerve you can survive the Holocaust!</span> <span id="s890">And to show that not all the Jewish people went to death like sheep.</span> <span id="s891">Some of us didn’t accept it, and we were fighting!</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: After the Holocaust, as a result of it, do you have feelings about “human nature,’ about “Germans,’ about “non-Jews?”</span> <span id="s893">Do you have any response to those questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Feelings about human nature?</span> <span id="s895">(sighs) Humans can be swayed by their leaders!</span> <span id="s896">By demagoguery!</span> <span id="s897">By false accusations, anti-Semitism, they can become wild animals.</span> <span id="s898">It depends on the leaders.</span> <span id="s899">Basically human beings, if they have a nice, decent leadership, they’re human beings!</span> <span id="s900">But they can become animals if they have demagoguery.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Do you continue to have feelings about the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Well not all the Germans were that bad.</span> <span id="s903">I had one that I worked for that used to bring me in a loaf of bread behind his uniform and told me to hide it.</span> <span id="s904">And I forgot to mention a very important incident that happened in the ghetto before the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s905">There was one German-Austrian on a motorcycle -- he wasn’t supposed to come in the ghetto -- he was driving in the streets of the ghetto and hollering, “Jews, get out!</span> <span id="s906">This is going to be the end of you!</span> <span id="s907">Jews get out!”</span> <span id="s908">He took a risk, and he came and warned the Jews!</span> <span id="s909">Not all of them were Nazis or murderers.</span> <span id="s910">There were some decent people, but they were helpless to do anything.</span> <span id="s911">And they were afraid for their ow?</span> <span id="s912">(word missing in original translation) If they got involved, they might bury themselves!</span> <span id="s913">But some of them were doing it willingly!</span> <span id="s914">If the Germans would have different leadership, wouldn’t be a Hitler, I don’t think anything like that would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: One of the things you told me is that you’ve become a secularist.</span> <span id="s916">You described yourself as having grown up in a religious family.</span> <span id="s917">Is your choice to become a secularist tied up with your experiences in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: (Sigh) In the house we still keep kosher, my wife buys kosher meat.</span> <span id="s919">But if you go out, you can’t find a kosher meal here any place, so by necessity, if you can’t eat anything kosher, you eat un-kosher.</span> <span id="s920">So, in that sense, I’m secular.</span> <span id="s921">Half secular.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: But has the Holocaust affected your feelings about religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: (Sigh) It’s a question in my mind.</span> <span id="s924">Why the Jewish people are never taught to fight back!</span> <span id="s925">To be aggressive!</span> <span id="s926">Well, in Israel, it’s changed now.</span> <span id="s927">But, when I was born, there was always, “turn the other cheek,” a gun was something that’s not for Jews, and things like that.</span> <span id="s928">I would like to see a Jewish people know everything about guns, know everything about fighting, and everything about war.</span> <span id="s929">When times like what happened before, they would know how to act, what to do, how to organize.</span> <span id="s930">We were helpless, we didn’t have no organization.</span> <span id="s931">Even so, we managed to get out somehow, but we could have had a resistance in there -- “As long as we have to go, the whole town might as well go with us!”</span> <span id="s932">-- and keep real good resistance like the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s933">But it wasn’t in our nature.</span> <span id="s934">There was nobody to inspire us!</span> <span id="s935">There was nobody to organize.</span> <span id="s936">There was nobody to do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Well, Mr. Grosblat, you were very different than that.</span> <span id="s938">You did fight!</span> <span id="s939">Can you tell me why you think you were different?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: I remember an incident in school, when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s941">Here you have separate desks.</span> <span id="s942">Where I went to school, two of us were sitting together.</span> <span id="s943">And I was sitting with one Nicolaichek -- I still remember his name --and he was always kicking me, and he was always pushing me!</span> <span id="s944">And I just hit him!</span> <span id="s945">In class!</span> <span id="s946">When the teacher called us out, I told the teacher what happened and she still blamed me.</span> <span id="s947">She put me in the corner and I had to stand in the corner.</span> <span id="s948">So I had a feeling, as a kid, that I gotta fight for my well-being.</span> <span id="s949">I gotta fight for my rights.</span> <span id="s950">I gotta fight for what nobody else will.</span> <span id="s951">I was just a rebel!</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: The last question I wanted to ask you is if you’ve seen films about, or read many books about, the Holocaust, do you think that they accurately depict what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No.</span> <span id="s954">They left a lot of it out.</span> <span id="s955">There were times where they used to take babies and throw them against walls -- babies -- I don’t think I ran into any of that in the reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Well those are my questions.</span> <span id="s957">Is there anything you want to add?</span> <span id="s958">Or say for the record?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: What I’d like to add is, Jews should be more organized.</span> <span id="s960">They should be expert and should know weaponry.</span> <span id="s961">They should know their enemies.</span> <span id="s962">They should stand up -- should be able to fight whenever something like this happens.</span> <span id="s963">Not to take it lying down and be helpless and resigned to whatever is going to happen, to do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s964">Just take a knife or axe or anything, if they come after you.</span> <span id="s965">Try to get them first.</span> <span id="s966">The youth should grow up tough.</span> <span id="s967">You might not have to be tough, but you should grow up tough, and you should fight for what you believe in.</span> <span id="s968">You’re a human being just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s969">You happen to be born Jewish, and for centuries when all the anti-Semitism was going on it poisoned a lot of minds and even in this country, we’re still experiencing anti-Semitism, so everybody should be able to take care of himself.</span></p> <p><span
