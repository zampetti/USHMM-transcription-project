id="s13">Q: Could you tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s14">A: My name is David Pollack.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell me something about your parents and the town in which you grew up please.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My father came to Canada in 1913 from Russia.</span> <span id="s19">He was an indentured worker.</span> <span id="s20">Someone paid his fare across and he worked off this fee and then had a few hundred dollars and asked the man who had brought him over to find a place in Canada where with $300 he could buy a business building, room overhead where he could live and enough money left: over to bring in his fiancée.</span> <span id="s21">They only place in Canada where that would qualify was a little village called Kenistino (ph), Saskatchewan, a village of 400 people then and I think 400 people now, where there happened to be a store with a room overhead and the whole thing including my mother's air fare, air fare - sea fare, was less than $300.</span> <span id="s22">So my brother and sister and I were born and brought up in this little hamlet in northern Saskatchewan.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What was it like growing up in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: It was very healthy.</span> <span id="s25">It was a simple childhood.</span> <span id="s26">You, you were concerned with the weather and wheat and trying to, my father trying to sell the merchandise that in his little tiny store.</span> <span id="s27">Most of it wasn't actually sold.</span> <span id="s28">Most of it was bartered because money was rare in the 30's when I remember the store.</span> <span id="s29">The farmers would bring in butter and eggs and cheese and furs and and roots so they would dig up herbs.</span> <span id="s30">I remember one called seneca root (ph) which you could make into some kind of over-the counter drug, and my father would look at these things and say they're worth such and so and then that person would take the groceries and my father would send these things then on to Prince Albert which was then a city we would call it of five thousand, and so the family survived and my brother and I were sent to University of Saskatchewan and my sister when she graduated from grade 12 was sent to New York to my mother's sister so that she could marry a nice Jewish boy, of which there were none in Kenistino.</span> <span id="s31">We were the only Jewish family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What was it like to be the only Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Since I didn't, since I didn't know anything else it seemed perfectly normal.</span> <span id="s34">Everybody was the only family there the only Ukrainian, the only Slavic, the only whatever.</span> <span id="s35">People had to get along.</span> <span id="s36">There was no fire system.</span> <span id="s37">There was no police system.</span> <span id="s38">There was a municipal doctor, which meant he had an enormous territory to travel so it wasn't wise to have, to revive old world animosities of religion, race, color or creed.</span> <span id="s39">People of course couldn't eliminate their prejudices, but everyone tried to get along, and so while my father would tell me you are Jewish and you must behave and not do things that will not be right, I didn't really know what that meant until I left Kenistino at age 17 to go to the University of Saskatchewan, which was in a city called Saskatoon, and I really have not encountered anti- Semitism in my life.</span> <span id="s40">I can't say I've never because it's impossible not to encounter, but it's been minimal, perhaps because I don't think in those terms.</span> <span id="s41">I guess because of my childhood, so I knew I was Jewish but I didn’t really know what that meant and it didn't trouble me.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">And certainly doesn't trouble me today.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: You went to University.</span> <span id="s45">Was that: a radical change for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">It was a big change because this little village, Kenistino, had minimal infrastructure.</span> <span id="s48">It had no running water.</span> <span id="s49">It had outdoor outhouses and in twenty below and thirty below and forty below, the typical prairie winters, something that I I'm glad I don't have to do to this day.</span> <span id="s50">Electricity came into Kenistino when I was in junior high.</span> <span id="s51">Before that we studied with coal oil lamps and we, with little felt wicks, and there were no such a thing as television of course.</span> <span id="s52">The radios were poor.</span> <span id="s53">We had no newspaper.</span> <span id="s54">So University was an amazing change as the studies let alone the city of Saskatoon was a major change for me.</span> <span id="s55">So I spent two years there and then I enlisted at age 19, just going on 20, because everybody was doing that and it was, as we now would call it, it was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the the Jewish people would talk about a lot in the prairies.</span> <span id="s56">I might just say a word about the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s57">Since Saskatchewan is a very large province, peopled, dotted with tiny hamlets and towns and villages, the Jewish people would meet once a year for the high holidays in one village or another, by some pre-arranged system and hold the services without a rabbi but with a local cantor.</span> <span id="s58">And they would pray and then they'd meet in the one Jewish woman's house</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:06:00 and they'd eat and the men would talk politics and talk about Zionism and play cards and go home.</span> <span id="s60">So although each village had one or perhaps two Jewish families, they retained a sense of being Jewish without having Cheders or anything.</span> <span id="s61">I was bar mitzvahed but it was rather odd.</span> <span id="s62">My father sent me to another village twenty-five miles away every Friday night to memorize my bar mitzvah ceremony.</span> <span id="s63">I didn't know what I was saying but I said it.</span> <span id="s64">My dad and mother cried copiously and everybody was happy and so there there was a sense of Jewishness but it was an arms-length sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s66">You enlisted in the army when?</span> <span id="s67">In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I enlisted in the Air Force in 1942.</span> <span id="s69">I was then 20.</span> <span id="s70">I enlisted when I was 19 but I didn't actually enter until I was 20.</span> <span id="s71">And I spent the first year and a half in Canada.</span> <span id="s72">I enlisted in Air Crew but I washed out because I wore glasses and my coordination with a helmet on wasn't good, and at that time in the early 40's, if you enlisted in Air Crew and then couldn't make it for reasons of of such a nature, you were given the first option to enter this new and secret world of radar.</span> <span id="s73">The reason was that you could advance more rapidly and it was a little bit more exciting than being ground crew and just repairing air planes and doing ground duties.</span> <span id="s74">So I was allowed, I was offered the course in basic radar and I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s75">My mind works along lines of mathematics and I was commissioned after my eight months of of study and sent to an island off the west coast of Canada at the southern point of the Queen Charlottes.</span> <span id="s76">There's there's an island about the size of a city block on which the Canadian's authority, military authorities, had put a radar station.</span> <span id="s77">From Alaska to Baca (ph), California, the Canadians and Americans had interlocking circles such that the Japanese ships, submarines, and aircraft, if they came towards the coast, would be spotted by this radar system.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:08:20 And the one I was sent to was part of this interlocking grid of radar networks.</span> <span id="s79">And I was the junior of two officers.</span> <span id="s80">I was what is called a pilot officer.</span> <span id="s81">It's equivalent in the Army to 2nd Lieutenant, and the commanding officer who was a flying officer of 1st Lieutenant's rank, and I were, constructed and put into operation this radar system.</span> <span id="s82">We had 40 young Canadians absolutely isolated from civilization in a rock in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</span> <span id="s83">No women, no movies, no liquor, no nothing.</span> <span id="s84">Just a radar station.</span> <span id="s85">It wasn't, it wasn't exactly what I thought a war would be.</span> <span id="s86">Nothing every happened.</span> <span id="s87">The Japanese didn't come so it was boring and yet we we were supposed to keep these 40 young men up to operational efficiency at all times, when their thoughts were on other things -wine, women and song - I know because I had to, I had to what is the word - read their mail to make sure that they didn't pass on any secrets, but they didn't talk about radar.</span> <span id="s88">They talked about other more basic things.</span> <span id="s89">Anyhow, after six months I thought you know this is ridiculous and I volunteered to go overseas and so I arrived overseas and spent about a year in England before D Day.</span> <span id="s90">My work in England was mostly on radar-controlled anti-aircraft.</span> <span id="s91">We were trying to shoot down the buzz bombs or the V-l bombs by radar and also of course when the German bombers would come over.</span> <span id="s92">And also I spent six months in the North</span></p> <p><span id="s93">01:10 Sea out of Yarmouth on what were called HSL's - high speed launches.</span> <span id="s94">The RAF and the American Air Force, the Canadians were always part of the RAF or attached to the RAF, would go out to bomb in the morning and afternoon and come back and there would be these fights over the North Sea and when one of our air craft was shot down, if someone in our bomber could get a fix, a coordinational fix back to the intelligence headquarters in London, that person would look on a big map and see where we were anchored in our launches, and then send a a message by radio - there's an aircraft down or going down in your quadrant.</span> <span id="s95">try and find it.</span> <span id="s96">And if it was daylight the skipper with his binoculars would would go towards where he thought the bomber might be.</span> <span id="s97">If it became dusk and we were getting close then it would be my job to turn on the radar which had a very high frequency low scan so that we could we could see into the water's edge and the job was to find these aircraft and pick up the pilots which were very rare vintage because they were very rare commodity.</span> <span id="s98">They were being shot down so quickly by the Luftwaffe (ph).</span> <span id="s99">So for about a year I was in England doing these things on the land with buzz bombs, shooting down buzz bombs, or on the sea trying to find aircraft and and pilots in their lifeboats with my radar.</span> <span id="s100">And that was my job until D Day when - dates are a little fuzzy now in my mind - but I would say perhaps a week or ten days after D Day, I was asked, or not asked, I was told to go across the channel with a mobile radar unit to set up a mobile transmitting station as close as possible to Berlin.</span> <span id="s101">The reasoning was as follows.</span> <span id="s102">Radar was very primitive 45 years ago.</span> <span id="s103">Instead of having chips and the little tiny things we have today, they had huge what used to call them bottles, big tubes, glass tubes, and great big power packs.</span> <span id="s104">I mean you'd need a room this size to power the transmitters in those days because they were so primitive.</span> <span id="s105">So inefficient.</span> <span id="s106">That being the case the closer the radar unit was to the aircraft that they were sending their impulses to the more accurate they'd be.</span> <span id="s107">I guess I should just explain that word impulse.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: That's OK.</span> <span id="s109">I mean here we ...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Well but it might explain what I was doing.</span> <span id="s111">The Americans were bombing Germany by daylight with a bombsight called Norden (ph).</span> <span id="s112">You actually looked down and the bombardier controlled the airplane in the run in over the target.</span> <span id="s113">You looked at the target and twiddled knobs and you controlled the projectory of the airplane.</span> <span id="s114">So the Americans would bomb Germany in daytime.</span> <span id="s115">The British and the Canadian and the Polish attached and the</span></p> <p><span id="s116">01:14: Australians and the New Zeelanders attached to the RAF bombed at night.</span> <span id="s117">And the way they could see see in quote marks the target was as follows.</span> <span id="s118">The heavy bombers the Blenheims (ph) and the Wellingtons the big bombers carrying the bombs would go out in units of I think it was ten or twenty.</span> <span id="s119">And in between waves of the heavy bombers would one or two aircraft that were called mosquitoes.</span> <span id="s120">They were made out of plywood and they flew at thirty thousand feet at three hundred miles an hour.</span> <span id="s121">They had no bombs.</span> <span id="s122">They had a radar set that you could see and hear and from the ground we would control that navigator in the mosquito such that when he came 0ver for example the suburb of Berlin, we'd press a button, knowing~ where he was on our screen on the ground in England.</span> <span id="s123">He could hear and see what the signals we were, the impulses we were sending to him, and the bomb was dropped - not a bomb - a thermite (ph) bomb was dropped from the mosquito on a parachute, and that~ thermite bomb was brilliant, would, would stop "x" thousand feet above the ground and remain suspended in the air and then five minutes later this wave of ten or twenty bombers would come over and bomb the thermite flare.</span> <span id="s124">So you had had what was called twenty-four hour service.</span> <span id="s125">The Americans bombing in day, the British bombing at night, and the radar controlling the British night bombing.</span> <span id="s126">And the farther you were from the aircraft that you were sending the impulses to, the weaker were the impulses and the more likely you'd get distortions on the screen or in the headset.</span> <span id="s127">So that's why they sent our mobile teams across the channel after D-Day to get closer and closer to Berlin so that we could guide the night bombers from England on to Berlin while the Russians were coming in from the other side.</span> <span id="s128">So I was sent with this mobile radar unit.</span> <span id="s129">I think we were twenty or thirty or forty people, with the with the radar equipment, and we set course towards Berlin - I don't remember the cities.</span> <span id="s130">I remember Aachen - A - A - C - H - E - N. I remember Dueren (ph).</span> <span id="s131">I remember Weimar and I certainly remember Mons (ph) in Belgium where we bivouacked.</span> <span id="s132">And we were on our way to I don't know where, when an American came towards us on a motor cycle, an MP I 10 guess, and I was in the lead jeep with my flight sergeant.</span> <span id="s133">I was all of 23 then.</span> <span id="s134">1945.</span> <span id="s135">And I guess my sergeant was the same age, and this American comes up side and he said you guys ever seen a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s136">I had heard the phrase, but I thought being rather ideologically simplistic - I was from the prairies.</span> <span id="s137">I had had two years at University and then I was in the service, so I really hadn't thought about such things.</span> <span id="s138">I'd read whatever newspapers I was given, but I thought that they were our propaganda system and their propaganda system, and we had stories about camps and tortures and so forth, but I hadn't really given much thought.</span> <span id="s139">I said to the sergeant, let's see what he means by this phrase.</span> <span id="s140">And the American said its "x" kilometers down the road.</span> <span id="s141">It's called Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s142">And that's how I came to enter Buchenwald I think a day or half, a day or two days after it was liberated by, if my memory's correct, the American 3rd Army, I think.</span> <span id="s143">But that's how I came to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Tell me your impressions as you walked through the gates?</span> <span id="s145">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Well, there were inmates milling around.</span> <span id="s147">There were some soldiers.</span> <span id="s148">The inmates, there was a triage system under way.</span> <span id="s149">Those who clearly were beyond any hope, or those who were dead or those who were clearly beyond any hope, were, were in one part of the camp.</span> <span id="s150">Those that seemed quite in decent hea1th, in good health, were being sent out as quickly as they could get trucks to take them out And in the remainder were, were there with doctors coming in 1:o to look at them and see what they could do.</span> <span id="s151">I saw the piles of, of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s152">They were stacked in the way you stack beer bottles in the in the refrigerator.</span> <span id="s153">You know, you put the head and then the bottom of the bottle, and then the front of the bottle and the rear of the bottle so that you can, they'll s1.ack without rolling over.</span> <span id="s154">They were stacked with legs spread apart and heads put in so that you could get bodies, a large number of bodies in a pile.</span> <span id="s155">There was a furnace with one of the doors open and the remains of a body in it.</span> <span id="s156">There were scaffolding and piles of bones and of course the inmates themselves.</span> <span id="s157">I went into one building where a number of men were lying on 1he ground, on the floor of this building, which was very dirty with excrement.</span> <span id="s158">I was then smoking and I had this sweet capprel (ph) cigarettes which was a British cigarette in hard paper cover with silver foil, and I was smoking cigarette after cigarette because the smell was, the stench was very strong, and one of the inmates who was lying on the ground signaled for ;I cigarette and I had three left and I sort of tossed them and I didn't want to get too close because I didn't know about typhus or I, I didn't know about the medical side of things, and they took out the three cigarettes and divided them and then they began to have a little jostling for the silver foil.</span> <span id="s159">I guess it represented something of value after years of no value.</span> <span id="s160">It was a very, very disturbing sight to, to see them wanting this little piece of paper just because it seemed to have some value, monetary value Anyhow they would make V signs to us, and they smiled, those who had strength.</span> <span id="s161">They, I took photographs.</span> <span id="s162">I took a number of photographs, which I've given to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, of the furnace, of the scaffolding where they would hang people, of the bones, of the people stacked on the ground and being carted away in some kind of truck or horse-driven carriage.</span> <span id="s163">I don't remember which.</span> <span id="s164">I remember that the men's thighs were so thin that you could almost put~ my hand around it, it was just bone there.</span> <span id="s165">The flesh had literally melted away.</span> <span id="s166">You could put your hand around the tops of their arms.</span> <span id="s167">Their faces were this wax, this yellow waxy face.</span> <span id="s168">The skin W21S drawn so tightly around the skulls that they almost just: looked like, like skulls with tissue paper around them.</span> <span id="s169">It was a very shocking sight.</span> <span id="s170">particularly my sergeant threw up.</span> <span id="s171">I didn't throw up.</span> <span id="s172">I guess it was because it came as such an amazing blow you might say.</span> <span id="s173">I, I repeat I was ideologically very simplistic.</span> <span id="s174">I had never thought about such things happening.</span> <span id="s175">They hadn't entered my my mind in Saskatchewan and in the early years of the my war time activity which were very occupied with technical problems and then drinking beer and going out with women.</span> <span id="s176">I didn't I didn't think about ideology and philosophies of government and the racial thesis and things like that.</span> <span id="s177">So it was very, it was like somebody had struck me, but I, I, I wasn't as physically upset as my driver who wasn't Jewish and I guess it wasn't until the next day when the enormity of the thing came to me.</span> <span id="s178">I had a little diary that periodically I'd enter things, and I entered a couple of pages, which I think I've also given to the Memorial li...library.</span> <span id="s179">But clearly it was a very mammoth and, and disturbing event to a young, young kid.</span> <span id="s180">A young greenhorn you might say.</span> <span id="s181">Greenhorn for that kind of, of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What did you do in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, I, I had to go on.</span> <span id="s184">I wasn't a flea agent.</span> <span id="s185">I had my orders to be at such and such a point at such and such a time, but I wanted to do something and since I only spoke English I found a prisoner who spoke many languages and I said in the RCAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, attached to the RAF, the British Royal Air Force, officers have the right to send a little blue V mail, air gram letters, and when we sent them they'd go by air to where ever.</span> <span id="s186">Enlisted men might go by air or might not go by air depending upon space, so that was a privilege that British officers had.</span> <span id="s187">So I said to this inmate who spoke many languages, look, I can't remain here long, and yet I'd like to do something.</span> <span id="s188">If you will find some prisoners, some inmates who have friends or relatives around the world, if you will give me the inmate's name and his friend or relative's name and address, I'll send a little one paragraph, two sentence letter saying I have seen your friend or relative.</span> <span id="s189">He will soon be at a displaced persons camp in such and such.</span> <span id="s190">Send him money or passports or food or clothing as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s191">That inmate lined up a number of people.</span> <span id="s192">I don't know how many because I did this twice, once at Buchenwald and once a week later at a DP camp that I subsequently passed.</span> <span id="s193">And I would say I wrote between one and two dozen letters -I'm not sure on the number all over the world, to Turkey, to what was then Palestine, now Israel, to England, several to the United States, one to Canada which I'll mention in a moment, simply saying I have seen your friend or relative names so forth.</span> <span id="s194">Send help to him care of DP camp - I've forgotten the name of the DP camp where I was told they would go - it was in Belgium as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s195">And then in each case I put, my address is Flying Officer D. H. Pollack, C29272 - that was my number - RCAF overseas.</span> <span id="s196">You can reach me at that address.</span> <span id="s197">I would be interested in knowing whether you have reached your friend or relative.</span> <span id="s198">So the whole letter was one paragraph with a little footnote.</span> <span id="s199">And away those letters went.</span> <span id="s200">And two weeks later some more went from this DP camp that I visited.</span> <span id="s201">Some years later - I kept the names and addresses of some of them, and 25 years later I came across a folder with these, with some of them - oh no, I think, I'm sorry - my mind now is getting clear - some of them replied to me.</span> <span id="s202">And I kept those in a folder.</span> <span id="s203">That's it.</span> <span id="s204">And they simply said in varying degrees of, of excitement I received your note.</span> <span id="s205">I did contact my friend or relative.</span> <span id="s206">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s207">In varying degrees of, of, of enthusiasm and warmth and emotion.</span> <span id="s208">And I didn't do any...you know, what would one do.</span> <span id="s209">I, I did what I could and I and I didn't I didn't want to intrude on people's lives, but twenty-five years later I came across 1:his folder and decided to write to two or three of them to say I've just found your letter to me of 1945.</span> <span id="s210">It's now 1960 whatever, '63, '68.</span> <span id="s211">I'm curious to know whether the person that you told ME you had located is doing all right.</span> <span id="s212">Something like that.</span> <span id="s213">And I got two or three very fascinating letters.</span> <span id="s214">One if you'd like I'll tell you about.</span> <span id="s215">Evidently one of the persons, who couldn't speak English, said I have a relative in Windsor, Ontario, but I don't know his or her address.</span> <span id="s216">His name was Eisenberg (ph), I now find.</span> <span id="s217">I wrote to the Chief of Police in Windsor, Ontario, saying I have met a prisoner in whether it was Buchenwald or the DP camp I've forgotten.</span> <span id="s218">He or she, he needs help immediately and doesn't know his relative's address.</span> <span id="s219">Could you try to locate a mister, I think it was Hiam Eisenberg (ph).</span> <span id="s220">The constable or the Mounties, I don't know who, put a little note in the Windsor newspaper and through that newspaper note, they located the relative who got in touch with Mr. Eisenberg in Europe and they wrote to me from Windsor saying thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">We've, we've seen your letter from the Chief Constable of Windsor and we have made contact and bless you and, and that was that.</span> <span id="s222">Many years later I decided to write and see whether Mr. Eisenberg was still in Windsor and low and behold, he replied, saying I have never forgotten you because first of all you were an Ally, secondly you were an officer, thirdly you were Jewish, and for me this was, this was momentous.</span> <span id="s223">And I'm now in Windsor and I opened a little air conditioning store and I married in Europe and I have three Canadian children and we're doing well and we're very happy.</span> <span id="s224">When the Holocaust Memorial Museum found out about the photographs that I had taken at Buchenwald, they asked if I had other mementoes additional to the photographs.</span> <span id="s225">And I took out these letters and sent them; including Mr. Eisenberg's and then I thought I should tell him I've done this, because after all it was a letter to me.</span> <span id="s226">He said of course you can send them to the Museum.</span> <span id="s227">Then he wrote me a second letter, which I've also given to the Museum saying I must tell you of an odd occurrence in Buchenwald he said.</span> <span id="s228">I was handy with...I was working in a some kind of foundry.</span> <span id="s229">My number was, and he mentions his six digit number in the letter, but he said when I forged the new one I put the letter P, capital P, in front of it because I had noticed that prisoners who had a P in front of their number were less likely to be killed than those who didn't.</span> <span id="s230">He said I wasn't killed, and to this day I think Lt had to do with the letter P which I think meant either political or Polish.</span> <span id="s231">I received that letter, sent it on to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, and ten days ago driving from Ottawa to Washington, my wife and I get these reading tapes - you put them in your car and a book is read to you - and this particular book was about a woman who had been in Auschwitz, Dachau and a third concentration camp.</span> <span id="s232">And she mentioned the letter P as meaning political or Polish and being sort of a talisman (ph) so what Eisenberg had suspected as a thesis in fact was correct and so his life presumably was changed by this, this quirk of fate.</span> <span id="s233">I called the Holocaust Memorial Museum to say I was sending them this fascinating letter and suggested that they write to Mr. Eisenberg to get that little ID with the letter P on it.</span> <span id="s234">On such minuscule quirks one's life depends.</span> <span id="s235">It's really sort of mind boggling.</span> <span id="s236">(Pause) Well, I have received letters from people in London and Turkey and in Israel.</span> <span id="s237">I have a beautiful letter from someone in Israel - two, two letters from what is now Israel, one from New Jersey, one from the Bronx.</span> <span id="s238">Several from England.</span> <span id="s239">And I've kept them.</span> <span id="s240">And I think they're now all in the custody of the Museum and that was the little contribution that a, that a young kid was able to make to, to this Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Can you tell me about the letter from Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I wonder if I could read it.</span> <span id="s243">I have it here.</span> <span id="s244">it really is a touching letter.</span> <span id="s245">(Sure) it goes into much more detail than, than Mr. Eisenberg's about broader issues.</span> <span id="s246">I, I hope I can locate it.</span> <span id="s247">, I know I have it here and it is very (pause) it is very graphic.</span> <span id="s248">Dear Mr. Pollack.</span> <span id="s249">This is from Hiam Grossman (ph), 48 Street, Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s250">Dear Mr. Pollack.</span> <span id="s251">I thank you very much indeed for your kind letter of July 31, and I hasten to answer it as I was extremely pleased lo hear from you again.</span> <span id="s252">I had written him in the late 50's.</span> <span id="s253">My sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah , was saved from Nazi captivation after she had been thrown into the extermination railway whence the American liberators extracted her.</span> <span id="s254">In September '45 she arrived in Israel and thanks to good medical care and substantial nourishment, she slowly recovered from those terrible impressions.</span> <span id="s255">By chance I learned of the address of her son and his family whom my sister-in-law met unexpectedly for the first time at the Palestine Office in Paris.</span> <span id="s256">Together they went to Israel where they are now living in Haifa.</span> <span id="s257">The son is a government official and his nice little daughter Ruth is now seven and goes to school, So Ruth now is 25 years, later, so she's in her mid-30's.</span> <span id="s258">She is the only member of the family upon whom the dreadful past did not leave any trace.</span> <span id="s259">My sister-in-law, despite her unusual vitality and her strong desire to enjoy life, cannot forget the past and reconcile herself' to the loss of her dear ones.</span> <span id="s260">Naturally we try hard to make the last years of her life pleasant and we actually often wonder where these people found the physical and the emotional strength to survive the sufferings they have had to undergo.</span> <span id="s261">Obviously only the help of people like yourself has encouraged them to go on and to have faith in the future.</span> <span id="s262">It is said in the Torah, in quote marks, "Anyone who saves a single soul, has saved the world as a whole."</span> <span id="s263">And you may be justly proud to be one of those.</span> <span id="s264">I am very glad that you have afforded me this opportunity of thanking you from the bottom of my heart in my own name and in the name of my entire family for all you have done to save my sister-in-law's life to whom I am forwarding this letter, your letter, so that she can write to you also.</span> <span id="s265">I did not get a letter from her.</span> <span id="s266">I was glad to learn that you got married in the meantime and I am wishing you and Mrs. Pollack much luck and happiness.</span> <span id="s267">It would be extremely nice to meet you both personally.</span> <span id="s268">You probably know that our small country attracts many visitors from all four corners of the globe and perhaps you will also consider once to spend a short leave here.</span> <span id="s269">Wouldn't that have beer interesting?</span> <span id="s270">It is needless to say we would be only too pleased to offer you hospitality.</span> <span id="s271">I hope to hear from you again.</span> <span id="s272">For us the war was not terminated when the 2nd World War ended and my own grandson who was seventeen was among the first victims of the war of liberation.</span> <span id="s273">But we feel that the sacrifices were not in vain, as after 2000 years of dispersal, we gained our homeland.</span> <span id="s274">It is our hope that our children will be granted a better world than this of today.</span> <span id="s275">Who would have believed in 1945 that today the Germans are again allowed to sit in the family of nations as among equals.</span> <span id="s276">With the very best wishes and greetings for yourself and Mrs. Pollack, I am very truly yours, Hiam Grossman.</span> <span id="s277">I mean this is an example of another letter which was if have it here these are copies - that that the originals here all gone to, to your library, to your Museum but one here - no I don't have it.</span> <span id="s278">From, from (pause) Mrs. Cutler in, in the United States, but I, I don't have it handy.</span> <span id="s279">Oh, oh here is the 1945 letter, August, so that's, that's the first one - that the next on~ was some :20 twenty years later.</span> <span id="s280">Dear Mr. Pollack.</span> <span id="s281">Words fail] me to thank you for your very kind letter of 17th just received.</span> <span id="s282">In the meantime we have received several letters from my sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah as well as a cable giving us her address as quote, "Displaced Persons Center, M , Belgium," dated 19 July '45, but as it was impossible to communicate with her at the above address, we sent her a cable to the quote "Palestine Office" unquote, in Brussels.</span> <span id="s283">So that's, that's their reply to my air gram.</span> <span id="s284">(Pause) Well, this is an illustration.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: What happened, this communication obviously this has gone on for all these many years.</span> <span id="s286">Let us go back a little and ask what happened to Flying Officer Pollack at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Well, I came back from the service in 1945 and finished my final work on a Bachelor.</span> <span id="s288">I had, had two years when I enlisted and I took another year and a half and got a bachelor's degree from the University of Saskatchewan, and then was given a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago in the United States where I took my Master's and all of my Ph.D. excepting the thesis, and then was offered a, a, a job with the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction Development here in Washington, and worked there for a couple of year; and then joined the United Nations Secretariat and had a thirty year career in Washington, in New York City, in Mexico City, in Santiago, Chile, and in Geneva.</span> <span id="s289">Then I came back thirty years later.</span> <span id="s290">I married when I got the U.N. job, had three children and on taking early retirement in 1980, returned to Ottawa, which was my wife's home, and I've been a professor at Carlton University in the School of International Affairs ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What effect has all of this had on you do you think?</span> <span id="s292">The experience in Buchenwald, certainly the correspondence afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Well, the initial effect was very powerful, very raw and very emotional to a young kid, but I think the effect on me, an odd way to put it is sort of been an intellectual one.</span> <span id="s294">I, all my career both in the United Nations and teaching has been on how do systems work.</span> <span id="s295">What are ideologies of political systems and economic systems and how do they, how do you make them work, and the fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently, there was based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of, of, of racial theories, the, the, the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how, how horrible it is and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so efficiently run.</span> <span id="s296">This has stayed with me, so remember that my childhood was not that of a Jewish person, that is to say we were the only Jewish family and while I knew I was Jewish I didn't feel it sort of in through my chicken soup that Jewish children in a in a Jewish community would feel.</span> <span id="s297">I knew I was Jewish but I didn't know anything whatnot.</span> <span id="s298">So that Buchenwald had this first effect which was very raw as I say and it upset me.</span> <span id="s299">It just physically upset me, but afterwards it made me just aware of the horrors of being able to design and implement systems based on, on such a concept of human life and immorality and fear and hatred and finally this, this is what stays with me that Buchenwald proved that you can do it.</span> <span id="s300">Do it well, from that point of view.</span> <span id="s301">As a matter of fact, not; don't I don't use such emotional words when I'm teaching, but I do tell students in my first class in the sessions when I teach development, the word development has been my life.</span> <span id="s302">And I say you know I, I do remember one thing.</span> <span id="s303">When I was a kid your age I say to the students, I'm, I'm fascinated how easy it was even for the Allies to take young people and put them in the same uniform, same haircut, same kind of shoes, same tie, and get them in a disciplined way to destroy, not with these horrible overtones of Nazis, but you can bring young people together to be disciplined to destroy.</span> <span id="s304">It's not hard.</span> <span id="s305">It's not hard to teach people to enjoy cutting down a big tree.</span> <span id="s306">But how difficult it is to get people to join voluntarily to build and to develop it, to plant trees.</span> <span id="s307">That thought has stayed in my mind all my life.</span> <span id="s308">Just that the Nazis carried it to a blasphemous and obscene result, but it is so easy to take young people and have them do things together in a tightly organized way, even though they, they want to be different.</span> <span id="s309">This has always been a big , a big paradox in my mind that it's easy to do to do that, so Buchenwald just made me think very deeply about this paradox of civilization.</span> <span id="s310">How we can be Dr. Jekeyl's one moment and Mr. Hyde's the next.</span> <span id="s311">I may just on a somewhat lighter note, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you the story of the camera that took the pictures that that I've been talking about.</span> <span id="s312">in my childhood in Saskatchewan, it was quite common for teenagers to be given a rifle because we shot game, small game We would shoot crows because they would eat wheat, and we’d shoot gophers and bush rabbits because they'd eat wheat.</span> <span id="s313">So kids had a rifle, and I had a 22, and nobody thought about it.</span> <span id="s314">But when I was commissioned and went overseas the British gave officers in Europe, when we went across the channel, gave officers side arms.</span> <span id="s315">We were gentlemen.</span> <span id="s316">We had side arms.</span> <span id="s317">And enlisted men, men had these big rifles, 303's.</span> <span id="s318">On our way to as close as we could get to Weimar before coming to this incident with Buchenwald, we spent a night at one of the many German guest houses on the edge of the, the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s319">And there were these little round buildings where people would rest their arms and shoot at I don't know what, game of some kind.</span> <span id="s320">So I asked my Flight Sergeant if after dinner he would come with me and help me regain my use of a of a powerful rifle.</span> <span id="s321">Because I said you know if there are Germans hiding in the which we were told there were.</span> <span id="s322">It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge, refuge in this big forest, being fed and protected by the civilians.</span> <span id="s323">If there are Germans there and if for some reason they decide to shoot at us, my little side arm, my little popgun, wouldn't be worth anything at ten yards.</span> <span id="s324">So I'd just like to practice again with a, with your 303, which is a big rifle.</span> <span id="s325">I think it was a Lee Enfield (ph).</span> <span id="s326">So he said OK, and after dinner we went out.</span> <span id="s327">It was six o'clock or seven o'clock.</span> <span id="s328">It was good light, and I took this big rifle.</span> <span id="s329">They, they have a recoil so you push them up against your shoulder ad I put my elbow on the little window and he said you see that tree down there - I guess it was ten yards or whatever - see if you can hit it.</span> <span id="s330">So I aimed and pressed the trigger twice, and whap, whap this these bullets - I, I hit the tree, and I turned to him you know with great pride saying you know, that just shows you I hadn't forgotten.</span> <span id="s331">And out from behind the tree come two German officers, who had been hiding.</span> <span id="s332">They didn't know we were there.</span> <span id="s333">We didn't know they were there.</span> <span id="s334">But they thought that we'd seen them and were shooting at them, and came towards us and one pulls off a dagger or a little short sword and hands it to the Flight Sergeant saying something in German which we assume was don't, here, this is a bribe, and the other takes a little icon camera off his neck and hands it to me.</span> <span id="s335">Then we didn't know what to do with these two guys, so we phoned and an American military policeman came and took them away with great joy and I ended up with a camera.</span> <span id="s336">And I got film and I think it's sort of fitting retribution that the pictures that I took and which are now with your Museum were taken with a liberated German camera although it was humorous in the, after the event, but this, this was the way I, I got a camera to take the pictures that I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Is there anything you want to add, anything that comes back to you ?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s339">I hear in Canada and in the United States people saying it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">The Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s341">The concentration camps never happened and I know they happened, because I was in them albeit only for a few hours.</span> <span id="s342">I'm coming to the latter stages of my career and life and I have been involved with development I think perhaps as, well come to think of it maybe as a psychological antidote to destruction.</span> <span id="s343">Maybe if you think about these things and you're in very formative years you've spent three or four years destroying things and seeing such things as Buchenwald, you, you want to build you know.</span> <span id="s344">You feel a compulsion to develop things, not to knock them down.</span> <span id="s345">The war and Buchenwald stay in my mind because I'm an economist and I work on the link between economic growth and social equilibrium and political stability and I wonder whether we can maintain a world in which these kinds of occurrences, the war and the the Buchenwalds, won't happen again.</span> <span id="s346">So I think that it's admirable that your Holocaust Memorial Library will be a place where young people and not young people can see and hear and read these things and not, not for not for emotional reasons.</span> <span id="s347">I've tried not to be emotional today.</span> <span id="s348">I, I haven't used my folders or my letters.</span> <span id="s349">As a matter of fact nobody even knew they existed until Hiam Bookbinder found out about them from, from one of the few people who ever saw them.</span> <span id="s350">So my reason for being so happy to give what I have and tell what I have to the Museum is not an emotional reason, to arouse emotions and passions but to have people think about these things so they won't happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Fair enough.</span> <span id="s352">Before we break I realize there's one question we didn't ask you, and that is can you go back a minute to the DP camp that you were in and do you, will you tell us what you remember about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: It's less clear in my mind than Buchenwald, and I think it was briefer.</span> <span id="s354">What I would suggest is I do believe that Mr. Eisenberg was in the DP camp because when he wrote in one letter, he, he refers to me taking out my little book in the, and I think he said in the, in Belgium.</span> <span id="s355">So if you have a chance to write to him or interview him, probably he would be better equipped to tell you.</span> <span id="s356">I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s357">You know it's 1945 is what - good Lord, 45 years ago, and lots of other thoughts have come into my mind since then.</span> <span id="s358">But whoever was there it was clearly in reasonably good health, so that the thing wasn't so tragic.</span> <span id="s359">There wasn't so much pathos as there was in Buchenwald where the triage system was so stark; in the these three groups of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">PAUSE - TECHNICNICAL CONVERSATION Well this was one of the furnaces.</span> <span id="s363">it was out of course, although I vaguely recollect seeing some embers, but I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s364">There's a body or bones - more seen in one side than the other.</span> <span id="s365">I did all of this very hurriedly so I am afraid I don’t remember more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Well these piles of bones were in various parts o~ the camp.</span> <span id="s367">They were also piles of shoes and belts and things.</span> <span id="s368">Someone said they'd seen teeth.</span> <span id="s369">But I didn't see teeth, but I, I did see this pile of just bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION I don't know how many bodies are underneath what you are seeing there.</span> <span id="s371">I, I assume now that there must be three or four layers and I don't know whether that's a truck or s horse 28 pulled wagon, but they were just taking the bodies away obviously as quickly as they could so that there wouldn't be gangrene or whatever medical problems would last (ph), but they were just carted away as quickly as, as they could get Something to put them in.</span> <span id="s372">Just like as I said, piles of beer bottles.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION I don't know who put the wreath up.</span> <span id="s374">I assume it ~as some one from the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s375">Could have been a civilian but I don't know.</span> <span id="s376">The thing that is so horrible is the emaciation of the legs and arms and waists and of course the fact the faces all begin to look exactly alike.</span> <span id="s377">They just all look like skulls.</span> <span id="s378">The skin is drawn so tightly there's no fat or flesh anymore.</span> <span id="s379">They're just, they're just gone.</span> <span id="s380">They just evaporated.</span> <span id="s381">They're just tossed there.</span> <span id="s382">And you'll see how they're piled on top of each other so as to get the maximum number in a short, in a minimum amount of space.</span> <span id="s383">A really macabre sight.</span> <span id="s384">I - and it was all over the place too.</span> <span id="s385">Were not just there but all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Well, it's 45 years ago and as I mentioned I was just 23 years old, but they all looked so pathetic.</span> <span id="s387">There were just piles and piles and even the clothing - you see the striped pajamas - that they didn't all have that typical garb.</span> <span id="s388">They all looked so sad.</span> <span id="s389">They were these, you couldn't, they weren't human beings.</span> <span id="s390">They, they didn't look like people.</span> <span id="s391">They just looked like stacks of waxy things, and they just were, just rows of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION I think I had in the photographs somewhere the - I should have mentioned this and I didn't - the lamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">End of Tape #1 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
