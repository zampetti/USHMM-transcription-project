Burstein, and before was Malvina Grünfeld.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Trebišov on April the 17th, 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Tell me a little bit about Trebišov.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Trebišov was a small city, shtetl.</span> <span id="s17">It's 7,000 people.</span> <span id="s18">Mostly were Catholics and 200 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s19">Mostly Orthodox.</span> <span id="s20">Everybody Orthodox.</span> <span id="s21">They had a one cheder, one synagogue, one teacher and one mikva.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s24">My family was very religious.</span> <span id="s25">My father was a rabbi's son, and my mother was a rabbi's daughter.</span> <span id="s26">And everybody – mostly everybody was religious in that community.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My family before the war, we had a restaurant and my family, we had eight children.</span> <span id="s29">I was the youngest of eight children.</span> <span id="s30">And my father was a melamed before he got married, and my mother was only 15½ years old when she got married.</span> <span id="s31">I was the youngest from eight children.</span> <span id="s32">The oldest sister was married to a cantor in Galanta, which is a very, very big yeshiva.</span> <span id="s33">And the other sister was married in Brno.</span> <span id="s34">He was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s35">And my other sister was home with her, nine years old boy, and my other brother two years older from me, he was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s36">He was still a yeshiva bocher, and that was my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Was your lifestyle fairly comfortable?</span> <span id="s38">Do you have good memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I would say I was loved by everybody because I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s40">So usually I was spoiled.</span> <span id="s41">And I never forget Shabbos.</span> <span id="s42">We had one chicken, divided for two meals.</span> <span id="s43">Friday night and Saturday lunch, one chicken.</span> <span id="s44">So one of my sisters gave me always her portion of the white meat, and I spread it on the plate it should be big that I had plenty meat.</span> <span id="s45">But it was – vegetables, we had plenty.</span> <span id="s46">And potatoes, we had all the time ready in the back yard.</span> <span id="s47">And meat, we had once a Shabbos, as I said.</span> <span id="s48">White bread, challah, was also once a week, but was Shabbos.</span> <span id="s49">And fish, my brother couldn't forgive me, forgive himself.</span> <span id="s50">We had the river in the back of our yard, and we went only for the fish Friday, l’koved Shabbos.</span> <span id="s51">We were poor, but very proud.</span> <span id="s52">She didn't want charity.</span> <span id="s53">My brother who was nine years old, my mother took him to the cheder, and he ran away.</span> <span id="s54">So the teacher says, "Mrs. Greenfeld," he says in Yiddish, "I know you're not – you don't have money.</span> <span id="s55">Your husband is in the war, but we will pay for your son.</span> <span id="s56">He has to be in the cheder, a family like you."</span> <span id="s57">And my mother said – they said, "We will pay for him."</span> <span id="s58">My mother said, "No, I don't want paying, but I take my son every time."</span> <span id="s59">Honest, very honest, decent people.</span> <span id="s60">Everyone in my family.</span> <span id="s61">My father is – when the war broke out, he went to the Sarajevo, and he was captured there after the war.</span> <span id="s62">And my mother raised all the eight children by herself.</span> <span id="s63">She struggled, she went away early morning, and she left me, I remember, a year old, with a gypsy who fed me.</span> <span id="s64">So life was very difficult for her.</span> <span id="s65">We never had white bread, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s66">Just vegetables and food . . . and potatoes, that was free.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Now, you – so then you went to school in Trebišov?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: To a public school?</span> <span id="s70">To a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I went to public school.</span> <span id="s72">I finished the first year the seventh grade.</span> <span id="s73">That's the first time they had seven grades.</span> <span id="s74">Before, they had only six grades.</span> <span id="s75">And I went also a must, everybody who is there has to go to Jewish school, study, everybody.</span> <span id="s76">And they are graded to be the public school.</span> <span id="s77">I went till I was 13.</span> <span id="s78">To the Jewish school, Hebrew, but they didn't – Jewish, they just studied history.</span> <span id="s79">Jewish history.</span> <span id="s80">We didn't study Hebrew, just, read and write, but we never know what it says.</span> <span id="s81">We didn't understood the Hebrew language.</span> <span id="s82">But we had to know history in Czech interpretation.</span> <span id="s83">Czech was my school.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s85">I'm a little confused.</span> <span id="s86">You went to a Czech school and a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">01:07:07</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And was the Jewish school for girls, or girls and boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Together.</span> <span id="s91">Jewish school was together, and so it was also the public school for everyone in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did the Jewish people in your town mix with the non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s94">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s95">You felt like one family.</span> <span id="s96">Everybody knew you by the first name.</span> <span id="s97">Everybody said “hi” to you.</span> <span id="s98">There was no – it was very friendly atmosphere among the Christians and Jews.</span> <span id="s99">Very, I could say that the signs were all over.</span> <span id="s100">“Jew, go to Israel,” all over the signs were.</span> <span id="s101">But there was no violence.</span> <span id="s102">Nobody hurt each other.</span> <span id="s103">We never heard of anybody killing each other at all.</span> <span id="s104">They were very, very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Were you personally aware of any anti-Semitism other than those signs?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No, really not in my youth.</span> <span id="s107">No.</span> <span id="s108">Everybody kissed me, in fact, my friends, my roommates.</span> <span id="s109">And everybody I had a good relationship with them until the Nazis came.</span> <span id="s110">And then I heard that one of my school mates, my brother was hiding already, so he find him in the woods and hit him, took his shoes off, and gave him over to the policeman.</span> <span id="s111">That was my school mate's husband I used to kiss all the time.</span> <span id="s112">∗</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: That was – when it happened?</span> <span id="s115">Well, when I came back I was told, I wasn't home yet, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Were there Zionist organizations, different political organizations . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s118">Yes.</span> <span id="s119">When I was young, when I said my father died early when I was only 13 years old.</span> <span id="s120">He was 52.</span> <span id="s121">And so my mother's brother, he was a schochet and a cantor in Prievidza, a “status quo,” and a modern city.</span> <span id="s122">So he took me to his place and I enrolled right away to be a Shomer.</span> <span id="s123">Shomer, it's a Zionist organization for Israel, for Israel, and they have those Kibbutz, free, no marriage and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s124">But it's pro-Israel, and then when I came home, 16, I enrolled in the Jabotinsky group, you know.</span> <span id="s125">Fight for Israel, even with munitions, but fight for Israel.</span> <span id="s126">I met in fact, Jabotinsky, I met him in Košice, in a bigger city.</span> <span id="s127">They had a convention, and my brother, also.</span> <span id="s128">We went together.</span> <span id="s129">I have a picture with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What was your impression of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Of Jabotinsky?</span> <span id="s132">He was a rusky – a husky, tall man and he was very strong with his conviction and I liked him.</span> <span id="s133">Because what he said was so powerful all the time, that Israel has no place – not to be – Israel has a place, now to be independent.</span> <span id="s134">They should fight for it, and that was all what I wanted to have in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Now, how much were you aware of Hitler and Nazism before the war started in Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Before the war started in Slovakia, for me it was in 1939 when the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia where my sister lived in Brno.</span> <span id="s137">That was Czech next to Prague, a big city.</span> <span id="s138">And so they left everything that night in 1939 and came to my mother to Slovakia, so we knew it's trouble.</span> <span id="s139">And then we got right – yeah?</span> <span id="s140">And we then got right away a letter after that from my sister in Galanta, who was then occupied, like Hungary.</span> <span id="s141">And she had to leave everything in half an hour with eight children, and they took them to some camp.</span> <span id="s142">And nobody heard from them since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Let's stop for a moment because there's a truck noise.</span> <span id="s144">[Pause] Before the Czech territory was occupied, were you aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">Because we heard Hitler on radios.</span> <span id="s147">We called him – barked like a dog; he didn't talk because he has a rudeness in him.</span> <span id="s148">That even my – everybody thought he's barking, he's not talking.</span> <span id="s149">Yeah, we heard about him.</span> <span id="s150">That's the way we knew what's going on, but we never thought about was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s151">No, I didn't know in that time that it was Auschwitz there.</span> <span id="s152">Just persecution, kicked them out.</span> <span id="s153">My sister who was there for 30 years, she didn't have citizenship, so she had to leave in half an hour.</span> <span id="s154">Nobody needed citizenship, so we knew it's troubles.</span> <span id="s155">We knew.</span> <span id="s156">But not in that, in that – how you say it?</span> <span id="s157">In that end, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: You probably didn't think that what was happening in Germany was necessarily going to happen to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s160">We didn't – no, we couldn't believe it, no.</span> <span id="s161">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s162">They were such, such unbelievable things.</span> <span id="s163">In my backyard I saw girls going in that frail train and they waved to me because they knew they had to pass my house.</span> <span id="s164">They didn't see me because I was hiding there, but they still knew I am someplace.</span> <span id="s165">In that small place everybody waved because they knew each other, and I had a little store, millinery store.</span> <span id="s166">So everybody knew me in that village, in that city.</span> <span id="s167">But we never thought that Auschwitz was the answer for those deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Now, you said that in 1939 was when you really became aware of all of this because your sister had to leave, and she came home.</span> <span id="s169">At what point did things start changing in Trebišov?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, it was the professional jobs were taken away from Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:13:58</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: In 1939 it started automatically, little by little.</span> <span id="s174">And then they had those swastikas.</span> <span id="s175">And I had in this a sign in my store, "Jew."</span> <span id="s176">Everybody had to put in their store a sign that was from the beginning that they should boycott us.</span> <span id="s177">And that was always the sign that “don't talk to them”.</span> <span id="s178">It was dangerous.</span> <span id="s179">And then it was curfew 8 o'clock till 5 in the morning, or 6 o'clock at night till 5 – 8 in the morning.</span> <span id="s180">Maybe something like it.</span> <span id="s181">You couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s182">Traveling was restricted.</span> <span id="s183">You couldn't go anyplace.</span> <span id="s184">And . . . if you had friends – you always made connection before with few Christians.</span> <span id="s185">My mother went for milk six miles, they gave it to her.</span> <span id="s186">They're not supposed to give her, she was kosher, so they give her.</span> <span id="s187">So that kind of contact with food, milk and butter they give her in secret.</span> <span id="s188">Only secretly they could do that.</span> <span id="s189">But it was just impossible to describe the horrors which was there all the time.</span> <span id="s190">But from beginning, as I said, that was the beginning of the troubles, of the tragedies.</span> <span id="s191">Denied jobs, kicked them out, and you couldn't possess anything.</span> <span id="s192">The money or whatever you had, the savings you had to give them in.</span> <span id="s193">People were hiding, like my mother was hiding someplace.</span> <span id="s194">Nobody knew it, I never find it after the war.</span> <span id="s195">They were hiding [ed comment: hiding, not themselves but their money and valuables] in basements or under the ground or someplace, if they had some valuables.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So you're saying that this happened really in the beginning as soon as Slovakia became an autonomous – a satellite of – autonomous but yet a satellite of German—</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Hlinková Garda—</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: All of these problems started right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Now, were you able to keep your business?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: No.</span> <span id="s202">No, I had to close it, but I worked at home in my house, as I said, secretly.</span> <span id="s203">I had few nice customers.</span> <span id="s204">Peasants don't wear hats yet.</span> <span id="s205">They just started.</span> <span id="s206">So we had a factory, a sugar factory.</span> <span id="s207">So the professional people, they were there.</span> <span id="s208">Only they wear hats.</span> <span id="s209">And then we had a soldiers’ – how you call it?</span> <span id="s210">A barracks for soldiers, soldier station.</span> <span id="s211">So they had officers, those were my customers, the elite.</span> <span id="s212">So few – I made good friends, they came to me, but it was in secret.</span> <span id="s213">You couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s214">Both ways, she would be . . . .</span> <span id="s215">She is a Czech, so they didn't think too much.</span> <span id="s216">She wasn't so scared, because she had the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Was this a frightening period?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Oh, my gosh, yes.</span> <span id="s219">We were frightened.</span> <span id="s220">You never knew what happens to you.</span> <span id="s221">You never knew when you go out what happens to you.</span> <span id="s222">Very frightened.</span> <span id="s223">Very, very horrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Were there acts of violence against the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Not in my time yet.</span> <span id="s226">No, no.</span> <span id="s227">Just the scary part was that they announced, who knows Jews, they should report them.</span> <span id="s228">That was by itself a signal, you know, be careful, if you talk to them or if they talk to you – treat you the same as the Jews – the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s229">So it was a very, very, very daring thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So were Jews being taken anywhere?</span> <span id="s231">Were Jews being rounded up or anything in this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: It was – I never heard anybody who would do it and anybody who would violate anything in that time.</span> <span id="s233">Because it was already that time when they took the boys.</span> <span id="s234">The boys were not there anymore.</span> <span id="s235">Single boys, first, who were not married.</span> <span id="s236">And then they took men even they were married, and so there were no men in the city, in the place anymore.</span> <span id="s237">And girls they had also ordered – the way I said behind my house, I saw the freight with kids, they waved to me, so that was the last transport for girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Now, when you say they took the boys, they took them then, who is "they" and how did . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Oh, the Hlinková Garda who was charge, the Hlinka was a priest but he was in charge of the Hlinková, of the organized like Nazi soldiers.</span> <span id="s240">They called them Hlinková Garda.</span> <span id="s241">And they were in charge and they did everything like the Nazis did.</span> <span id="s242">They had orders from the Nazis, so they took first the single men.</span> <span id="s243">And then they took the even married men, only men.</span> <span id="s244">And the wives with children were still home when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: When did these deportations start, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Well, it was the tragic part for girls, as the boys went first to labor camp, as my brother went.</span> <span id="s247">And that was – from 1939 it went on, but from 1939.</span> <span id="s248">And for girls, it was in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">01:20:21</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: When you say they took them, did they come into the town and round people up?</span> <span id="s251">How did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: They reported them.</span> <span id="s253">You have – no, they get – you had – they had to report to the authorities.</span> <span id="s254">There was an announcement made, you have to report all the boys, single come here and here.</span> <span id="s255">And then they are going to labor camp, but it wasn't.</span> <span id="s256">They were going, already, to the end, they take them anyplace; we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s257">There just was no Jew anymore in the city in that place where I was.</span> <span id="s258">No more Jewish boys left and no men.</span> <span id="s259">And that was my last time that I was among the last to survive there still hiding.</span> <span id="s260">When my friends, as I said, they waved to me, you know, that they are in that transport.</span> <span id="s261">They had to report, and I didn't report.</span> <span id="s262">I didn't go to report.</span> <span id="s263">Every single girl had to come to report, and so they took them away.</span> <span id="s264">But I didn't, so I went hiding first, and then I escaped, you know, at Pesach.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: That – before we get to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I'm not there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Was there a period at which point you all had to go into some sort of a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Not in my place.</span> <span id="s269">Not in my place.</span> <span id="s270">No, there was just curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And where – were you with part of your family still, or living alone, or living with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I still lived in my mother's house with my mother and my rabbi, brother-in-law [ed comments: rabbi and brother-in-law is the same person] and his wife.</span> <span id="s273">They came from – and my sister, who had a nine-years-old boy and my brother.</span> <span id="s274">We all still lived together.</span> <span id="s275">I was hiding under the porch, but they were looking, searching for me, the policemen.</span> <span id="s276">The Hlinková Garda came to search for me, and I heard them above my head, the steps, how they walk and three times in the row.</span> <span id="s277">So my brother-in-law and my mother all gathered us together and they said, "You come up from your hiding place.</span> <span id="s278">There is no way you can escape here if you hide.</span> <span id="s279">They will find you.</span> <span id="s280">It's three times in the row, and you cannot survive.</span> <span id="s281">You cannot stay here."</span> <span id="s282">So they all decided for me that I should go away that same night to Budapest.</span> <span id="s283">And my brother-in-law who was a rabbi, he put his hands on me, it was in Pesach and he benched [Ed.</span> <span id="s284">Comment: bench – to bless (Hebrew)]me, you know, “Malkele, du kenst alles machen.”</span> <span id="s285">For life, you can violate all the regulations, Jewish religion or no religion.</span> <span id="s286">So that was that night in Pesach.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: In 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: 1942.</span> <span id="s289">When I went with that boy, 13 years old, who did not go the day before with his family, with his friends.</span> <span id="s290">They arranged the day before to go away with that boy who came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: I want to stop you because I want to make sure I understand.</span> <span id="s292">The rest of your family who was at home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: They didn't go, but they thought you should go?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: You know, I am puzzled now.</span> <span id="s298">I really am so puzzled.</span> <span id="s299">My brother who was in labor camp, forced labor, he escaped and came home.</span> <span id="s300">Because I saw him before I left, I don't how he escaped from there.</span> <span id="s301">He was maybe 50 miles away.</span> <span id="s302">And he came home; they told me I should go, but nobody went.</span> <span id="s303">Everybody stayed.</span> <span id="s304">My brother stayed; my sister with the child.</span> <span id="s305">Nobody – I don't know.</span> <span id="s306">I can't explain.</span> <span id="s307">I'm puzzled now why they didn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: What did your brother tell you about the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: He said it was just horrible.</span> <span id="s310">They let them dig stones in mountains just for a reason that they should be sacrificed.</span> <span id="s311">They should be – they should be trouble, they should sacrifice.</span> <span id="s312">They should suffer.</span> <span id="s313">He lost [Ed comment: he lost = he lost weight] in one week something impossible.</span> <span id="s314">You saw him – I went – we went to some place to a vacation place to, to board – a spa.</span> <span id="s315">My mother had troubles with the feet.</span> <span id="s316">And he came to visit us in that time.</span> <span id="s317">He said it's just horrible.</span> <span id="s318">He had 15 people – I have a picture with him from that forced labor.</span> <span id="s319">He said it's impossible what they do with them, no food, they hit them if they're not, you know, in line.</span> <span id="s320">If they don't do their job right.</span> <span id="s321">And I can see him even now, how he complained.</span> <span id="s322">How cruel it was, he said.</span> <span id="s323">It's not even human what they're doing with him.</span> <span id="s324">With the rest, 15 boys were there.</span> <span id="s325">Mostly boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So for some reason, your family decided you would leave even though they did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And did they – was there any sort of organization that helped you, or you were just going to run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: There wasn't time to think.</span> <span id="s330">We didn't care, you had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s331">Nothing to lose anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: So you were going to leave just totally independently?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Now, you mentioned that you left with some boy.</span> <span id="s335">Who was this boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: That boy, his name was Izo.</span> <span id="s337">They had a big, a big, grocery wholesale place.</span> <span id="s338">And I used to know them because they were friends, and the day before his two sisters and a boy went with other group, 15 people.</span> <span id="s339">I supposed to go – I supposed to be in that group, but they left without me.</span> <span id="s340">I was mad and not mad because I could understand that how difficult, how dangerous it was for them to wait for me.</span> <span id="s341">But the next day that boy, as I said, he came with me because he came back.</span> <span id="s342">Little fellow, you know, 13 years old, a kid – he was like tiny little boy, and he was scared to go without parents.</span> <span id="s343">So our parents, they decided he should go with me.</span> <span id="s344">So he listened and he came with me.</span> <span id="s345">So we crossed the border, and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Walking overnight.</span> <span id="s348">It was night.</span> <span id="s349">It was night and so much, mud in the field.</span> <span id="s350">And we came to a village, closest village, and the dogs start to bark.</span> <span id="s351">And that was give-away because in the village everybody knows each other; it seems like dogs don't bark.</span> <span id="s352">So we went in the – in there where the horses are – the stable.</span> <span id="s353">And we waited until sun came out, and we went to the woods.</span> <span id="s354">And from there, we went to Újhely to a smallest, a next smallest city.</span> <span id="s355">And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Now, this Újhely is in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s358">I am already in Hungary.</span> <span id="s359">We are already in Hungary.</span> <span id="s360">Újhely was maybe 10,000 people.</span> <span id="s361">Nice Jewish community.</span> <span id="s362">And I needed money because Czechish money wouldn't be good.</span> <span id="s363">So I went to the first store I saw a Jewish name on the store title.</span> <span id="s364">And I went in, and so, the woman says, "Your mother is Mali Grünfeld."</span> <span id="s365">She recognized me.</span> <span id="s366">I was so amazed.</span> <span id="s367">She gave me money and I left.</span> <span id="s368">From there to Budapest, but from Újhely – Újhely.</span> <span id="s369">There I had an aunt, I had aunt and I went to visit her.</span> <span id="s370">I remembered her, she gave me her maid's Jewish-Hungarian papers.</span> <span id="s371">So with those papers and my cousin who was one lawyer – he didn't give me – and the other was a factory, a big factory, chairs and everything.</span> <span id="s372">He gave me money enough to go to Budapest.</span> <span id="s373">So we came to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Did – the boy was still with you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Did he have papers also?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">01:30:04</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: He didn't.</span> <span id="s379">He didn't.</span> <span id="s380">He just got papers in Budapest because his two sisters were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: I want to ask you, when you decided to make this trip out of Trebišov into Hungary, what did you take with you?</span> <span id="s382">What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Oh, whatever I could put on.</span> <span id="s384">And I had few jewelry, I put it in my skirt, sewed it together.</span> <span id="s385">And we went – to that woman, that woman – a policeman's sister supposed to guard us through the border.</span> <span id="s386">She took my money, she took my jewelry out of my skirt and we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s387">Just what we had on us.</span> <span id="s388">Two suits, two dresses, and that's all.</span> <span id="s389">And the less we had, the easier it would be to walk in that mud.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Was there any kind of underground activity in Trebišov that was helping people get to Hungary that you know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No.</span> <span id="s392">No.</span> <span id="s393">Unfortunately, no.</span> <span id="s394">Nobody believed that it would happen, something like that.</span> <span id="s395">Nobody believed because they were already organized.</span> <span id="s396">Jabotinsky, they had a group, and they had Mizrachi also for Israel.</span> <span id="s397">And nobody did anything against them.</span> <span id="s398">Everybody went like unbelievable.</span> <span id="s399">In my time, no one was there any longer.</span> <span id="s400">No singles, no men, no girls.</span> <span id="s401">It was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And your plan when you left home was to do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: I was young.</span> <span id="s404">I wasn't scared of work, because I had to work all my life in childhood.</span> <span id="s405">My father died 13.</span> <span id="s406">I went to my aunt, and I worked like a slave from 5:30 till 9:00, so I wasn't scared from work.</span> <span id="s407">So to me, everything was good.</span> <span id="s408">And with food, I was never spoiled because my mother had nothing.</span> <span id="s409">So I was always depending on myself.</span> <span id="s410">One slice of bread will be mine, but I can make it.</span> <span id="s411">I had a confidence.</span> <span id="s412">Crazy, stupid.</span> <span id="s413">But I can make it.</span> <span id="s414">I will work hard, and I was very honest.</span> <span id="s415">And so – I don't know.</span> <span id="s416">I think it was more than luck.</span> <span id="s417">And how I survived, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Okay, but just getting back.</span> <span id="s419">You had a plan that was just to go to Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Right.</span> <span id="s421">Saved my life.</span> <span id="s422">No other question about the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: And someone helped you over the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s425">No, we went alone.</span> <span id="s426">That little boy and me, we went alone through the border.</span> <span id="s427">But that woman where I had paid for them, she directed us.</span> <span id="s428">She told us which way to go, that's all.</span> <span id="s429">Once we came in that little village in Hungary, we were all by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s431">So you left this town for Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And how did you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Train.</span> <span id="s435">Train, I remember.</span> <span id="s436">By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Had you been to Budapest before?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s439">We didn't have money to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So when you arrived, what was your impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: My only impression was, “God, how I will make it here?”</span> <span id="s442">I know no one.</span> <span id="s443">On the street.</span> <span id="s444">Big city, and you – I don't know.</span> <span id="s445">I really cannot even tell you how is it possible to do it now that I think of it.</span> <span id="s446">But I was lucky that a boy I met who was my neighbor in Trebišov, and I met him in Budapest.</span> <span id="s447">And everybody said, "Don't talk to him.</span> <span id="s448">He's an informer."</span> <span id="s449">But to me, he gave me a place where I should stay, paid for the room.</span> <span id="s450">Gave me a little money, and that was it.</span> <span id="s451">And from there on, that Jewish organization in Budapest – I remember where it was, but I can't remember the name, what organization.</span> <span id="s452">They organized jobs for refugees like me in secret.</span> <span id="s453">So I went there, and luckily I got a job in a dress – in a men's clothing.</span> <span id="s454">But I needed, as I said, I needed the job, and I was lucky.</span> <span id="s455">I didn't have problems to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You said you remembered where this Jewish organization was located.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Gee, I remember where it was.</span> <span id="s458">I can't remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Do you remember the street or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I know it was kind of – Sziv utca or close by.</span> <span id="s461">Sziv utca or next to a train station – to a train.</span> <span id="s462">I think it’s Sziv utca.</span> <span id="s463">It was far a little away from where I lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And how did you come in contact with the boy you knew from Trebišov?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh, he – random.</span> <span id="s466">On the street.</span> <span id="s467">I just met him.</span> <span id="s468">I met everyone – I never knew – they warned me not to talk to him, and he faces me right away when I walked on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Who warned you not to talk to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: When I was in Trebišov, they already knew he's there in Budapest, and everybody, "Keep away from him.</span> <span id="s471">Keep away from him."</span> <span id="s472">To me, it was a good luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: So if I'm to understand you, when you arrived . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: . . . in the big city, you didn't know anyone, and you ran into this boy on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: And he got you settled . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: . . . with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: So you worked in the clothing store?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Oh, I worked a million places right away.</span> <span id="s483">That was a clothing store.</span> <span id="s484">The other was a sugar factory.</span> <span id="s485">The third was a maid.</span> <span id="s486">I had to change very often because it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s487">Somebody recognized me, I'm Jewish, I had to run away and leave the money.</span> <span id="s488">I worked there and somebody would suspect you, that was enough to leave the job for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">01:37:08</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: I'm a little confused because as I understand it when you first went to Budapest, you went with Jewish-Hungarian papers, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So it was okay to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s494">Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Oh, you were worried they would suspect you of being . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Czechish.</span> <span id="s497">So you couldn't have contact.</span> <span id="s498">You avoided every contact possible.</span> <span id="s499">You didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s500">If your mother would pass by, you wouldn't say hello to her.</span> <span id="s501">You would be scared that it’s a chain.</span> <span id="s502">I know her, whom she knows and it would be on and on.</span> <span id="s503">So we didn't have friends really.</span> <span id="s504">But one group we met in the park, they were also Czechish like I was, but already Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s505">And we met occasionally, once a week or twice a week.</span> <span id="s506">One boy was missing.</span> <span id="s507">We were scared what happened to that boy.</span> <span id="s508">So the Nazis, his brother was with him, and his brother said he – two weeks later he escaped the Nazis, but now he will need papers because he is without papers lost.</span> <span id="s509">Identification card.</span> <span id="s510">Clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">01:38:24</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Well . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: You not there yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Okay, darling.</span> <span id="s516">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: If you want to finish this.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s519">Say whatever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Well, how did you – there were a lot of other refugees there from Czechoslovakia, other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s522">Of course there were, yes.</span> <span id="s523">But you just look at them, and you run away from them.</span> <span id="s524">You wouldn't stop them.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So how did you make contact with this group that you met in the park?</span> <span id="s526">How did you know each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: That's a good question.</span> <span id="s528">You know, I was thinking about that many times, and I couldn't really – I went to a kosher restaurant, there I made my friends.</span> <span id="s529">I made many friends.</span> <span id="s530">I mean, like me, you know.</span> <span id="s531">But that group, I can't remember how I met them, but we kept seeing each other almost for a year in that park.</span> <span id="s532">We know each other by names, but maybe we didn't even want to know there.</span> <span id="s533">I can't remember where we met them.</span> <span id="s534">In that park it was close by to me, and I went there to sit down, to escape everything.</span> <span id="s535">And it seems like that was the place, but I wouldn't swear on it now after so many years.</span> <span id="s536">Just I know we met each week or twice a week, you know, to know that they are there; they are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Did that park have a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: People?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did that park have a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s541">I wrote it down, I forgot.</span> <span id="s542">I went there last two years ago, so I go to visit.</span> <span id="s543">Hmm, I have it written down, I forgot now.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Now, before we get to the story because it's a very important story . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Körúti Park, Circle Park.</span> <span id="s546">Körúti Park, Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You were at this time living in Budapest as a Hungarian Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What was life like for Hungarian Jews at this point in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: From the beginning, you might want to say or when the Nazis came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: When you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, I was there from the beginning.</span> <span id="s553">It was a normal life, cheder open and kids with peyes run everywhere and many synagogues – I used to go in the synagogues.</span> <span id="s554">And one day, I never forget, the Dohany Utca Synagogue, which is now a museum.</span> <span id="s555">Dr. Hevesi was a lecturer.</span> <span id="s556">And Yom Kippur, I went there, and they asked me, they came with a ticket and they said, "Give me money."</span> <span id="s557">On Yom Kippur, they want a contribution.</span> <span id="s558">And I said, "I need money."</span> <span id="s559">They thought I'm joking because I had to be dressed very clean to be able to get a job.</span> <span id="s560">If you're dirty and your nails are dirty in Budapest, out of work.</span> <span id="s561">You don't have a job.</span> <span id="s562">So the regulations they have there, so what did I want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">01:42:02</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Well, I was just asking you what life was like for a Jewish person in Budapest at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Oh, religious.</span> <span id="s566">People went to synagogue like here in Washington, wouldn't be any difference.</span> <span id="s567">There were organizations, Agudah was very popular, and synagogues were three, four.</span> <span id="s568">One Rabbi Adler was there and his sister.</span> <span id="s569">The only person who let me in her house was that rabbi's sister who was married to a cantor, and she let – it was dangerous to let me in, and she was the only one who let me in.</span> <span id="s570">So they raise kids – Woman was working, to my surprise, more than in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s571">In Czechoslovakia, Orthodox rabbis' daughters don't work – or children.</span> <span id="s572">And here a woman was working and education was stressed.</span> <span id="s573">They know so much, even girls study more than I did, we did in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s574">And they all worked, everybody, girls, it was a big change there.</span> <span id="s575">Religious kids started to work and have professions.</span> <span id="s576">Before they didn't have that.</span> <span id="s577">And life went on; everywhere there were kosher restaurants, and I used to be in kosher restaurants.</span> <span id="s578">I was kosher in that time.</span> <span id="s579">It was no different than here, a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: No restrictions on Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: From the beginning when I was there?</span> <span id="s582">No, but automatically the same law started like in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s583">Exactly the same, they copied.</span> <span id="s584">Because Nyilas they were the Nazis.</span> <span id="s585">The Nazis did the same thing that the Hlinková Garda did in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s586">Labor camps – forced labor and then took them away one by one.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Are you talking about after the occupation or before the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Before, before.</span> <span id="s589">Before, everything before.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Well, when you first arrived in Budapest in 1942, everything seemed to be okay for the Jewish people there?</span> <span id="s591">You said everything was sort of normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: At what point did that start changing in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: It changed because after a while they had the same stars to put on – yellow stars.</span> <span id="s595">Then they had the same taking away the boys to labor camp.</span> <span id="s596">There was Dohany, a Dohany where they used to – and they organized ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s598">I'm just trying to understand how fast this was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s600">Well, in 1942 was great, till 1943 – end of 1943 – it started really serious business with taking them away and put stars, losing jobs, closing the stores, curfew on the streets.</span> <span id="s601">You couldn't be on the street.</span> <span id="s602">And almost paralyzed Jewish life.</span> <span id="s603">No Jewish life left over.</span> <span id="s604">Little by little, they took the men away just as much the – as in Czechoslovakia – the boys away so you didn't have . . . .</span> <span id="s605">Then they took the girls away.</span> <span id="s606">So Budapest was practically without of Jews.</span> <span id="s607">All stores closed, to the end.</span> <span id="s608">And from beginning, it was automatically it was like step by step the same design followed the Nazis' order.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So until things got bad, you were working from place to place and living somewhat of a normal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">01:46:19</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Oh, I couldn’t say that's normal.</span> <span id="s612">You didn't know what you're eating.</span> <span id="s613">I don't know where you sleeping.</span> <span id="s614">You don't know where you working.</span> <span id="s615">I don't think of it as normal.</span> <span id="s616">If I think of it now, I can't it believe how I could survive.</span> <span id="s617">I wouldn't call it normal by any means.</span> <span id="s618">Relatively, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s619">If I was thinking how those people in the concentration camps, I thought I'm – I saw people on the street hitting them.</span> <span id="s620">Policemen hit the old people walking, they couldn't walk – hit them.</span> <span id="s621">So I would think, “oh, gosh, I am vacationing,” if I see this.</span> <span id="s622">And ghetto – I pass by a ghetto I had one loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s623">I was saving that for the whole week.</span> <span id="s624">There's a woman in the entrance.</span> <span id="s625">I said, "Take that bread."</span> <span id="s626">I will never forget her face was yellow-green, and she was crying.</span> <span id="s627">She said, "I cannot take that bread away from you."</span> <span id="s628">I said, "Just take and run because I will be catched, nobody will be happy."</span> <span id="s629">So it was such an impossible, but why didn't woman didn't run away, I don't know.</span> <span id="s630">The door was open.</span> <span id="s631">The ghetto door was open.</span> <span id="s632">People didn't believe it, couldn't believe it, that could happen.</span> <span id="s633">Even they were in ghetto, they still couldn't believe it, that tragedy what waits for them – it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s634">Gosh, bombs – day by day, I saw mountains of people like potatoes, like potatoes.</span> <span id="s635">One hit my house, where I was with a Christian family already, since I'm Christian.</span> <span id="s636">And they had a little soup, a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s637">They gave me one spoon, and six other people ate the same – from the same plate.</span> <span id="s638">One spoon, bowl of water, but that was all – we couldn't have.</span> <span id="s639">We couldn't go out on the – one woman, we were in bunker for three months in sand, sleeping.</span> <span id="s640">You couldn't go out, it was bombing constantly.</span> <span id="s641">Budapest was burning day and night.</span> <span id="s642">I was happy about when it was burning, to be honest.</span> <span id="s643">If I die, Samson.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s645">At what period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: That was already in 1944.</span> <span id="s647">The most critical time, and no one could be Jewish any longer.</span> <span id="s648">There were no Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Now, you mentioned just now something about becoming Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: But you didn't tell me how all of that happened.</span> <span id="s652">Maybe you can . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Oh, how I became Christian?</span> <span id="s654">Well, there was no more – my identification Jewish-Hungarian wasn't good anymore because there were no more Jews.</span> <span id="s655">So I had to change my name for Christian Jew, Hungarian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: When – how long did you live as a Hungarian Jew?</span> <span id="s657">I didn't – I just want to get an idea of —</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Hungarian Jew?</span> <span id="s659">Till 1943, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And at the point where you were a Hungarian Jew, you felt always at risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s662">My God, many times they brought on me a policeman one day in the restaurant where do I get the ration papers, it was illegal.</span> <span id="s663">And then one day, I go in the park because there's a razzia, it will be in that street.</span> <span id="s664">I should go in the park that will be safe.</span> <span id="s665">So I went to the park.</span> <span id="s666">One man, a Nazi newspaperman, was in charge of the building where I stayed and he is there in the park and he stops me.</span> <span id="s667">And we talked together, and then he says where I am from.</span> <span id="s668">And I said I didn't even know because my Hungarian name, I still had Hungarian name, Jewish name.</span> <span id="s669">And he said he's going to my city.</span> <span id="s670">I said my mother was yesterday here and he wanted to say something to him, that he should go to visit my mother because he knew the city.</span> <span id="s671">I said don't go because my mother was yesterday here.</span> <span id="s672">Then he takes my pocketbook away with force.</span> <span id="s673">In that pocketbook was my life.</span> <span id="s674">If you don't have any papers with you, you're dead.</span> <span id="s675">And I knew he's a Nazi newspaperman.</span> <span id="s676">I knew he's in charge of that building, and I run after him.</span> <span id="s677">He said, "Why are you so nervous?"</span> <span id="s678">I remember he's asking like now.</span> <span id="s679">And I said, "I am insulted that you took with force my papers.</span> <span id="s680">You didn't ask for them."</span> <span id="s681">He tells me, "I thought that you are a very naive girl.</span> <span id="s682">Now, I know that you are raffiniert."</span> <span id="s683">Like shrewd, raffiniert.</span> <span id="s684">Raffiniert is more like a shrewd girl, a Hebrew girl.</span> <span id="s685">"Just tell me when you came from Czechoslovakia to this country."</span> <span id="s686">He did not report me.</span> <span id="s687">I left.</span> <span id="s688">Two weeks later somebody went there . . . .</span> <span id="s689">Were such magic things, such un . . . .</span> <span id="s690">When I am walking on the street and a policeman is coming.</span> <span id="s691">And a man behind me came over, and he says I – he knows me.</span> <span id="s692">I never saw him before, I didn't even know he exist there.</span> <span id="s693">You know such coincidence.</span> <span id="s694">And in the restaurant, policeman was – he got shut this door and he brought Nyilas, you know, the Nazi Nyilas?</span> <span id="s695">And he said I should identify myself.</span> <span id="s696">You know identification cards.</span> <span id="s697">I said, "I left them home."</span> <span id="s698">You know, just to let – well, anyway many such episodes.</span> <span id="s699">Many, many, many more.</span> <span id="s700">At night I was waken up at midnight.</span> <span id="s701">I should him the papers, and that cantor's wife's sister was with me.</span> <span id="s702">Said, "Don't be next time without paper identification," and left me there.</span> <span id="s703">Another story they locked me in the restaurant and my – my kosher restaurant in Dob utca nine [9 Dob Street], and he said, “A Nazi's coming in to check everybody.</span> <span id="s704">You run."</span> <span id="s705">I left everything, run on the street day time.</span> <span id="s706">It was – you didn't know what you're doing from minute to minute.</span> <span id="s707">I was a maid because I didn't want to eat.</span> <span id="s708">Going to eat places.</span> <span id="s709">Then I was washing the dishes in the restaurants, so I should have food, I should not be hungry.</span> <span id="s710">Washing dishes in a restaurant by myself, unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: How did you know who to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Didn't trust anyone.</span> <span id="s713">You just didn't trust anybody because Jewish people you couldn't.</span> <span id="s714">You were scared of them and yourself, and Christians, you couldn't.</span> <span id="s715">And the end – well, I – the end, to the end where only Christians could be like, how I got the Christian papers.</span> <span id="s716">So, my brother-in-law was a cantor, and his congregant was one of the woman who had – that Adler who gave in Budapest – who gave me the Christian papers.</span> <span id="s717">Kovacs Gizi is my name now.</span> <span id="s718">He had always contact and money.</span> <span id="s719">He was Jewish, but he had such wonderful job as a Christian.</span> <span id="s720">He didn't look like Jewish.</span> <span id="s721">So he gave me the papers, Christian papers.</span> <span id="s722">Follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Well, I want you to explain this a little bit more how you were able to get Christian papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And about when this was.</span> <span id="s726">I think you said this was middle 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s728">Mid,1943.</span> <span id="s729">Well, you could have the whole house full of diamonds.</span> <span id="s730">If you wouldn't have the identification papers, your life was not worth that of a penny.</span> <span id="s731">So there is my friend, Joseph Adler, and he was – he had an aunt in that place where my brother-in-law was a cantor, so he helped me.</span> <span id="s732">And until today, we are friends, and I went to his grandchild's wedding two months ago, 800 people.</span> <span id="s733">It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s734">[Indecipherable].</span> <span id="s735">So he gave me the Christian papers, Christian Hungarian papers.</span> <span id="s736">And he gave me money, and he helped also other, a rabbi was next in that same floor.</span> <span id="s737">Without any question, he went in which was dangerous and gave him money and identification papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: How did he get these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: He had a contact with the one Christian man, and that Christian man was somebody very important.</span> <span id="s740">And he gave him all the identifications what he needed, and so he helped many out with money, because he always had money, and he helped me out with the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: I'm going to stop right here because they need to change the videotape.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Oh, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: And we'll take a little pause.</span> <span id="s744">How are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I don't know— End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s747">02:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: And you want to know I came from the Golem family.</span> <span id="s749">Who made the Golem, the Rabbi Loew, from Prague, I came from that family.</span> <span id="s750">My mother always said, "Don't forget your name."</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You said . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Okay, if you want it.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: It's up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: It's good information, but it doesn't fit right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No, I just, I just – if you wanted that.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: When we finished up before, you were talking about getting these Christian papers.</span> <span id="s758">Were you able to help anyone else get Christian papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s762">Well, it was like one boy I used to meet at the kosher – Dob utca Nine was a kosher restaurant in Budapest, okay?</span> <span id="s763">And I was kosher and I went every day, and there was a boy and I met him there.</span> <span id="s764">And he said he is having – he has identification papers if somebody wants it, but for money.</span> <span id="s765">I had no money.</span> <span id="s766">I was lucky I have from day to day – if you worked a week, you could buy yourself on black market one slice – one loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s767">But normally, you had to work for a week.</span> <span id="s768">But I said to that boy, “I have one ring.</span> <span id="s769">I had a ring from home, from my hometown, a small ring.</span> <span id="s770">I give you that ring in deposit.</span> <span id="s771">The woman cannot come today over to bring me money, but she has to get the papers today because tomorrow, you never know what happens to her.</span> <span id="s772">So leave me the papers.</span> <span id="s773">You come tomorrow if you want to, to my place, and I give you cash.</span> <span id="s774">I see her tonight.</span> <span id="s775">I promised her to bring her the papers."</span> <span id="s776">He said, “I cannot give you.</span> <span id="s777">I need the money."</span> <span id="s778">I said, "I cannot – you cannot," – he was in my room.</span> <span id="s779">"You cannot go away with that paper now.</span> <span id="s780">You have to give me that paper."</span> <span id="s781">"I can't."</span> <span id="s782">I said, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s783">Here is my ring.</span> <span id="s784">Take my ring."</span> <span id="s785">So he listened.</span> <span id="s786">It was good, and I went to give that paper to her.</span> <span id="s787">And then she gave me her bracelet, which I carried, I thought if “she will come back.</span> <span id="s788">At once – I don't ked it, I will have everything after the war.</span> <span id="s789">Give her back."</span> <span id="s790">So she gave me her ring and her bracelet and, of course, she didn't come back.</span> <span id="s791">And one woman the same way, I give her the papers, that boy left the papers without money.</span> <span id="s792">Give her another ring.</span> <span id="s793">The same ring I gave for two people, I took back that ring.</span> <span id="s794">And she came back, but she couldn't survive; her body didn't work.</span> <span id="s795">They didn’t eat and they ate and then they got sick, and it was so she didn't.</span> <span id="s796">But those two people – those two people I remember exactly how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And you were able to get these through this Mr. Adler?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Oh, Mr. Adler.</span> <span id="s799">Mr. Adler – nobody was Jewish anymore, okay?</span> <span id="s800">194– end of 1943 and '44 beginning, no Jews.</span> <span id="s801">And so Adler, we met in the restaurant occasionally, and he said, "Here are your papers, and here is your money.</span> <span id="s802">And I have a place where I live, you can come to live there."</span> <span id="s803">But we didn't know each other.</span> <span id="s804">You know, we did not suppose to talk to each other, we didn't know each other, that they shouldn't suspect us.</span> <span id="s805">And so then I was lucky, he occasionally gave me money.</span> <span id="s806">And then to the end it wasn't good anymore either.</span> <span id="s807">So he left his – I didn't live there anymore.</span> <span id="s808">I had to find a new place.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">02:05:02 How did I find a new place?</span> <span id="s810">I was working in Rothchilds – in that elite salon, aristocrats.</span> <span id="s811">And I am going home, and my colleague, my girl, who was working with me dresses, I said to her, "You know my housewife" – how she said?</span> <span id="s812">"My landlady – landlord has a guest.</span> <span id="s813">Her sister came from someplace, and I cannot stay there tonight.</span> <span id="s814">If you could take me, I will sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s815">Anyplace you want just to have" – 5 o'clock is curfew.</span> <span id="s816">You cannot be on the street.</span> <span id="s817">So she let me, and that was my good luck and I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s818">But it was already bombing, constantly bombing it was on and on and on.</span> <span id="s819">I don't know if you want that part now.</span> <span id="s820">And I stayed – three Jewish – her brother-in-law and her two sisters, we were in the same building together.</span> <span id="s821">There was unselfishness, I would never believe it.</span> <span id="s822">She's asking me, "Malvina, Gizi, when is Yom Kippur?"</span> <span id="s823">She knew I am Jewish – didn’t report me, and she – unbelievable how unselfish those people were while I was with them.</span> <span id="s824">You know, slice of bread or water, it was like life saver, and they didn't care.</span> <span id="s825">They gave me just as much as they had.</span> <span id="s826">We should come to the bunker how everybody had to be curfew and bombs were hitting the city constantly.</span> <span id="s827">And in a certain hour or a certain time, they were announcing each day, when we have to go in the bunker.</span> <span id="s828">Bunker, you know what is a bunker?</span> <span id="s829">So we went in the bunker one time in the length of three months.</span> <span id="s830">Didn't go out, didn't go in.</span> <span id="s831">And one girl says, "I can't stand it," a young woman.</span> <span id="s832">I just see her in front of my mind.</span> <span id="s833">"I have to get water."</span> <span id="s834">"Don't go, don't go, sweetheart."</span> <span id="s835">Bombs hit her and she never came back.</span> <span id="s836">Just for water, but she wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s837">But it was just such a critical time, people are – and that bunker life three months, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s838">Three months in one place, one seven-story building.</span> <span id="s839">And one day I am standing in front of the building – occasionally, I – she lived, we lived on the first floor – occasionally, we went up to the first floor.</span> <span id="s840">Not permitted, everybody had to be downstairs, but since it was first floor, so we went up.</span> <span id="s841">And I am standing in front of the window, and the bomb hit the whole building and that little window with my friend.</span> <span id="s842">Scattered bombs you know and all windows are broken.</span> <span id="s843">And we are here like a miracle.</span> <span id="s844">Nothing happened to both of us.</span> <span id="s845">And we couldn't eat; we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s846">The stores were closed and bombed out.</span> <span id="s847">You could steal – they didn't call it stealing.</span> <span id="s848">We had to work for it.</span> <span id="s849">Confiscating or something.</span> <span id="s850">Confiscating, but not stealing.</span> <span id="s851">And they had ice cream cones, so I took ice cream cones and put water in it.</span> <span id="s852">It was lucky, and my friend's uncle came.</span> <span id="s853">He was, he couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s854">He cried.</span> <span id="s855">He cried with tears.</span> <span id="s856">He's starving.</span> <span id="s857">A big, husky man is crying.</span> <span id="s858">So I gave him as much I could, and one day I went for a bread.</span> <span id="s859">They said that place will have bread, and I met a friend who pretended he's blind.</span> <span id="s860">He said, “What the heck you doing on the street?</span> <span id="s861">It's curfew.”</span> <span id="s862">No one was on the street.</span> <span id="s863">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s864">“You cannot do it.</span> <span id="s865">I'll give you money, if you need money.</span> <span id="s866">You don't go out on the street any longer."</span> <span id="s867">And that kind of – on the street, you couldn't see anyone.</span> <span id="s868">As I said, except the mountains dead people scattered in one section.</span> <span id="s869">And one restaurant was open one hour a day, and there were many dead people around here.</span> <span id="s870">You didn't mind.</span> <span id="s871">You just went through and went in and ate if you got a cup of soup, and went back again.</span> <span id="s872">Impossible, impossible conditions.</span> <span id="s873">Hygiene – there was none.</span> <span id="s874">Couldn't drink water, so how could you wash yourself with water?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Did you think you'd get through all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">02-10:23</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: At the time, do you remember what you were thinking?</span> <span id="s879">Did you think that you'd get through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I always have a kind of stupid hope.</span> <span id="s881">I didn't believe that it's possible to do it, but I always said to the landlady, "You will see, we will live through – we have to live through that war, and I will tell you, you have to live.</span> <span id="s882">We have to live through that war."</span> <span id="s883">But that was so silly.</span> <span id="s884">That was very silly to hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: After you were living with the Christian papers, did you have to do anything differently?</span> <span id="s886">Did you have to pretend you were Christian?</span> <span id="s887">Did you have to change your lifestyle at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Well, I didn't have to change too much because I didn't have any lifestyle.</span> <span id="s889">Makes simple as that.</span> <span id="s890">I had no lifestyle.</span> <span id="s891">From minute to minute, I don't know where I am.</span> <span id="s892">I'm working today, somebody suspects you, I run away.</span> <span id="s893">No money, no job.</span> <span id="s894">Today I'm sleeping here.</span> <span id="s895">I don't know where I am tomorrow.</span> <span id="s896">I don't even know where I am tonight.</span> <span id="s897">No plans, no arrangement.</span> <span id="s898">Once I had a rental room, that's true, with two old ladies.</span> <span id="s899">They knew that I'm Jewish, and the manager of that building knew I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s900">I had to leave.</span> <span id="s901">And in that same building was that newspaperman.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: But you didn't have to go to church or—</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Now, you came from a very religious home.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: So during all this period, were you able to in any way continue your religious observances or practices?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Well, the kosher restaurants were still open until it was open, but then it was closed.</span> <span id="s908">So then I ate anything I could.</span> <span id="s909">But while I was a maid in that same period of time, I didn't eat, but they ate pork and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s910">I just picked bread and stuff which is kosher for me, but it wasn't kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: So even with all of these hardships, you tried to respect your tradition . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s913">I wouldn't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s914">If I think of it now, it was so silly.</span> <span id="s915">And, you know, that nicest part was, I didn't have to do it.</span> <span id="s916">I didn't have to observe according to the rabbis.</span> <span id="s917">I could do anything I wanted to.</span> <span id="s918">It's a style, or, I don't know, way of life, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: What about holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: I went to synagogue one day, and in that same time a friend where I was working, she had a big cross all the time.</span> <span id="s921">And one day I came to her – nobody was around us – I said, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s922">And she says, "No, I am not Jewish."</span> <span id="s923">And here I went to synagogue, and she is there.</span> <span id="s924">So in synagogue, I used to go in Dohany Utca, in what is now a museum.</span> <span id="s925">I used to hear wonderful lectures by Dr. Hevesi.</span> <span id="s926">He was a wonderful lecturer.</span> <span id="s927">It was so quiet when he was talking, and I was so impressed with him.</span> <span id="s928">And that was like a hiding place, no place to go.</span> <span id="s929">It wasn't safe either.</span> <span id="s930">It was public, it was – never public places they didn't advise us to be.</span> <span id="s931">We were supposed to be hiding all the time someplace where nobody would see us.</span> <span id="s932">So I went to the synagogue and to the shows, to the theaters I used to love to go.</span> <span id="s933">I thought I'm safe inside.</span> <span id="s934">I don't have to face too much public outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: This was all while you were still a Hungarian Jew, or this was after you got your Christian papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: It was continue, but you see the synagogue wasn't anymore on.</span> <span id="s937">It was a ghetto, and that's the end to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Did you ever go into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: To the end when I gave that woman that slice of bread.</span> <span id="s940">No, I didn't want to go in.</span> <span id="s941">It was too risky.</span> <span id="s942">In that little bit what I went in with the gates, open gates, it was not advisable.</span> <span id="s943">I couldn't help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: But you knew what was happening inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s946">Oh, oh, we knew.</span> <span id="s947">We knew, yes.</span> <span id="s948">That's it's ghetto, everybody knew that that's a ghetto; it's no picnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Did you feel at all conflicted about that?</span> <span id="s950">That you were running around as a Catholic and yet your people were in this horrible condition?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: What did that feel like?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: It was like a stone.</span> <span id="s954">You can't think.</span> <span id="s955">You feel like a statue, that it's not you.</span> <span id="s956">How can you survive and watching them?</span> <span id="s957">And you can't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s958">Where can you turn?</span> <span id="s959">The whole world is quiet.</span> <span id="s960">Nobody cares, and we were angry.</span> <span id="s961">We were very much angry, not only on the whole world, that they let something like that happen.</span> <span id="s962">But we were also angry, if I may say, in that time when Jewish people were still all right that they were so indifferent.</span> <span id="s963">They were so indifferent.</span> <span id="s964">They didn't raise, we didn't hear any screaming, didn't have any help from anyplace, and we felt very, very bad about it, angry.</span> <span id="s965">We were angry.</span> <span id="s966">Simply very, very angry that we can sit in nice warm place, and I’m starving and freezing to death, had no shoes.</span> <span id="s967">One hole was snow and the other one went out the snow.</span> <span id="s968">So it was anger and such hopelessness.</span> <span id="s969">Can't do anything for them.</span> <span id="s970">And when I saw those people, I said, "Thank God.</span> <span id="s971">What do I have to complain?</span> <span id="s972">I'm vacationing."</span> <span id="s973">That's the way I felt.</span> <span id="s974">I'm on vacation.</span> <span id="s975">With all the troubles compared to them, unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: At this point did you have any more contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Oh, right away, no.</span> <span id="s978">I wrote right away when I came in April.</span> <span id="s979">The 22nd when I left Pesach my home.</span> <span id="s980">And I wrote right away home that I'm all right and I would like to hear from you.</span> <span id="s981">You know, just a card, and I give my address to that cantor's wife, Frankel, Lillian Frankel.</span> <span id="s982">She was the only one who let me in her house.</span> <span id="s983">Only one woman, no one let me in.</span> <span id="s984">And the card came back very shortly, didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s985">The 5th of May the card came back.</span> <span id="s986">Card came back the 5th of May, I remember like now.</span> <span id="s987">Unknown, Address unknown.</span> <span id="s988">[ed comments: the card said “address unknown”] They moved, but the address is unknown.</span> <span id="s989">And that was the time when they took them to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s990">You know, I didn't want to find out where they were.</span> <span id="s991">Until today, I can't think – I couldn't put myself together to find out.</span> <span id="s992">I don't know if you can understand me.</span> <span id="s993">I couldn't put myself together.</span> <span id="s994">I didn't want to know where they are.</span> <span id="s995">From Dachau, I was 30 miles.</span> <span id="s996">I didn't want to go in.</span> <span id="s997">I didn't even ask where they are.</span> <span id="s998">Can you believe it?</span> <span id="s999">So unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1000">Mother 62 years old only, and I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1002">I want to get back to that.</span> <span id="s1003">But maybe you can tell me now about how you got involved with this group that was acquiring ID cards or work permits.</span> <span id="s1004">You said earlier that there was a park . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1006">Körúti, Körúti Park.</span> <span id="s1007">That's Circle Park.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: And about when was this?</span> <span id="s1009">I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: About when was this time-wise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Well, it must have been end of '43.</span> <span id="s1013">End of '43 because that was where it when it was most critical.</span> <span id="s1014">Most critical time.</span> <span id="s1015">There were no Jews.</span> <span id="s1016">The boys are out in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1017">The men are in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1018">Women are all away or in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1019">Ghettos are liquidated.</span> <span id="s1020">There are no more ghettos, no more forced labor, no more don’t see Jew.</span> <span id="s1021">Budapest without a Jew.</span> <span id="s1022">So I went to that Körúti Park.</span> <span id="s1023">I live in that – close by Negyed Utca in the train station – close to the train station.</span> <span id="s1024">And one boy – so we met there maybe Ďuri, and his wife and one other was a lawyer and he survived.</span> <span id="s1025">And then my two friends and one other boy was there, so two women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Was this sort of a spontaneous meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1028">It was like we meet here and happily we acknowledge each other.</span> <span id="s1029">That was the message.</span> <span id="s1030">But don't talk to each other unless you have to, and don't sit in one section.</span> <span id="s1031">You know, scatter all over.</span> <span id="s1032">We don't know each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Were you all from Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1035">They had the same papers already, Christian-Jewish – Christian-Hungarian papers like me.</span> <span id="s1036">They couldn't be otherwise there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: So tell me the story of how you got involved with this plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Oh, well—</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And if you remember the names of these people that would be helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Well, Perl Ďuri.</span> <span id="s1041">Perl , P-e-r-l, Ďuri D-u-r-i.</span> <span id="s1042">And “D” on the top is like “U” Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1043">And then the other was his brother, Jan, with his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1044">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1045">And the other was – I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1046">I just remember Perl Duri, with his friend – because I went to visit him after the war – with his mother survived.</span> <span id="s1047">In Trencianski-Martin.</span> <span id="s1048">Trencianski-Martin, a Slovak in Tatry, he lived.</span> <span id="s1049">I remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1050">And then Salgo Tibor (ph) and Salgo Willie (ph), those two brothers.</span> <span id="s1051">And then the other married couple, one more was missing, was there.</span> <span id="s1052">I can't remember the names, but I have four names.</span> <span id="s1053">And then one time – one day one of the brothers were missing, the Salgo, not married.</span> <span id="s1054">The other was also single, Willie, and he is not in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">02:22:25 So we worried, since one is missing that's some bad news for everyone.</span> <span id="s1056">So his brother worried, and he said after two weeks that he find his brother.</span> <span id="s1057">He came out, he was captured by the Nazis, hanged 10 days from the ceiling with hands up in the back tied together.</span> <span id="s1058">Cigarettes in the back testing how much he can take, and electrical wires in his mouth and, of course, tortured him as much they could.</span> <span id="s1059">So, luckily, the bomb hit the building after 10 days to be tortured and hanging from the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1060">He escaped, but he was blue, green and yellow, you know, from all this torture.</span> <span id="s1061">He had to hide in the bunker, and when he came out, so he needed papers.</span> <span id="s1062">With his papers he is lost.</span> <span id="s1063">So, after he looked a little better, his brother decided that he will ask his General friend – Christian.</span> <span id="s1064">He was working in the pharmacy, and then he met that General, Hungarian-Christian.</span> <span id="s1065">And he gave him a paper that he requests from the National Printing Office, identification cards for laborers to work in a factory – in a munitions factory.</span> <span id="s1066">And I will be there, they shouldn't give anybody the papers, just for me.</span> <span id="s1067">And he's sending me, assistant, to the National Printing Office which was located – I see it now, like a – Váci Utca, like in the Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s1068">And his brother – I didn't know where that place is – took me.</span> <span id="s1069">Three blocks away he was waiting, if I come out alive.</span> <span id="s1070">So I went in, in the National Printing Office.</span> <span id="s1071">There was a young man – luckily, I got them 500 identification cards.</span> <span id="s1072">I didn't look at them.</span> <span id="s1073">I just grab them.</span> <span id="s1074">I don't know; I went out.</span> <span id="s1075">I didn't breathe, I guess.</span> <span id="s1076">Very – and then that boy was waiting for me who was hanged, you know.</span> <span id="s1077">So I gave him the papers and he ran away, and he gave it to others that he had contact.</span> <span id="s1078">What kind contact?</span> <span id="s1079">That brother who was working in the pharmacy they made the arrangements to meet all the men there, and he will give them from the pharmacy – because it's open to the public, it's a safe place – and he said so many and so many people only, so many and so many hours.</span> <span id="s1080">Divided the time they shouldn't be all at one time there.</span> <span id="s1081">He said he saw everybody, he told me that he saw everybody who's coming in.</span> <span id="s1082">But he was there incognito, they shouldn't see him; he was hiding behind in the back somehow.</span> <span id="s1083">And I went there three times.</span> <span id="s1084">I don't want to tell you how scared I was each time to go in.</span> <span id="s1085">And the fourth time – I got three times, okay, 500 and 500 – and the fourth time, they wouldn't give me it.</span> <span id="s1086">But I noticed that they want to call the policeman on me, the Nazis, so I run out.</span> <span id="s1087">How I did that, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1088">So that was my lucky star in that time that I could make it.</span> <span id="s1089">And there, I met them in 1981 – ’81 when it was the international convention in Israel.</span> <span id="s1090">My husband and Miriam were with me.</span> <span id="s1091">[ed comment: met Tibor and Willie]</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Miriam your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: My daughter.</span> <span id="s1094">And those two men came, I saved their lives.</span> <span id="s1095">You know, Willie, those two brothers only.</span> <span id="s1096">They came in and Willie, the younger one who was hanged, said “I thought that I would never have children,” because they tortured him so much everywhere.</span> <span id="s1097">And now he has a family and grandchildren, he's happy and he was a pioneer.</span> <span id="s1098">From the 400 people on the boat, the first to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1099">And there were seven survived, and he was the one among the seven that survived.</span> <span id="s1100">And his brother is a doctor now, he's retired.</span> <span id="s1101">And he has a family, beautiful children, and they came to visit me also to Washington to Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s1102">But when I met him I lost the convention.</span> <span id="s1103">I thought “I am dreaming” and he didn't stop repeating, "Malvinka, Malvinka," talking Hungarian because I speak and he speaks Hungarian, "You are my heroine, you saved my life.</span> <span id="s1104">You saved my life.</span> <span id="s1105">You are a hero, you are great."</span> <span id="s1106">You know, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1107">I thought “I am dreaming,” it was great.</span> <span id="s1108">And his brother also came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Let me ask you a few questions about these papers that you went to get.</span> <span id="s1110">What were these papers?</span> <span id="s1111">They were work permits?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1113">Work permits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Did they have names on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1116">They didn't have names, they was printed.</span> <span id="s1117">Printed with that General's paper, print of a General's paper, and on that paper was required that I should bring, I should bring the – from the National Printing office papers for free.</span> <span id="s1118">National Printing Office gave me papers, just blank names.</span> <span id="s1119">But it was the National Printing Office seal, Hungarian national print.</span> <span id="s1120">And that was Nazis everything went through that printing office this.</span> <span id="s1121">They had a seal from the printing of this, but blank.</span> <span id="s1122">Everybody could fill out your letters, so you're a tailor, 13 years, or a boy of 15 – the way you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: So your friend filled out the name cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Your friend, the people you were working with, after they got these blank work permits, then they would put in names, or false names or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1127">They gave them in that pharmacy when they came in, everybody got a paper.</span> <span id="s1128">And they filled it out according to their age or profession, whatever they choose to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">02:29:13</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Did you actually see the papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: I was lucky to get rid of them because I didn't need them.</span> <span id="s1132">I was already Christian and if I keep one and somebody – the police or something, I'm dead.</span> <span id="s1133">Where you got it?</span> <span id="s1134">He was catched – when he gave the papers, that Willie.</span> <span id="s1135">He had a handful of papers in the hands and policeman put him in jail because they find the papers in his hands.</span> <span id="s1136">He escaped again, but it was very, very life threatening.</span> <span id="s1137">Not only dangerous, but it was a bullet right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Who is the man you got the papers from in the printing office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: God, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1140">A young man and I didn't even ask, I didn't care, and I, I just was so happy to get out with the papers.</span> <span id="s1141">Didn't know, it was a young man in 30s, very businesslike dressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And then each time you did this, you gave them to Willie or the brother as soon as possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: The younger brother.</span> <span id="s1144">The other had troubles to walk.</span> <span id="s1145">Then after that after the war, he got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So you gave it to the one who had been tortured?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: He would wait for you at some appointed place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Three blocks, yeah.</span> <span id="s1150">Because any time I went in, all the time it was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Do you think that anybody got paid for these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1153">Now, that was a good story.</span> <span id="s1154">You know, I'm glad you asked me because I didn't know it until maybe a month or two months ago.</span> <span id="s1155">I called my friend up, and I said, "You know, I want to recheck that how it happened."</span> <span id="s1156">I wasn't interested before.</span> <span id="s1157">It didn't care, I gave it to the – and you do what – you know.</span> <span id="s1158">He said that he gave it to his sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1159">She made money on it, and she didn't give a penny to that boy.</span> <span id="s1160">That boy gave her the paper – that boy who was tortured, I give him the papers, all right?</span> <span id="s1161">And then the boy give the sister-in-law the papers, and she made money on it.</span> <span id="s1162">And she didn't give him anything, she didn't give me anything.</span> <span id="s1163">So they become enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: The sister-in-law was the wife of the guy in the pharmacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1166">The other – their sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1167">They had another sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1168">Not a sister-in-law – how is it?</span> <span id="s1169">Like a nephew – an aunt?</span> <span id="s1170">Like sister's child, a nephew, a niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Niece?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1173">Brother-in-law's wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Your brother-in-law's – is a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Well, then . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: These got distributed through the pharmacy . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: . . . and the other brother?</span> <span id="s1179">But who made money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: The sister-in-law from another brother . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Another brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: From another – had nothing to do with those people, the two sister-in-laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: But she isn't . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Cousin!</span> <span id="s1185">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1186">Now, I got it.</span> <span id="s1187">I know I confused you.</span> <span id="s1188">Cousin's wife.</span> <span id="s1189">His cousin's wife got the papers, and his cousin's wife didn't give anything for the Willie, that man who gave her the papers, and she made money on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: But these papers got distributed through the pharmacy, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And so this cousin's wife was involved in this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Must have been.</span> <span id="s1194">Must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1196">Well, did you – at this time – you have a regular, sort of a normal job also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: It's nothing normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Okay, but, you know, were you working somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1200">I worked.</span> <span id="s1201">I was luckily always working someplace, yeah.</span> <span id="s1202">I worked all the time all my time what I was there.</span> <span id="s1203">Million jobs, but I always – I was always lucky to get some work.</span> <span id="s1204">But you had to work a week to get one loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: The last time you went in when you thought that they were suspicious of you and they were going to call the police or the Nazis, how did you get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Miracle.</span> <span id="s1207">I said I had my identification, I left them at home.</span> <span id="s1208">If they would let me out.</span> <span id="s1209">So, "I let you go now, but next time don't go without identification papers."</span> <span id="s1210">Such, such, such unbelievable thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: So after this episode and you kind of went back to just wherever you could find to work or a place to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1213">They usually in Budapest have a sign, "A bed to rent."</span> <span id="s1214">To sleep overnight, one bed to rent.</span> <span id="s1215">Mostly, I went there.</span> <span id="s1216">It was light overnight men and women together, families together.</span> <span id="s1217">It was no problem I was so used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: At this point in time, were you aware of any of the aid organizations, the Jewish rescue organizations or underground organizations in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Nothing to help, no help anymore.</span> <span id="s1220">It stopped, all of them.</span> <span id="s1221">There was nothing there in my time what I would remember.</span> <span id="s1222">There was no contact.</span> <span id="s1223">We didn't go anyplace to listen to anything.</span> <span id="s1224">We were scared of the light, so I didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s1225">In that time and Bricha was before, you didn't hear anything after.</span> <span id="s1226">After the Jewish life stopped, we had no knowledge of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Do you think that the people you were working with to get out of these work permits, do you think they were operating independently or that they had had some help and instruction from another organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: I think they must have had some other organization.</span> <span id="s1229">Willie must have had something.</span> <span id="s1230">Willie must have had because he was very broad minded, he was very active before and he did – but, I wouldn't know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: So you don’t know who that would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: I wouldn't know, no.</span> <span id="s1233">I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1234">I could only find out if I called him again – ‘cause he's alive, he could tell me – in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Well, it might be good information to just put in your file if you ever find out, if you know.</span> <span id="s1236">So the Nazis came into Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: And things changed?</span> <span id="s1239">They just got worse?</span> <span id="s1240">Things . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: It's not worse; it's the horror.</span> <span id="s1242">The most horrible, horrible, horrible time.</span> <span id="s1243">There's no Jew, not a single Jew is there.</span> <span id="s1244">Can you imagine such a lively organization, such a lively Jewish community?</span> <span id="s1245">Synagogues are empty.</span> <span id="s1246">Stores are closed.</span> <span id="s1247">You don't see any single person, and curfew was on till the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1248">You couldn't go out, it's just you couldn't meet – breathe outside.</span> <span id="s1249">You have to be in a bunker, prepared to be in day and night.</span> <span id="s1250">And at night it was a must if you are over 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1251">One time I couldn't make it, so house was bombed out.</span> <span id="s1252">So I went under the house all by myself.</span> <span id="s1253">There was a man shaking, he has sickness.</span> <span id="s1254">I said, "how come you are here all by myself."</span> <span id="s1255">They put him there, sister-in-laws put him there so that he shouldn’t be – so he should be safe – they should save him.</span> <span id="s1256">The whole building was empty, so I stayed with him the whole night.</span> <span id="s1257">The sick man shaked all night through with fear and everything.</span> <span id="s1258">I will never forget that night.</span> <span id="s1259">Curfew, if you're not home in time, you're lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: So toward the end you weren't even working anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No.</span> <span id="s1262">I didn't work to the end, no.</span> <span id="s1263">I stayed in one Christian family.</span> <span id="s1264">Two sisters, one brother and one sweetheart for one of the sisters.</span> <span id="s1265">She was real nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: They thought you were Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1268">They said, "When is Yom Kippur, tell me Gizi?"</span> <span id="s1269">Okay, Gizi's my name now, okay, Hungarian-Christian.</span> <span id="s1270">"Gizi, tell me when is Yom Kippur."</span> <span id="s1271">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1272">No.”</span> <span id="s1273">You know, “I don't know."</span> <span id="s1274">So they knew I am Jewish, but they did not report me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: And you stayed with them until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Till the end and bombs were sort of constant now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Well, how did all of this come to an end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: What happened to the end?</span> <span id="s1279">Germany lost, but Germany still was killing in the last minute.</span> <span id="s1280">In December everybody announced Germany kapituliert, finished.</span> <span id="s1281">Germany won’t win – lost the war, and they still went at night and killed and killed and killed.</span> <span id="s1282">The bombs and the grenades, I heard every time at midnight.</span> <span id="s1283">And one seven people, my friends, men, they took them to the Donau, to the river, faced the Donau – faced the river, shot them.</span> <span id="s1284">Seven people.</span> <span id="s1285">And one pretended he's alive, so he told me my friend was killed there.</span> <span id="s1286">He was from my neighborhood who – seven and one survived because he pretended he is dead.</span> <span id="s1287">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1288">The killing was unexcusable, and government did support, it gave permission to kill – didn't stop.</span> <span id="s1289">The government, Hungarian government – Horthy, Horthy.</span> <span id="s1290">He said he didn't interfere.</span> <span id="s1291">He gave the orders to kill more.</span> <span id="s1292">A madness, unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">02:39:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Do you remember the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Oh, my . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: And when was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Oh, it was in May.</span> <span id="s1298">According to me it was in May.</span> <span id="s1299">They said in January, in December.</span> <span id="s1300">December was over, but in May that was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1301">Legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Yes, but in Budapest it was earlier, wasn't it, in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: In December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Or January maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: January, yeah.</span> <span id="s1306">December – end December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: What happened then at that time when the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Well, everybody plundered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Well, how did you – where were you?</span> <span id="s1310">What was happening when the Soviets came in?</span> <span id="s1311">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I was in that room with my friends, and suddenly five soldiers come over.</span> <span id="s1313">And they want to attack the woman, the single woman there.</span> <span id="s1314">She was very beautiful, and she screams after me, "Gizi, Gizi, I didn't report you.</span> <span id="s1315">Help me, help me.</span> <span id="s1316">Help me, help me."</span> <span id="s1317">Five soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Soviet, they liberated – Soviet Russian liberated Budapest.</span> <span id="s1320">So they all wanted to attack her, so she screamed after me and I came over.</span> <span id="s1321">And I said, "Hey, you're my brothers.</span> <span id="s1322">How can you do it?</span> <span id="s1323">What would you do if somebody – something like that happens to your wife or your sister or mother?"</span> <span id="s1324">So they let her go.</span> <span id="s1325">She said, "You owe me that because I did not report you, and I knew you are, Nazi – you know, you are Jewish."</span> <span id="s1326">And life, you couldn't have food.</span> <span id="s1327">You didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1328">Even after the war, the stores plundered– everybody steal whatever they could.</span> <span id="s1329">There was no established law.</span> <span id="s1330">After maybe four or five months later, they said, "Hey, you cannot do it any longer."</span> <span id="s1331">From December to summer, I think.</span> <span id="s1332">You know, you could take and nobody would bother you.</span> <span id="s1333">But after a while, the law came that you cannot steal or take anything anymore, so what we did – there was no food, no stores, no place to go shopping, after the war.</span> <span id="s1334">The only great thing was you had freedom.</span> <span id="s1335">You could breathe, and I thought that's best in the world what you can get after – that we are alive.</span> <span id="s1336">So I went to see that man [Tibor] who was that friend who was alive.</span> <span id="s1337">My Christian lady [landlady] took me to him, and I was happy that he's still alive.</span> <span id="s1338">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s1339">And he took over an office, a doctor's office because he had two years of medicine already.</span> <span id="s1340">And he said it's horrible, no drugs, and he had to take the bombs – the shrapnel out of people.</span> <span id="s1341">Cold freezing hospitals.</span> <span id="s1342">No heat and no drugs.</span> <span id="s1343">He said it's a horrible, horrible condition.</span> <span id="s1344">So while he was going to hospital, curing the people, and if he saw somebody's very sick even before, he took his identifications away and gave it to someone else.</span> <span id="s1345">I was waiting for food.</span> <span id="s1346">Kitchens on the streets for everyone.</span> <span id="s1347">But from the morning to the night I could wait for a cup of soup.</span> <span id="s1348">I waited, and I got his soup and luckily and he could be in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1349">But after a while, we decided we are going to Szeged, plenty food, another city – a doctors’ university.</span> <span id="s1350">So he went to enroll to the doctor, finish, and I was staying there till I wouldn't be hungry anymore.</span> <span id="s1351">Once they got me, the policeman, I had wanted to sell.</span> <span id="s1352">But they didn't put me in jail.</span> <span id="s1353">You know, they just took away my blackmail – or black market.</span> <span id="s1354">There it was already food plenty.</span> <span id="s1355">Plenty food in Szeged.</span> <span id="s1356">Then I wanted to see who's at home in Trebišov.</span> <span id="s1357">I knew it's a magic, if somebody will come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">02:44:27 I didn't want to dream.</span> <span id="s1359">I still – I took a train overnight, three weeks on the top of the train and I traveled.</span> <span id="s1360">And Red Cross occasionally stopped the train and gave us soup or something, so in three weeks I came home traveling on the top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1361">Soldiers went home.</span> <span id="s1362">The soldiers didn't want to go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s1363">They got an order if you're not coming three times.</span> <span id="s1364">If you're not coming on the third order, you will be sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1365">So then they went back on the same train what I went on the top of the train.</span> <span id="s1366">And I came home and, of course, there is – we owned a house and a restaurant, and my mother still owed money on that building.</span> <span id="s1367">So I stayed till I could make – pay off the house.</span> <span id="s1368">So I was dreaming, I wasn't believe it that somebody's coming back, they should have at least a place.</span> <span id="s1369">So I went in my house, they hit me, why I didn't stay with the – why I didn't die with the Nazis, because the Christian woman took over.</span> <span id="s1370">She was one time a maid in my mother's place, so she lives now in my building, in my house.</span> <span id="s1371">It was a nice house.</span> <span id="s1372">And she hit me, and I wanted, you know, sentimental things what I could out from there, so I took a policeman and we went back.</span> <span id="s1373">She hit me again in front of him.</span> <span id="s1374">Such a – soaked over Communism – I mean, Nazism.</span> <span id="s1375">Everybody was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1376">One boy who hit my brother, gave him to the policeman, he says while I was there – stopped me on the street, he said: "I wanted to save your brother."</span> <span id="s1377">Gosh, I was so mad at him.</span> <span id="s1378">I was so mad.</span> <span id="s1379">I went to the office, I said, "How come you still have that man free?"</span> <span id="s1380">So he says, "We have a new Bible.</span> <span id="s1381">If somebody hits you on one side, you give him the other side."</span> <span id="s1382">I said, "It's good that you didn't build a monument for the killers here."</span> <span id="s1383">But then I left, I didn't – I stayed till I . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Any other people in your family or other Jews come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: From my family, no one.</span> <span id="s1386">From my family, no one came.</span> <span id="s1387">And I find maybe 10 people, 10, but they don't live there anymore.</span> <span id="s1388">They are in Israel – they went to Israel, maybe 10.</span> <span id="s1389">I went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1390">Books scattered, we have a big library, book – Torah books.</span> <span id="s1391">Mother, I don't if she – maybe the rabbi – father, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1392">I didn't question it.</span> <span id="s1393">I always – saw that book in that same place.</span> <span id="s1394">And my mother used to read them in translation, in Jewish translation, the Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1395">They had always used that – so they put the books in that synagogue, and my brother-in-law wrote 500 pages of Torah.</span> <span id="s1396">They were there in that synagogue.</span> <span id="s1397">And then my cousin took them out – who is New York now.</span> <span id="s1398">I wanted to publish it, but my hands are not kosher so he doesn't want to five it to me.</span> <span id="s1399">He's very religious – Borough Park.</span> <span id="s1400">And life – people went back to their professions and they worked, but they didn't have to because the HIAS and the JOINT distribution gave everybody a room if you wanted to and enough money to live on after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: How long did you stay in Trebišov?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Just till I sold my – I cleared my house, my mother's house.</span> <span id="s1403">Four or five months.</span> <span id="s1404">I didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s1405">In Prague they wanted to give me a factory because I was very good in my field, and my name was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: So you went to Prague then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Then from there, when I left Trebišov, I went to Prague and Brno once more to see my sister's place and I went to Galanta where my other sister, was and was bombed out both.</span> <span id="s1408">My – Brno was bombed out, the building.</span> <span id="s1409">No one came back, and Galanta I had nothing there left.</span> <span id="s1410">One boy wasn't home, so he came to see me in Budapest in 1942.</span> <span id="s1411">And their parents were taking him away in '39, and then Miriam now asked for a paper from the agencies, from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1412">So they sent us that he was – he died of starvation in 1944 in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1413">The only boy.</span> <span id="s1414">Also – and after the war, Trebišov, they didn't have Jewish life.</span> <span id="s1415">Those people are like how – group like a ghetto, stay together there in a bombed building and one got married.</span> <span id="s1416">She's in Israel now, she is a pharmacist, and no one is there now.</span> <span id="s1417">Nobody stays there, and I got back a little money what my mother left the woman, Christian, where my store was.</span> <span id="s1418">She gave me back a little money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: So you went to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Oh, I just wanted to get out to United States, so I went to Germany from Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: You didn't stay in Prague then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1425">I didn't stay.</span> <span id="s1426">I just was inquiring which Visa is faster.</span> <span id="s1427">If I can get out faster from Czechoslovakia, so I registered also in Prague.</span> <span id="s1428">But it was against the law, I was in the DP after the war.</span> <span id="s1429">DP, displaced persons camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s1430">After the war in Budapest, I went first to Szeged where I could eat.</span> <span id="s1431">After that I came home to see if anybody is alive.</span> <span id="s1432">No one was alive.</span> <span id="s1433">I went to Germany because I heard they have established displaced person camps, and whoever wants to come to register to the United States.</span> <span id="s1434">So I knew I have my sister here, I wanted to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1435">I registered in both ways, which was illegal.</span> <span id="s1436">My sister sent me once money.</span> <span id="s1437">They put me in jail because I wrote to her, “thank-you for the money,” and then the censor, they said, "How come it's foreign currency?</span> <span id="s1438">You cannot keep money."</span> <span id="s1439">I said – I had to lie, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1440">I didn't, of course, I said that one dress would be $10.</span> <span id="s1441">The one pair of shoes $10.</span> <span id="s1442">So I thought then in relating $40 value what she would send me would be $40.</span> <span id="s1443">So they brought a translator in, and finally they let me out.</span> <span id="s1444">But that was one day in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: When you say you registered in two countries, what were the countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Czechoslovakia, Prague.</span> <span id="s1447">Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: And the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: And the other was the – Leipheim, where I was registered in the DP camp from '45 – from '45, I registered, and till '47, till I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1450">But meanwhile I went illegally, you know, to the Czechoslovakian, see again if I can come out faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">02:52:45</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Now in Leipheim, how large is the DP camp office?</span> <span id="s1453">Can you tell me a little bit about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: They were barracks before, and they made them for DP – the DP camps.</span> <span id="s1455">That was 1,000 – 800 people there and one, two, three, five; maybe five big, huge barracks.</span> <span id="s1456">And UNRRA supported food, and we got little, little rations.</span> <span id="s1457">You know, how much – I could finish it in two minutes.</span> <span id="s1458">But it was still a great help.</span> <span id="s1459">And you could earn money if you wanted to work or teach.</span> <span id="s1460">You want to be a dressmaker, you organize a group and you get paid from the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1461">I didn't want to work, I said I worked so much in my life.</span> <span id="s1462">I didn't want to work for money.</span> <span id="s1463">My sister was very good.</span> <span id="s1464">She send me packages of cigarettes, and one piece – one box, you could live a week.</span> <span id="s1465">And I moved to München, and I traveled a lot, I traveled all over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: How long did you actually stay in the camp in Leipheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Registered.</span> <span id="s1468">It went from 1945 till 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: You actually lived at this camp for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: You lived at the camp, but you traveled around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: And you had complete freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1475">You can do anything you want to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Who were most of the other people who were at Leipheim?</span> <span id="s1477">Where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: They were all displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1479">My cousin was with me in the same room.</span> <span id="s1480">She brought soap in this country.</span> <span id="s1481">Soap from people, made from people.</span> <span id="s1482">Nazis made soap from people.</span> <span id="s1483">Nazis' lamp shades and soap, and she carried that piece of soap with her.</span> <span id="s1484">She showed me that piece of soap made from people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Where did she get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Where did she get it?</span> <span id="s1487">You know, I can't tell you, but I know her address.</span> <span id="s1488">I can find out, but I didn't care to know it.</span> <span id="s1489">Everything was painful to find out.</span> <span id="s1490">I don't know, it's just so painful to know.</span> <span id="s1491">But I know she carried it to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: So you met up with her at Leipheim coincidentally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1494">I knew she's alive, and I went to – after the war, I walked 30 kilometers to their home to find out who is alive.</span> <span id="s1495">So I found her, she was lucky.</span> <span id="s1496">Three sisters together, two brothers, they are still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: So how did you find out she was in Leipheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: We – she – we – how did I find out?</span> <span id="s1499">We lived together in the same room, and her brother was with me in the same room and that other strange boy.</span> <span id="s1500">We were fir people, and before Leipheim when I went to see him, that was in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1501">So then we made it up that we going to Germany, she wants to immigrate.</span> <span id="s1502">She doesn't want to stay home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: In Leipheim, there were a lot of people there from concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Mostly, mostly everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Did you talk to them?</span> <span id="s1506">Did you learn what they experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: One was more horrible than the other.</span> <span id="s1508">One was more horrible than the other.</span> <span id="s1509">There was not a story, all were heroes in my eyes.</span> <span id="s1510">I wasn't better than they were.</span> <span id="s1511">I was luckier, but they were suffering more.</span> <span id="s1512">Everybody had a name [ed comment: name=number (tattoo)], and who had a name on their body, it was a horror, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1513">Shiver when you see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Were you surprised by what they told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">02:57:09</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1517">I was surprised, yes.</span> <span id="s1518">I didn't expect that bad.</span> <span id="s1519">Walking naked in the woods, walking naked – just to punish them, not to give food, not to have water to drink, not to eat.</span> <span id="s1520">One – my, my – I can’t even – my, my niece, my cousin, she stole a little potato.</span> <span id="s1521">How can you blame a little 17 year old beautiful girl, she steals?</span> <span id="s1522">But she stole maybe somebody else's life.</span> <span id="s1523">That little potato was somebody else's life.</span> <span id="s1524">The others, the cousin, I heard that cousin's cousin, somebody in the family; she washed herself with the water.</span> <span id="s1525">She could save a people's life with that water.</span> <span id="s1526">Conditions unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1527">I never thought so.</span> <span id="s1528">And tortured them on the street – and nude – and hit them and kicked them, pulled them.</span> <span id="s1529">Anything they wanted to do, like a piece of furniture, not human.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: We need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">03:01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: I forget they – Miklos who was 10 years in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: You want to tell that story?</span> <span id="s1536">Okay, I'll ask you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Just sort of – we were talking about in Leipheim when you met up with all of these people who had come out of Auschwitz and other camps.</span> <span id="s1539">When you were in Budapest, did you know much about the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s1541">Not too much.</span> <span id="s1542">We just know they are gone, no one is here.</span> <span id="s1543">That's all we knew.</span> <span id="s1544">There is not a single Jewish person alive in Budapest, except like I was, you know, Christian papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: In the ghetto, there where some, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: To the end, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1547">If it was, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: But you hadn't heard stories about the death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Ghetto?</span> <span id="s1550">No, no, I didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s1551">Only after the war when the concentration camp came back.</span> <span id="s1552">You know, when everybody – my cousin who had that soap, piece of soap in her hands, it is earth shaking to me.</span> <span id="s1553">They said lamps and soaps she carries with her.</span> <span id="s1554">And she had numbers, and her brother was 60 pounds when he came out from the camp – Dachau – not Dachau.</span> <span id="s1555">From that horrible camp there which was the worst—</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Auschwitz and then one more.</span> <span id="s1558">Well, anyway, he had his share.</span> <span id="s1559">Stories – it's no food, walking in the rain, walking in outside nude just to suffer.</span> <span id="s1560">Just to make them suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: What was it like living in this DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Well, you see, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1563">When I – in the DP camp as – DP camp, you had opportunities, if you were looking for.</span> <span id="s1564">You could have courses, Hebrew and dressmakers, and any profession you wanted to pick.</span> <span id="s1565">You could get educated.</span> <span id="s1566">If you want to leave the DP in the free world, you could get prepared in that place if you didn't have any profession.</span> <span id="s1567">Like my little cousin who lived with me, she was gorgeous and 17.</span> <span id="s1568">So I told her to go and study Hebrew; she did.</span> <span id="s1569">I told her to go to, I was like a mother to her, go to make – learn dressmaking.</span> <span id="s1570">She made, she went.</span> <span id="s1571">So when she came to the United States after years, lucky, she studied in that dressmaker design school, and she became a very good dressmaker.</span> <span id="s1572">So you could make yourself anything you wanted to in that camp, if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s1573">But I didn't feel like I wanted – life was very, very limited and simple.</span> <span id="s1574">But you had friends it was such a tight together.</span> <span id="s1575">You know, like you're my brother, you're my sister.</span> <span id="s1576">You didn't feel like strange person there, it was one whole big family.</span> <span id="s1577">If you see a man, you didn't look at him like a man.</span> <span id="s1578">But you looked and, “Oh, my gosh, thank God he's here.</span> <span id="s1579">That's my brother.”</span> <span id="s1580">If you didn't have any – you know if you didn't feel like a man.</span> <span id="s1581">But it was all – or a sister or anybody, you had such a unity.</span> <span id="s1582">And life was very, very simple, and those people really didn't have too much strength to do anything more – they went to eat.</span> <span id="s1583">You went to lunch, get the dinner that little rations, what they got.</span> <span id="s1584">In the morning, breakfast, a little cereal, tiny milk, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1585">You were hungry constantly even with the rations you got, you got there.</span> <span id="s1586">But many people managed some way to make money.</span> <span id="s1587">Some way that they wouldn't have to be hungry.</span> <span id="s1588">But from that rations, you had to be hungry.</span> <span id="s1589">You didn't have to starve to death, but it wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s1590">And then the clothing, you could get free.</span> <span id="s1591">So you didn't have any worries how you get a dress, and rooms were free, of course.</span> <span id="s1592">One room we were four people in.</span> <span id="s1593">My cousin and me and her brother and a little strange boy.</span> <span id="s1594">It was nothing unusual to have a strange man in that room, or Nazis or with numbers or – I mean survivors.</span> <span id="s1595">It was nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s1596">It was just accepted thing that girl – not scared – man, no man wasn't such thing in that time.</span> <span id="s1597">She was Orthodox, my cousin.</span> <span id="s1598">She is still, and it wasn't a difference.</span> <span id="s1599">Not supposed to be in the same room according to the – you know, regulations, Jewish.</span> <span id="s1600">But was no difference, and courses, they emphasized Hebrew courses very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: So after a while, you weren't in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1602">You had your own little apartment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">03:06:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: In München, out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1605">I didn't like that camp life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Oh, how long did you stay actually living in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Registered.</span> <span id="s1608">I had to wait to come to the United States, I had to be registered there.</span> <span id="s1609">I couldn't—</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: But you didn't live there for very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: No, I traveled a lot, you see.</span> <span id="s1612">So by traveling, I took a room in München.</span> <span id="s1613">It wasn't legal maybe, but I did it.</span> <span id="s1614">My sister send me packages and once – before I say that, it was almost in the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Well, I think you've talked about it.</span> <span id="s1616">It must have been quite wonderful to be able to be open.</span> <span id="s1617">To be able to be a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Free.</span> <span id="s1619">Fantastic.</span> <span id="s1620">But it was such hopelessness there.</span> <span id="s1621">There was no place, was no solution for it.</span> <span id="s1622">Only one solution was offered, that place to immigrate.</span> <span id="s1623">That was the hope, the best place in the world.</span> <span id="s1624">But three-quarters of those people there, no one wanted to stay there; they wanted to go out from the country.</span> <span id="s1625">That was good.</span> <span id="s1626">But it was very depressing waiting three years.</span> <span id="s1627">And tomorrow, they promise you tomorrow the quota, and you come tomorrow and a year later.</span> <span id="s1628">Six months later, three months later, and it was always one year, two years, three years.</span> <span id="s1629">For me it was 'til 1947.</span> <span id="s1630">It wasn't right.</span> <span id="s1631">I didn't have in the camp registered DP camp.</span> <span id="s1632">My friends went to a city close by, a bigger city.</span> <span id="s1633">Günzburg or Ulm.</span> <span id="s1634">And I went to say good-bye to them.</span> <span id="s1635">I didn't have my identification card – identification on me from the DP camp already, American DP camp.</span> <span id="s1636">They picked me up in that, in that truck, three soldiers.</span> <span id="s1637">Here, you go in that truck.</span> <span id="s1638">Took me to jail.</span> <span id="s1639">Can you imagine how strict that was before?</span> <span id="s1640">American soldiers did it to me; put me with the prostitutes in Ulm in the jail.</span> <span id="s1641">Next day, I said, "How could you do that to me?</span> <span id="s1642">Not enough I have to be with prostitutes after the war?"</span> <span id="s1643">I should – it was a court, the court made a, you know, case out of it.</span> <span id="s1644">And $50 fine, I said, "Well, where would I get $50?"</span> <span id="s1645">$50 is like $50,000 to a person who doesn't have five cents.</span> <span id="s1646">I said, "I can't give you $50.</span> <span id="s1647">I don't have money."</span> <span id="s1648">So one man from the group said, "I bail you out."</span> <span id="s1649">In the, in the, in the jail, they gave you a glass of grass with water, that was the soup.</span> <span id="s1650">On the floor, you could sleep.</span> <span id="s1651">Now, the Americans, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: I think you had wanted to mention something about the Communist government that came in after the war into Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Well, the Communists liberated, so they took over Budapest, of course, the country.</span> <span id="s1654">And there were soldiers, Americans – Russian soldiers, and to me they were great.</span> <span id="s1655">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1656">There was nothing to eat, no place to shop.</span> <span id="s1657">And I went – I knew that they have a big truck with bread.</span> <span id="s1658">I said, "I am hungry.</span> <span id="s1659">Give me chleba."</span> <span id="s1660">I speak Slavic, you know, I speak Slovakian.</span> <span id="s1661">I said, "Davai chleba.</span> <span id="s1662">Give me bread."</span> <span id="s1663">They didn't ask me who I am.</span> <span id="s1664">I said, "I am freezing in my room.</span> <span id="s1665">I need wood."</span> <span id="s1666">He went to the wood with – where is wood, you know, forest.</span> <span id="s1667">Cut the wood off – cut the tree off, and carried it with other soldiers to my house.</span> <span id="s1668">Cut it to pieces, I was warm.</span> <span id="s1669">That’s Comm— American – the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1670">But they were always drunk.</span> <span id="s1671">They sung on the street, doctor or a peasant, equally the same.</span> <span id="s1672">They were drunk and drunk and drunk.</span> <span id="s1673">And then “You have a watch?</span> <span id="s1674">Davai chasi.”</span> <span id="s1675">Chasi is a watch.</span> <span id="s1676">They said, "Give me the watch.</span> <span id="s1677">Davai chasi."</span> <span id="s1678">They put it here on elbow from top till down, like kids; they never had a watch in Russia.</span> <span id="s1679">So suddenly, “davai chasi,” that means give me your watch.</span> <span id="s1680">They didn't wait, they just grabbed and took it off of your hands and put them on.</span> <span id="s1681">And then they threw them away like kids; that was funny to me, very funny – how they had them.</span> <span id="s1682">But they didn't want to go back.</span> <span id="s1683">They said, "Why should I go back to my country?</span> <span id="s1684">I don't have a family there left.</span> <span id="s1685">They are all bombed out.</span> <span id="s1686">I'm not going back."</span> <span id="s1687">But there came the order three times, they have to go back otherwise they are in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1688">And one man who is 10 years in prison, Miklos that was his name.</span> <span id="s1689">Forgot his name, Miklos.</span> <span id="s1690">Maybe it will come back to me.</span> <span id="s1691">He was from the democratic regime in Hungary, put to jail because he was a Communist for 10 years.</span> <span id="s1692">And then he became in charge, so what did he do?</span> <span id="s1693">He killed people, and everybody could see hanging on the street, in the big street in Budapest – on Andrássy út.</span> <span id="s1694">Hanging people, you pass by, you didn't think anything of it.</span> <span id="s1695">You took everything such in stride, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1696">You didn't think anything after the war that man is hanging.</span> <span id="s1697">You saw so many on the mountains piled up, so you just pass and didn't think anything of it.</span> <span id="s1698">And then maybe you expected that he was 10 years suffering in jail, that he wouldn't be so sympathetic to the people.</span> <span id="s1699">It was – after the war was still misery.</span> <span id="s1700">No food, even for everyone.</span> <span id="s1701">Not only for the Jewish people now – equally.</span> <span id="s1702">Couldn't get anything in the stores.</span> <span id="s1703">They were all empty.</span> <span id="s1704">No food, what I mean just to survive.</span> <span id="s1705">Sometimes the water was pumped out.</span> <span id="s1706">You had to travel miles to get a little water, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: So you decided to try to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">03:14:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1710">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1711">Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1712">I could hardly wait to come over.</span> <span id="s1713">And when I came on the boat . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: In 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Seven.</span> <span id="s1716">From Bremen, Germany.</span> <span id="s1717">I thought I am dreaming, God, I was so happy.</span> <span id="s1718">That breakfast, I never thought that one minute before we had such a horrible life, and here I am such a luxury.</span> <span id="s1719">This was like a dream, like a dream come true.</span> <span id="s1720">You couldn't describe that feeling, you couldn't.</span> <span id="s1721">Just the food by itself, you didn't concentrate on anything else.</span> <span id="s1722">Just to be free and to have food.</span> <span id="s1723">You can walk; you can talk whatever you want to.</span> <span id="s1724">That was just the most amazing thing to me.</span> <span id="s1725">No starving anymore.</span> <span id="s1726">That was a luxury life.</span> <span id="s1727">Everybody got sick, but I didn't so I was – on the boat.</span> <span id="s1728">The boat was an army boat, the Ernie Pyle and water came in the boat.</span> <span id="s1729">So we had to change the direction.</span> <span id="s1730">It took us three weeks to come United States.</span> <span id="s1731">Wouldn't last that long if not water in that boat.</span> <span id="s1732">You know, accident.</span> <span id="s1733">It was a dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Did you travel with anyone you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: I traveled with many friends.</span> <span id="s1736">I can't remember, but we all went apart.</span> <span id="s1737">After the war, we had a little bit of contact from beginning.</span> <span id="s1738">One is in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1739">Yesterday, I just saw her picture.</span> <span id="s1740">I forgot her name.</span> <span id="s1741">I don't have any contact with them any longer, but some came to – in Frankfurt, I met them, and then United States, I didn't know where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: So tell me about your first impressions when you arrived in New York – you arrived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1744">A dream.</span> <span id="s1745">A dream of dreams.</span> <span id="s1746">My sister came, my brother was and a few friends, her friends came to wait for me.</span> <span id="s1747">And a bouquet of flowers, my brother.</span> <span id="s1748">Couldn't breathe, I cried.</span> <span id="s1749">I just cried.</span> <span id="s1750">Couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1751">Very emotional.</span> <span id="s1752">The, the – that Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1753">Yeah, that was something to see it.</span> <span id="s1754">I can't describe, even now it brings tears to my eyes.</span> <span id="s1755">It was just gorgeous, it was like heaven on earth.</span> <span id="s1756">Kiss everyone – I couldn't stand anybody complained in the United States.</span> <span id="s1757">But even now I'm feeling there is no way to complain to me it is heaven even now.</span> <span id="s1758">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1759">One minute away – I'm thinking one minute away.</span> <span id="s1760">That was great, and I had a great sister and a great brother supported me in every way.</span> <span id="s1761">Give me money right away, give me five – $300, which was a fortune for a person who has nothing.</span> <span id="s1762">And he said, "You be independent.</span> <span id="s1763">I want you to be independent."</span> <span id="s1764">But three weeks later, I went to work.</span> <span id="s1765">I went to work as a milliner, and I got a stitch infection.</span> <span id="s1766">My body wasn't – just one stitch, with a needle.</span> <span id="s1767">I had to stay off because my hands were infected.</span> <span id="s1768">But luckily, I got along with people very well.</span> <span id="s1769">I made very, very nice friends in New York and I am still friends with them.</span> <span id="s1770">One died, and one just came to see me, who was in Europe, who was working for Rabbi Bernstein.</span> <span id="s1771">She was his secretary, so I just met her last week.</span> <span id="s1772">So I was lucky to have met someone.</span> <span id="s1773">It's still a dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Did New York present any kind of culture shock?</span> <span id="s1775">What here surprised you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: In New York?</span> <span id="s1777">It was everything, what you wanted to have.</span> <span id="s1778">I went to lectures each time to Segal (ph) at synagogue.</span> <span id="s1779">They had dances there every week.</span> <span id="s1780">I went there.</span> <span id="s1781">One man was there in that time, he said he's a medical doctor.</span> <span id="s1782">He said he want to marry me the next day.</span> <span id="s1783">Not leaving anymore.</span> <span id="s1784">I dream, it was everything from the first minute I came to this country, it was a dream in every way.</span> <span id="s1785">Yes, culture I cultivated.</span> <span id="s1786">I went to those lectures, Segal (ph) and then dances and then the Jewish shows, free tickets for refugees.</span> <span id="s1787">And Skulnik for second [ed comment: Second Avenue- Yiddish theater] in New York, and the theaters I like all the time to go, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: What was difficult for you?</span> <span id="s1789">Anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: No.</span> <span id="s1791">After the war, gosh, nothing was difficult.</span> <span id="s1792">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1793">I got a job right away.</span> <span id="s1794">I didn't want a job.</span> <span id="s1795">I, I – when I got the stitches, I got paid for it.</span> <span id="s1796">I could be independent.</span> <span id="s1797">If I make a dollar, I still have the dollar to put away.</span> <span id="s1798">I could still eat, not to be hungry and to be independent.</span> <span id="s1799">Fifty cents frankfurters.</span> <span id="s1800">I was so proud it's mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: It's sort of a strange question, but when you started working, you probably worked with some people who had not been in Europe during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Did you ever talk about the war?</span> <span id="s1804">Did you – were they surprised?</span> <span id="s1805">Did they want to know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: I tell you, I didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1807">I didn't even talk to my children for years.</span> <span id="s1808">I didn't want to bring it up.</span> <span id="s1809">I didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1810">Somebody brought Holocaust up, I just said, "Sorry, I can't participate in that subject.</span> <span id="s1811">I'm not ready for it.</span> <span id="s1812">I don't want to talk about it."</span> <span id="s1813">I couldn't bring myself together, even to my kids, to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: So you—</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: Painful, very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: . . . you eventually met someone, got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1818">But also in that one episode it was that jealousy was big, because I was good in my field.</span> <span id="s1819">I can – I was already a milliner at home for many years, and I went to Bratislava and Budapest one of the best salons.</span> <span id="s1820">And I was watching what others do, I observed because I had to.</span> <span id="s1821">I had to compete with everybody.</span> <span id="s1822">So I was looking how to make the most, and that was jealousy many times.</span> <span id="s1823">One woman said, "Yesterday a woman was here.</span> <span id="s1824">She was much worse than you are, and they hired her."</span> <span id="s1825">But they let me go because the forelady didn't want me.</span> <span id="s1826">And then in Budapest where I was working one time, I made a hat, designed all by myself.</span> <span id="s1827">And that design hat went all over the country, had orders.</span> <span id="s1828">And the woman said, "Cut off a certain part of the head.</span> <span id="s1829">It should be better."</span> <span id="s1830">I said, "Don't cut if off.</span> <span id="s1831">It's perfect as it is."</span> <span id="s1832">"No, you do it."</span> <span id="s1833">So then the forelady comes in, and she said, "Who killed that hat?"</span> <span id="s1834">And she told it's me.</span> <span id="s1835">She didn't took it on herself because the forelady told me to correct it.</span> <span id="s1836">I wanted to leave the store.</span> <span id="s1837">That was the European.</span> <span id="s1838">But there was jealousy in jobs.</span> <span id="s1839">As a foreigner, that what I noticed.</span> <span id="s1840">But I work at many places, they were sympathetic with me.</span> <span id="s1841">They want me to come Saturday to work if I want money, even it's not right but I should come.</span> <span id="s1842">Many places I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1843">I didn't notice any anti-Semitism while I was working.</span> <span id="s1844">I made friends while I was working, good friends.</span> <span id="s1845">I didn't have that problem with them, just the jealousy was more a problem.</span> <span id="s1846">What I noticed.</span> <span id="s1847">They were scared of it.</span> <span id="s1848">If I met somebody?</span> <span id="s1849">Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: How long did it take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: When I came in, I was engaged.</span> <span id="s1852">When I came to this country in 1947.</span> <span id="s1853">Yeah, I met somebody in Germany.</span> <span id="s1854">I have his picture here.</span> <span id="s1855">And I came out and he want me to come back after two years.</span> <span id="s1856">I said, "Oh, no way.</span> <span id="s1857">I changed and you changed.</span> <span id="s1858">Two years, it's too much.</span> <span id="s1859">You lived through; I lived through.</span> <span id="s1860">I'm not going back to misery again.</span> <span id="s1861">I don't want to go on rations."</span> <span id="s1862">And so then he married and I married, too.</span> <span id="s1863">Oh, my brother lived in Washington, had a little store.</span> <span id="s1864">And I lived in New York, so I came to visit him.</span> <span id="s1865">And I was helping him like a European sister, cleaning his jewelry and washing his floor, washing his windows.</span> <span id="s1866">Like at home.</span> <span id="s1867">And a man came in, three customers, and they said if I am single, they have a man for me.</span> <span id="s1868">And I was talking on the telephone, he's a musician, a friend from Europe, from Brno where my sister was.</span> <span id="s1869">And he belonged to my sister's congregation.</span> <span id="s1870">When he was 13, he already played violin, he's a violinist.</span> <span id="s1871">And I was talking to him, I was always very happy to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1872">So anyway, he said they have a man for me, and I said, "Okay, so let me meet him."</span> <span id="s1873">To me – my brother had a date with a girl, I said, "I'm not going with you on your date.</span> <span id="s1874">I need a man for myself."</span> <span id="s1875">Just not to be with him, not to spoil his date.</span> <span id="s1876">So then my husband I met in his cousin's place, in his brother-in-law's.</span> <span id="s1877">My husband didn't want to come to my brother's place, but he said he was going to his brother’s – brother-in-law's brother liquor store in Washington.</span> <span id="s1878">I said, "Okay, he's not coming here.</span> <span id="s1879">I am going there."</span> <span id="s1880">So my husband came, then he took me to his brother – he's a lawyer in Fairfax, he was.</span> <span id="s1881">Now, he's old and sick.</span> <span id="s1882">Burstein, Robert Burstein.</span> <span id="s1883">And they thought I would be good for him, you know, for his brother.</span> <span id="s1884">So in five days, he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s1885">He was a very set man, he always knew what he wants to do – what want to do.</span> <span id="s1886">And I felt like he's very reliable and character is great, and I don't meet a man every day like that.</span> <span id="s1887">So it took me five months to make up my mind.</span> <span id="s1888">In January '51, we got married.</span> <span id="s1889">He was an economist and a rabbi, he missed but maybe a year or something.</span> <span id="s1890">Very educated.</span> <span id="s1891">A good person like human being, so that was my good luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: I have two girls.</span> <span id="s1894">One is Miriam and the other is Susan.</span> <span id="s1895">She's married 10 years, maybe more, to a very, very nice Catholic lawyer – very nice man.</span> <span id="s1896">And they have two [ed comment: three] adorable kids, Brian, Tony and John.</span> <span id="s1897">I'm very happy with the kids, with them that they are happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Let me just ask you a few general questions about all of this.</span> <span id="s1899">When you look back, what do you think – you're a single young woman going through all of this alone.</span> <span id="s1900">What do you think gave you the courage or the strength to do what you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: In the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Uh-huh [yes].</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: I tell you it was just such an automatic thing to do; that man needs papers, and my life was so miserable if I lose it, I have not too much to risk.</span> <span id="s1904">Not too much to risk.</span> <span id="s1905">If they catch me today – there's nothing safe.</span> <span id="s1906">Was no – I couldn't say I'm sitting in that chair and I'm safe.</span> <span id="s1907">That chair wasn't safe for me.</span> <span id="s1908">Nothing was safe.</span> <span id="s1909">So I said if I have to do something with my life, that man will be dead.</span> <span id="s1910">He needs my help.</span> <span id="s1911">And it was like such an automatic thing, I didn't think I am in danger.</span> <span id="s1912">I knew what I am going to do.</span> <span id="s1913">I didn't think I am crazy, I knew exactly if I go there, it will be danger.</span> <span id="s1914">And, as I said, I didn't think, just that I have to do it.</span> <span id="s1915">I didn't even think it's such a great glory to me in that time to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: But all of your hiding and everything alone, was there something about your background, the way you grew up, your life before the war that prepared you for what you had to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: I had a very difficult life, youth.</span> <span id="s1918">My father died when I was only 13 years old, and I didn't know my father till nine years old.</span> <span id="s1919">He was captured in Sarajevo, now in Serbia.</span> <span id="s1920">I read his card, "Send me money, send me food,” sent to my mother, when he sent from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1923">World War I. I didn't know him.</span> <span id="s1924">And when he came back after – he was captured in that Sarajevo, and when he came back, I was nine years old, developed.</span> <span id="s1925">Suddenly, you have a father.</span> <span id="s1926">I didn't like that.</span> <span id="s1927">He had a snuff box, Orthodox, you know, and I didn't like that smell.</span> <span id="s1928">And then he was teaching me how to pray Hebrew, and one day he cut – he tied me to the table, I should study; I didn't want to study.</span> <span id="s1929">But that was punish your kids, in the name of God, you know, that they should listen to you.</span> <span id="s1930">I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1931">I was already not ready for that kind of treatment, you know, I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1932">And then German, he taught me.</span> <span id="s1933">And he played chess, he taught me.</span> <span id="s1934">He made chess and he played chess.</span> <span id="s1935">He was a gabbai in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1936">You know, like a president in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1937">And he was a respectable man because the honor, the name, if you are a rabbi's daughter, he is a rabbi's – a kvittel [ed comment: a kivttel- rabbi’s family] of rabbis.</span> <span id="s1938">He came from that Loew, that big, golem family who made the golem.</span> <span id="s1939">Kind of he related that he comes from that family.</span> <span id="s1940">Loew, in Prague, Rabbi Loew.</span> <span id="s1941">And he created that golem?</span> <span id="s1942">and he came from that big, big family.</span> <span id="s1943">So they got respect – and he was a teacher before he – when he got married at 19 years old.</span> <span id="s1944">And my mother, I remember, she used to wash dead people.</span> <span id="s1945">She said that's the biggest mitzvah, biggest mitzvah in the world what you can do in your life.</span> <span id="s1946">Because they cannot repay you anymore.</span> <span id="s1947">You do it for the sake of doing good.</span> <span id="s1948">And she was a very high – very, very high ethics, she had.</span> <span id="s1949">Moral ethics.</span> <span id="s1950">She always stressed money is – name is more worth it than money, all the time.</span> <span id="s1951">Like gold, you know, that kind of Talmud.</span> <span id="s1952">And once she says she studied the book, and once she told me I was amazed; I was already a woman.</span> <span id="s1953">And she says that birds communicate.</span> <span id="s1954">And I said, "Where did you got it from?"</span> <span id="s1955">She said it is already in the Talmud book interpretation.</span> <span id="s1956">And she studied a lot, and she took every day a newspaper and shared it with the neighbor, who had no money to buy it alone.</span> <span id="s1957">But she had to have the paper.</span> <span id="s1958">And hardworking existence, I don't think so she lived.</span> <span id="s1959">Eight children.</span> <span id="s1960">Eight children, no father, but everybody when they grow up, congratulated my mother, how great the kids are.</span> <span id="s1961">She didn't do anything for them.</span> <span id="s1962">One was a maid in a rich place, – an aunt’s place – and another was a maid in a rich place.</span> <span id="s1963">My uncle came to pick me up so I can study hats in his place.</span> <span id="s1964">His daughter was a millinery.</span> <span id="s1965">I became a millinery.</span> <span id="s1966">But they didn't register me for a year, sooner so I should work free.</span> <span id="s1967">For three years, you had to pay if you study any trade.</span> <span id="s1968">And after three years, you get paid.</span> <span id="s1969">So they didn't register – I worked four years, instead of three years.</span> <span id="s1970">But it was a good experience for me, they had a very disciplined, happy life, and I didn't have it at home.</span> <span id="s1971">So then my father died, and I cried day and night when I was young.</span> <span id="s1972">I slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1973">I was homesick when I went to that place, and sit on one place for 12 hours.</span> <span id="s1974">Somebody died in the community, I had to make the hat with her overnight.</span> <span id="s1975">I was 13.</span> <span id="s1976">I had to be up the whole night, make that hat.</span> <span id="s1977">It would be against the law if it's in this country, but I did it.</span> <span id="s1978">And you had breakfast, a cup of coffee and a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s1979">Lunch, a good lunch, but I could have three lunches, I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s1980">And then you have 7 o'clock dinner: a slice of bread with a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s1981">There now, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1982">That wasn't – but I always prayed to God he should make me not only independent, I shouldn't need anyone.</span> <span id="s1983">I should have my bread and water.</span> <span id="s1984">That's all I want, I don't want more.</span> <span id="s1985">Just I should be my bread and my cup of water.</span> <span id="s1986">I shouldn't need any charity that was my desire all the time my life to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">03:34:09</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: This was as a young girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Very young, 13 when I was in my aunt's place.</span> <span id="s1990">I said “that's enough for me.</span> <span id="s1991">Should be my bread, don't give me anything.”</span> <span id="s1992">I don't want anything.</span> <span id="s1993">And my mother was strong.</span> <span id="s1994">She was very proud, she didn't take charity.</span> <span id="s1995">She wouldn't take charity.</span> <span id="s1996">When the Germans, Nazis, the Czech Nazis came in, the Hlinková Garda, one very rich man wanted to give my brother suits.</span> <span id="s1997">He didn't need them because they take them away.</span> <span id="s1998">They take away – the Nazis took away, if you had one dress, two dresses, took away one.</span> <span id="s1999">The whole house cleared it out.</span> <span id="s2000">You know that procedure.</span> <span id="s2001">And my mother didn't want it.</span> <span id="s2002">She said, "No, darling, you don't take it.</span> <span id="s2003">You don't need it.</span> <span id="s2004">You have what you have, and that's enough for you."</span> <span id="s2005">Very proud, didn’t want – and very, very hard working.</span> <span id="s2006">She was like a slave to me, like a slave.</span> <span id="s2007">It was a very difficult life.</span> <span id="s2008">Early morning, late at night, no husband to support anyone.</span> <span id="s2009">It was – but she had faith in God.</span> <span id="s2010">That faith kept her, faith in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: You think that kept you going, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2013">I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s2014">I always said I have to live through that.</span> <span id="s2015">I have to live.</span> <span id="s2016">I know it's impossible, though, logically.</span> <span id="s2017">But inside of me I always, yes, I have to live through that war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Do you think that your religious beliefs helped you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: I was never that big, I was never – it was just a pattern made for me from my mother's place.</span> <span id="s2020">But I questioned all the time something in religion.</span> <span id="s2021">And once I belonged to three organizations, they kicked me out.</span> <span id="s2022">Because one is Agudah, the Mizrachi, I'm a Shomer and I'm a Jabotinsky.</span> <span id="s2023">And I was in all four of them.</span> <span id="s2024">Then I decided Allgemeine Juedische Organisation, Allgemeine Juedische Organisation, that means United Jewish Organization, and I thought people shouldn't fight.</span> <span id="s2025">There's no reason to be more religious and non-religious.</span> <span id="s2026">My brother was a rabbi at home.</span> <span id="s2027">My brother, the rabbi – brother-in-law – came to see my mother, I have to say that story.</span> <span id="s2028">The other was a schochet, he came to see my mother in my house.</span> <span id="s2029">My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s2030">My brother who came to the United States was not educated, and he touched the open bottle of wine.</span> <span id="s2031">Nobody would drink that wine.</span> <span id="s2032">I couldn't accept it, it was just over my head.</span> <span id="s2033">I couldn't, and I just questioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Yeah, but, nevertheless, throughout the war—</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: I kept the tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: . . . you tried to observe holidays.</span> <span id="s2037">You tried—</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: . . . to keep kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: You prayed.</span> <span id="s2042">I mean, it must have given you some sense of strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2044">I think I got it from my mother.</span> <span id="s2045">I think I got it from my mother, and it was always in my mind “your name and your name.”</span> <span id="s2046">You know, it's better than gold, and that kind always in the moral standards.</span> <span id="s2047">I think that was my mother's doing.</span> <span id="s2048">And one thing she always said I have to have it good in life, because I'm a good person.</span> <span id="s2049">That kind of carried me; that she had faith that I want – she always said, "Don't bring me shame on my head."</span> <span id="s2050">She said it to my brother, and the stories all over, I think she had something to do with that.</span> <span id="s2051">Yeah, I was, I went to synagogue almost every time I could.</span> <span id="s2052">Shabbos, even then, and that was danger.</span> <span id="s2053">And, as I said, it's on Yom Kippur when they came to ask me money.</span> <span id="s2054">I said, "I need money."</span> <span id="s2055">They wouldn't believe me because my manicured hands and my clean dress I had one dress.</span> <span id="s2056">They stole my dresses.</span> <span id="s2057">I washed out the belt, I washed out the collar, and I went to work.</span> <span id="s2058">But water was very rationed.</span> <span id="s2059">You were not home at 4 o'clock, you don't have water.</span> <span id="s2060">If you have one dress and it's not clean, you cannot go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Once you had these Christian papers, it never occurred to you to stay Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2063">I don't believe in that.</span> <span id="s2064">I'm not such strong Jew that I should change right away.</span> <span id="s2065">Because I am a good Jew maybe in my heart.</span> <span id="s2066">But I couldn't change it.</span> <span id="s2067">What would I – no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Were you ever confronted with moral choices that were difficult to make during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s2070">My friend, desperate, she said she's in love with a married man who supports her.</span> <span id="s2071">And she thinks that that married man that married man's wife is the prostitute, not she.</span> <span id="s2072">She's not the prostitute because she is living with a man she doesn't care for, and he’s living, ergo, she is the one who is entitled.</span> <span id="s2073">And she says that she has a man for me.</span> <span id="s2074">It was nothing unusual, nothing.</span> <span id="s2075">Such a – sometimes it was a blessing who could do it.</span> <span id="s2076">I didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s2077">Maybe that saved me – I was embarrassed I didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s2078">But that was, yes, it was many times.</span> <span id="s2079">And then the $500 Pengö [ed comment: Pengö is Hungarian currency] somebody offered, my friend told me if I go with him.</span> <span id="s2080">No, I couldn't follow it.</span> <span id="s2081">I didn't follow one; I didn't follow the other.</span> <span id="s2082">But it was nothing bad in that time.</span> <span id="s2083">You know, it was – nobody would point out that you did something wrong because your life was at stake.</span> <span id="s2084">That money, it saved your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: But you didn't do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: I didn't even having second thoughts, I was insulted.</span> <span id="s2087">I didn't want to talk to that girl any longer, but it was, yeah.</span> <span id="s2088">It was facing many such little episodes.</span> <span id="s2089">One man wanted to give me lunches, in a restaurant…“I give you lunch…”</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: When you think back now about these years, 50 years ago, are there certain images that stick with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2092">Every day.</span> <span id="s2093">You can't get away from it.</span> <span id="s2094">I get very mad if they say, "Don't forget it."</span> <span id="s2095">If they – they have a lecture, Senior Citizen Survivor Center, "Don't forget."</span> <span id="s2096">What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s2097">It's the whole family, not a person.</span> <span id="s2098">"Don't forget."</span> <span id="s2099">There hasn't been a day what you wouldn't remember every one.</span> <span id="s2100">Even my husband has been dead eight years, I remember him every day.</span> <span id="s2101">And now, the whole family, a nice family.</span> <span id="s2102">I would have a great family.</span> <span id="s2103">I have no one from my family.</span> <span id="s2104">Two years ago my sister and brother died, but they’re a great family.</span> <span id="s2105">Yeah, you can't forget.</span> <span id="s2106">It sticks to you lifelong, I feel that way.</span> <span id="s2107">You can't.</span> <span id="s2108">Eight children.</span> <span id="s2109">One was a year old.</span> <span id="s2110">I loved them to pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: So you think back on that time when you were all together before the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2113">I went to visit them, I stayed there.</span> <span id="s2114">Played with them, loved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Or maybe when you said good-bye to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: We had a great relationship.</span> <span id="s2117">Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Maybe you remember when you left your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2120">Of course, I see every day people in front of me.</span> <span id="s2121">My sister had nine-years-old boy.</span> <span id="s2122">Adorable little fellow, great little fellow.</span> <span id="s2123">Nine-years-old kid, and I – as I said, my mother was only 62.</span> <span id="s2124">So everybody was young.</span> <span id="s2125">No, you can't – I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: What kind of long-term impact . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: What do you think that these experiences, how have they affected your life today?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: It's hard to say, because I keep blessing my God.</span> <span id="s2130">That he gave me such a long life and such a happy life here in this country.</span> <span id="s2131">I married a wonderful man, couldn't get a better person.</span> <span id="s2132">A better character, you couldn't get.</span> <span id="s2133">He was a rabbi and an economist, he was in the government.</span> <span id="s2134">Besides this, he was gentle human being, a mensch.</span> <span id="s2135">So I had two girls; the other is Susan, she is married three years – I mean, with three boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">03:44:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: Yes, you mentioned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: Three grandchildren, and Miriam.</span> <span id="s2139">So I had a full, full life, and I blessed to God that he gave me that in this country.</span> <span id="s2140">And what I think I can't forget the past, and the past goes with me always, but I hope that no one in the world has to have that experience, no one – what I had.</span> <span id="s2141">And that I am here today, I think it's not me.</span> <span id="s2142">I think some, like a statue, I don't think so it's me.</span> <span id="s2143">Why would I go to that whole hell for the people I don't even know?</span> <span id="s2144">I didn't regret it.</span> <span id="s2145">I didn't regret it, but I just hope – and what happened, my answer, is to – is it, needs from the childhood, an education against the hatred.</span> <span id="s2146">One letter I got from Mrs. Maurer when the story came out in the newspapers that people in leadership can see, should see what hatred can do.</span> <span id="s2147">That hatred, child is innocent.</span> <span id="s2148">For me, I don't have hatred, thank God.</span> <span id="s2149">I don't know what was the – I don't have hatred against anyone.</span> <span id="s2150">I can't forgive what they did.</span> <span id="s2151">I don't know how Germany can sleep at night.</span> <span id="s2152">But it's—</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: There’s too much noise on the—</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: You mean on the outlook?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: No, I mean, there are people who act a certain way or don't act a certain way or have certain fears because of what they went through at an earlier time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Well, the fear is that you can't forget, and it haunts you.</span> <span id="s2157">It haunts you.</span> <span id="s2158">Wherever you go you are hearing the lecture I am in Hadassah.</span> <span id="s2159">I am in the ORT, I am in the B'nai B'rith and there is Temple Israel, wherever you are the memories haunt you.</span> <span id="s2160">So it must have an effect, because you're never relaxed.</span> <span id="s2161">You lost that freedom of relaxation.</span> <span id="s2162">You can't relax.</span> <span id="s2163">You're always tensed, because the memories.</span> <span id="s2164">Memories.</span> <span id="s2165">If I go on the street and I see a kid, I say “Oh gosh, my little grandchild, he is– thank God – here, but where are the others?”</span> <span id="s2166">Innocent nine – eight children.</span> <span id="s2167">Good people, they didn't hurt a fly.</span> <span id="s2168">So you're tensed.</span> <span id="s2169">You're tensed.</span> <span id="s2170">Many times when I got out of that thing, I thought maybe I should go to the psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s2171">Many times I thought maybe everybody should go.</span> <span id="s2172">I face death little by little.</span> <span id="s2173">I think everybody has that feeling.</span> <span id="s2174">I don't know, I don't speak for everybody.</span> <span id="s2175">But it haunts you day and night.</span> <span id="s2176">That's all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: For several years afterwards, did you just block it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: Never block it out.</span> <span id="s2179">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: You said you wouldn't talk about it to anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Oh, I didn't talk, but I didn't block it out.</span> <span id="s2182">It made me very – when I went to those meetings, it made me very shaked-up.</span> <span id="s2183">For a time then I couldn't tolerate the one brings up the war stories, and the other brings up the other war stories.</span> <span id="s2184">And none was better than mine, and everybody's the same shoe.</span> <span id="s2185">Everybody is in the same shoes.</span> <span id="s2186">There is no better story and no worse.</span> <span id="s2187">Everybody you see is a monument.</span> <span id="s2188">What those people lived through, and I am included, that's not normal.</span> <span id="s2189">It would be crazy to say that you are very, very normal, if you’re always tensed and always think about this, what we cannot have.</span> <span id="s2190">It's almost 50 years, and you carry it with you.</span> <span id="s2191">I'm asking you, I'm asking you the question, normal or not normal?</span> <span id="s2192">If somebody tells you a different story, maybe they are different.</span> <span id="s2193">Maybe they are.</span> <span id="s2194">I just can't say that it's . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: One last question I have, because I don't think I asked you this before.</span> <span id="s2196">When we were talking about how you were able to get all of those work permits so that other people could have papers and be free or sort of free, why did you do it?</span> <span id="s2197">You knew that you were at great risk.</span> <span id="s2198">What made you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: You know, I was asked that same question a few times, why I did it.</span> <span id="s2200">Somebody accused me I took money.</span> <span id="s2201">I didn't take money – wasn't money involved at all, okay?</span> <span id="s2202">And the other part, I wasn't crazy.</span> <span id="s2203">I knew what I am doing, I knew exactly what I am doing, that it's not a ball game for me.</span> <span id="s2204">I know I am going in the top of the atom bomb, it can explode every minute when I am stepping in or before I step in, because the building was surrounded by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2205">Why I did it, I have no answer for it.</span> <span id="s2206">I really don't know why I did it.</span> <span id="s2207">I just had something in me said you have to do it and no question.</span> <span id="s2208">You have to do it, and I didn't feel I am doing something very big.</span> <span id="s2209">I didn't feel like I'm such a big hero.</span> <span id="s2210">I just did what I have to do.</span> <span id="s2211">I was there in that minute they needed me.</span> <span id="s2212">That boy is dead without me, and life was tough.</span> <span id="s2213">If I lose my life there, maybe I would lose it regardless.</span> <span id="s2214">That was my idea, but I wasn't crazy.</span> <span id="s2215">I knew what I am doing.</span> <span id="s2216">And I didn't plan to get money for it, didn't think of it.</span> <span id="s2217">And I'm happy I did it, very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: What I would add to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: I feel that you've told me a lot, and I don't have any more questions, but if there's something else you wanted to say . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: Well, one thing I wanted to add.</span> <span id="s2222">I don't want to miss it.</span> <span id="s2223">Churchill.</span> <span id="s2224">Churchill was the only statement – statesman, he openly said that he's against, you know, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2225">That was only country, none of the others – they were quiet.</span> <span id="s2226">He was the only one who spoke, who was outspoken.</span> <span id="s2227">My mother and sister – I can't remember anymore.</span> <span id="s2228">That's all I can say; he just said that.</span> <span id="s2229">You know, I just feel it shouldn't be war.</span> <span id="s2230">That's all what I feel like.</span> <span id="s2231">And in Israel, I was in AIPAC, I thought I'm dreaming.</span> <span id="s2232">They put me to the head table with the, with the Ambassador of Israel and his wife and a congressman and another congressman.</span> <span id="s2233">I thought I'm dreaming.</span> <span id="s2234">After 2,300 people in AIPAC convention, Sheraton Hotel downtown, and I am there, me, little from that village and from that place.</span> <span id="s2235">I thought I am in heaven.</span> <span id="s2236">So they work for peace and I work for hope will come to Israel.</span> <span id="s2237">So, I don't know what to say.</span> <span id="s2238">Just bless everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Now,
