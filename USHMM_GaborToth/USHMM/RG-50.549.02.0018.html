Yeah.</span> <span id="s34">Th-Those things I think are important to talk about.</span> <span id="s35">I mean, I [inaudible].</span> <span id="s36">One -- one perspective, which is a very removed and kind of naive perspective.</span> <span id="s37">I mean, to -- to hear your feelings about these things is very important to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: It was an extremely intra -- important trip.</span> <span id="s39">But that’s no where you want to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Well, we can start -- if you want, we can start there.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: But -- it doesn’t mean the see -- I don’t think the sequence is -- is too important.</span> <span id="s43">Well, if we want to do it from the beginning -- if you could start and just give me the -- tell me a little bit more about your family -- about your parents and aunts and uncles, so the -- the previous generation.</span> <span id="s44">And tell me their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s46">My family’s name is Weil, W-e-i-l, which is a very common Jewish name in Alsace, where -- in -- where I grew up.</span> <span id="s47">My fam -- my immediate family consisted of my father, my mother, my paternal grandmother and my brother, who’s 13 months younger than I am.</span> <span id="s48">My parents came all from rural -- from villages.</span> <span id="s49">Ba -- And I was born in a little village outside of Strasbourg, right -- very tiny community of farmers.</span> <span id="s50">But it had a synagogue in the days I was born, because I remember as a little girl going to visit the Hassan there [indecipherable] because he had -- his wife had a little grocery store and -- and that’s all I remember, I was three years old and we moved to the city.</span> <span id="s51">My parents had --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Which -- which city?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Strasbourg.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Oh, I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s56">I grew up in Strasbourg for all practical purposes because I don’t remember anything from before I was three years old.</span> <span id="s57">My father had a very unusual profession for a Jew.</span> <span id="s58">His father had been a butcher.</span> <span id="s59">They -- usually the Jewish butcher was also the butcher for the other population.</span> <span id="s60">In other words, he served the whole community.</span> <span id="s61">Of course, the Jews ate the kosher parts and so on.</span> <span id="s62">I had never known my grandfather because he died of some gangrene he had of his leg -- he had a leg amputated, because I’m told that he had diabetes, but I -- I really never knew him.</span> <span id="s63">And my father had only one sister, who died when she was probably about 18 or so, of complication of probably appendicitis, which know how to treat.</span> <span id="s64">But her name was Margaret.</span> <span id="s65">So, my middle name is Margaret.</span> <span id="s66">I’m -- I’m Simone Margaret.</span> <span id="s67">And also Heb-Hebrew name would mean Esther, so I’m Esther too, in my Hebrew name.</span> <span id="s68">The interesting thing is, is that I’d always thought that I was named Simone because it’s a real French name and Alsace had just returned to France in 1918.</span> <span id="s69">My parents were married in 1919 and I was born in 1920.</span> <span id="s70">And then I found out when -- more recently I’ve been studying genealogy and I have the genealogy of the Weils all the way back to way before the French revolution, I have investigated that.</span> <span id="s71">And I found out that -- lost my train of thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: You were talking about your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: My na -- yeah, that there was between my father and Margaret, a boy named Simon who died as an infant.</span> <span id="s74">I mean, which was very common in those day.</span> <span id="s75">So was I named after some -- I had never heard of him until we dug up that genealogy.</span> <span id="s76">So that --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: This was one of your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, no, my fa -- my father’s -- my father’s br -- well, it would have been an uncle</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: would have been an uncle, but he died as an infant.</span> <span id="s81">Never knew him, ne-never heard of him.</span> <span id="s82">He was just was important to talk it’s neither here nor there, but it was just interesting, was I named because of a Francophile sentiment or was I named because there was a Simon that died as an infant.</span> <span id="s83">So, that’s it.</span> <span id="s84">My father did not -- at first -- I don’t think my father had more than a sixth grade education.</span> <span id="s85">They were a very poor family in the village and he used to help his father in -- in the butcher shop, but he eventually developed an interest in sheep and sheep raising and sheep breeding and for the meat and for the and developed a big, big business.</span> <span id="s86">He became the most important sheep breeder in the east of France and although we lived in the city, he had these herds of sheep, I guess that’s what they are, in the various places where he went and then he supervised all this -- this big business.</span> <span id="s87">I had very little interest in that.</span> <span id="s88">My mother also had very little education, although probably more than my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Jeanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: J-e-a-n-n-e, which would be pronounced Jean, I guess, here.</span> <span id="s93">She was the oldest of eight children.</span> <span id="s94">I knew my -- mat-maternal grandparents quite well, because from the earliest age on, even before I was a year old, I would spend a lot of time with my grandparent.</span> <span id="s95">And with all the unmarried uncles and sister -- uncle and aunts, because I was the first grandchild -- and little by little, the siblings -- my mother’s siblings got married and I -- but I always went to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s96">I must have been eight years old, when both of them died, at -- at the very close interval.</span> <span id="s97">They were they lived in the village, called Mummenheim, which -- which today is almost a suburb of Strasbourg, but in those days was a trip to go there.</span> <span id="s98">And I spent a lot of time there.</span> <span id="s99">There were a very rigid, stern family.</span> <span id="s100">But my grandmother was sweet and kind and she taught me a lot of songs and little girls ditties, you know, that kind of things.</span> <span id="s101">And I -- I remember her very fondly.</span> <span id="s102">But my mother being the oldest of eight sibling and probably better off than the others, she became, over all the years that I have known her, the family caretaker.</span> <span id="s103">She was -- our house was always Grand Central Station and her brothers and sisters would always come</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And what was their profession, your mother’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: My grandfather, well, had a little grocery store with his brother.</span> <span id="s106">He also was a peddler and he carried his ware to another little grocery store across the Lake and that’s -- that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s107">Nobody on my mother’s side either had -- nobody went through high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Now, when you say he was a peddler, just -- did he peddle things house to house, or just to another store?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Gee, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s110">I know I seen him with his thing on his back and maybe he went -- there was a store in Mummenheim with his brother -- his brother Neftilly, who was deported during the war and hi-his -- they had another store in Wagdenheim and I don’t know whether he just schlepped it over there or whether he -- whether he peddled.</span> <span id="s111">I -- I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Let me interrupt one second, I forgot to -- had to put a special slate at the beginning of the interview and I will read that now.</span> <span id="s113">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s114">This is an interview with Mrs. Simone Weil-Lipman, conducted by Steve Roland, on August fourth, 1998, in her home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.</span> <span id="s115">This is a follow up interview to the USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Mrs. Lipman on July third, 1990.</span> <span id="s116">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I’m reacting to the fact that’s already eight years.</span> <span id="s118">Can’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Does it seem like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No, no, no .</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: You know, one thing that -- that you mentioned during lunch is that -- that there were things that you read in the transcription of the interview, that you -- that surprised you.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Does anything particular come to mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: N -- Only the one thing that was really not correct that somehow in my -- although I think my English is pretty good, so once in awhile I express myself a little awkwardly and I think something didn’t quite come across.</span> <span id="s125">You see, when the war started, I was li -- I was 19 years old, but the year before, really, we -- Munich was happening and we were very worried, because Strasbourg is the most exposed city.</span> <span id="s126">And so my parents asked me to take my grandmother away from Strasbourg and in transcript -- in -- I -- I read that I took my -- I went to safety with my grandmother and the interpretation was that I went to be safe with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s127">What really happened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a train and I went to some kind of resort, to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole world situation and then brought my grandmother back to Strassber -- the following year, when the war really was going to get started, same thing happened.</span> <span id="s128">I was away, my father brought me back home.</span> <span id="s129">This is end of August, 1939 and again I took my grandmother, we took a train.</span> <span id="s130">We went to the center of France where we stayed in a hotel and I took my grandmother to safety, I didn’t go to safety with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s131">So, this is one of the things that, as I say, I took responsibility for my grandmother and we waited out [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s132">And so this is one of the detail that are -- other things, they don’t come to my mind right now.</span> <span id="s133">[indecipherable] clarifying [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: So that’s the information I can gi-give you about my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Tell me -- tell me a little bit about -- about your fe -- your family, in regard to the -- the climate in the house, about the way things were done in the house, about the religion, about the ethics.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, we were very observant family.</span> <span id="s138">My mother came, obviously, from a very observant family.</span> <span id="s139">Both my parents came, but my mother -- of the two -- of my parents, my mother was the more knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s140">She -- really amazingly, for a woman in those days, could understand the prayer book, could understand the Biblical text.</span> <span id="s141">My father could read -- with a lot of mistakes -- he could lead a service even, but he made lot of mistakes, because he didn’t have the intellectual stuff that goes with it.</span> <span id="s142">He had just learned it by rote and by heart and so on.</span> <span id="s143">But the climate was one of observance.</span> <span id="s144">Judaism was certainly central to our lives.</span> <span id="s145">There was not an intellectual climate.</span> <span id="s146">There was not a interest in music, in books.</span> <span id="s147">My parents read, but probably -- well, I don’t know what you’d call them har -- here.</span> <span id="s148">Romantic stuff that --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: What -- what language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh, at -- at home we spoke Alsatian, which is a dialect, based on German and my mother spoke French, obviously I spoke French and went to French school and in my teenage, rebellious years, I pretended I couldn’t understand anything but French, which my father didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s151">Don’t forget, that Alsace moved back and forth between France and Germany, which meant that my grandmother, who lived with us, was born in the French period, to -- became German in 1871, when France lost the Prussian war.</span> <span id="s152">So both my parents were born under a German regime and went to German schools.</span> <span id="s153">Spoke German fluently.</span> <span id="s154">In 1918, France reverted to fran -- Al-Alsace reverted to France.</span> <span id="s155">Now, my mother came from a very Francophile, somewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to Paris, at least for some time, to be with an aunt, whom I know -- whom I knew too, and there they perfected their French.</span> <span id="s156">So my mother spoke and wrote perfect French.</span> <span id="s157">No spelling mistake, no nothing, she didn’t -- but she also could do it in German.</span> <span id="s158">My father -- whose business was with the peasants, the farmers, the -- the rural community, never bothered to learn French.</span> <span id="s159">So he could understand somewhat.</span> <span id="s160">So as I said, in my rebellious teenage years, when he and I collided, I couldn’t understand Alsatian.</span> <span id="s161">I should like to add something that -- very pa -- I don’t know how interesting it is to this particular interview, but Alsatian Jews speak not -- sp-speak what is called in French, le Judeo Alsatian, or in their own parlance, they call it Yiddish dige.</span> <span id="s162">It’s not Yiddish, because God forbid an Alsatian Jew should speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s163">The Alsatian Jews look down on eastern European Jews, whom they all called Polacks, that’s -- was the n-nomination, so just like the German Jews in this country look down on the immigrants that came after them from the eastern European countries.</span> <span id="s164">Exactly the same situation.</span> <span id="s165">My father is probably turning around in his grave, as I have discovered that this Judeo Alsatian, which they spoke, is really similar to Yiddish.</span> <span id="s166">It’s not -- does not have -- it’s -- doesn’t have a written language, it doesn’t have a literature.</span> <span id="s167">It was just a spoken language -- is dying out, but it’s being retrieved and I happen -- I -- where as when I grew up, I thought of it as very crude and very common and I walked two miles behind my parents when they spoke it.</span> <span id="s168">Today, I’m very interested in it and I have read a number of books.</span> <span id="s169">There -- I find out there is -- I have been communicating with people who are studying it and there is very few of us who still ha-have a feel for it.</span> <span id="s170">It’s a very rich language, very different from Yiddish in it’s pronunciation and it’s formation of words, and is very much tied into Hebrew, which also intrigues me very much.</span> <span id="s171">So, this is how that beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Can -- can you give us a short example of how it sounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes, I can give you one that I always use when people ask me.</span> <span id="s174">In Germany you say, “Eashe harbor gie gessen.”</span> <span id="s175">I have eaten.</span> <span id="s176">In Yiddish, you say, “Ay chobe gessen.”</span> <span id="s177">In Alsatian, you say, “Shop gessa.”</span> <span id="s178">In Yiddish dige, le Judeo Alsatian, “Ishap ger archult.”</span> <span id="s179">I don’t if you know Hebrew, but ochell in Hebrew is to eat.</span> <span id="s180">So they -- they use the Hebrew word, they conjugate it in germaway and they say, Ishap.</span> <span id="s181">The big difference, eehope and ishap, that’s the big different.</span> <span id="s182">Ishap ger archult and that’s the way my father would speak, using Hebrew words, conjugating them and distorting them, so that in order to trace back what it really means, you really have to do a little research.</span> <span id="s183">And it’s -- has intrigued enough people.</span> <span id="s184">There is a chair of Judeo Alsatian [indecipherable] at the university now.</span> <span id="s185">And it’s a non-Jewish person who is studying it.</span> <span id="s186">So it’s interesting [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s187">But anyway, this is what we spoke at home.</span> <span id="s188">And coming back to this, the atmosphere, you know, my parents had no social life.</span> <span id="s189">They didn’t go out, they didn’t travel.</span> <span id="s190">My vacations were -- m-my grandparents house, maybe at an aunt, my -- once -- one aunt got married and lived in another village and she married a -- a cattle peddler.</span> <span id="s191">J-Jews were a lot of cattle peddlers or became merchants and grain merchants, cattle merchants and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s192">So I went -- I went to spend some vacation with them.</span> <span id="s193">The only time my -- I remember taking a vacation was my mother and we went to Luxembourg in a Jewish hotel, was that -- there was an epidemic of polio and my mother took us there for several weeks.</span> <span id="s194">Is --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: For what -- for what reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Because there was an epidemic of polio -- to be away from Strasbourg and to go somewhere where it wouldn’t affect us.</span> <span id="s197">Because in these days, you went into an iron lung and all this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s198">So twice I remember going there.</span> <span id="s199">But what really became my -- well, even before I go to that, let me say, my -- the focus of my life was school.</span> <span id="s200">For two reasons.</span> <span id="s201">One -- number one, I was interested.</span> <span id="s202">But number two, had a brother who’s 13 months younger and my father made no bones about the fact he would have liked to have a boy first or maybe even two boys and no girl, because he needed one for the busine -- he needed two boys for the business.</span> <span id="s203">And I was an only -- only a girl.</span> <span id="s204">But I was very interested in school and did very well in school.</span> <span id="s205">So this mar -- the teachers and -- and I also went very unusually so for those days, I also went to what you’d call here, Hebrew school and got a very solid Jewish education.</span> <span id="s206">An education which I continue throughout the years so that I’m familiar and comfortable with the Hebrew -- of the service and I’m comfortable with the Biblical text and I have continued studying.</span> <span id="s207">And so my goodies came not so much from my parents as it came from teachers and rabbis and educators.</span> <span id="s208">And also, when I was 12 years old, my parents permitted me to join the Jewish girl scout -- German -- and that really became the center of my life.</span> <span id="s209">Now, I’m not unique in this.</span> <span id="s210">Of course, it took even more importance, because my parents, when -- couldn’t give me the -- the cultural stuff that they didn’t have.</span> <span id="s211">I mean, they -- they -- they -- they were not educated to -- to have this and so I got -- I got very involved and a total commitment to the Jewish girl scouts.</span> <span id="s212">Not the --when I -- when I say girl scout -- and the equivalent, I mean there is no comparison to the scouting movement today in the United Sta -- don’t know what it was like 50 years ago, but that was a -- a total commitment to service, to -- to -- I’m -- I -- to Jewish learning.</span> <span id="s213">There was a boy’s movement and a girl’s movement.</span> <span id="s214">I -- now, in back -- in looking back on it, I must have been an organizers from very early on, because by the time I was 13, I was already one of the leaders.</span> <span id="s215">You know, the movement at that time, unlike in the United State, no parent involvement.</span> <span id="s216">It was -- we called it leading through youth.</span> <span id="s217">We didn’t have any parent involvement.</span> <span id="s218">So we got leadership training and we got all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s219">I took these kids hiking in the mountains every Sunday, or practically every Sunday and we roughed it up, we went camping, we dig out trenches.</span> <span id="s220">We kept kosher at camp and we -- we cooked on -- we didn’t have any of the equipments that you have today, we really roughed it out.</span> <span id="s221">But it was and it is an indi -- it -- we have a -- still today, we -- we have a bound, a -- a tie between us that is the s-something that is difficult to describe.</span> <span id="s222">And the Jewish youth movement became a very active movement in the resistance in France during the war and then eventually after the war, some of them found a kibbutzim in Israel.</span> <span id="s223">And I am still not in correspondence, because [indecipherable] because our -- our what we call the commissaire, the -- the big leader over the whole region there, there’s a man who is now in his 90’s, he is deaf, he is blind, and -- but I’m -- I still get news from him or about him.</span> <span id="s224">And all to rees --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Where does he live?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: And he founded a kibbutz there and his wife is still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Well, his real name is now Shimon Hamel, but in -- oh, this -- this is going to ex -- ask for a lot of explanation.</span> <span id="s233">We call him Shamu.</span> <span id="s234">Shamu in French means camel.</span> <span id="s235">But it also means somebody who’s very rough.</span> <span id="s236">And he was a very tough leader.</span> <span id="s237">If you take the Jewish encyclopedia, and I have it in there, the library there and you look under scouting and you’ll find his name there in quotation mark and his wife is a very busy lady, so we called her Fumi, which in French means ants.</span> <span id="s238">We all had names like that which we called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s239">But it creates a tru -- an -- you know, I’ve often wondered -- you know, people have asked me, in this country, what made you do what you did during the war?</span> <span id="s240">And, although I have really no answer to it and I have read books and I’ve tried -- people have been pondering, why did some people become rescuers and why did some stand by?</span> <span id="s241">And actually participated here, at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in a workshop led by somebody from Germany and -- on rescue and resistance.</span> <span id="s242">And I also have connected in the last few years, with some of my co-workers in the camps and in the underground and we pondered this, too, because we [indecipherable] ask, why did you did what you do -- did?</span> <span id="s243">And the only answer that everybody [indecipherable], we ha -- there was a job to be done and we did it.</span> <span id="s244">Now, why did we do it and not somebody el -- the -- I have been pondering and I really don’t know, except that maybe in this deep involvement in this youth movement, I took on a sense of responsibility and caring and duty, sort of.</span> <span id="s245">And more recently I have been thinking about it and my mother, who was not an educated woman, but sh -- and she was a very gentle and rather passive woman, yet, she was a caretaker.</span> <span id="s246">She took care of all her siblings.</span> <span id="s247">Or -- and of not only siblings, of -- of relatives in need and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s248">And of her mother-in-law, who didn’t give her an easy time either, but she was there and I’m wondering whether I unconsciously, you know, had some -- some model there.</span> <span id="s249">Be -- and my father, who was really a -- a very -- man with a very high temper and really a tyrant, but nevertheless, he let my mother do all this helping.</span> <span id="s250">In other words, he opened his pocketbook and there was never any problem.</span> <span id="s251">So I wasn’t a deprived child in a sense of physical [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s252">We lived simply, not luxuriously, but I didn’t have this -- I -- I really got my goodies from the scouting movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: And from my teachers, rabbis, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Well, ec -- explain one thing to me.</span> <span id="s256">In growing up in the Jewish community here, in this country, I’m used to families in which the parents are very involved in kind of laying out a path for the children.</span> <span id="s257">And particularly with regard to education.</span> <span id="s258">Ver-Very keen on pushing children through education and setting up things.</span> <span id="s259">And from what you’re telling me, it seems to me that for you particularly and maybe for your -- your friends, that thi -- that -- that your interest in education and in the scouting movement and in -- and even in promoting Judaism, w-was more self motivated.</span> <span id="s260">Is -- is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s262">Well, th-th -- your statement is correct except for one thing is that is this is true uniquely for me.</span> <span id="s263">Has nothing to do with my generation.</span> <span id="s264">It’s my family, my friends.</span> <span id="s265">And -- in -- in the Lycee, which I attended -- in the Lycee which I attended, I had friends who were of different religions.</span> <span id="s266">I had the daughter of a minister.</span> <span id="s267">I had a -- I had Jewish friends and their parents had this kind of -- in fact the -- the -- one of my girlfriend’s mothers was a writer of children’s book.</span> <span id="s268">And to me, that was kind of a discovery, that there were mothers who were writing -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: This is a continuation of United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s270">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: -- and their parents had this kind of -- in fact, the -- the -- one of my girlfriend’s mothers was a writer of children’s book.</span> <span id="s272">And to me, that was kind of a discovery, that there were mothers who were writing books?</span> <span id="s273">I mean, in my family, there were very limited people, so I cannot universalize for -- for my generation.</span> <span id="s274">It certainly wasn’t in my family.</span> <span id="s275">And my family was very -- I -- I wa -- I grew up with a sense of my family was very different from the families of the other kids, my friends who had record players and -- and pi -- well, we had a piano, I played piano, but who had record players and whose parents went to the theater and who entertained.</span> <span id="s276">And we didn’t -- my parents had that limitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: But they’re -- from what you told me about your father, my impression was that y -- that he was fairly well-to-do.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Not well-to-do, no.</span> <span id="s279">He [indecipherable] up the na -- good business, so we were living comfortably.</span> <span id="s280">We had large apartment, but on the wr-wrong side of town, let’s say.</span> <span id="s281">All my friends lived in a different neighborhood.</span> <span id="s282">We lived across from the railroad station, which meant the -- I always had the feeling that they came from the little village and they found a place across the railroad station and that’s where they went.</span> <span id="s283">And when I went to the Lycee and wherever I went, my friends lived closer to that place.</span> <span id="s284">But you know, that’s -- it wasn’t well-to-do, we didn’t lack of anything.</span> <span id="s285">And there was -- had a maid full time.</span> <span id="s286">But then, everybody had maids with -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Now were they -- what -- what background was the maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: The maid was one of his shepherd’s daughters, I guess, from one of the villages and when --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Oh, no, mm-mm.</span> <span id="s291">No, not Jewish, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What were the -- can you tell me a little bit about the relationship between the -- the Jewish people who lived there and the non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Well, as you -- as I told you just now, you have to look at different levels.</span> <span id="s294">When I was in the village with my grandparents, where I spend, as I said, all my summers until I was 10 - 11 and had outgrown that and I was with the girl scouts at camp.</span> <span id="s295">I went camping with them at the south of France and all over the [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: There’s that -- there’s -- just let -- for the record, there’s construction taking place next door.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: There are three houses being built right now.</span> <span id="s298">We lucked out.</span> <span id="s299">The -- I -- there was still a perceived fear of anti-Semitism in the village.</span> <span id="s300">I never experienced this in the city.</span> <span id="s301">And what I remember very well is, on Christmas eve, my grandparents would close all the shutters of the house.</span> <span id="s302">They -- just up -- they lived in the street called Rue de les gliese, Church Street.</span> <span id="s303">Which means the church was right -- just at the end of the street there, and there was this fear -- I’m sure they had never experienced this personally, but maybe it came down through the family history that coming out from the midnight mass, there would be some -- something happening to Jews.</span> <span id="s304">And so they closed the shutters on -- [indecipherable] they probably closed them other nights, too.</span> <span id="s305">But there was a fear there.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: These are your mother’s or father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: My -- my mother, you know, my -- my -- my mothers.</span> <span id="s308">My maternal grandparents, because my paternal grandmother lived with us and my grandfather had died.</span> <span id="s309">And also, I remember in the village, as a little girl -- and I played with little kids there -- whether they were Jewish kids or not, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s310">But I remember hearing some little -- what would you call it, little -- oh, nasty things, like, you know, what you -- some derogatory statements.</span> <span id="s311">I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s312">If you want to hear it enunciation, I can tell it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s314">I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yout -- yout chasit dout.</span> <span id="s316">And I don’t remember the rest of it.</span> <span id="s317">J-Jew -- Jew, shit into the bag -- and then I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s318">Anyway, there was a derogatory kind of thing.</span> <span id="s319">But I don’t remember it bothering me, so -- but their relationship with non-Jews was perfectly good, there in the village.</span> <span id="s320">I remember in Passover, spending Passover with my grandparents and since they were very observant and I went literally across the street to the farm with a -- with a pottery container and they would milk the cow directly into that.</span> <span id="s321">And was very acceptable that Jews at this time of the year, couldn’t put the milk in another kind of vessel because of the Passover observance.</span> <span id="s322">And so there was that.</span> <span id="s323">My father worked with non-Jews in the countryside.</span> <span id="s324">I would ass -- and he -- he did business with non Jews all the time.</span> <span id="s325">As for me, I -- of course my -- the -- the -- the center of my life was the family, the school and -- and -- and religious school and this very active Jewish youth movement.</span> <span id="s326">But I also -- I excelled in school.</span> <span id="s327">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Now, did you go to school with non-Jews, or only --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh yes, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s330">Because my brother and I were so close in age, we started school at the same time.</span> <span id="s331">Speak of psychology, my parents didn’t quite have that kind of training.</span> <span id="s332">And lo and behold, how these unsophisticated parents managed to get me in an all boy’s school, I don’t know, but it saved them a trip to take me to an all girl’s school.</span> <span id="s333">So we started school at the same time.</span> <span id="s334">And I excelled in the boy’s school.</span> <span id="s335">And because I wasn’t a boy, I had to do better than the boys, and so -- and these were -- this was a -- a gr -- a Lycee, it was a public school, so it wasn’t Jewish kids, it was kids of all -- of all faith and all [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s336">And then, by the time I went into third grade, then I was able to walk by myself and so I walked to a girl’s school, a Lycee -- I mean, a French school.</span> <span id="s337">And it’s very interesting that wh-when I left there, then my brother really -- he -- he became -- he blossomed more.</span> <span id="s338">But the thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Hogere, Roger.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And how do you spell Hogere?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Like Roger.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: My brother is dead.</span> <span id="s345">He died at age 55 in Israel, after losing his youngest son in the Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And how did your brother die?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s349">Then his -- his -- your nephew was killed in a battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: He was killed in a battle in a Yom Kippur wawl in 1973.</span> <span id="s351">So, he had already had a heart attack before, so this is -- this did him in and he died, years later.</span> <span id="s352">So the rest of his family is in Israel and that’s -- and that’s where my nephews and nieces and great-nephew [indecipherable] are and my sister-in-law and her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Do -- do you travel there often?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: N-Not often, but I’ve been there a total of seven times already, so that’s not too bad.</span> <span id="s355">And I’m very close to that side of the family.</span> <span id="s356">But in the Lycee, I ex -- had, personally, a very good relationship with my -- with students of all faith and I was in this -- what should you call it?</span> <span id="s357">The [indecipherable] of the -- of the high school.</span> <span id="s358">We took not only Latin and a foreign language and Greek and -- and math and philosophy.</span> <span id="s359">You know, we -- there was a group of us and there were Protestant, there were Catholic, there were Jews, we were all, there were -- I have pictures of us going on outings together into the mountains or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s360">Had one limitation, is that we kept kosher.</span> <span id="s361">So I certainly didn’t go out with them to eat, you know, with this group.</span> <span id="s362">But I had them over to ha -- to my house and we made -- well I had my own room, where I could entertain.</span> <span id="s363">This was very unfrequent.</span> <span id="s364">It was -- it was very unfreq -- I had a very good relationship with my -- teachers were all non-Jewish and I -- in my -- in my leadership positions in the Jewish youth movement, I went to international camps and you know, f-from scoutings from all over the world.</span> <span id="s365">And so I really never experienced personally, any anti-Semitism or any friction in my relationship with non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Now that -- that -- to me, that’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: [indecipherable] that.</span> <span id="s369">I want to ask you be -- one other question.</span> <span id="s370">In this country, in the Jewish community here, you have this extraordinary range of people’s relationship to Judaism and how observant or non-observant they are, now to Jews who were not observant at all.</span> <span id="s371">In your youth -- and -- and you’ve -- and you’ve said several times that -- that you were fact -- very observant and your grandparents were observant.</span> <span id="s372">Was there such a thing as Jews who were not observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Oh yes, indef -- a -- that -- the -- lots of them.</span> <span id="s374">My closest Jewish friends were not observant, did not come from observant families, did not go t -- the girls did not go to Hebrew school, they did not have that education.</span> <span id="s375">It was something that came both from my family and from me personally.</span> <span id="s376">I’ve always had that interest and I continue, here today in Chapel Hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: But those people consider themselves Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s379">But there was -- now, when I said we were observant, I’m -- you know, I hate the word Orthodox.</span> <span id="s380">You use the word Orthodox today because you have to separate Conservative, Reform, Orthodox.</span> <span id="s381">There was no such a thing in France.</span> <span id="s382">It was traditional Judaism.</span> <span id="s383">It -- Orthodox only had to define itself with the rise of the -- of Reform and then the Conservative movement.</span> <span id="s384">So it was traditional Judaism.</span> <span id="s385">And to label ourselves Orthodox, I don’t want you to feel that we wearing black coats or anything like that.</span> <span id="s386">We were perfectly modern Jews.</span> <span id="s387">And so is my family in Israel today.</span> <span id="s388">They are very observant Jews and except for the boys wearing the knitted kippah, th-they are of this world, you know?</span> <span id="s389">So I -- I don’t like the label Orthodox.</span> <span id="s390">But sure, my friends -- my friends didn’t have that education, you know, I -- I -- in a way my family was -- it -- and interestingly enough, my cousins, who -- we have the same grandparents, practically none of my cousin have remained even Jewish.</span> <span id="s391">They have all intermarried.</span> <span id="s392">Practically all of them.</span> <span id="s393">Or if they haven’t intermarried, their kids have intermarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And these are cousins who live where?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Some in Strasbourg and some in the village in -- in -- in -- in -- in where my grandparents lived in s -- [indecipherable] in the village Sovalza, so in Strasbourg, these cousins -- now, I must say, there are -- the next cousin -- I was the oldest of all the cousins, because my mother is the oldest of all of them.</span> <span id="s396">And there is eight of us.</span> <span id="s397">My brother, m-myself are the oldest and then there is eight years until the next cousin.</span> <span id="s398">And she didn’t marry a Jew.</span> <span id="s399">The children are -- have retained no tie to Judaism.</span> <span id="s400">Of the whole family of cousins, there is only my brother who went to -- made alia to Israel and his whole family has remained very committed to Judaism.</span> <span id="s401">Myself here and my family -- I’m -- I’m all children and grandchildren who are -- have remained very ha -- observant -- very -- I should say Jewishly committed.</span> <span id="s402">And amongst my cousins, the-there is one -- there is two who have remained -- no-not the cousins, the children of the cousins, there is only two that have remained Jewishly committed.</span> <span id="s403">All the other -- the children are completely -- have left Judaism, totally.</span> <span id="s404">So that answers your question.</span> <span id="s405">You’ll have to go to see my schoolmates or others and even in the family, it’s been, the commitment has been -- there was something unique in my family, I don’t know what it was, but both my brother and I got that somewhere.</span> <span id="s406">They were never -- now, to say something on their behalf is, their families were never quite as committed as we were to Juda -- although they were, on the surface, observant.</span> <span id="s407">I mean, they didn’t travel on Shabbat and they did -- they ate kosher.</span> <span id="s408">Everybody had a kosher upbringing, no question about it.</span> <span id="s409">They didn’t -- they were younger and so the war hit them at a different stage of their lives.</span> <span id="s410">They also -- they a -- it also hit them in -- in very personal kinds of way.</span> <span id="s411">Two of them lost their parents -- four of them lost their parents.</span> <span id="s412">And -- during the war and so it affected them in many different ways.</span> <span id="s413">So I had wa -- this advantage of eight years before the war, which they didn’t have.</span> <span id="s414">They were little kids, they were -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Well, this is -- there’s so many directions --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: -- that I feel that we could talk now, but le -- I was going to ask you about this later, but let me ask you now.</span> <span id="s418">D-Do you find with -- with these --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Did I fi --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Do you find with these relatives that you are saying, who have become less religious and -- and have intermarried, that the war affected their belief in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: It affected them very deeply, whether it’s their belief in God or whether there is their attachment to Judaism.</span> <span id="s422">I haven’t discussed to believe in God with them.</span> <span id="s423">But I know it affected them very deeply.</span> <span id="s424">Can I give you one example?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I think my next oldest cousin is eight years younger than I and then she has a sister who is three years younger than I.</span> <span id="s427">They grew up at Strasbourg like I did, but it’s interesting, I cannot remember our family getting together for holidays so very rarely [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s428">My parents were very limited this way, socially.</span> <span id="s429">But I remember their coming and I -- I -- I remember going to their house and so on.</span> <span id="s430">They must have gotten some kind of Jewish education somewhere, although I really cannot swear, but they must have gone to Talmator like we all did.</span> <span id="s431">You see sc -- in France, school is as -- five days of school, but unlike here, where Saturday and Sunday are off, you have a day in the middle of the week that’s off.</span> <span id="s432">You went to school s -- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, were off on Thursday and you went to school on -- on Friday and Saturday.</span> <span id="s433">Big dilemma for an observant girl.</span> <span id="s434">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s435">I went to school, but I didn’t write.</span> <span id="s436">I attended -- this was the compromise, because there were no day schools and I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s437">So I -- I t -- I sat through classes without writing.</span> <span id="s438">So you distinguish between the Jews who wrote and Jews who didn’t write on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s439">This was the big thing.</span> <span id="s440">And I was one of the few who didn’t write.</span> <span id="s441">But on Thursday, on Sunday, we went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s442">And whether my cousins stayed or not, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s443">But what happened is, when the war started, there were obviously -- I was 19, so one of them was 11 and the other one was nine.</span> <span id="s444">They lived in the south of France and the father -- they lost their mother to cancer very early on during the war.</span> <span id="s445">And their father worked with the Jewish agency, you know, the -- there was an official Jewish agency functioning in France -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Now just so I’m clear, their -- their mother was your mother’s younger sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: One of them -- one of my mother’s sisters, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: And she -- she died of natural causes and the father put them in a -- into a boarding school while he was working for the Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s450">There was a -- an official Jewish agency that was responsible to the [indecipherable] forces, but -- and my uncle worked for them.</span> <span id="s451">He had been a civil servant in Strasbourg, some -- some very low government pencil pusher kind of job.</span> <span id="s452">I -- I don’t know exactly what he did.</span> <span id="s453">And he was killed in that position because they took the whole office as hostages -- as hostage and he was killed.</span> <span id="s454">At that time I was working in the underground and my -- I think I talk about this in my -- in my oral history.</span> <span id="s455">And the head of our network came to Chatahou where I was functioning and told me that Mr. So and So had been killed and we better go and rescue the daughters.</span> <span id="s456">Well, he didn’t know it was my uncle and I indeed got my two cousins out of the boarding school.</span> <span id="s457">They have recently told me that they didn’t know whether it was a trap or whether it was really me that had called them.</span> <span id="s458">And they only told me this about 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And wh-where do they live now?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: In France.</span> <span id="s461">[indecipherable] me get back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: So they both survived because I placed them in a safe place.</span> <span id="s464">I remember exactly how we changed the name and all that, that’s not relevant.</span> <span id="s465">And the war was over, they were left without any parents, deeply affected by what happened to their parents.</span> <span id="s466">And in addition, the young one of the two got TB and so she had to be isolated in some treatment kind of -- an-and they lived with my very bitter uncles and aunts to -- who never married.</span> <span id="s467">And to escape, they went into 180 degree turn and not only with my oldest cousin -- I mean, the older of the two cousins, become a professor of German.</span> <span id="s468">Yes, it’s really incredible, she studied German.</span> <span id="s469">She became a Communist.</span> <span id="s470">She married a non-Jew in the same kind of political orientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: French?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: French.</span> <span id="s473">He became a very -- they -- they -- they dropped their Communism in -- very soon in ba -- but they have remained very Socialist oriented, very Leftist kind of thing.</span> <span id="s474">And he achieved a very, very high position in the French government , in -- an incredibly important position.</span> <span id="s475">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Do you want to mention what it is, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I’d rather not.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: And he -- they -- the -- he’s not Jewish and she’s severed all her relationship to family.</span> <span id="s480">This is how she’s been af -- to -- to the -- to the -- the extended family, she really severed all her relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: How -- and how-- how s -- how much severed?</span> <span id="s482">I mean, you don’t speak to her any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Oh, I do.</span> <span id="s484">But th-the uncles and aunts, she s-separated her -- I mean I was in the cou -- in this country, you know, so I -- she didn’t sever herself from me.</span> <span id="s485">After the war, I -- I still was in touch with her, but she married this non-Jew and she cut herself off from the fam -- from -- there were uncles and aunts and my parents.</span> <span id="s486">She just separated herself [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: For what reason?</span> <span id="s488">I don’t -- I’m not sure if I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Well, she didn’t want to have anything to do with Judaism.</span> <span id="s490">My family was the traditional Jew -- my family and -- I mean, extended family, that the ones that were left represented.</span> <span id="s491">They also represented the war, they represented the loss of her father, of her mother.</span> <span id="s492">They -- they represented -- I have never asked her what made her do all these things, but I see a -- a complete lose -- wanting to loosen herself up from the things Jewish, totally.</span> <span id="s493">And I’ve stayed with her and I’ve talked with her for a long time, but that’s something else I’ll talk to you about you later.</span> <span id="s494">I -- I really have had ver -- little relationship with my family in France and it’s only in recent years that I have -- well, recent -- not quite -- not -- maybe the last 20 years or so that I have really intensively reconnected and with a great deal of pleasure.</span> <span id="s495">But so, when you say, did they lose their belief in God?</span> <span id="s496">I don’t know what belief they lost, bu -- la -- they certainly lost their -- any belief in -- in things Jewish.</span> <span id="s497">Her sister married a Jewish man eventually.</span> <span id="s498">Somebody much older than herself and sh -- he died of Parkinson’s disease very young, and she -- and she also last -- lost all contact -- she ha -- c-continued the contact with the family, but Judaism she completely put aside.</span> <span id="s499">And her son married a non-Jewish person and her ch -- grandchildren are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s500">Interesting enough, now that she’s retired -- and she became a social worker -- now that she’s retired, she has, in a very -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s501">Intellectual, secular way, reconnected to -- to things Jewish.</span> <span id="s502">She studies and she’s interest in groups.</span> <span id="s503">Not for observers -- observance as much as for unders -- of -- of thinking, you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s504">My other two -- I mean and I -- air -- I can go down the line, I have six cousins like that and their ties to Judaism have loosened a great deal.</span> <span id="s505">And if they haven’t, I have two male cousins and they have married Jewish girls, but their own children, except for one, are -- no longer have any tie with -- but you know, I don’t know whether the effect of the war, or whatever it is, but whatever I have read about statistics is that they -- this is very typical of the Jewish population in France.</span> <span id="s506">So, whether the war had -- o-of the old Jewish population, now there is an influx of observance brought in by the Sephardic Jews from North Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: So I -- I don’t know if I answer your question, why my brother and I remained very committed Jews, I don’t know, except that probably it has more to do with the intensity with -- and maybe also my mother brought a great deal of knowledge to what we were doing.</span> <span id="s509">Because I was always an inquisitive kind of kid, I’d say.</span> <span id="s510">When my mother said, “You can’t do this,” or “you can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s511">I’d say, “Why?”</span> <span id="s512">And if she couldn’t the answer, I would go to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s513">And it was very funny.</span> <span id="s514">Last -- last Friday night we had some friends here who -- from -- dear old friends from Cleveland, who came through here and something came up at Kiddush time and I -- this -- this friend of mine, gen -- this is an American friend, said, “Will you tell me why some women put -- make such s -- gestures, some incantation kinds of gestures before you light the candle?”</span> <span id="s515">And I knew the answer, you know, because the whys go back, early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Because what -- because what?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Because why -- asking why --</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I always ask my mother what --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So what is the answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Oh, you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: When -- in Judaism, you always say a blessing before you do something.</span> <span id="s524">So, before you drink wine, you say a blessing.</span> <span id="s525">Before you eat bread, you say a blessing.</span> <span id="s526">When you light the candles, you do the thing first, because -- and then you do the blessing, right?</span> <span id="s527">Right?</span> <span id="s528">This is the [indecipherable], because you cannot do the blessing and then light the candle, because it would be Shabbat already and you cannot -- and you cannot do -- light the candles on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s529">So you use a little fiction.</span> <span id="s530">You light the candle first, you close your eyes, you haven’t seen the flame yet.</span> <span id="s531">You say the blessing and lo and behold, here is the flame.</span> <span id="s532">All you have to do is close your eye.</span> <span id="s533">But, I think it has become like a -- a -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s534">My mother didn’t do that, she just closed her eyes and said the blessing.</span> <span id="s535">But in eastern European tradition, it has become putting a shawl over your head and closing your eyes and doing a -- which I don’t do, because I understand why it’s -- I’m -- I’m a very literal girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: So, going back to early child -- to my early years, I’ve always wanted to know.</span> <span id="s538">And I guess this is a personal kind of thing and I -- my cousin may not have had that.</span> <span id="s539">But whatever reason it is, they have cut themself off from -- from things Jewish.</span> <span id="s540">I have another cousin and -- and I -- I love them dearly and we get along very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: H-How does it affect you personally, to see this -- these -- these elements in the Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: In -- in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s544">And -- and within your family also.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: In my family here, in -- in [indecipherable] amongst my peers now, there is hardly a grandparent who doesn’t have a non-Jewish grandchild.</span> <span id="s546">It is -- it is the norm here.</span> <span id="s547">I’m rather the exception, I should say.</span> <span id="s548">It makes me very sad.</span> <span id="s549">It makes me sad, but at the same time, I feel the Jewish people’s going to survive.</span> <span id="s550">I mean, there has been -- the only worry I have is that the other Orthodox are going to make it survive and I -- this is not where -- that’s not where my heart is and that’s not where my beliefs is, for a v -- a variety of reasons, whi --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Well, let’s talk about that.</span> <span id="s552">That’s an interesting point.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I -- I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I don’t know whether that’s relevant to what -- what I can bring to you about m-my post-war experiences, but I do not believe that their search for authentic Judaism is relevant to me.</span> <span id="s556">What they consider authentic, which is the Judaism of the ghetto of the 14th, 15th century, I do not consider that the authentic Judaism and that’s what worries me and all the -- the -- the fences and the adding of -- of the prescriptions [indecipherable] Judaism.</span> <span id="s557">To me that’s not authentic Juda -- whatever authentic Judaism is, I’m sure that Moses today would not recognize the ultra Orthodox in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s558">He wouldn’t rec -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s560">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: -- prescriptions [indecipherable] Judaism.</span> <span id="s562">To me that’s not authentic Juda -- whatever authentic Judaism is, I’m sure that Moses today would not recognize the ultra Orthodox in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s563">He wouldn’t recognize them as Jews, you know, if he went -- coming down to earth today.</span> <span id="s564">And so this is what -- I’m just only worried that -- that the Judaism would be changed into something that is a Judaism of the ghettos, the Judaism of -- o-of -- of -- not of this world.</span> <span id="s565">I mean, they isolate themself.</span> <span id="s566">To me, my Judaism has to be lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Now which -- which groups of Jewish people are you specifically talking about when you say the ul-ultra Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I’m talking about th-the ultra Orthodox in Israel, the -- I’m talking about the Orthodox in this countries, who -- who -- who distinguish themselves by the way of dressing, by their -- th-their [indecipherable] life.</span> <span id="s569">They are not of this world.</span> <span id="s570">I want to -- have to stop, may I?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s572">Let’s take a little break.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Now, it’s not so much the break, I have to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Yeah, well I do too.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s576">[indecipherable][break].</span> <span id="s577">The important thing is, I want to re-rethink the way I have approached this, but I -- I’m -- I’m -- I’m ready to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Wh-What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Well, this whole question about Judaism and I -- because it’s been very im -- an important search for me, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Oh, are we on?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s585">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Oh, I didn’t know I was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: No, no, I just turned it back on.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Well, coming from this very traditional -- coming from this very traditional background, and marrying here, in this country, Jewish man, who’d rai -- been raised fairly traditionally in Germany, there’s no question that I was going to have a Jewish home.</span> <span id="s589">But I was searching and of course, when I came here as a student, I had discovered Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism, all kinds of formulas which -- which I was not familiar.</span> <span id="s590">And don’t forget, I had had five years of war -- of really living as a Catholic as well and cut off -- although I do remember even living as a Catholic, we had a very clandestine seder and -- and a -- and all kinds of -- I have never really been away from Judaism, even when I was living as a Catholic.</span> <span id="s591">And as soon as the war was over, I was back into a l -- being the head of a Jewish children’s home and instilling a love of Judaism and teaching and training the kids and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s592">When I came to this country, I discovered this other formulas and I just observed, I wasn’t really becoming a part of any of this.</span> <span id="s593">And I got married in a traditional Jewish ceremony in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s594">My parents -- I -- small apartment, because after the war they had lost everything and they were sharing apartment with somebody else, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s595">But we got married in a synagogue and came back here and we joined a Conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s596">Our home -- I did not keep a kosher home, but kept a -- oh, a very traditional oriented ka -- ya -- obs -- nee -- at least observing Friday night and attending services on and off.</span> <span id="s597">It was not a same commitment that I had before, until about almost 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s598">Well, I’ll be married 50 years next year, so it’s about 48 or 49 years ago.</span> <span id="s599">I heard a lecture by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionism and he really expressed for me a direction for me to go into.</span> <span id="s600">It was a very revealing kind of lecture.</span> <span id="s601">I still have the notes that I took.</span> <span id="s602">He defined -- as you know, Reconstruction, it defines Judaism as a dynamic, religious civilization.</span> <span id="s603">God as the power that makes for salvation.</span> <span id="s604">And I began to read Rabbi Kaplan.</span> <span id="s605">I began to subscribe to Reconstructionist magazine.</span> <span id="s606">And it opened to me a whole m -- way of living my Judaism in a more creative and in a more -- in a happier way.</span> <span id="s607">My childhood was full of don’t, and it’s a sin and all the forbidding kinds of thing.</span> <span id="s608">One of the strongest phrases that remains in my memory, is in Kaplan’s writing, he talks about reading into the Torah, or reading out of it.</span> <span id="s609">And I grew up where everybody read into the Torah because -- this is repeated three times and this is -- were -- this is -- has a meaning and usually the meaning ended up in some forbidden to do this and forbidden to do that, etcetera.</span> <span id="s610">[indecipherable] Rabbi Kaplan talks about reading into the Torah, reading into the teaching of the Torah itself, the text itself.</span> <span id="s611">And doing things in a more creative ways.</span> <span id="s612">And so after that, this is -- this has been my -- my direction.</span> <span id="s613">And especially with our children.</span> <span id="s614">We -- we -- they all -- they all attended Conservative synagogues.</span> <span id="s615">They all went to Jewish camps.</span> <span id="s616">They went to Camp Ramah, they went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: What’s it called, Camp what?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Camp Ramah.</span> <span id="s619">These are the -- the camps of the Conservative movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s621">How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: R-a-m-a-h.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And where is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Oh, they’re all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Happened to be -- this one happened to be in Canada, but -- and it’s -- to this day -- to this day I am looking for ways to enhance Judaism in this world, by blending in with all life here today.</span> <span id="s627">I don’t know how to say it, but I’m always looking for ways of making my Judaism more meaningful and more joyous, happy with -- with creative things.</span> <span id="s628">So we were very fortunate because -- well, in c -- we first lived in Cleveland, my husband and I. I -- I graduated from Western Reserve and my husband was still attending school at Case.</span> <span id="s629">We settled in Cleveland after we got married, which is 1949 and I’m -- my first job was as a director of a Jewish day nursery, which was Jewish day care center, affiliated with the Jewish [indecipherable] in Cleveland, which was a top notch agency.</span> <span id="s630">And this is where, eventually, I got my training, also in child therapy.</span> <span id="s631">M-My degree is in social work.</span> <span id="s632">I had gotten my degree at Western Reserve.</span> <span id="s633">But I specialized in early childhood, because in France I already had a degree in early childhood, so I combined the two and I specialized in that.</span> <span id="s634">And little by little, I developed my skills in -- in working for, or in behalf, or with young children.</span> <span id="s635">And we joined a synagogue, a Conservative synagogue and I think I have taken -- so have -- adult -- my husband, too, we have taken adult education classes all our lives, in -- in the various synagogues and I learned more about Reconstructionism.</span> <span id="s636">I’ve -- I have -- I have read a great deal about this.</span> <span id="s637">In Cleveland, we belonged to such a huge congregation, like 2,000 families, that it was very difficult to form any meaningful relationships.</span> <span id="s638">And although -- I was working, raising kids and we had a real struggle when we first started here.</span> <span id="s639">I didn’t have a penny to my name, my husband had not a penny to his name.</span> <span id="s640">We lived in two rooms -- not two room apartment, a -- a -- not two bedroom apartment, two room apartment, upstairs, raising a kid.</span> <span id="s641">We eventually got a house.</span> <span id="s642">It -- the financial struggle was -- was rough and after I had my first child, I stayed home for four years, although I worked part time on the side.</span> <span id="s643">But what I did was, I worked as a Sunday school teacher on Sundays, just to get away from the house and leave a child to daddy.</span> <span id="s644">And I taught second grade Sunday school, which I’d never done before, but it provided me also with a tie to the Temple and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s645">We left Cleveland at the time our oldest son was ready to be Bar Mitzvah and my husband was transferred to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s646">And had to join the existing Conservative synagogue there, because he had to be Bar Mitzvah -- I mean, that was his [indecipherable] and -- but we were very unhappy with the establishment synagogue, with -- with -- we -- it was so rote -- it was so uncreative, but we went, you see?</span> <span id="s647">I -- we schlepped our kids there and we went and we made no exception to this kind of thing, until we discovered that in the suburb of Syracuse called Dewitt, they were creating a new Conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s648">We were younger in those days, although we were much older than the general age of the congregation, we just -- I -- I have to tell you that story.</span> <span id="s649">I read about this congregation, then I found out what time their Friday night service are and we went with our kids on Friday night.</span> <span id="s650">And the rabbi, though very rigidly observant, nevertheless, he had a -- a way of teaching, a way of making the service interesting.</span> <span id="s651">But he had passed mimeographed sheets with some special readings or discussion point or whatever it was that Friday night and I was ecstatic about something.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: What year was this, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: ‘66?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: ‘66.</span> <span id="s656">And I was ecstatic about that.</span> <span id="s657">My son always tells me, “Mom was converted by a mimeographed sheet.”</span> <span id="s658">Because I wanted -- I -- I -- I didn’t want this road service, this -- this dead service and I wanted something creative in there.</span> <span id="s659">And [indecipherable] we joined, because by then they -- you see, when we came first, I couldn’t join, because my son had to have his Bar Mitzvah and they -- they had just created -- they only had a fir -- kindergarten or a first grade in religious school.</span> <span id="s660">But that was okay for our second son, because they are six years apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: What -- what are their names, the boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: The -- the synagogue is called --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: No, no, your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Oh, the oldest is Peter and the second one is Robert.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: And you have a daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Just two boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Two boys.</span> <span id="s669">They are six years apart.</span> <span id="s670">And among them they have five children.</span> <span id="s671">And the oldest has two girls and the second one has two girls and a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: And tell me the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Tell me the names of the grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: The grandchildren -- the older -- the -- the oldest -- Peter’s daughters are Abigail and Rebecca and Robert’s kid --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And ho-how old are they now?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Abby is 11.</span> <span id="s678">She already has a Bat Mitzvah date for the year 2000.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Rebecca is eight and then in ro -- Robby has Elanna, who’s going to be 11 in October.</span> <span id="s681">David, who is eight and Amy, who is f-five half.</span> <span id="s682">But anyway, we left the big synagogue where our oldest son had been.</span> <span id="s683">He is a high achiever and so he had won every prize in there and every scholarship and every da-da.</span> <span id="s684">He was the head of -- president of the class or whatever it was and it was a great big shock that we left.</span> <span id="s685">But we were so happy at this new synagogue.</span> <span id="s686">They -- they were meeting and the little building and -- it -- it -- they were living on shoestring, but my husband volunteered to work on an architectural search committee and before he knew it he was the h-head of the building committee and before he knew it, he built a synagogue and I got involved with children, with the education committee, with the richman commit -- education enrichment has always been my -- my thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Education enrichment?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Adult education particularly, but in those days also education, so I always [indecipherable] of education and then I -- I did everything, including dusting and everything in that syn -- it was our synagogue, it was our -- it -- it -- it was ours and the -- the rabbi, a-as I said, he was bul -- in spite of his rigidity, but he was a teacher.</span> <span id="s691">He enhanced the service with -- with things that were meaningful to us and we -- our -- our involvement with the congregation really blossomed during these 19 years we lived in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s692">And we miss it tremendously.</span> <span id="s693">But this has given my Judaism it’s -- wh-what it is today, this search for -- for meaningful ways of -- of -- of -- of living my -- my Jewish life.</span> <span id="s694">Now, it’s no longer the Judaism that my parents had.</span> <span id="s695">I’m not limited by the don’ts of the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s696">I’m not limited, I’m -- I know there is one inconsistency with me, I don’t keep kosher.</span> <span id="s697">And it’s been a little struggle for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Can you tell me about it?</span> <span id="s699">Wh-Wh-Why did you make that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: It -- originally it was my rebellion against the -- the things at home and I just have never had the strength and courage to go back [indecipherable] was some -- it -- it’s very difficult to define my position, but it’s just --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And how -- how does your husband feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Oh he’s -- he -- it’s okay with -- he is by far not -- by far not -- doesn’t have the education that I’ve had, because he grew up as a -- the only Jewish child in his German village.</span> <span id="s703">His brother was 10 years older than he was, he had left.</span> <span id="s704">He lost his father when he was four.</span> <span id="s705">His mother was left a widow very young and he was the baby child at home.</span> <span id="s706">His sister was married already.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: What happened to his father?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: His father died when he was four.</span> <span id="s709">His brother had left, his sister had married, he was alone, he was at school, he was victimized.</span> <span id="s710">Couldn’t get a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s711">But he has very emotional tie to his Judaism, but he doesn’t have the -- what shall I say, the -- the intellectual knowledge that goes with it, so he -- he d -- he doesn’t have the fluency that I have.</span> <span id="s712">But we do things together and as a family.</span> <span id="s713">I mean, I never go to services alone, we go together and we have made that commitment together and we have taken classes together, but he certainly -- he doesn’t have the Hebrew knowledge or the -- the knowledge that I -- that was given to me when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s714">So, no, that’s not as important to him.</span> <span id="s715">But we -- but he certainly was devoted and dedicated to that synagogue and we attended service on a totally regular basis and we were -- we were -- this was our extended family.</span> <span id="s716">This was our -- we have no family in this country.</span> <span id="s717">I have no one.</span> <span id="s718">Now, my husband has a sister and he had a brother who died.</span> <span id="s719">He’s 10 years older than my husband, he died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s720">But the sister lives in New York, the brother never -- had [indecipherable] such a close relationship and so for all practical purposes, we don’t have family here.</span> <span id="s721">My children don’t have grandparents here -- don’t have grandpare -- I mean, I took -- I took them to France to see my paren -- my parents were able to pay our trip, because we didn’t have a penny to our name.</span> <span id="s722">And so, between my brother and my parents, they send for us so they could meet the grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s724">Well, le-let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s725">I’m not sure if -- if this is really an answerable question.</span> <span id="s726">But this evolution of your Judaism and your relationship to the religion may have taken the course it took anyway, but can you identify or can you discuss at all how some of the experiences you had during the war might have affected this?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: I don’t think it’s re -- it’s related to the experiences I had during the war.</span> <span id="s728">It’s much more a personal journey and a -- and -- and a personal course, coming from -- actually I was even more observant than my parents at one time during my teenage years.</span> <span id="s729">You know, teenagers can go one way or the other.</span> <span id="s730">And I was, you know, I was even more observant than my parents and I -- I threw away the rigidity and -- so it’s -- I -- I think it’s more of a personal j-journey, a personal search to be as Jewish as my parents, but in a different kind of way.</span> <span id="s731">I don’t believe it is related to the ho -- if anything, I was exposed during -- particularly during my camp experience, my early on -- as you recall, I was a volunteer internee social worker in one of the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: In Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: In Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: And I was very young.</span> <span id="s736">I ha-had no life experien -- I was 21 years old when I got there.</span> <span id="s737">And here were adults, interned in a camp.</span> <span id="s738">They already -- some of them had already been interned for a year by the time I got there.</span> <span id="s739">I met them.</span> <span id="s740">So I had lived in these inhuman conditions, which I describe in my early interview.</span> <span id="s741">And there was a rabbi -- I remember vividly, there were teachers.</span> <span id="s742">There were very observant [indecipherable] they were non-observant people.</span> <span id="s743">But, from the people who remained committed to their Judaism in some way -- I remember holiday celebrations in the camp, or Shabbat celebration, that I remember having a very positive kind of affect on me, that these people, under the circumstance on which they live, they remained Jewish.</span> <span id="s744">And maybe so it had -- could have had a positive affect on me, rather than the opposite.</span> <span id="s745">And I -- as far as throwing away some of the -- the shackles of religion, I -- I was try to replace them by something more meaningful to me and more positive.</span> <span id="s746">And I th -- and I’m still doing it right now, every minute, thinking of moving from one congregation to another, because a new one is being created right here, in Chapel Hill.</span> <span id="s747">And there are young people and I don’t even know if we’ll belong, because they haven’t gelled yet.</span> <span id="s748">But they’re searching for something creative.</span> <span id="s749">They’re searching for a service that is gender sensitive, which is very important to me.</span> <span id="s750">Because in Syracuse, too, when the -- when Conservative Judaism made it permissible for women to be included and the minyan to be counted and to put this in the service, I -- I was at the head of that movement in my congregation.</span> <span id="s751">I was the first woman to lead services in our congregation.</span> <span id="s752">And so I -- we are looking into this new congregation and next Shabbat I’m doing the service there, because they don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s753">And I thought I would never do it again.</span> <span id="s754">But it is exciting to help a group of --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: You thought you would never do what again?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: You thought you would never do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Leading services, I -- I don’t even have a voice to speak of, but it is nice to be able to provide some help of some people who are seeking to create their own thing and to live their Judaism in -- in a way that is meaningful to them.</span> <span id="s759">And so at first when they -- when I showed an interest and I said, “I want my -- I want something ready made.</span> <span id="s760">At my age -- I’m 78 years old, I’m wa -- I don’t want to create things any more.”</span> <span id="s761">And we’ve attended their services and they were willing to -- to understand things and to learn and particularly -- and I’m very, very -- what’s very important to me is that the services -- the Hebrew text, not just the English text -- be gender sensitive.</span> <span id="s762">[indecipherable] a big issue for me.</span> <span id="s763">Um -- a big issue, it’s an important issue.</span> <span id="s764">And -- and also that service -- that we have time for meaningful discussion during the service and that -- on the Torah reading, that kind of thing is important to me.</span> <span id="s765">And so here I am, still as excited at 78 as I was in earlier years as a girl scout, to find ways of doing things at a camp.</span> <span id="s766">This has remained -- this has kept young in me and important to me.</span> <span id="s767">So, next Saturday, in that new congregation, I will participate.</span> <span id="s768">Th-This is not a program I had -- I can just stand up and do it, you know, I don’t have to prepare, or read or anything, this has been part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s770">And this is a Conservative congregation [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s772">Ah, they don’t know yet exactly what they’re going --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: They don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: They -- they’re si -- they’re neutral as is -- [indecipherable] seek an identity, but I think it’s going in to a very liberal kind of Conservative Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: There’s a -- a few things I want to go back -- I mean, it has kind of an unusual shape, I think, of this interview [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes it is, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: But I -- but I’m enjoying it.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Be-Because this is the last of the things that I would have expected to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: But all of them are important and there are a few more things I want to ask you about.</span> <span id="s780">Well, there’s one question I want to ask you that -- which was -- we started to get to about before the war.</span> <span id="s781">And -- I think one of the most important things that you brought up -- to me, anyway, was the question that you said you’ve been asked many times, which is -- wh-why did you -- yourself and the others who -- who did what you did, do it?</span> <span id="s782">And I think all of these things are related.</span> <span id="s783">I think that the relationship that you had with your parents and the relationship that you had with your religion.</span> <span id="s784">I mean your relationship with the scouting movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: I think all of those things are part of it and I -- so I -- I don’t think that I’m going the wrong direction by asking you these things.</span> <span id="s787">But one of the things that’s really, really difficult for me to understand -- I’m 43 -- is to understand -- and I don’t know if you can help me with this or not; wh-when I -- I asked you about the relationship between the Jews and the non-Jews in your city and you said ba-basically it wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: For me personally, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Was -- everybody got along pretty well?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Oh, I heard about -- I heard about -- talk about the big word and -- we used in my family for anti-Semitism is called rischous.</span> <span id="s791">Now, I don’t know the origin of that word, ec-except rusha means a bad guy.</span> <span id="s792">So rischous, maybe it come from -- I -- I don’t know, but this is the word that my family used in -- in Judeo Alsatian [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s793">And I heard a lot about it and -- and my family had -- my parents knew about the affaire Dreyfuss and -- you know, the very famous anti-Semitic thing.</span> <span id="s794">And they had lived through that and they were exposed to that and -- and I heard about it, but personally, I didn’t read the newspapers, so I didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s795">I was so focused on -- on my school and on my activities and this was not the -- the youth of today dating and going out on Saturda --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: But -- but -- well, I -- I gue -- the thing that’s -- that’s -- that’s -- seems impossible for me to comprehend is, what was the progression in the pre-war and the early years of the war, in your understanding of what was exactly taking place and why it was taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: You know, I think when you’re faced with a matter of life and death -- and it was a matter of survival, you don’t think about why the things are happening, you are -- you’re doing something to survive and you see people as -- either you’re helping or aga -- or they’re against you, you know, and I -- there was the people in the Resistance, the people who helped you with the papers, the people who help you with the thing and the others.</span> <span id="s798">And that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s799">So you worked with those who helped and you tried to defend yourself against the others.</span> <span id="s800">You didn’t think why did he and why did she do tha --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: That’s not what I’m asking you.</span> <span id="s802">What I’m a -- what I’m asking you is even a harder question to answer, I think, which is what was your perception about why the Jews were being singled out and rounded up and -- and put in camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: You know, I lived on the border of Germany.</span> <span id="s804">You had to just cross the Rhine and you were in Germany.</span> <span id="s805">I could spit across if -- if the Rhine was too wide.</span> <span id="s806">Never [indecipherable] there on th -- never went into Germany.</span> <span id="s807">But part of my background is this his-historical thing that Jews were always persecuted.</span> <span id="s808">And this is what Holocaust Museum is showing us.</span> <span id="s809">And th-this is why -- actually, I don’t want to lose my train of thought, but I’m rebelling against this a little bit, at this stage of my life.</span> <span id="s810">I feel that we need to teach people -- and our children, particularly, the achievement of the Jews, before we talk about the persecutions.</span> <span id="s811">And that’s why -- we talked early, at what age do you tell a child about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s812">Well, that child has to be grounded in what Jews -- what Judaism is all about and what they have achieved, before you tell them about all the persecutions through the centuries and particularly the last one.</span> <span id="s813">So, but that’s a different kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: But -- but that’s an important issue, because one of the things that I -- that I want you to share, is that -- is that perception, what you think of the hol -- is another whole topic that I want to bring up, which is, what do you think of the general approach to dealing with the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Well, I -- on that I have some specific thoughts, because I’ve been very much involved in that -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s817">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: -- before we talk about the persecutions.</span> <span id="s819">And that’s why -- we talked early, at what age do you tell a child about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s820">Well, that child has to be grounded in what Jews -- what Judaism is all about and what they have achieved, before you tell them about all the persecutions through the centuries and particularly the last one.</span> <span id="s821">So, but that’s a different kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: But -- but that’s an important issue, because one of the things that I -- that I want you to share, is that -- is that perception, what you think of the hol -- is another whole topic that I want to bring up, which is, what do you think of the general approach to dealing with the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Well, I -- on that I have some specific thoughts, because I’ve been very much involved in that.</span> <span id="s824">And I -- indeed, coming back to your earlier question, I lived -- I lived next door to Germany, so what was happening in Germany, from the late 20’s on, from the rise of Hitler, it was part of my growing up years.</span> <span id="s825">I remember April -- was it April first, 1933, when we had a -- a solemn service in our synagogue in Strasbourg, because -- exactly what the date was that Hitler was starting the Nuremberg laws or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s826">I mean the restrictions on Jew and Hitler being installed.</span> <span id="s827">And we began to have lot of Jewish refugees come into the city and all of that.</span> <span id="s828">So, it was not happening overnight.</span> <span id="s829">It was something that -- although I thought it would never happen in France -- French people don’t do things like that.</span> <span id="s830">My parents probably thought differently, bu -- although they took absolutely no presh -- measures to protect themself from anything.</span> <span id="s831">My father, confident in his status of a loyal French citizen, n -- continued his business to the last day, never put a penny aside, never -- never did anything.</span> <span id="s832">But I grew up with the awareness that indeed, it can happen to the Jews.</span> <span id="s833">And I know the history of the Jew.</span> <span id="s834">So, it just was one -- it just crossed the Rhine.</span> <span id="s835">It just came gradually.</span> <span id="s836">So ‘33 -- this is ‘39, six years, it came gradually.</span> <span id="s837">And then after that, it was just fighting for your survival, you know, it just -- and fighting for the survival of others, for some of us who got involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s839">Did tho -- how there -- there’s one -- I want you to clarify something for me, because I didn’t quite understand it in your -- your interview, about the camp in -- how do you pronounce it?</span> <span id="s840">Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: That -- this was a -- this was a camp for foreign Jews who had immigrated to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: In France there were many Jews who had come from eastern Europe, many.</span> <span id="s844">Because France was very -- always been very easy -- France was always a country for refugees.</span> <span id="s845">The literature is full of the refugees who came from fra -- the White Russians, the -- you know?</span> <span id="s846">For ev -- all countries.</span> <span id="s847">And from the French colonies and so on.</span> <span id="s848">But mostly there were lots -- lots of Jews from eastern Europe who came.</span> <span id="s849">It’s very easy to get into France.</span> <span id="s850">That’s never been a problem.</span> <span id="s851">But to become a citizen, that’s the pro -- and even if you’re born in France, at least in those days -- I don’t know what the law is today, it’s changed over the years, but I don’t know what it is today.</span> <span id="s852">You were not a citizen, being born in France.</span> <span id="s853">If your parents had not acquired citizenship, you were a foreign Jew.</span> <span id="s854">So as soon as the war started, the authorities -- no, nos -- no, not as -- when the war started, as soon as France lost the war and was occupied by Germany, they rounded up all the Jews who had not French citizenship.</span> <span id="s855">Now, that includes people like my sister-in-law, who was born in France, of Polish parents.</span> <span id="s856">She and her entire family were in Rivesaltes, because her parents had not acquired citizenship.</span> <span id="s857">She spoke French.</span> <span id="s858">She was born in France.</span> <span id="s859">Her par -- her father was deported as forced labor, whatever that meant.</span> <span id="s860">He may have been sent to Auschwitz directly, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s861">Her brother joined the French underground.</span> <span id="s862">He escaped the camp, he went into French underground.</span> <span id="s863">He was killed in the French underground, on that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s864">He was born in France.</span> <span id="s865">The mother survived and she and her younger brother survived, because we placed them with ame -- ame -- in hiding and my sister-in-law was placed with my family.</span> <span id="s866">That’s how she came to marry my brother.</span> <span id="s867">And -- but she was foreign born.</span> <span id="s868">Who were the other forei -- who were the other foreign Jews?</span> <span id="s869">There were the Jews from the Rhineland, in Germany.</span> <span id="s870">There’s the whole -- the -- the whole Jewery that lived along the Rhine, which were in -- in -- in earlier days very prominent Jewish communities.</span> <span id="s871">They were all deported to France.</span> <span id="s872">Is this the only westward deportation in the history of World War Two.</span> <span id="s873">All the deportations were east.</span> <span id="s874">The Jews from Rhineland were deported into the south of France and promptly picked up by the French whatever -- police or militia or whatever and put into these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: How many camps were there?</span> <span id="s876">A: There were -- I don’t know, between 12 - 15 camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: And how many people you think were in each one?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Very bad at statistics, but in the thousands.</span> <span id="s879">And I -- I have books to show you and --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: -- whatev -- the figures are.</span> <span id="s882">But then there are the Jews.</span> <span id="s883">You know, France was invaded by the com -- the Germans came through Belgium and Holland to invade France in 1940 -- in May of 1940.</span> <span id="s884">We got caught up in that, because we were living up there.</span> <span id="s885">And the Jews fled Belgium and Holland.</span> <span id="s886">And they arrived in the south of France.</span> <span id="s887">My brother-in-l -- mart -- my husband’s sister and her husband lived in Belgian.</span> <span id="s888">They were caught in that.</span> <span id="s889">H -- the brother-in-law was in a camp in the south of France.</span> <span id="s890">He was able to get out and meet his wife in Marseilles -- she had been going all the way through -- from Belgium, all the way to the south of France, they were able to escape to Cuba and spend the war in Cuba.</span> <span id="s891">You get family sagas you wouldn’t believe when some of us get together.</span> <span id="s892">And so all these people were in camps, some on -- early on, were able to get out with all kinds of papers and all kinds of visas, all kinds of thing.</span> <span id="s893">But the majority were trapped.</span> <span id="s894">They had -- they had no papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: And at the beginning, your role was as a bona fide French Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: As a --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: -- so you were allowed to be free?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: As a bona fide French born Jew, I was relatively free to move.</span> <span id="s899">That doesn’t mean that all Jews in the south of France, because France was divided, we were -- lived in the south -- didn’t have to rig -- register.</span> <span id="s900">My parents had to regi -- everybody had to register with the special o-office of Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s901">Whether I registered or not, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: I don’t have any recollection and nobody asked, so I never know.</span> <span id="s904">I doubt that I did, but I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s905">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s906">Or my parents registered me as a member of the family, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s907">But Jews were registered and I had an uncle who was deported from Paris, a French born citizen who was deported from Paris in the very first convoy, arrested in 1941.</span> <span id="s908">But not because he was -- because of his status, particularly, it was more because some-somebody had attacked some German in Paris or something and they rounded up all the male Jews in this one particular neighborhood and he was among them, he and his father-in-law.</span> <span id="s909">He is on the list of the first convoy to leave for Auschwitz from Drancy in 1942.</span> <span id="s910">So, we didn’t know at the time, but I -- I know now.</span> <span id="s911">I -- he is on the list.</span> <span id="s912">Where were we?</span> <span id="s913">I lost my train of thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Well, you were just explaining to me the set up of the -- of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Oh, so in the camp, so this is -- these are the people who ran the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: And the un -- the general understanding of what happened to people who went to a place like Rivesaltes --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: -- or a camp like that, was it -- were -- were they going go get out or they were going to stay there for the whole war, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Th-They didn’t go into the camp, they were picked up and put into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: And these camps were not prepared for human beings.</span> <span id="s922">They were abandoned army barracks, overrun with bugs and vermin.</span> <span id="s923">There was no running water, there were -- I mean, the most horrible hygienic condition, as I say in my early interview.</span> <span id="s924">And so these people were there in these c-camps, awaiting that some govern -- authority would decide their fate.</span> <span id="s925">Some escaped.</span> <span id="s926">So, they were able to escape, some were able to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: If someone was caught running from the camp, would they be shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: No, not -- th-they wouldn’t be shot, they -- these -- they would be arrested and they would be turned over to the authorities, the Vichy authority, the German authority.</span> <span id="s929">Who -- who -- I mean, they were all working together.</span> <span id="s930">To some authority and they would probably be deported to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: To where?</span> <span id="s932">To Germany?</span> <span id="s933">To Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: To -- to the east.</span> <span id="s935">We didn’t know, in 1942 what that meant.</span> <span id="s936">The human mind couldn’t fathom death machines.</span> <span id="s937">At first we thought they were put to forced labor.</span> <span id="s938">Or resettled in the east.</span> <span id="s939">Resettlement in the east was the -- the euphemism.</span> <span id="s940">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s941">Death camp?</span> <span id="s942">I mean, how can the human mind even fathom such a thing?</span> <span id="s943">So these -- so does that answer your que -- and these were the Jews that were in these camps.</span> <span id="s944">And I -- and there they stayed, until they were deported.</span> <span id="s945">And indeed, as I sa -- reported earlier, in 19 -- the summer of 1942, they start just rounding up people.</span> <span id="s946">And it was to send them to the east.</span> <span id="s947">Some for forced labor, some for -- whatever that meant and some for resettlement.</span> <span id="s948">They were creating communities for Jews there.</span> <span id="s949">I had no idea what it meant.</span> <span id="s950">All I know -- my mind should have been working a little bit better when they took elderly, handicapped people.</span> <span id="s951">You don’t take people to work in the east in that condition.</span> <span id="s952">So, what we didn’t know, that they were gassed right away, upon arrival in Auschwitz and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s953">So, those are the people were in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s954">And in Gersin and in other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: I just want to ask you a few more things, so I understand your own path.</span> <span id="s956">So -- so your role in Rivesaltes was you were working to try to get children out, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Well, not originally.</span> <span id="s958">You see, there were several agencies with international status that had a conference in Nîmes and they -- there was an agreement that the govern -- would -- would permit social workers [indecipherable] social workers to be in these camp to help the popula -- to -- to make life a little easier for them.</span> <span id="s959">They -- they had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s960">The men and women were separated, the wer -- children were with the women, the men were separated.</span> <span id="s961">They lived in filth.</span> <span id="s962">They lived -- they had very little to eat, because the guards took the food and people died of dysentery, died of -- I mean, there are 3000 people died just of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s963">Was a study of malnutrition in the camps.</span> <span id="s964">And the original intent was to improve the conditions in the camps.</span> <span id="s965">ORT, if you know it, is a Jewish organization, brought sewing machines for the women, organized workshops.</span> <span id="s966">I have pictures of, and my -- my sister-in-law’s younger brother worked in one -- in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s967">I mean, they did all -- they did some -- her father, who was a shoemaker, organized a shoe repair shop, and -- and with the -- je -- with the organization, there were non-Jewish organization as well of Jewish ones.</span> <span id="s968">There were very few Jewish ones, allowed us to -- to live in the camp.</span> <span id="s969">And I was in a farm with my parents and one of my scouting leaders got a hold of me -- and I don’t know how she got my address.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: This was Andre Solomon?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: And since she’s dead, I will never know.</span> <span id="s974">And I never asked her how she got ahold of me, now I don’t -- will never know, but she found me and I left and I went to the camp, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: So you had known her a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s977">I -- she was one of my leaders in camp.</span> <span id="s978">She was the leader of the older girl’s club.</span> <span id="s979">In those days, there were -- the -- the older ones started at 18.</span> <span id="s980">Can you imagine today 18 year old girls, girl scouts, you know?</span> <span id="s981">But this was the commitment we had and she was -- she was one of our leaders.</span> <span id="s982">And I knew her and she got ahold of me and so I went to live in the camp.</span> <span id="s983">I was 21 years old when I first started and we -- we tr -- I was in charge originally, to do something on behalf of the kids.</span> <span id="s984">So the first Shabbat I was there, I had, in this big empty barrack, I -- we announced that all -- there would be a program for the kids, a program with nothing.</span> <span id="s985">I mean, nothing -- I mean, nothing.</span> <span id="s986">Singing, what we could do and maybe something like -- and I had 280 kids in that barrack, all ages.</span> <span id="s987">But here again, I had the support of that internee population.</span> <span id="s988">There were teachers, there were rabbi’s, there were professionals of all kinds, doctors.</span> <span id="s989">And they helped.</span> <span id="s990">And they were internee themselves and they had been already in this camp, we -- and this was a tremendous lesson in human values and in -- in -- in human strengths, internal strengths.</span> <span id="s991">I mean, it was incredible for me to see people had lived in these conditions all the -- for all this length and time.</span> <span id="s992">The dignity with which they continue to live, under the very c-condition in which they lived.</span> <span id="s993">They’d had no water to wash, they had no -- I mean, it was awful.</span> <span id="s994">And this is -- this is originally what I did, and I was part of a team that delivered extra rations.</span> <span id="s995">We got, through all the agency, we delivered rations into the ca -- into the barracks and then eventually in a s -- paralleled another -- another part of the team of Ose worked on the liberation of the kids from camp.</span> <span id="s996">And then I participated in taking kids out and -- and helped in that process as well.</span> <span id="s997">They overlapped, kind of thing.</span> <span id="s998">But a book has recently been published by one -- the -- the -- the worker with whom I worked in that camp, and -- but she left before the deportations started, but she set that whole liberation process into movement.</span> <span id="s999">And is very interesting as she -- she wrote the book, she quotes me in the book.</span> <span id="s1000">It’s in French, I don’t know how your French is, and she quotes me.</span> <span id="s1001">There’s a picture of me in the book and it’s a pre -- the book got a -- an award in France.</span> <span id="s1002">And it’s very interesting, she recalls things that I did and said and I have no recollection of them at all.</span> <span id="s1003">We all have very selective memories, so I -- I was interesting to read.</span> <span id="s1004">And at a later date, I would like to tell you a little bit about my reuniting with my coworkers.</span> <span id="s1005">Is this a good time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1007">I think this would be a great time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Well, you know, but it entails a whole other kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1009">I-It’s a whole other chapter of my life in the United States.</span> <span id="s1010">And this reconnecting with the past has been a tremendous thing for me in the last 20 years.</span> <span id="s1011">When I first came here -- well, I came as a student, I went back and then I came, because I’d met my husband, and I really wanted to put everything -- everything behind me.</span> <span id="s1012">I didn’t even speak French to my kids.</span> <span id="s1013">Today I think it was stupid.</span> <span id="s1014">They could be bilingual so easily, but my husband doesn’t speak French and I certainly didn’t want to speak German and my husband doesn’t -- has even forgotten his German.</span> <span id="s1015">He doesn’t want anything to do with anything German.</span> <span id="s1016">So I had worked for the Joint Distribution Committee in Paris for a year, in between my -- getting my degree here and then coming back eventually, because I had to work for my scholarship for -- to repay my scholarship.</span> <span id="s1017">So, I n-never wrote back to anybody, in any of the agencies, not -- I -- I mean, with very few exceptions.</span> <span id="s1018">There are a few people I may have sent a Rosh Hashanah card or something like that.</span> <span id="s1019">And I did go back when -- the first time I went back is in 1952, because my parents made it possible for us to bring their first grandchild -- not their first grandchild, they had already a whole bunch of grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1020">My brother married much younger than I did.</span> <span id="s1021">But bring the American grandchild over.</span> <span id="s1022">And we went over.</span> <span id="s1023">And yes, I saw maybe one or two friends.</span> <span id="s1024">One, I worked with during the -- in -- after the war and she was from my hometown and maybe we met in Paris, and another one, but it was a very social kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1025">I didn’t see any -- or didn’t make a point of seeing any of my worker from the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s1026">I always went to see -- no, I didn -- I must correct that.</span> <span id="s1027">All went -- went to see that one person who was the director of a children’s home, with whom I worked during the war and who after the war became the director of Ose.</span> <span id="s1028">And I continue, even today.</span> <span id="s1029">He’s dead, but his wife is in a nursing home and I still write to her a card on the holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Monsieur Jobe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: And I’m still in touch with her, which is -- and every time we went to Paris, I went to see her.</span> <span id="s1034">But it wasn’t so much to reminisce, it was just because we had -- we’re good friends, you know?</span> <span id="s1035">And so I had -- it’s on the level of friendship, not to talk about the war, or not to talk about anything.</span> <span id="s1036">And other than that, I never talked about my experiences.</span> <span id="s1037">And as a matter of fact, to make sure, I asked my friend from Cleveland, the one who came to visit this [indecipherable] and we -- we -- I was going to say we grew up -- no, we grew our children at the same time.</span> <span id="s1038">We had children the same age and she was a concert scholarship student too, from Italy, who came after me, to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1039">And I barely knew what she did during the war, or -- I -- I sort of know.</span> <span id="s1040">And when we went to visit them a few years ago, in Florida, she says, “What did you actually do during the war?”</span> <span id="s1041">I said, “Oh, come on.</span> <span id="s1042">You know.</span> <span id="s1043">I mean, you’ve known me all these years.”</span> <span id="s1044">She said we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1045">So I had confirmation of the fact that I never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1046">And I entered into a community of German Jews, because my husband is from Germany and through -- because he lived with a German family when I met him, he had room with a German -- German Jewish family and we entered this whole German Jewish community, with which I really had -- with whom I had very little in common -- but you didn’t have to explain things to them, they knew what the score was.</span> <span id="s1047">I didn’t have to tell them about these things.</span> <span id="s1048">They had -- they had not lived -- they had escaped.</span> <span id="s1049">So -- did I tell my children?</span> <span id="s1050">Yes, I’m sure I talked about it.</span> <span id="s1051">They know about it.</span> <span id="s1052">But their dad went through -- but when -- what I went through, I’ve talked to them about these things.</span> <span id="s1053">They knew about it, but I -- other than that, I never, in public talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: So would you -- would you describe this as a conscious decision that you made or was it just a kind of natural evolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Well, it is such a natural evolution that it’s universal.</span> <span id="s1056">And when I talk -- and I thought maybe [indecipherable] in America.</span> <span id="s1057">But when I talked to my friends, my contemporaries and friends, they did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1058">They needed -- as it was a need to -- to forget.</span> <span id="s1059">There was a need to put behind.</span> <span id="s1060">And then there is a change.</span> <span id="s1061">You really need to -- to -- to fill out your past again and to -- to fill out these detail.</span> <span id="s1062">But I -- it is a -- but with me, there was one more thing.</span> <span id="s1063">That was in fran -- my friends in France told me, “Silonce for 30 years.”</span> <span id="s1064">Silence for 30 years.</span> <span id="s1065">And this is -- this is true.</span> <span id="s1066">For 30 years.</span> <span id="s1067">And I think there was something else here.</span> <span id="s1068">There was -- when -- when in it -- when I made an attempt to ac -- to, yeah, explain something sometimes, about the war, or about the war [indecipherable] -- there was such lack of comprehension on the part of people I was talking to, that it shut me off.</span> <span id="s1069">Sometimes very stupid questions.</span> <span id="s1070">I still get them today, these stupid questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Mm-hm, you mentioned them in the other interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: And there was a difficult -- and I -- and I -- I -- it -- it’s amazing, I still do get them occasionally, I mean -- what right -- what rights did they have to arrest you?</span> <span id="s1073">What rights do you have during a war?</span> <span id="s1074">You know, I mean, a teacher asked me those question in front of the students.</span> <span id="s1075">What am I saying, what a stupid ques -- you know?</span> <span id="s1076">It’s this kind of thing that I still get, and there was also -- you have to explain and explain, and if I say -- if in France I say, heevsall, everybody knows what I’m talking.</span> <span id="s1077">If I say AEF, [indecipherable] de France, everybody knows.</span> <span id="s1078">You don’t even say AEF, you say [indecipherable] and everybody knows that is the Jewish scouting movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: And here I have to go into explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: And I -- I just couldn’t -- couldn’t cope with that.</span> <span id="s1083">And -- but coming to this country was a tremendous change for me in every aspect, as -- as you heard, about Judaism, it was different, it was entering a real professional life, because I had a -- a degree.</span> <span id="s1084">Before that I worked, but I didn’t have a real, professional degree.</span> <span id="s1085">That doesn’t mean I did better or worse, it just meant that -- and it was starting a career.</span> <span id="s1086">And frankly and truly, it was a -- a struggle to get ahead and my parents had lost everything, weren’t able to give me any money coming over.</span> <span id="s1087">I think we spend everything they gave me on just buying enough stuff to -- to have a kitchen and a -- and a room and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1088">So, my husband didn’t have his degree yet.</span> <span id="s1089">He went to school at night.</span> <span id="s1090">I had a job on the weekend, a job during the week and -- and I just didn’t dwell on that.</span> <span id="s1091">So -- some of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: So what changed?</span> <span id="s1093">What -- what made you want to start talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: I know exactly when it happened.</span> <span id="s1095">It was in the late -- in the mid 70’s or early seven -- mid 70’s, I cannot quite peg it.</span> <span id="s1096">The council of Jewish women in clee -- in Syracuse, where we lived -- well, people knew that I was from France, that I had done some underground work, or had worked in camp and -- I mean, th-there was some general knowledge, but I had never, sort of really going a -- I think that once sisterhood asked me to participate in a program -- they will have other people who had lived in Europe and I -- I must have sa-said a few word.</span> <span id="s1097">But then, the Council of Jewish women was working with the educators in Syracuse to introduce the Holocaust in their curriculum.</span> <span id="s1098">And now we’re going to a very touchy subject.</span> <span id="s1099">And I was asked to participate.</span> <span id="s1100">This is the first time where I really did something officially, as a witness of the Holocaust, if you wish.</span> <span id="s1101">That’s the best definition I can come, because I don’t view myself as a survivor, I don’t view myself as -- I -- I was a rescuer, but at the same time was also a victim.</span> <span id="s1102">So I always say I’m a witness of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1103">And so I participated in that.</span> <span id="s1104">And then something fantastic happened.</span> <span id="s1105">We separated in two groups.</span> <span id="s1106">One group was younger women, was -- they were mostly women, who wanted to create a group of children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1107">And the other group wanted to meet with teachers and talk about curriculum.</span> <span id="s1108">And I went with the children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1109">And all of a sudden, I find myself much older than these people.</span> <span id="s1110">They were actually mostly professional women, whom I had known in the professional -- my professional li -- had no idea they were Jewish and certainly no idea they were children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1111">And they -- each one of them were talking about their experience -- I’m sure you know the syndrome of children of survivors and how the books have been written about them and I had read the book -- Epstein’s book, “The Children of the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s1112">And, as I listened to them and they asked me where I fit in out of it, I began to tell them of my experience.</span> <span id="s1113">And I cried and I cried.</span> <span id="s1114">I’m still crying today.</span> <span id="s1115">And all of a sudden, the floodgates opened.</span> <span id="s1116">I had never done that before.</span> <span id="s1117">It was like yay, you have a lot of grieving to do.</span> <span id="s1118">You have a lot of unfinished business.</span> <span id="s1119">And they created -- there’s a group, I helped them create it and -- but I didn’t become a part of it, because I was too close to them.</span> <span id="s1120">Although I’m a therapist and I’m a psychiatric social worker.</span> <span id="s1121">And I -- they wanted somebody -- a professional, to lead their group.</span> <span id="s1122">I -- I was -- I was -- I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1123">I was too close to that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1124">But it told me that I had a lot of work to do.</span> <span id="s1125">Now, I didn’t start the next day with task one, two and three, but I allowed myself to -- to let the -- all these memories get into me.</span> <span id="s1126">And I was aware of having been affected by -- by -- by all of these experiences, in very strange ways.</span> <span id="s1127">I would see a program of refugees on the road in Bangladesh or wherever and I’d burst in tears.</span> <span id="s1128">So I know that -- I mean, we were expelled, we fled, we were on the road for -- for days and nights and all of this -- so I knew I had that in me, unresolved.</span> <span id="s1129">And so -- and little by little, I began to talk more about this.</span> <span id="s1130">I accepted.</span> <span id="s1131">I didn’t really do much in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s1132">This was more in the 70’s.</span> <span id="s1133">Maybe I gave a talk or two, maybe at the synago -- I don’t know pr-precisely, but I was able to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1134">And then -- oh, there’s something else happened.</span> <span id="s1135">Since my husband traveled, as he told you, a great deal, internationally, I had the opportunity at one point -- he was working for two weeks in Paris and I must have been able to take two weeks off.</span> <span id="s1136">And I went with him to Paris and for the first time I reconnected with my cousins in Paris, I have four cousins in Paris.</span> <span id="s1137">And I had been -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s1139">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: -- weeks in Paris and I must have been able to take two weeks off.</span> <span id="s1141">And I went with him to Paris and for the first time I reconnected with my cousins in Paris, I have four cousins in Paris.</span> <span id="s1142">And I had been totally cut off from them and two of them were the girls I had hidden and two of them were other cousins and all of them, in some way were connected to me, because after the war they were -- I -- they were in the institutions --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Can go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: They were in the institution and the children’s home where I trained -- they -- they were -- they were part of the staff, they wen -- and in later years I found out they always looked up to me because I was older and because also their parents told -- they also hated me, because their parents say, “Why can’t you do what Simone did?”</span> <span id="s1147">You know, that kind.</span> <span id="s1148">So, a mixed feeling.</span> <span id="s1149">But I really connected.</span> <span id="s1150">We visited.</span> <span id="s1151">In these two weeks, I remember vividly, staying with one of my cousins and all five of us sitting on the floor in this upstairs room and talking about our families.</span> <span id="s1152">The two girls who had loved their parents, my -- they have a perception of my parents, I have a perception of their parents.</span> <span id="s1153">And so family stuff, also.</span> <span id="s1154">The skeletons.</span> <span id="s1155">I remember we had -- they re -- had a perception of my father, I had a perception of their parent and we talked about that.</span> <span id="s1156">And it was therapeutic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Hold on one second, I have to change the tape…this is the beginning of tape two, it’s an interview with Simone Weil Lipman and today is August fourth, 1998.</span> <span id="s1158">And we were talking about some of the -- the way that you began to change your ability and interest in talking about your experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Well, I -- in -- in these trips to France, I remember allowing myself to reconnect with some of -- not only the relatives, but with the people I had worked with during the war, those who were still living.</span> <span id="s1160">And -- and then sharing our memories, on a very one to one basis, the re -- one or the other, one I’d worked in camp with or one I’d worked in the children’s home with and -- and it became -- I became aware that all of a sudden, I wanted to -- to -- to -- to check out my memories and to share them.</span> <span id="s1161">And it felt wonderful, because there I didn’t have the lack of understanding.</span> <span id="s1162">I had instant comprehension, you know, it was -- we were on the same wavelength.</span> <span id="s1163">And we talked and -- now I cannot say that we stayed in touch, because none of us are really corresponding.</span> <span id="s1164">But I fairly frequently went to France, but mostly what happened was that I was able to talk about my experiences here.</span> <span id="s1165">Now, it’s a universal phenomenon for survival, is to not have talked about their experiences for 30 years and it is shared by the people in France and it’s shared by people here.</span> <span id="s1166">It’s a -- it’s -- it’s a universal thing.</span> <span id="s1167">And I had read about the Holocaust, I had read Elie Wiesel’s book.</span> <span id="s1168">Elie Wiesel, by the way, was a kid of Ose, who had been coming to France to -- to -- in 19 -- ever -- I’d -- and I’d -- the end of the war, and he was rescued by Ose, whe -- in one of the children’s homes.</span> <span id="s1169">And the director of that children’s home is one of my very good friends, and so we’ve talked about him.</span> <span id="s1170">And every time I go to Paris I see her and we talk about these kids, we talk about -- we talk about all these things of the past.</span> <span id="s1171">And I think that enabled me to begin to talk about my experiences.</span> <span id="s1172">I’m not sure exactly when, exactly, and with what group, but I had to go through that journey of reconnecting and it really d -- the -- the -- the cath -- the cathartic point was when I had that meeting with this -- this [indecipherable] of survival, when I became aware that -- that all that grieving that I hadn’t done -- nobody had time to grieve, you had to -- you had to go on and that I -- I had to -- to go back in all this experience and talk about them.</span> <span id="s1173">And then, in 1982, we moved to France -- 1983, we moved to France.</span> <span id="s1174">I retired from -- I -- at that time I was on the faculty of the Upstate Medical Center in the Department of Pediatrics and Child Psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1175">And I was in private practice, working with families of young children.</span> <span id="s1176">And I was ready to retire, to say the least.</span> <span id="s1177">And in France, I became very active in the Jewish community in which we lived.</span> <span id="s1178">We lived in Lyon, in -- outside of Lyon, we live in -- in a suburb of Lyon.</span> <span id="s1179">But we became very active again, in creating a Jewish community, but that’s another kind of story.</span> <span id="s1180">Although it’s the same story, but again we were at a nucleus of creating something there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: I -- I think that’s very significant, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Well, we’ve seen in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: I don’t want you to gloss over it, I think it’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Well, what was very important, is that in Judaism is very sterile -- th-the kind -- the kind we encountered in France was very sterile and there was a -- th-there is a tradition of Judaism and people belong, but they don’t go, you know, because there is no alternative.</span> <span id="s1185">And I have two cousins in Lyon and th-they were o-of that branch of totally -- of not knowing what they were doing and having really no significant Jewish life, but belonging to something that is so traditional, that God forbid you don’t change it, kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1186">And there are some -- there is a liberal community in France, it’s called the j -- l-liberal Judaism.</span> <span id="s1187">There’s two -- two -- two flavors.</span> <span id="s1188">But there was nothing in Lyon and somebody found out that we were, quote, not -- I mean, liberal Jews.</span> <span id="s1189">I don’t know what that means in -- in their definition, that we -- that we were welcoming, you know, another form of Judaism.</span> <span id="s1190">I don’t know how it got spread.</span> <span id="s1191">I became very active with the equivalent of Hadassah, I’m a member here of Hadassah, but I have never been a -- that women’s organization kind of -- first of all I was working full time -- not full time, I was working all my life and I just haven’t had -- gave all my extra energy to the synagogue and to it’s various programs.</span> <span id="s1192">I have done so many program.</span> <span id="s1193">A -- that I had nothing left for women’s organization.</span> <span id="s1194">I’m a life member of the National Council of Jewish Women, because I owe them, and -- but I have not been active.</span> <span id="s1195">But in France I became active with the veetsu.</span> <span id="s1196">I ba -- I devised their programs and still today, they are following in my footsteps.</span> <span id="s1197">I managed t-to -- their programs and became very f -- brought somebody to -- to their meetings who became a very dear friend and she’s still active in bringing a program [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1198">But I was a program whatever -- chair or whatever there -- not such ti -- but I activated that very -- that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: And they’re following in my way of doing thing.</span> <span id="s1201">And also in -- in the -- in this Jewish community -- see, France --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Let me ask you a question, ha -- wh-when you refer to yourself or other people refer to you as a -- a liberal Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: In -- I ma -- to -- to what -- what aspects are you referring to?</span> <span id="s1205">Is this -- is this a political liberalism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: It -- it -- it has to do with -- with regard to law -- Jewish law -- I’m not strict with Jewish law --</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: But I’m all -- well, th-the political implication, I don’t know [indecipherable], so I’m talking much more about [indecipherable] about dus -- ame -- observing the fine points of -- of Jewish law, that’s what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1209">But for me, it’s also much more being -- since I view Judaism as having evolved over the centuries, I do not view it as fixed, I view it as a historical Judaism, Conservative Judaism is historical Judaism.</span> <span id="s1210">It views that Judaism has changed over -- over the centuries, according to the ages in which it lived.</span> <span id="s1211">The Judaism of Moses is not the Judaism of Miamanidis and is not the ju -- and is not the Judaism of Rabbi Kaplan or of whoever the chief rabbi in Israel is.</span> <span id="s1212">It’s -- it’s -- it’s evolves constantly and to me that is the important.</span> <span id="s1213">It has to be dynamic, it has to change with the days.</span> <span id="s1214">And in France, it was so rigid when we came back to France.</span> <span id="s1215">The women sitting upstairs, that sits very well with me.</span> <span id="s1216">And the women downs -- the men downstairs and I upstairs and they didn’t even have -- when the Torah reading came, they didn’t have a hamas -- a -- a book to read the Torah reading.</span> <span id="s1217">So I went downstairs and asked one of the men if I could have a hama -- he looked at me as if I were from another planet, you know?</span> <span id="s1218">A women who can follow the Torah reading.</span> <span id="s1219">So, you know, it’s this kind of attitude that say I can’t worship here.</span> <span id="s1220">So, you know, we tried the -- the -- North African community in which we lived, I mean they were even more rigid.</span> <span id="s1221">And then they -- Judaism in France, traditional Judaism does not accept conversions that are not made by Orthodox rabbi -- it’s a little bit like in Israel.</span> <span id="s1222">So there were many converts in -- who had no place to go, so they formed their own liberal mo -- le mouvement liberale juivre de France.</span> <span id="s1223">And -- but they had nobody to lead it.</span> <span id="s1224">So some -- they wanted us to help them and we met at people’s houses.</span> <span id="s1225">And who carried the burden [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1226">So they asked me to become the president.</span> <span id="s1227">I said, “I’m not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1228">I’m an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1229">You can’t have a president who is not a citizen and incorporate this group.</span> <span id="s1230">I don’t -- and I don’t want to be and I’m leaving again.</span> <span id="s1231">I’m not staying here.”</span> <span id="s1232">And they were totally on the wrong tracks.</span> <span id="s1233">But we -- we participated and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: What was the general age of this congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: It wasn’t a -- it was a group of people and we were the only -- I mean, oh, in -- in their 40’s, 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Young-Younger than you?</span> <span id="s1237">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Eee, oh, nobody as old as we were.</span> <span id="s1239">Oh, although my -- we were still working -- no, more 50ish, meta -- the oldest maybe in their 50’s, late 50’s, 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Well, I was younger then, too.</span> <span id="s1242">I was only har -- I was only in my 60’s too, at the time, so yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: And is there a re -- a relationship -- in your belief, in your perception of this interpretation of Jewish law, with -- with being a liberal person and -- and with integrating -- with integrating one’s Judaism and religion with the rest of your life and -- and your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Never thought about it.</span> <span id="s1245">I think -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1246">I hadn’t thought about that.</span> <span id="s1247">I want -- it’s -- it’s interesting, because this new group we are trying to participate with, they want to be all inclusive, t -- and -- and I would like to include them, but also I want -- at the same time I want some -- I want my tradition to remain, s-see what I mean, a -- the things that are important to me.</span> <span id="s1248">To me, the core of -- of thing like -- we have traveled a great deal.</span> <span id="s1249">I have attended service in Istanbul and I’ve attended service in Stockholm and I have attended services all over.</span> <span id="s1250">And to me, this is fantastic, that I can walk in there and I know enough of the service that I can open whatever prayer book they give me.</span> <span id="s1251">It’s always Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1252">The Hebrew is the Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1253">The service is the same, bu -- it’s a -- this -- this -- this fantastic thing that binds Jews from all over the world.</span> <span id="s1254">T-To me this is -- and I -- and I’m very grateful that I have the Jewish knowledge to be able to enjoy this.</span> <span id="s1255">To -- you know, I -- we went with a group of people to istan -- service at Istanbul and of course the women were upstairs.</span> <span id="s1256">What else is new?</span> <span id="s1257">And so I -- I listen, I listen and it’s a different pronunciation and all that, but I know where I am.</span> <span id="s1258">There was a -- one other woman, she was a rabbi’s wife and she found her place too.</span> <span id="s1259">And they all said, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s1260">But you know, for a lifelong attendance at service and it’s -- it’s -- so, what a -- I don’t want this to be destroyed by rigidity.</span> <span id="s1261">I want it to be alive with variety.</span> <span id="s1262">I don’t know what else to say.</span> <span id="s1263">I -- I haven’t put it in words.</span> <span id="s1264">And that’s to me is exciting.</span> <span id="s1265">So, getting into a new group, that’s -- wants to be inclusive and yet at the same time maintain some tradition, that’s what’s important to me, so we tried that, we were not very successful in France, because we were the only ones who really were with any contin -- no, people were floating in and out.</span> <span id="s1266">Eventually, for the high holidays, we went to Geneva, Switzerland, which was an hour and a half away and spent the high holidays there.</span> <span id="s1267">Ah, because they had a very interesting international community there, with a rabbi who was trained in Cincinnati and so we had a very interesting service there and we felt very welcome and they included a lot of English -- English and French in the service.</span> <span id="s1268">And they -- and it was okay.</span> <span id="s1269">See, even though I do understand the -- the -- the Hebrew, I want the -- the secular language to be included.</span> <span id="s1270">To -- to include more people.</span> <span id="s1271">This is too important to me, is to include people.</span> <span id="s1272">So, anyway, so we lived in France and there I all -- there I really connected.</span> <span id="s1273">First of all, Ose, the agency for which I worked, was doing their archives and they send a interviewer to Lyon and I did an oral tape for them, of course in French.</span> <span id="s1274">And the woman with whom I worked in Rivesaltes, who was already at Rivesaltes when I got there -- she was a philosophy student from a completely assimilated family who didn’t even know what Hanukkah was --and, so I don’t know what brought her to the camp, but that’s her problem, not mine.</span> <span id="s1275">And she became the director of Ose.</span> <span id="s1276">And so we got in touch with her, because she read my report and she related to it.</span> <span id="s1277">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Want to tell me her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Vivette Samuel.</span> <span id="s1280">She’s the one who wrote the book, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: And then, we were there when she got the Chevalier de la legion d’honor.</span> <span id="s1283">The Legion of Honor in France, a big ceremony, which I attended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: That was for OSE?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: The honor was for who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: For her -- for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: And so I attended that in Paris and while I was in Paris attending that, I met people who told me, “Don’t you remember?</span> <span id="s1290">Yo -- we met here and you slept in my room there and --” I don’t remember these things.</span> <span id="s1291">But it was wonderful, because all these people were part of my past.</span> <span id="s1292">I -- it was almost like reclaiming a piece of myself.</span> <span id="s1293">And so allowed myself to open up and to -- to hear all these things, to talk about all these things, to cry about these thing.</span> <span id="s1294">So these three years in France, I -- I did that oral history and I -- and I -- I really was able to -- to share a great deal.</span> <span id="s1295">And at the same time, I really reconnected with my cousins.</span> <span id="s1296">And Jew -- they were not -- they -- they be not -- that doesn’t -- I ma -- I -- it was family and we talked about our -- we -- we filled all our holes in our memories about our parents and grandparents and that.</span> <span id="s1297">In the meanwhile, th -- since then, I’ve done a lot of genealogical work out -- one of our sons is very interested in that and he is on the computer and doing all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1298">And so, I have send them all this stuff too and I found a cousin on my father’s side and all this kind of thing has hap -- I mean, he found me, I didn’t find him, he found me.</span> <span id="s1299">And so, all of this has been very, very beneficial to -- to me.</span> <span id="s1300">And so when I came back from France and we settled down here and we joined a congregation, a Conservative one.</span> <span id="s1301">And I joined the educa -- adult education committee, what else?</span> <span id="s1302">And the [indecipherable] committee.</span> <span id="s1303">It was not as satisfactory, because the memories of our congregation in Syracuse are such that we can never duplicate that.</span> <span id="s1304">It was -- you cannot recreate an extended family like that when you’re older than the rest of the peop -- you can no longer move in the same -- in the same way.</span> <span id="s1305">So we, sadly we -- we have not connected in our congregation.</span> <span id="s1306">But, coming back to my work there, I gave several talks.</span> <span id="s1307">I offered to -- because I was part of adult education, I gave a talk about my experiences.</span> <span id="s1308">And this led to my being the Holocaust speaker, maybe about six years ago, seven years ago, I was -- on Yom HaShoah, there is Holocaust day, I was the speaker for this -- the whole Chapel Hill community.</span> <span id="s1309">It was extremely well attended and I was able to di -- I -- I wrote a paper, a -- you know, based on my experience and I mostly talked about what we alluding to before, how do you talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1310">And I had read an article by Rabbi Shulweiss.</span> <span id="s1311">He’s a rabbi in Encino Valley in -- in -- in California.</span> <span id="s1312">And he’s always been one of my gurus, one of the people I like to read.</span> <span id="s1313">He’s very liberal minded and he is -- we actually -- when we were in California -- we took a trip to California about 11 years ago and we made it a point to be, on Saturday, in -- in that area, so we could attend services.</span> <span id="s1314">Well, he -- he is such a personal person.</span> <span id="s1315">I mean, he comes and shakes your hand and where are you from?</span> <span id="s1316">And I know somebody in Chapel Hill and this -- this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1317">But he is liberal, he is -- he writes beautifully, he is -- he is my kind of rabbi.</span> <span id="s1318">I’ve never had one like that.</span> <span id="s1319">And he had written about telling his children about the Holocaust and how do you tell them about it and how he had great deal of difficulties dealing with this and telling his children about the Holocaust, until he found about -- found out about the Righteous Gentiles and about the people who have helped, during the -- during the war in -- in all countries.</span> <span id="s1320">And that not, quote, everybody was against the Jews, unquote.</span> <span id="s1321">There were people helping.</span> <span id="s1322">And by looking at that aspect of the -- what happened during the war, he was able to then talk to his children about the other things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Now, can you elabo -- can you elaborate on that distinction and why -- why that was so important for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Because it -- it puts -- number one, a posit af -- a positive aspect on the -- on what seems like a ca -- total inhumanity of man against man and that’s all you hear about.</span> <span id="s1325">But there was a humane aspect, at least in some of the people.</span> <span id="s1326">And the second thing is, in talking to the children about these horrible things that happened, from time immorial whether it’s from Haman down to all the generations of the Crusades and what have you, all our kids hear is about the persecution.</span> <span id="s1327">But when you can tell them about people who’ve helped the Jews and are still helping the Jews, you can m-modify that message.</span> <span id="s1328">And when you -- and to me there is one more point, if you can talk about things that Jews have achieved, they’re -- next to the Holocaust Museum, there should be a museum of the -- learning through the ages, the -- I’m not talking about the Nobel Prizes, the Jewish Nobel Prizes or the Jewish basketball players.</span> <span id="s1329">I’m talking about the wisdom of -- of the ages, of the si -- of the -- the learning that took place, the contributions to -- to everything.</span> <span id="s1330">And you have to balance it all.</span> <span id="s1331">And so, this was the gist of my talk.</span> <span id="s1332">I talked about -- I didn’t talk about what I did -- I can never talk about what I did during the war.</span> <span id="s1333">This, to me, is -- number one it’s too personal and number two, it’s I focus -- I want to focus on the children and -- and what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1334">But I also wanted to -- with this -- this reading of -- this thing about -- that Rabbi Shulweiss wrote, I was able to focus also on the rescue aspect.</span> <span id="s1335">And then I can wean myself into that whole rescuing effort.</span> <span id="s1336">But I’m a Jew, rescuing my own.</span> <span id="s1337">You know, it’s not quite the same as non-Jew rescuing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: And this is -- so this is my talk that I gave and from then on I have been in demand.</span> <span id="s1340">And at first I was not very selective and I accepted all the offers, feeling that I had a duty, a responsibility, and -- and becoming aware that indeed, you have to talk in the first person.</span> <span id="s1341">You -- this is the real stuff, that can touch you.</span> <span id="s1342">And this summer, I feel very virtuous, I cleaned out my files, because I was home so much.</span> <span id="s1343">And I have stacks and stacks of letters from kids in schools where I talked about.</span> <span id="s1344">And I keep those.</span> <span id="s1345">I have thrown out a lot of stuff in my life, but I’m keeping these.</span> <span id="s1346">I hope my children and grandchildren would see them, because they’ve been touched by -- by the real thing and so, although I usually tell them I don’t -- that -- that other people have known what I have done and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1347">I said, I have to tell them specifically what I did, otherwise not real to them.</span> <span id="s1348">So I have learned to do that in various, different ways.</span> <span id="s1349">And of course I have -- I’ve talked.</span> <span id="s1350">I give a li -- different emphasis whether I talk at the university or whether I talk at the church youth group and you know, it’s different, focus is different, [indecipherable] is different, pattern.</span> <span id="s1351">But I’ve been able to do it as a berd -- on -- as I told you earlier.</span> <span id="s1352">And just last year, I did so many that it was really exhausting and then I -- I’m doing -- handling it very well, while I’m -- my audience -- and I don’t need any notes, I don’t need any papers and I just talk and I -- I love to talk in public.</span> <span id="s1353">This is -- by the way, is -- I don’t write.</span> <span id="s1354">I have never been able to write and even in my very successful schooling, writing was always a problem.</span> <span id="s1355">And my teachers tore out their hair and they didn’t know why I was so good in everything else, and not in writing.</span> <span id="s1356">So writing is something I don’t do.</span> <span id="s1357">But I make an outline -- I make myself an outline, once I know I have to have a beginning and a middle and an end and I have to clearly define in my introduction what I’m going to cover and then I zoom and I talk.</span> <span id="s1358">And that’s how -- like I said, I don’t have my written talks, except for the one that I gave at this conference at UNC, where they were supposed to be published in a book.</span> <span id="s1359">They never were, but I really wrote out something on rescue and resistance.</span> <span id="s1360">And so until last year, I found out that I had this after reaction of arrhythmia -- of irregular heartbeat.</span> <span id="s1361">When it happened the first time, I didn’t quite relate, but it happened the second time, after I gave a talk, and then I went to see a doctor and I’m on medication.</span> <span id="s1362">So I have been slowing down on this a little bit.</span> <span id="s1363">And I heard a speaker from England, a wonderful person, a non-Jew, who has devoted his life to teaching the Holocaust -- in -- in England, Steven Smith, who created the one and only teaching Holocaust museum in England and he -- after hi -- an experience in Israel, when he went to Yad Vashem and came back to devote his life to this and I heard him talk here, in a small group.</span> <span id="s1364">Somebody brought him over and then I told him about, you know, my difficulty to continue talking.</span> <span id="s1365">He says, “But then, don’t do it.</span> <span id="s1366">Let somebody else do it.”</span> <span id="s1367">And I have to accept the fact that I’m not going to do as much of that any more.</span> <span id="s1368">But I must go and tell you about something else that has given me back so much in the last few years.</span> <span id="s1369">About five -- it’ll be five years this December, Ose had, in celebration, I believe of the 80th anniversary of the creation of Ose in -- in Russia, a reunion in Paris of the hidden children.</span> <span id="s1370">The children they had hidden during the war.</span> <span id="s1371">And of course I went.</span> <span id="s1372">And to me, this has been the highlight of my last few years here and a tremendously important experience.</span> <span id="s1373">Because, when I -- as I have given these interviews, as I’m doing with you today.</span> <span id="s1374">Or as I’m being -- talk and s -- people ask me for specifics, I don’t remember specifics.</span> <span id="s1375">I don’t remember names of kids, I don’t remember specific facts.</span> <span id="s1376">Is it because in the early years here, I really so blocked out everything that it’s blocked away totally?</span> <span id="s1377">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1378">Or did I just not invest myself enough in these kids that I don’t remember them?</span> <span id="s1379">I felt a guilt -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s1381">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: -- years here, I really so blocked out everything that it’s blocked away totally?</span> <span id="s1383">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1384">Or did I just not invest myself enough in these kids that I don’t remember them?</span> <span id="s1385">I felt a guilt that I maybe didn’t put enough of myself into them.</span> <span id="s1386">Well, little by little, I reconne -- first of all, I reconnected -- a woman who lives in Richmond tried to find me, because I had been her social worker and her counselor and what have you -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Where -- where was she then?</span> <span id="s1388">A: She was living in Richmond, but she was only sip --</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: No, when you were her counselor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Oh, well, there’s -- the story is that she was in Rivesaltes, her parents both died in Rivesaltes, of dysentery.</span> <span id="s1391">She was left an orphan.</span> <span id="s1392">Got her out the camp and she was with the Jewish scouts and then in another --</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: How -- how old was she, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Oh, teen-ager, 16?</span> <span id="s1395">14 - 15 - 16?</span> <span id="s1396">And then, apparently, when I was in the underground, I hid her in a convent.</span> <span id="s1397">I say apparently, because I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1398">And when the war was over and I reopened the first children’s home, I took her into that children’s home and she was in the sewing room and she showed me pictures of her with me and all that.</span> <span id="s1399">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1400">And she found me where we were living in France.</span> <span id="s1401">She happened to be on sabbatical with her husband, who is at the university in Richmond and she’s an artist.</span> <span id="s1402">She had come to this country to unite with family and it didn’t work out, as so often it didn’t, but she made a life for herself.</span> <span id="s1403">Had no children.</span> <span id="s1404">And so she told me all that story and then we have -- now, whenever we go through Richmond, I see her.</span> <span id="s1405">Whenever she comes down here -- she was here recently and she did a lot of beautiful artwork and have it in -- and she gave me a lot of her work.</span> <span id="s1406">And she has such a positive memory of the things I did on behalf of her family and herself, that I was astounded.</span> <span id="s1407">I was -- I mean, anybody thinks that much.</span> <span id="s1408">You know, I had just sort of -- because I -- I couldn’t remember these things, I thought maybe I hadn’t put anything into it.</span> <span id="s1409">And then there was this reunion in France.</span> <span id="s1410">And here I was with my husband and there were 500 children between the ages of 55 and 70, I would say, coming from all over the world.</span> <span id="s1411">Of course, the majority from France, but they were from Israel, they were from Argentina, they were from the United States, from England, from all over.</span> <span id="s1412">And they were looking for pieces of themselves in -- in other’s memories.</span> <span id="s1413">And pictures were plastered all over, for people looking each other.</span> <span id="s1414">Be -- I stayed with my cousin, so I didn’t stay there the whole time, but I attended all the meeting.</span> <span id="s1415">And some people were looking for me.</span> <span id="s1416">Some kids were looking for me.</span> <span id="s1417">There was particularly one woman, I mean th-this one had phoned me already.</span> <span id="s1418">She had gone to Paris seeking -- looking for anybody she had been connected with during the war, because she had lost all her family.</span> <span id="s1419">And she lived in Toronto and she had, through somebody at the information center on the Holocaust, she had ga -- f -- happened to meet somebody whom I worked with during the war, and gave her my addre -- and she wrote to me and I found out that I was the director of the children’s home, after the war, where she was.</span> <span id="s1420">And she told me any number of stories about me and the things I did.</span> <span id="s1421">Including serving these kids breakfast in bed on Shabbat morning, because I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s1422">She told me ab -- that -- the stories I told on Friday night, that she had kept with her all her life.</span> <span id="s1423">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1424">But it must have been me and then it must have have happened.</span> <span id="s1425">And then in Paris, the most fantastic thing that happened wa -- there was Friday evening service -- there were Friday evening of wet -- at four o’clock in the afternoon, because sundown is at four o’clock and it’s winter and this December.</span> <span id="s1426">So we had services, maybe five o’clock, it was dark and women upstairs, men downstairs.</span> <span id="s1427">And I’m -- we all had now name tags and on the name tags we had put down where we had been with children’s homes and the name of children home, the camps and so on.</span> <span id="s1428">But nothing distinguished the social workers from -- the workers from the -- the children, the counselor, and we all had the same nametag.</span> <span id="s1429">So I had the Rivesaltes and Moultanta and Polousa -- the names of place -- the name.</span> <span id="s1430">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Te-Tell me, I’m just curious, how many places did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Oh well, I -- I have to count.</span> <span id="s1433">First Rivesaltes and then I worked in a children’s home called Polousa and then I worked in the underground and then I worked -- I opened a children’s home in Moultanta and then one outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s1434">So, for this agency, I worked in four different places.</span> <span id="s1435">And so -- and of course there were workers there and I knew many of the workers and it was wonderful to talk with the workers.</span> <span id="s1436">Some came from Israel, some came from elsewhere and, “Do you remember, you slept in my room that night when you were arrested?”</span> <span id="s1437">“I did?</span> <span id="s1438">I don’t remember.”</span> <span id="s1439">And that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1440">But up -- up in that service on Friday afternoon, next to me sits a very elegant woman in her fur coat and she jerks around and says in French to me, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s1441">And I said, “From America.”</span> <span id="s1442">And she says, “Oh, you look so French.</span> <span id="s1443">I thought you were from France.”</span> <span id="s1444">So I says, “I’m a little bit from both.”</span> <span id="s1445">And then she looks at my tags.</span> <span id="s1446">“Oh, you were in Rivesaltes?”</span> <span id="s1447">All the way -- all the time thinking that I’m one of the kids, too, you know, because it doesn’t say social worker or worker or any -- or counselor or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1448">And she said, “When were you there?”</span> <span id="s1449">And I s -- told her.</span> <span id="s1450">And then she says, “I was in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s1451">My parents were in Rivesaltes, they were deported.</span> <span id="s1452">My brother was in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s1453">And a social worker took me out of the camp, although I was over 16, she faked my papers.</span> <span id="s1454">And I shall all remember her, she took me out and took me to such and such a pla --.”</span> <span id="s1455">And I said, “What was -- what was the name of the social worker?”</span> <span id="s1456">And she said, “Simone Weil.”</span> <span id="s1457">And it was just absolutely incredible.</span> <span id="s1458">We just fell into each other’s arms and -- and then she happens to know my sister-in-law and all the store -- that -- she survived, obviously, in hiding.</span> <span id="s1459">And she married a Jewish -- French Jewish man who knew my family and so that’s why she knew about my family, about my brother.</span> <span id="s1460">And we talked and when the service was over, we went downstairs, we met the men and we’ve -- and then she’s been writing to me -- you know, not much, but -- but through her, somebody else got in touch with me and then there was the woman in -- in Toronto who got somebody else in touch with me.</span> <span id="s1461">And these kids, in quotation mark, have given me back so much in -- of my own memories.</span> <span id="s1462">And validating someone, myself or my work, which I had completely devaluated, because of my lack of memory, that maybe that’s what has enabled me to give all these talks.</span> <span id="s1463">And to -- to really talk about the children, because they have enriched my memories tremenda -- it’s -- it’s just been incredible.</span> <span id="s1464">And then books have been written, books that describe experiences that have been mine and I have read them and so this has been my latest journey, as of the last five years.</span> <span id="s1465">And we’ve gone back to France.</span> <span id="s1466">In fact, next year would be our 50th wedding anniversary and we plan to go back to Strasbourg, where I still have a cousin.</span> <span id="s1467">And so we -- each time I go now, we reconnect and so, at that conference, I had another fantastic experience.</span> <span id="s1468">We met -- wh-when I say we, I mean we, all retired social workers -- not social worker -- all professional workers of the same vintage, within a year or two, who had all worked for Ose during the war, either in the camp -- three of us -- four of us were from the camp and had worked in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s1469">One was the wife of the -- the widow of the -- the head of our underground team and another one w-was the worker who was in the children’s home, but we all, in one capacity or another had been connected to this work.</span> <span id="s1470">We met together after the conference.</span> <span id="s1471">And it was the most wonderful thing that happened to me.</span> <span id="s1472">Something that doesn’t exist for me in this country.</span> <span id="s1473">There’s no one I can talk like that.</span> <span id="s1474">And my husband wasn’t part of that.</span> <span id="s1475">He -- he -- he -- he [indecipherable] went up the Eiffel Tower or something, but anyway, we had this wonderful sharing and I needed it.</span> <span id="s1476">Maybe they needed me too, there, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: I -- I want to ask you a question about your husband and if you don’t want to talk about it -- but I know that you mentioned in the interview -- the video interview, that he’s not able to talk about any experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: What’s the fundamental difference between you and him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: He’s a very introverted person.</span> <span id="s1481">A very private person.</span> <span id="s1482">Also he -- he was a -- a very lonely child when he grew up.</span> <span id="s1483">His siblings were much older and he was really left to his own devices.</span> <span id="s1484">And has very traumatic memories of his childhood, but he has made contact --</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: That were related to the war, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Oh yes, all related to the war, and then he was alone in boarding school in England and then he came here and -- but finally -- we’ve talked about this a great deal.</span> <span id="s1487">Finally he has made contact with the Speedwerk Foundation to do an interview.</span> <span id="s1488">Now, they -- they called him, they said yes, we will work you [indecipherable] and I hope it’s going to happen, because I wish he would.</span> <span id="s1489">We did take one trip with our grown -- before our children got married, our sons, when we were living in France, we all went to Germany, to his house and to his village.</span> <span id="s1490">And there he -- while we were there he was able to talk to the children a little bit about -- in the cemeteries full of Lipmans and all that.</span> <span id="s1491">Can we stop for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Sure [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: I want to put the air conditioner on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I’m getting very -- is that [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: [indecipherable] I want to spend a little bit of time talking about just th-the -- the pattern of your -- of your life, some of your personal development, your -- your marriage and your family.</span> <span id="s1497">One of the thing that struck me in -- in -- in the video interview that I watched, you said -- I -- I -- I -- I could look it up, but you said something about -- and it was related, I think even -- in fact, when you were speaking about your -- the gaps in your memory and the things that you blocked out, that you didn’t remember a lot of the children, because you were afraid to get too close.</span> <span id="s1498">And I was wondering how -- how that played out in your own family?</span> <span id="s1499">Did -- did you continue to be a person who was afraid to get close to people?</span> <span id="s1500">Or were -- were you the opposite?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Now that I know that, it probably was not a failure to get close to the children that broke off my memory, but rather a -- a whole blocking out of -- of -- of feeling related to these memories.</span> <span id="s1502">I -- I don’t think it interfered with my relationships with my children at all.</span> <span id="s1503">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1504">We have a very -- we have a close relationship.</span> <span id="s1505">We -- it did not interfere with my work.</span> <span id="s1506">I -- as I told you, I -- I worked in a variety of setting, dealing with children.</span> <span id="s1507">I started out by being the director of a day care center, where I chose not to remain the director, but to become the case worker, because I wanted to learn to work directly with children.</span> <span id="s1508">I interrupted my career for four years to be alone at home, you know, one child in two rooms upstairs.</span> <span id="s1509">Peter sometime ask, “How did you do it?”</span> <span id="s1510">He ask in his multiple room, multiple bathroom house that everybody has these day.</span> <span id="s1511">And somehow it must have worked out, because I remember incidents where I was getting cl-claustrophobic and with one child at home and I remember vividly -- it’s just a little incident and I spanked him and I was enraged and wha -- you know, on the verge of being abusive mother and I’m joking, but you know, when you’re at -- at home with a kid all the time.</span> <span id="s1512">And many years later, when he was at college, he was filling out these papers and some -- some kind of study where he ask whether he was ever spanked when he was a kid and he answered no and I said, “But Peter, don’t you remember I spanked you?”</span> <span id="s1513">I had such guilt about it.</span> <span id="s1514">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: You spank him once or many times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: I don’t -- no, I’m not a spanking mothe -- but that day I remember so vivid, I can see myself.</span> <span id="s1517">I don’t know what he had done or what drove me nuts.</span> <span id="s1518">And then he said he was never spanked and I said, “But don’t you remember that day?”</span> <span id="s1519">You know, “I don’t remember.”</span> <span id="s1520">And then it occurred to me that when the climate is good, a little bit of bad weather doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1521">So the climate must have been good and that was just a little bout of bad weather.</span> <span id="s1522">So, on the whole the climate’s been good and so I must have done something right about that.</span> <span id="s1523">I worked with children, I -- I went back to work in foster care.</span> <span id="s1524">I went, eventually, when we left Cleveland and my husband was transferred to Syracuse, I interrupted for awhile, because we had just made an -- hit a new city and Robby was just entering school and I floundered around for awhile, not knowing what I wanted to do and Syracuse was -- looked to me like to be in the dark ages as compared to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1525">Eventually it turned out to be really our highlight in our life.</span> <span id="s1526">And eventually I went to work for child guidance clinic.</span> <span id="s1527">And there, for a variety of reason, was able to develop my own style of work, because we had very poor leadership.</span> <span id="s1528">So, there was one of the benefits of poor leadership, I [indecipherable] was able to give papers -- not writing, give paper.</span> <span id="s1529">And became a consultant to early childhood programs.</span> <span id="s1530">I became a consultant to preschool, to pre-K, to daycare, to nurse -- private nursery school.</span> <span id="s1531">While I was still on the staff of the -- of the mental health department, the child guidance clinic.</span> <span id="s1532">And developed all kinds of workshops for all the staff -- the staffs of the various early childhood programs in Syracuse, I did any number of training and workshops and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1533">So I always dealt with children and I have all these wonderful letters of people thanking me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Let me get back to your own children now.</span> <span id="s1535">Your -- you mentioned before that book, “Children of the Holocaust”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: That -- the book, “Children of the Holocaust”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Do you have a -- have a first account with other families of -- of Holocaust survivors or people from your own position?</span> <span id="s1540">You know, where you’ve seen relationships between the parents and the children and -- and that’s part one and then part two is -- ha-has there been any entrance in your own family, of these issues?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: No.</span> <span id="s1542">It’s interesting, a -- you know, as I said earlier, neither my husband and I view our -- because we’re parents, both of us are parenting our children, we view ourselves as survivors, but the children of survivors and children of the Holocaust, talk more about their parents who have been in -- in the death camps.</span> <span id="s1543">And that’s very different from having [indecipherable] so we are quite a large step removed from that.</span> <span id="s1544">And particularly my husband who was not -- I mean he left Germany at -- when he was 17 and was in England.</span> <span id="s1545">So, he was interned in England, you know, J-Jews were interned -- I mean, Germans were interned in Eng-England, so he was in the [indecipherable] he was in a camp, but that camp was a country club compared to what people in France had to go through.</span> <span id="s1546">So I don’t think my children considered themselves as children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1547">They consider -- th-they know their parents have a history and they have shown some interest in it.</span> <span id="s1548">I can only compare my family, for instance, to this other woman who w-was a witness in Italy and -- and went through that -- who came, also as a counseled student.</span> <span id="s1549">And she has the same relationship that we have with their three children, we -- we have same age children, with one in between.</span> <span id="s1550">And I don’t see any difficulties in these relationships.</span> <span id="s1551">And interesting enough, my husband has a sister in New York, there’s a big age gap and she got married youn -- married very young and s -- and he got married very late, so the -- the generations are very skewed, you know, so she’s already a great grandmother, you know, and we, our grandch-children are not even Bar Mitzvah, you know, so it’s a big, big gap there.</span> <span id="s1552">And they have two daughters -- my sister-in-law, they have two daughters and one is in her 60’s already, my niece and her sister.</span> <span id="s1553">And her sister is a few years younger and her sister considers herself as a chil -- a child of survivors and attended all these meetings of a group as child of survivors.</span> <span id="s1554">And the older sister doesn’t understand it, why does she have that need?</span> <span id="s1555">So it is something entirely perceived by the child, for God knows -- a variety of individual reasons, a pass -- this -- place in the family, self perception, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1556">But I don’t feel -- the only thing that -- both boys married, of course, women born in this country.</span> <span id="s1557">Have no connection -- I mean, they’re American born women and -- so sometimes I feel there is a -- there is a -- a little gap there.</span> <span id="s1558">Just a little gap there, just like this -- we are -- we are not the old generation from the old countries, but we are different.</span> <span id="s1559">But I cannot quantify it or qua -- even qualify it.</span> <span id="s1560">It’s -- it’s something that I perceive, but I don’t think our children ever felt themself to be any different for having parents who were survi --except from having parents who mispronounce names [indecipherable] my sons made any numbers of -- of jokes about their mother putting the accent on -- on syllable -- on being more strict than most parent.</span> <span id="s1561">I have a -- you know -- we were strict with our children and I’m not sorry at all about it.</span> <span id="s1562">And maybe they view that as being part of our European background, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1563">Never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1564">I don’t view that as having been in the way with our children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1566">What -- what fields did the boys go into?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: They’re both engineers.</span> <span id="s1568">Their father is an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Like their father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: They’re both in computers.</span> <span id="s1571">And when the three of them get together, I go to the kitchen -- no.</span> <span id="s1572">No, I -- we have a computer and I know how to handle it.</span> <span id="s1573">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: What about your ola -- I know what I wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s1575">Is there a point at which you can recall where you began to feel that you were an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: I wanted so badly to put everything behind me, that I think it -- it’s -- it came instantly.</span> <span id="s1577">First of all, I spoke the eng -- I spoke the language, quite comfortably.</span> <span id="s1578">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: How did you come to learn English so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Well, I was a good student at school.</span> <span id="s1581">I had six years of English, not like the United States where you have one year of French and then you drop it all.</span> <span id="s1582">When we had a language, we had it for six years.</span> <span id="s1583">I had six years of English, I had -- this -- to that, we were bilingual at home, or trilinguals.</span> <span id="s1584">F -- Alsatian and French and I couldn’t understand German and I study at home.</span> <span id="s1585">I learned Hebrew in Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1586">I learned Latin, English and Greek simultaneously.</span> <span id="s1587">I had six years of Latin and six years of English.</span> <span id="s1588">And I’m not totally mixed up, but I am -- I’m doing fairly well with language and so when I got my scholarship, my coworker was just -- if not more qualified than I was, to get a scholarship, but she had no English.</span> <span id="s1589">And I had not spoken English since I left school.</span> <span id="s1590">This is 1946 and I left school in ‘38.</span> <span id="s1591">I had not spoken English.</span> <span id="s1592">And I was -- my English was good enough to make straight A’s in graduate school at Tulane.</span> <span id="s1593">But it was lousy to go and -- every day living.</span> <span id="s1594">I never raised my hand in class.</span> <span id="s1595">I could write, but I couldn’t really express myself.</span> <span id="s1596">And I couldn’t order anything in a c -- restaurant or anything, for a long time.</span> <span id="s1597">But when I came back and we were married, there was not a problem.</span> <span id="s1598">I remember kids in daycare laughing at me because in saying -- saying Bobby, I said booby.</span> <span id="s1599">You know, and they laughed because an O is an O and not a R, you know?</span> <span id="s1600">It’s not Bobby, it’s booby.</span> <span id="s1601">And I learned to disregard French phonetics and -- little by little.</span> <span id="s1602">How did I feel -- I remember -- I don’t even remember being sworn in, but I remember I became a citizen after five years.</span> <span id="s1603">That’s technical.</span> <span id="s1604">And it’s interesting that while we lived in France for three years, recently -- I mean, that’s 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s1605">Gosh, it’s 17 years ago.</span> <span id="s1606">And I was very happy to be there.</span> <span id="s1607">I enjoyed it, however, as an American.</span> <span id="s1608">It was not -- I loved to go there, but boy I -- this is home.</span> <span id="s1609">Oh, totally.</span> <span id="s1610">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: And ho-how do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: My life’s been here, the majority of my life, all -- I mean, I was 26 when I came and I’m 78 now.</span> <span id="s1613">Many more years here.</span> <span id="s1614">My kids are here, but mostly my grandchildren are here.</span> <span id="s1615">My profession is here.</span> <span id="s1616">My -- I don’t even have the professional language to discuss anything in French, you know?</span> <span id="s1617">I -- I couldn’t -- my -- my French is -- is very good and when we lived near France I had a ball, because I confused everybody by saying that I was American and speaking French very well.</span> <span id="s1618">You know, that kind of jo -- but -- and I enjoyed every moment we were there.</span> <span id="s1619">I missed a lot of the co -- house ease and comfort that we have in America because everything is -- was a little more complicated there.</span> <span id="s1620">Although we had everything we needed.</span> <span id="s1621">But home is here, coming back to my kids and to m -- I mean, my kids live miles away, but this is where I c-can express my thoughts, my feelings.</span> <span id="s1622">I’m -- I’m not much a student any more in France, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1624">D-Do you feel safer here?</span> <span id="s1625">I-Is that an element at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: No, mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1627">I felt just as safe in Israel, at midnight in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1628">I do -- I mean, oh, I feel safe in France, it was just as well -- as safe.</span> <span id="s1629">In France --</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Now I’m not referring to personal street crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: I’m referring to safety as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1634">I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Do you feel -- I mean, do you feel like a -- it’s possible something like that could happen again in Europe and not here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: No.</span> <span id="s1637">Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1638">Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1639">No, I -- I -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1640">But there is something that -- that gets in the way in France or in -- in European countries and -- and everywhere.</span> <span id="s1641">I’d have to tell you an experience that I had last year.</span> <span id="s1642">When I am in France and of course in Germany, and -- but in Germany we only have gone because of this cathartic trip for my husband, to go back to his hometown and ex -- w-we went -- I went with him once first to the cemetery and it was a very important trip for him to reconnect.</span> <span id="s1643">He wa -- his family was a very prominent family there and their house still exists.</span> <span id="s1644">It’s divided in four apartments, so it was a very substantial place and father was very prominent there.</span> <span id="s1645">When I am --</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Wh-What happened to his father?</span> <span id="s1647">Oh, his father died [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: His father died and his mother was deported.</span> <span id="s1649">His mother died, we found out just about three years ago, through the Holocaust Museum, where she died.</span> <span id="s1650">She was deported from the village in which she grew up, into Hanover.</span> <span id="s1651">She never made it out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1652">She finally got the papers to leave.</span> <span id="s1653">We don’t know why she waited so long.</span> <span id="s1654">By the time she decided, it was too late to get papers and she was eventually put in the Riga ghetto in Latvia and then from Riga, she was then put into labor camp in Stutthof and through the Holocaust Museum’s library, we were able to get in touch with a place in Stutthof, a -- a museum that they erected on the camp, that Stutthof camp and they sent us copy of a page of a ledger which shows her name and her date of death in Stutthof, in a camp.</span> <span id="s1655">In December, 1944, the war was over in France and she still died there.</span> <span id="s1656">She was in her 50 -- must have been a very strong -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Museum Me -- this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s1658">This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: -- in December, 1944, the war was over in France and she still died there.</span> <span id="s1660">She was in her 50 -- must have been a very strong woman to last that long.</span> <span id="s1661">For the longest time we thought that she had been -- we knew that Stutthof camp had put all their still alive internees on barges and drowned them at sea when the Russians advanced.</span> <span id="s1662">And so we had always been tha -- under that impression that’s what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1663">But the stutta -- the camp museum sent us a book, all in Polish, which somebody translated for us -- not translate, but read for us and then came to the conclusion that she must have died of a typhoid breakout at that time, in December 23, where most of the people died.</span> <span id="s1664">So, why am I telling you all of this?</span> <span id="s1665">Oh, going to Europe -- when I deal with people my age, and that has been true -- they were my age 50 years ago -- I mean, 30 year ago and I went to France.</span> <span id="s1666">My -- my unspoken question is, where were you during the war?</span> <span id="s1667">Now, that’s a question I don’t ask here.</span> <span id="s1668">And so that’s -- that’s something that exists a little bit less now, because I’ve gone back to Europe more often.</span> <span id="s1669">And I had an interesting experience, we went back -- when we lived in France, between ‘83 and ‘86, I went back to the farm my parents had lived in during the war and where I lived with them for not quite a year [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1670">And found the place and the people were very nice, let us come into the farm and we were there.</span> <span id="s1671">But, prior to that, I -- I have to backtrack, we stayed in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1672">It’s one of these chateaux that put up tourists.</span> <span id="s1673">And in the very place where my father had been in a camp, in Teeveeai blast, my father had been in a camp for a brief period.</span> <span id="s1674">And all the time I’m there, I’m saying to myself -- th-the owner of the -- the owner of the camp was my age, I said, where was he when my father was in camp, in Teeveeai, right here?</span> <span id="s1675">Was he in the chateau, where was he -- doing?</span> <span id="s1676">And I’m uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1677">And then the next morning we were on -- on -- on the way to -- on the farm, the next morning, you know, what I just described to you, going back to the farm where my parents had lived, and so the owner there said to me -- no, the wife s -- the owner’s wife said to me, “Where you off to today?”</span> <span id="s1678">You know, just chat.</span> <span id="s1679">I said, “We’re going on a pilgrimage.”</span> <span id="s1680">And she says, “Oh, you’re going to Oradure.”</span> <span id="s1681">Oradure siran is a village which is very famous in that terrible thing that happened in the end of the war, when France -- the Germans took the whole population of Oradure, put them in a church and put a match to it.</span> <span id="s1682">And that’s become a pilgrimage place.</span> <span id="s1683">I said, “No, I’m going to the place where my parents were hiding during the war.”</span> <span id="s1684">I said -- well, you know, just kind of spill it out.</span> <span id="s1685">And she said, “Oh.</span> <span id="s1686">They were -- my husband was in the resistance and he was in camp so and so as a member of the resistance.”</span> <span id="s1687">Well, everything cleared, you know?</span> <span id="s1688">No more -- but until I know where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: -- where were you.</span> <span id="s1691">It happened to me once in the States, when there was -- in a -- in a group, the French speaking group in Cleveland, which I -- or in Syracuse, I forget where, which I joined for a very brief period, there was one woman who was from Germany and she talked about being in Strasbourg during the war -- where?</span> <span id="s1692">In my house?</span> <span id="s1693">Where?</span> <span id="s1694">I couldn’t connect.</span> <span id="s1695">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1696">It was a very brief kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1697">So I have this in Europe, which I don’t have when I’m here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: And last year I had an incredible experience.</span> <span id="s1700">We went -- usually we go on -- we don’t travel on our own, but we thought we could handle tha -- we go on tours or we go in elder hostels or things like that, but I -- I wanted to see Prague and Budapest and we did it on our own.</span> <span id="s1701">And with a lot of soul searching, we decided to include Vienna, which ain’t so easy for us.</span> <span id="s1702">Well, we only spend a night or two there and after all, you know, the war is over, you can’t hold it forever and you know, the whole reasoning.</span> <span id="s1703">And so, in Prague, and in order to be understood, you speak German, because I don’t do Czech and -- so we spoke German.</span> <span id="s1704">And it’s run over with German tourists and in the hotel you s -- you use German.</span> <span id="s1705">And it didn’t bother me and -- and you know, this is a practical thing to do.</span> <span id="s1706">Then we took a train to Vienna and we had this very comfortable compartment, with -- and a woman from South Africa or Australia.</span> <span id="s1707">Anyway, it was a very pleasant first class compartment.</span> <span id="s1708">We never travel first class, but our travel agent said, “You stay in a Eastern Euro-European country, you better upgrade yourself.</span> <span id="s1709">So we are there, we arrive at the border of Austria, the train stops and there is passport control.</span> <span id="s1710">And this border guy -- I don’t know what you call it -- officer, comes in, very innocuous looking young man, with a khaki shirt and a khaki pants and some -- some -- something on him and in German asks us for our papers.</span> <span id="s1711">And I broke down.</span> <span id="s1712">I handed him -- I handed him my passport and I felt my tears running down.</span> <span id="s1713">This was a German, speaking German, asking me for my papers.</span> <span id="s1714">Were they going to be fake?</span> <span id="s1715">Was I going to be arrested?</span> <span id="s1716">Was I going to make it?</span> <span id="s1717">I surprised myself totally, my having tears running down my sh -- so it’s still there.</span> <span id="s1718">In spite of all the talking, reading, doing, I ma -- I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1719">I -- I -- I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1720">It wasn’t just one thing, it -- the -- the Gestalt of the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: So, being in Europe is, in this way, different from being in America.</span> <span id="s1723">Not safer, just different.</span> <span id="s1724">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: No, I think that’s a very -- a --a very good description.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: And I think it’s an important distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Yeah, oh, I -- I have to think about -- it -- it’s something that -- that’s there.</span> <span id="s1729">I mean, it -- as I’m getting older, there are fewer people of my age there, so they only choo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: But I’ll tell -- I -- I -- I -- just to share something with you, you know, I -- as I -- I mentioned to you before, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: You went to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: To Poland in April and that’s the first time I ever went to Europe, anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: I never went to Europe before.</span> <span id="s1735">And -- and I had some mixed feelings about going to Poland.</span> <span id="s1736">As it happens, my father has a very close associate, a fr -- an old -- an old friend who was from -- from Warsaw, Jewish doctor, a woman who survived the war, whose parents did not.</span> <span id="s1737">And she was out of Warsaw when the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: And she lives there now, she committed herself to staying and living there.</span> <span id="s1740">And so I’ve been in touch with her and she’s invited me to come many times, but I’ve never gone.</span> <span id="s1741">And so I was intrigued about going there and I -- and I just want to go to this particular conference because they were people who do what I do on radio, from all over Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Meeting that just happened to be meeting there.</span> <span id="s1744">But th-there was this -- I had a similar reaction, which is I’m looking around at everybody, I’m looking at the few Jews that are left in Poland -- and I went and did an interview with a -- a young man a little bit older than me, in his late 40’s, who runs the only Jewish magazine published in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yeah, Jewish what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Jewish magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: That was started just a couple of years ago, after Communists --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: -- were out of power, that he was allowed to form a -- a magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: And I met a German conductor, who was a -- who was a protégé of Leonard Bernstein’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: -- who happened to be conducting a concert in -- in Warsaw that week.</span> <span id="s1755">But I was asking the same questions everywhere I went.</span> <span id="s1756">And then loo -- and then we were standing, looking at all these older peasants from around Warsaw and I’m thi -- the whole time, I was wondering the same thing.</span> <span id="s1757">You know, well what were they -- where were they and what were they doing?</span> <span id="s1758">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: You know, when we went to Germany, we -- this while we were in France, it was, well, our 35th anniversary and we invited our kids to come on over, too.</span> <span id="s1760">And -- our sons with their wives.</span> <span id="s1761">They were -- was married, but had no children.</span> <span id="s1762">I would like to duplicate it with the kids, but it’s getting too big and I’m getting too -- I can’t handle that many people at a time.</span> <span id="s1763">But anyway, we went into Germany -- I mean first we went Alsace, I showed them where my parents lived, where I went when I went to school, where my grandparents lived.</span> <span id="s1764">We showed them all of that.</span> <span id="s1765">Also went to the cemetery and saw the monument to the Holocaust, all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1766">And went into Germany and Mart-Martin was very determined, we’re just going to go.</span> <span id="s1767">I don’t want to talk to anybody and we’re going to go just to see the place and show the children where my house was, the cemetery, the school and synagogue and so on -- which doesn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s1768">And then we’re going -- we’re driving back, I had [indecipherable] the whole itinerary, I had all the reservations.</span> <span id="s1769">We were going to just breathe as little of the air as we could and speak a little German as we could and just do it, because it -- it was an ex -- valid -- valid experience for our children, to see where their father grew up.</span> <span id="s1770">And then -- w-we went two cars and our son flagged us down and said, “You know, this has been a long drive, we -- I don’t think we can make it back to France today.</span> <span id="s1771">We are very tired.”</span> <span id="s1772">And then he asked, “Do you think Dad would mind if we spend another night in Germany?”</span> <span id="s1773">They were so aware of that.</span> <span id="s1774">And we said, “No, what’s -- that’s okay, if we can get a room,” -- we were in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1775">And we got a hotel, we needed three rooms and we got three rooms and we went there and the kids went of their own way.</span> <span id="s1776">We just wanted each our own space a little bit and they wanted to do their thing.</span> <span id="s1777">And Martin and I walked around in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1778">But the kids were conscious of the fact that another night in Germany was maybe more that their father could countenance.</span> <span id="s1779">And you know what, we said, “Gee, this is a beautiful city, darn it.”</span> <span id="s1780">And so we have transmitted our children this, they are aware of it.</span> <span id="s1781">But it doesn’t stop them from -- I don’t know, maybe buying something German or -- which is -- I’m -- I’m -- I’m very aware of that, I cannot buy something German.</span> <span id="s1782">But, it doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s1783">Israel buys stuff from Germany.</span> <span id="s1784">In Europe you cannot separate things -- Germany or Belgium or anywhere else, it’s the European stuff, why can’t you do it?</span> <span id="s1785">But here, I could no more buy a bottle of German wine than I could fly to the moon.</span> <span id="s1786">I mean, it’s just, I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1787">It -- It’s -- it’s not from the head, it comes from below, you know?</span> <span id="s1788">So -- so th-that’s the difference in -- when I’m in Europe.</span> <span id="s1789">It’s not the safety, it’s the awareness of the history, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1791">[indecipherable] the memory of -- I -- I -- one of my first cars that I bought was a -- an old Peugeot and I was -- it was -- needed to be repaired all the time.</span> <span id="s1792">And once I was -- it was really old, I mean it wa -- had like about a hundred thousand miles when I bought it.</span> <span id="s1793">But I was in the shop once, waiting for it to get repaired and was a man sitting next to me and he looked at me, he says, “So you’re in for another repair, huh?”</span> <span id="s1794">And I said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1795">And he says, “Yeah, me too,” he says, “but I’ll never buy a Mercedes.”</span> <span id="s1796">And then he looked at me and he rolled up his sleeve and showed me his tattoo.</span> <span id="s1797">And that was all he had to say, you know, was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1799">But you know, the streets in Israel -- have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: No, I’ve never been there.</span> <span id="s1801">I’d like to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: There are plenty of German cars and Israel has -- has given Israel a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1803">I mean, it’s a very personal kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Yeah, it’s complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: It’s hard.</span> <span id="s1807">How -- how would you say -- well, what we did is, on the list of things that they suggest that we -- there are thing -- I mean w-wh-what -- what they’re interested in is your perception of political events that are taking place over the -- you know, the past 40 or 50 years.</span> <span id="s1808">And when -- wha -- I mean, there’s like a million things to talk about.</span> <span id="s1809">But one thing, if there are things from your experience that would have affected the way that you -- you know, I mean this -- I can show you the list, it’s the atomic bomb, the war -- war -- I just -- I guess war in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: I -- I remember very vividly, I couldn’t vote then, but I do remember when I -- when Eisenhower was elected, what was that, ‘50?</span> <span id="s1811">‘51?</span> <span id="s1812">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1813">Anyway, I’m not very good at history.</span> <span id="s1814">And here we’re getting a Republican after all these Democratic thing.</span> <span id="s1815">I thought that everything was going to change.</span> <span id="s1816">And McCarthy was interviewing, I mean the -- the anti-American kind of hearings were going on.</span> <span id="s1817">That scared me.</span> <span id="s1818">I thought that with a new president who was going to be a Republican, versus all -- we had FDR, Truman, all that before.</span> <span id="s1819">And then I found out life went on and nothing changed very much.</span> <span id="s1820">But I was scared at the time.</span> <span id="s1821">As for the bomb, I was very involved at the time, the atomic bomb.</span> <span id="s1822">I was very involved in the ban the bomb kind of thing, because -- I remember marching in the -- in the marches with my son in the -- in the -- a stroller.</span> <span id="s1823">And Dr. Spock was in Cleveland and Dr. Spock -- actually, I consulted with him once, in my professional work and he used the same car repair dealer as we did and so my sons knew that this was the doctor who had written the book that I looked at when he was sick, so he -- he knew who Dr. Spock was.</span> <span id="s1824">But, anyway, he was -- was, this woman called Sane, it was a -- became active in that.</span> <span id="s1825">I’m not a very -- and my husband isn’t either, we are not the demonstration kind of people, marching kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1826">But that I mi -- I mean, we don -- we tend to support causes by giving money or even by writing letters and now by e-mail.</span> <span id="s1827">My husband does more of that than I do.</span> <span id="s1828">But we are not the -- the demonstration kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1829">Is that the English word or is it manifesti -- in French it’s manifestation.</span> <span id="s1830">Yeah, it’s demonstration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: And so -- but that -- that -- I -- I du -- at the time of the bomb, since I was also involved with young children and I had all this fall-out kind of thing, so I -- I did -- I did march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1834">You mentioned something interesting before that -- that struck me, which was your empathy or sympathetic reaction to seeing other refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Which is not -- I -- I don’t know, I mean what -- I me -- my perception’s not always the case with people that have gone through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1837">I mean there are some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: See, this has -- has nothing to do so much with the Holoc -- people in the Holocaust, the-they were sent to camps.</span> <span id="s1839">I -- what I’m talking about is we were expelled -- this is the other piece in the experien -- we lived in the border of France and then almost at the border of Belgium, Holland.</span> <span id="s1840">You know, Belgium and France.</span> <span id="s1841">My parents had left Strasbourg and the whole popul -- if you remember my early paper -- my early recording, Strasbourg had been evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: And then -- and my parents didn’t go with the mobs down in the south side of France.</span> <span id="s1844">They found their own place, probably a hundred miles west of Strasbourg -- in -- in Lorraine, in a place called Glammer.</span> <span id="s1845">And so when the war came -- when the -- not when the war came, when the invasion came, we were in the war, but nothing was going, it was the phony war and in the phony war, nothing was going on and we were waiting for something to happen.</span> <span id="s1846">And what happened is that the Germans went around the maginno line and they invaded Belgium and Holland and poured into France.</span> <span id="s1847">And we had to leave.</span> <span id="s1848">People were taking to the roads.</span> <span id="s1849">I don’t know if I sa -- recorded this, but we -- it was a Shabbat morning, my mother had cooked all the meals for Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1850">They had never been in a car on a Shabbat and we had a car.</span> <span id="s1851">And whatever we could, we loaded on top of the car.</span> <span id="s1852">Couple of mattresses, whatever food we had which was already prepared.</span> <span id="s1853">And we left in the great [indecipherable] just like the people you see on the roads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Except that we had a car.</span> <span id="s1856">So that’s a piece of my personal experience in France, which may not be at all related to experience of people who went into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1857">That’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: But there’s a -- I think you’re -- you’re -- th-that’s a very important distinction.</span> <span id="s1859">But there’s something else that I -- in a more general way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: I think that there are some Jews who are more able to -- I’m not -- I don’t have the -- the words aren’t coming.</span> <span id="s1862">There are some Jews who are able to empathize with other peoples --</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: -- and other struggles, and other people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: -- who are suffering.</span> <span id="s1867">And there are some Jews who are more inward and say, “I have to worry only about Jews.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: Yeah, is it good for the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1871">Yeah, I guess there are two, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1872">Do you want to ask me where I fit in between?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: I think actu -- I think I’m more open to suffering in general, I think.</span> <span id="s1875">Yeah, I really think so, when I think of all the causes we support.</span> <span id="s1876">But I think the main -- but also, we also do a great deal to support our own.</span> <span id="s1877">Probably -- probably our main -- I think of our charities, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: It starts with home, it starts with our own community, where we see our needs.</span> <span id="s1880">Because what we haven’t touched upon, and it probably doesn’t fit in your questions, but I’m going to touch upon it now.</span> <span id="s1881">Retirement started in Chapel Hill, here.</span> <span id="s1882">And we literally touched the ground running and became active immediately in community work.</span> <span id="s1883">And when I mean community, I mean the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1884">This is a very small Jewish community of no business -- no Jewish businesses, it’s all academic or research or it’s university or the research, Triangle Park and there’s literally no Jewish businesses here.</span> <span id="s1885">So when we came, there was a volunt -- a group of volunteers raising funds for the UJ and a bunch of volunteers having a program for some elderly people.</span> <span id="s1886">That’s all -- well, there was a Hillel on the campus and that kind of thing, was a Haddassah.</span> <span id="s1887">But there’s no organized communit -- there were two synagogue.</span> <span id="s1888">And I’ve been part, from the beginning, of a creation of a Jewish family server.</span> <span id="s1889">So, what I’m saying is my -- this was my -- although at first I didn’t know where to put my volunteer energies, it became -- I’m what -- 60 -- 66 years old and of course I can take classes and I can do -- which we did, right away from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1890">But I wanted to -- I wanted to be active and I wa -- vare -- I didn’t know where to start.</span> <span id="s1891">I went to Red Cross and I went -- and I went to the research [indecipherable] to the -- because I speak a few languages, maybe I could help them.</span> <span id="s1892">But none of this was satisfactory.</span> <span id="s1893">And then by chance I had met somebody who said, “Oh, there is a group that’s trying to hire a social worker to get started with the elderly, because it can no longer be done on a voluntary basis and one thing leading to the other, before I knew it, a few years late -- a few years later I was chairman of the Jewish Family Service and I’m still active on this committee.</span> <span id="s1894">I was charge of the Russian resettlement program here and I’m still in charge of that.</span> <span id="s1895">We don’t resettle anybody any more, but I’m still active in that.</span> <span id="s1896">And I am still immersed 100% in this.</span> <span id="s1897">So, yeah, if you wish charit -- my empathy -- I was much -- it was much more satisfactory to -- first of all, it’s my professional background that -- my skills came in handy in there -- than to go to Red Cross and when people donate blood to, you know, give them a cookie or something like that.</span> <span id="s1898">I couldn’t relate to that.</span> <span id="s1899">And I was doing Meals on Wheels.</span> <span id="s1900">I continued Meals on Wheels, which is not a Jewish program, for the longest time.</span> <span id="s1901">But then it -- the schedule interfered with something else and I dropped -- but for five years I was delivering meals to the general community here.</span> <span id="s1902">So I don’t limit it to the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: But then, as the community activities became more important -- and they have been, it’s been absolutely wonderful, because I work not only -- I work with younger people, instead of being with my peers all the time and my experience is given some validation and my community’s help.</span> <span id="s1905">And so both my husband and I -- he spent the whole day today at Hillel, because of some kind -- but thank God it’s only 12 minutes from here, so he can go running back and forth.</span> <span id="s1906">And that morning, the first thing I talked with the social worker and at Jewish Family Service -- number one I hired her, so I know her very well.</span> <span id="s1907">Number two, she asked me to do a -- to take care of some difficult situation on a voluntary basis and I report [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1908">And so we’re constantly involved with this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: And this is so -- yeah, I’m -- I mean I empathize with problems mi -- in -- in -- in the -- the -- outside the Jewish community, but I think my emphasis is inside the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1911">So, does that answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: Yeah, in general, but I -- I mean -- but I -- but I -- my -- na -- lik-like where -- what were your -- nawa -- d-do you think that your -- that your experiences shaped your general reaction and general ideas about war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: And could you describe -- talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: A-And this is what I -- I think one of the messages that I give the kids when I talk to -- especially the younger children -- I talk to them mostly about not speaking up when there is injustice or prejudice.</span> <span id="s1916">You know, for evil to -- for evil to flourish, it just -- just take one good man not to talk or sa -- I’m misquoting it, but you know what I’m talking about, not speaking up and -- now, of course they cannot write to their senators, but they can be aware of injustice, even in their school situations.</span> <span id="s1917">And they can be aware of prejudice and that kind of thing and then that’s what I talk to them about and then that’s not a Jewish notion, it’s -- it’s a general, universal no -- so I -- and when people say it can happen here, I really don’t believe it, but theoretically, it could happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s1918">And so this is the message I -- I gave the children.</span> <span id="s1919">But I’m not sitting at home worrying about war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: I’m -- I think it’s dreadful, what’s happening in the world nowadays.</span> <span id="s1922">Again, it started all over again today in -- in Rwanda and in -- in Bosnia it continues, it’s so wrong.</span> <span id="s1923">And one feels totally helpless and then the univer -- and the world community is totally helpless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Does this -- does it -- it’s funny, my own perception is -- I mean, first of all, when I think about the -- the Jewish Holocaust and the number of people that were executed and the way it was done and there’s the -- the whole -- I -- the only thing that I can think is hi -- i-is -- and a -- and it was one of the questions I asked you earlier, which was h-how did -- how did it escalate in -- in people’s minds -- y-you know, from the victim’s minds, how it escalated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1926">I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1927">It -- I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: I -- I really don’t know how.</span> <span id="s1930">I think that there are s -- maybe people have this -- there is this -- all these hidden revenges and hidden thoughts and hidden blaming and -- that are -- are given -- given ventilation, I mean are able to -- they’re able to ventilate, they come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1933">One of the messages -- something you said remind me of another message that I always give the children.</span> <span id="s1934">They always say, you know, it’s a bat -- or is a genocide here, you know, there is a Holocaust there and it’s true, there are -- there are genocides and -- going on and there are mass murders going on all over the world these day, whether it’s Bosnia or Rwanda or ethnic cleansing anywhere.</span> <span id="s1935">But never -- I tell them, remember, never has there been a plan made to systematically destroy a whole people.</span> <span id="s1936">It was done in Germany.</span> <span id="s1937">I don’t have to tell them about the Wannsee Conference or whatever they -- their -- their history isn’t that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: -- they don’t know that -- that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1940">But it happens elsewhere that whole ethnic groups are being destroyed and being eliminated.</span> <span id="s1941">But it happens in sort of a spontaneous and on a different kind of internal war kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1942">But this was an industrial plan of elimination, with industrial weapons to do it.</span> <span id="s1943">And in -- I -- I’ve seen a reenactment of the Wannsee conference on television.</span> <span id="s1944">It is absolutely unbearable.</span> <span id="s1945">And so they -- I want to give that message, that this -- in this way, the Holocaust is different.</span> <span id="s1946">And I don’t usually use the word Holocaust, I use the word Shoah.</span> <span id="s1947">Which they do in France, by the way, they always talk about the Shoah, never about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1948">Because it’s -- makes a difference.</span> <span id="s1949">It makes -- it makes it special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Which is what?</span> <span id="s1951">What is -- what is the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Shoah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: No, what is the -- what’s the -- I just want you to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: The different is that this -- the Shoah is this -- this specific plan that was made to -- to destroy a people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: And in a systematic way.</span> <span id="s1957">And that -- that’s unique in the history of mankind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s1960">This is tape number four, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: -- Shoah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: No, what is the -- what’s the -- I just want you to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: The different is that this -- the Shoah is this -- this specific plan that was made to -- to destroy a people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: And in a systematic way.</span> <span id="s1966">And that -- that’s unique in the history of mankind.</span> <span id="s1967">What have we not covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Let me take a look.</span> <span id="s1969">Lots of things, I think we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: We have covered things that you probably don’t have, even, in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: [indecipherable] I have so many lists.</span> <span id="s1972">I -- I do have to ask you this, this is -- over -- over the years, did -- were -- well, let me ask you this, were you aware that -- that Leonard Bernstein -- did you have any -- any interest in Leonard Bernstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: I have no -- had no -- no particular interest in him, no, but I know who he is, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: And were you aware that he was one of the first -- excuse me, the first Jewish musicians to go and work in Germany after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: No, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: He made a co -- I’m -- one of the things that I find interesting about him is that he was very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: He was very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1981">And he made a commitment to go and work with German musicians after the war and to help build the symphonic system in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: And he would take these trips where he would go from one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Oh, Germany to Israel, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1986">Very early and when he started collecting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: I didn’t know he was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1989">Very -- it was a key to his whole psyche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: He?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: It was a key element in hi -- in his whole psyche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1993">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1994">I don’t have my hearing aid on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1996">I was curious, I’m all -- I’m -- I’m -- I’m -- I -- my perception is, or was that he was in important figure in American Jewry, that people thought of him as someone who was very important.</span> <span id="s1997">But when I ask the question to people, people usually say, “Well, he wasn’t very important.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: No, I don’t perceive him as a pers -- I -- I know he was Jewish, but if you th -- ask me, and I’m -- I’m thinking of a musician rather than a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: [indecipherable] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: I’m just curious.</span> <span id="s2002">You know -- oh, I want to -- do you still keep in touch with your friend, Charlotte?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Did I talk about having met her in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Oh, that is another fantastic story.</span> <span id="s2006">And that -- you know, ilch -- my friend Charlotte, who was arrested when I was freed, I never been in touch with her.</span> <span id="s2007">I didn’t have -- I once asked for her address, when a -- a mutual friend and I wrote to her and I never heard from her.</span> <span id="s2008">So I said -- part of me said she’s mad at me because I was liber -- freed and she was arrested.</span> <span id="s2009">But I let -- dropped the thing, I mean it didn’t -- it -- it just disappeared from my memory.</span> <span id="s2010">And then we went and had that reunion.</span> <span id="s2011">I said, “Can anybody tell me if Charlotte is here?</span> <span id="s2012">How would I recognize her?”</span> <span id="s2013">And we met.</span> <span id="s2014">And the f -- we hugged and the first thing she said, “Now we can have that piece of pastry together.</span> <span id="s2015">We never had it, because we were arrested together.”</span> <span id="s2016">I said, “What do you mean?</span> <span id="s2017">We first had the pastry and it’s when we walked out of the pastry shop that we were arrested.”</span> <span id="s2018">And here we were arguing about that.</span> <span id="s2019">Secondly she said, “You know, I felt very guilty.</span> <span id="s2020">We had no business being seen together.”</span> <span id="s2021">Because she looked very Jewish and she said, “We had no --” she was not on our underground network, she was doing some other kind of work.</span> <span id="s2022">She said, “We had no business being seen together.</span> <span id="s2023">It -- I was compromising you.”</span> <span id="s2024">And I compromised myself by being with her.</span> <span id="s2025">And this is how our reunion took place, arguing over pastry.</span> <span id="s2026">But then she told me how she got liberated.</span> <span id="s2027">She was put into jail and knew that in the infirmary of that jail, there was a nurse who worked with the resistance.</span> <span id="s2028">So her goal was to get into that ner -- infirmary.</span> <span id="s2029">So she pretended to have a toothache, very bad toothache and she had two teeth pulled, two perfectly good teeth pulled and -- you know, because she complained about it and all the treatment they had was to pull the teeth.</span> <span id="s2030">And the nurse helped her escape.</span> <span id="s2031">That’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s2032">So it took me almost 50 years to find out -- exactly 50 years to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: And where did she go after?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Oh, th -- she was -- she was part of a -- working with Ose and different kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2035">When the war was over she worked as a social worker with one of the Jewish agencies in Paris.</span> <span id="s2036">And so we aged paralleling.</span> <span id="s2037">And -- but that was the reunion, so that was the first time, took us 50 years to reconnect.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: And I tell that story to the kids and they -- they love that story.</span> <span id="s2040">Makes it real, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2042">Do you still talk -- keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: No.</span> <span id="s2044">Mm-mm, mm-mm.</span> <span id="s2045">No.</span> <span id="s2046">We -- we chatted, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: It’s too many people -- too many thing and then our lives have taken so many different courses, I mean it’s just im-impossible to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: I’m not a very good corresponder.</span> <span id="s2051">Pick up the phone easier, but -- so I had never seen her before, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: [indecipherable] There was one thing on your interview I wa -- two things I wanted you to -- [indecipherable] I mean, to see if they’re still pertinent.</span> <span id="s2053">I just wrote the pages down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: I guess we haven’t gone according to any plan.</span> <span id="s2055">We have just -- it has just emerged, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: Well, yeah, more or less.</span> <span id="s2057">I -- well, I had some of a plan [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Had to get me back on track.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: I -- I have found -- I mean, I -- I don’t know how it appears to you, that it -- that appears completely discombobulated and random, I apologize.</span> <span id="s2060">But I have found that it’s better to try to initiate conversations and for me to listen --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: -- than to follow a strict order of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2064">Be -- things are interconnected, it’s very difficult to put it in categories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2066">And every time -- because now I have a whole series of general themes about what to ask you about and every time you start talking about one, I was thinking about another one [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: And other things came into my mind as I was talking to you, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2069">No, the funny thing is, I look over the -- the things that Arwin asked me to make sure we touched about and we’ve talked about almost all of them.</span> <span id="s2070">Oh yeah, I -- I just want -- there’s -- there’s -- take a look at this.</span> <span id="s2071">This was -- I just wanted you to elaborate on this and this is almost a professional question for when you’re [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2072">Y-You were talking about the -- coaching children and giving them new identities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2074">Oh, this is interesting, what you underlined was when I did my -- when I did my interview in France with Ose, my oral history, in French and I -- the director of Ose, who was the woman I had worked with in camp, colleague of mine, she immedi -- wrote to me and said, “I read your -- I read your interview and you say exactly the same thing that I have always felt.”</span> <span id="s2075">She became a professional social worker, I developed more professionally.</span> <span id="s2076">And all we had to do -- all -- all we could do is produce the cards, look at the suitcases, empty the profe -- th -- th -- the personal things to make a child safe, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s2077">And we had no time to prepare them, to ask them how they feel.</span> <span id="s2078">The kind of things I would do as a professional therapist, to avoid the trauma of going into a new situation without having say good-bye to their parents, without knowing where their parents were.</span> <span id="s2079">With leaving behind everything?</span> <span id="s2080">I mean, these are traumatic situations which, under normal circumstance, I would take weeks to prepare a child for.</span> <span id="s2081">I didn’t have 24 hours.</span> <span id="s2082">And I couldn’t let these thoughts even -- if -- even if they had existed and I was not professional enough to have these thou -- even if they had existed, I couldn’t have had -- let them intrude upon me in my mind.</span> <span id="s2083">I had to tell a child, “You are no longer so and so, you are so and so.</span> <span id="s2084">Remember now, give me your name.”</span> <span id="s2085">No, I had to -- “I have to take your suitcase away, because it has your name on it.”</span> <span id="s2086">I didn’t say, “How do you feel about my taking your suit --” I mean, that’s what I’m talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: The -- the profe -- I’m -- I’m glad I didn’t know enough about -- about how to deal with trauma, otherwise I would have been hampered in -- in my moving fast and so we saved kids life.</span> <span id="s2089">And on the whole, I think that in many ways, when I read -- there have been some studies made on the children, the hidden children.</span> <span id="s2090">More and more there has been.</span> <span id="s2091">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s2092">The -- the first people to speak after the Holocaust were the survivors.</span> <span id="s2093">It took them a long time to talk and they began to talk about their experiences.</span> <span id="s2094">And then the children of survivors talked of their -- what they had in common.</span> <span id="s2095">And it -- and other groups at different times.</span> <span id="s2096">Now, for instance, there were also the children of deportees, that’s more in Europe, that’s not here, because we don’t have that many children here, of people who were deported.</span> <span id="s2097">And then, only very recently, the -- the children who were hidden, sort of felt -- there’s a whole group of them, they have something in common.</span> <span id="s2098">And they didn’t speak and I ask -- I know -- there’s one here -- I mean, there are several here in Chapel Hill, but there is one I know fairly well.</span> <span id="s2099">And she only recently came out of the closet and she say, “I’m talking about it.”</span> <span id="s2100">And she said, “Quite often this was painful.”</span> <span id="s2101">Of course, she lost her parents while she was in hiding and then she stayed with some relatives and well -- came to this country, whatever, I don’t know all the details.</span> <span id="s2102">But she says also, “Since we survived, we didn’t feel that we had a voice in all of this.</span> <span id="s2103">I mean, we were not victims, we survived.”</span> <span id="s2104">And now, all of a sudden, they feel they have something to talk about, because they indeed were victims and they have a lot in common.</span> <span id="s2105">And so now there are the hidden children coming out of the woodwork.</span> <span id="s2106">They have -- they had a big meeting of the hi -- children hidden by Ose in Miami two years ago.</span> <span id="s2107">I didn’t go to that one.</span> <span id="s2108">And there is a newsletter and I’m on the mailing list and I -- there is one -- a huge one in Israel.</span> <span id="s2109">And these kids find they have something in common, because they were hidden and they had their losses and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s2110">And -- why am I telling you that, I lost my train of thought.</span> <span id="s2111">Where we are at?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Well, we were talking about the -- the level of trauma that people ha -- deal with and your perception of the trauma.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Yeah, and that -- but -- a-and the studies, yeah, what I wanted to say is that there were studies made of how these children have adjusted.</span> <span id="s2114">There’s one I have from France and you know, they don’t do any worse or better than the general population.</span> <span id="s2115">They have their share of successes and of divorces and of failed businesses and -- and of successes.</span> <span id="s2116">They -- they really don’t differ statistically from the general population, not that the general population is doing that well in -- you know, I mean it’s ver -- they doing very normally.</span> <span id="s2117">And then -- and one -- as one of the surviving -- one of the hidden children in Paris told me, “Hey, we didn’t do so badly, you know, considering what we gone through.</span> <span id="s2118">Why do you think this is so?”</span> <span id="s2119">And I gave her my interpretation and I said that considering that what is very important is just after the very early years of a child’s life, let’s say the first -- some say it’s the first two, some say it’s the first two, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2120">Most of these children came from intact, nurturing families.</span> <span id="s2121">And what happened to them, happened to the whole family and not within the family.</span> <span id="s2122">So that they survived more psychologically intact, actually.</span> <span id="s2123">If you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s2124">To -- children are -- there are many children today who are dysfunctional because of the pathology within the family.</span> <span id="s2125">Because of parents who don’t get along or -- or whatever it is, or parents who divorce or -- or all kinds of things that happen inside the family.</span> <span id="s2126">What happened to these kids -- and -- and so they lose their nurturing, their loo -- they lose all the si -- sense of stability, they lose a sense of -- of security and what have you.</span> <span id="s2127">But what happened to these hidden kids is that they had good, solid years, early childhood, of nurturing and of -- of -- of -- of -- as -- a stable family situation and they don’t perceive their parents as the perpetrators of terrible things.</span> <span id="s2128">It is -- it happened to the entire family.</span> <span id="s2129">And, if anything, they become concerned about their parents -- about the fate of their parent.</span> <span id="s2130">I ha -- when we’re finished with this, I want to show you a absolutely devastating book.</span> <span id="s2131">I have a book, I think it’s two telephone books of -- that are the children that were deported from France.</span> <span id="s2132">The -- this put together by Serge Clarksfeld and his wife.</span> <span id="s2133">Does the name mean anything?</span> <span id="s2134">Serge Clarksfeld is a lawyer whose parents were deported and he devoted his life t -- he is the one who bought Barbie to France, he and his wife brought Barbie.</span> <span id="s2135">His wife is German and not Jewish and they have devoted their life to hunt the perpetrators and war criminals.</span> <span id="s2136">In the first book he wrote, it was a -- a -- Barbie is -- is very famous for rounding up a whole children’s home called Eezure.</span> <span id="s2137">It was not directly an Ose home, but related to Ose and we had workers in there.</span> <span id="s2138">And here wa -- this was in spring of 1944, April 1944, it was almost over and he rounded up the staff and the children and except for one boy, who happened to visit there and was left off the truck because he was not Jewish, everybody was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2139">Nobody survived, none of the kids, except one of them -- one of the counselor -- I’m -- I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s2140">But there is a mother of the children -- two mothers of the children with the Clarksfelds became active, first of all in founding rap -- Barbie and bringing him to trial and he was brought to trial while we were living in France.</span> <span id="s2141">And we were in front of the prison with each one of us carrying a name of a child, big, big, big panels.</span> <span id="s2142">And what his job was -- became -- was to investigate the identity of each of these children and get as much data on them and pictures of them, so we don’t say 41 children, you say, Bobby and Suzy and Eddie and -- and give them all a name and an identity and he published this book, “The Children of Eezure”.</span> <span id="s2143">And then he became to study the deportation list from France and cull out the children and try to find an identi -- when he published, all over the world.</span> <span id="s2144">And he’s put together the first of what he thinks is a series of books where he has pictures and stories about each one, and there were 10,000 children deported from France.</span> <span id="s2145">So he -- it was published in France and there was an exhibit in the new school in New York and it was published by, I think the New York Press and it was available and so I got it.</span> <span id="s2146">And they are not numbers, they’re kids.</span> <span id="s2147">And there you can see from what loving, nurturing backgrounds they came.</span> <span id="s2148">And now I think this is what I’m tr -- I’m trying to talk about, what these kids went through, I just couldn’t address it, I just couldn’t prepare them.</span> <span id="s2149">I had to move very quickly.</span> <span id="s2150">Does that answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Very well, yes.</span> <span id="s2152">Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s2153">Yeah, I have to tell you, one of the most -- there were two things at Auschwitz that I saw that are similar.</span> <span id="s2154">One -- one is that they have in some of the prison barracks, they have plaques all down the walls, with photographs and little biographies, so that you see that these are people, that you -- and you can sit there -- you could sit there the whole day and read about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: You go to Yad Vashem and you go into the children’s [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: And then there’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: It’s only names.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Just names.</span> <span id="s2160">And it goes on and on, it recite the names -- the names, you hear them on -- we went into Prague, into one of the synagogues.</span> <span id="s2161">There’s nothing on the walls but names, tiny little names.</span> <span id="s2162">That’s the one where Madeline Albright went to.</span> <span id="s2163">I couldn’t go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2166">I had to stay out.</span> <span id="s2167">I walked in and out, it was just too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Well, the other one tha -- the other thing that they have there at Auschwitz is one of the -- one of the buildings is devoted only to collections of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: And they have all these huge piles of shoes and eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s2171">But the one that really [indecipherable] me is the whole room filled with children’s shoes.</span> <span id="s2172">I mean, the shoes are this big.</span> <span id="s2173">And it’s just un -- completely incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s2174">I mean, even standing there in the middle of Auschwitz and have to -- having seen all the adult ones, that people could -- you know.</span> <span id="s2175">And then, being a father and having two little children, you just can’t comprehend it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: I-It’s not -- I -- it’s something that I -- that I can’t understand and it’s -- it’s part of this question that I was asking you before, about trying to ope -- to come to grips now with these other world situations, like in Bosnia or in Rwan-Rwanda, because I feel -- those things feel so far away to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2179">Well, they -- they are far away and at the same time you get so angry about being so helpless and that the world community is so helpless, with all the bodies we have created, like NATO, like United Nation and all that.</span> <span id="s2180">And yet, we still are helpless.</span> <span id="s2181">It’s a little scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: But you know, there’s one more low -- there’s one more little thing about you -- in -- in -- in the story here, you said that the -- that -- that the day that you had to leave Strasbourg, your family, that you actually drove your neighbor’s car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: No, I -- that’s not when we left Strasbourg, that’s when we left Blamont, the place where my parents had already taken up resi -- we had, oh, they lived [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Oh, that was the second time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Yeah, the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: The second --</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: The first time we left -- I mean, we were forced to leave but, it -- it wasn’t because it was an inva -- it was still peace, there was no war yet.</span> <span id="s2188">It was two days before the war, two days.</span> <span id="s2189">But in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: But that -- but the question I have for you, when you tell that story in the video tape, the -- I was -- my -- the -- the question that came to my mind was -- was that moment a turning point for you?</span> <span id="s2191">Was this something that was out of character for you to do, drive a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: Well, I -- I ha -- I had just learned to drive, I mean, in those days, we had one car, obviously, it was my father’s car for business.</span> <span id="s2193">I never got a ride to school or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2194">We walked to everything or take the streetcar.</span> <span id="s2195">So I never learned to ride it -- my -- and my brother used the car for -- help my father, he knew how to drive.</span> <span id="s2196">So, my brother would take our car, but the neighbors, as I said in my story, the neighbors had a car.</span> <span id="s2197">And the male in the family were in the army.</span> <span id="s2198">There was nobody -- but there was a car.</span> <span id="s2199">You know, there was -- there was transportation, they get out from under the German.</span> <span id="s2200">There was nobody to drive it.</span> <span id="s2201">So, I drove the neighbor’s car.</span> <span id="s2202">And there was a handicapped girl and a grandmother in there.</span> <span id="s2203">And it was totally in character for me to do that, because I was a girl scout leader.</span> <span id="s2204">In fact, I drove the car in my girl scout uniform, which in those days, I don’t know what it’s today, was a khaki uniform, with a khaki hat with all kinds of insignias and badges all over me.</span> <span id="s2205">And that gave me an official status, because -- I mean, sometimes I -- sometimes myself, I wa -- I wonder about it, but it was in character for me to do that.</span> <span id="s2206">And I remember as we were on the road, there were -- there was my brother, there was me and there was two other -- two other Jewish families from bila -- from that town.</span> <span id="s2207">We all traveled as a convoy, with people on the road and cars and the defeated army -- French army and soldiers and va -- wagons and -- and at one intersection I was going to be separated from my brother.</span> <span id="s2208">I didn’t know where he was going.</span> <span id="s2209">I don’t know where we were going, we were going.</span> <span id="s2210">We were leaving the Germans behind us.</span> <span id="s2211">And I stopped the car and I got out on the road, with my khaki official uniform and I stopped all traffic and I went through.</span> <span id="s2212">You know, was it out of -- I -- I -- I -- I was pretty determined girl or -- alway -- you know, I had already left, actually.</span> <span id="s2213">When my parents were in Bremel, I went to take a job in Paris as a -- as a early childhood -- in -- in early childhood.</span> <span id="s2214">I was just 20 and when I got to the school there, outside of Paris, the concierge who opened the door for me, asked me what grade I was in.</span> <span id="s2215">You know, I was very young.</span> <span id="s2216">But I took a job in Paris and my mother took very sick and I went home and that’s why I was home when the invasion started and it was a good thing I was home, because we were all together leaving.</span> <span id="s2217">But I was teaching in Paris with the bombing trails and we -- we had -- we -- we -- we were in the shelters and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s2218">No, it was not out of character for me to do that.</span> <span id="s2219">I -- I wish I had known how to drive better, but I got there.</span> <span id="s2220">I got there -- I remember once we were going over some mountain -- there were mountains on the way and my car heating up and I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s2221">And the soldiers pushed me up the hill, you know, because they were walking alongside.</span> <span id="s2222">We didn’t move farther than -- we didn’t move very f -- very fast.</span> <span id="s2223">And we kept on driving and every night by -- we had my grandmother with me, we -- we found some shelter.</span> <span id="s2224">We had all the Shabbas food hanging on the car.</span> <span id="s2225">We had it hanging over the car with -- and we found a bed for my grandmother, we -- and then we slept wherever we could, and we were going and we left everything behind us.</span> <span id="s2226">And we ended up somewhere where we stopped.</span> <span id="s2227">And this is where -- this is where my experience is very special, because -- in a sense that the people who were deported, I think didn’t have that expulsion and that fleeing kind of experience.</span> <span id="s2228">And that’s the one that early on, kind of gave me that empathy feeling for [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: No, it was -- it was something that -- that I assumed, right, because I -- I was a -- I -- that was -- I was the leader of the girl scouts, I was a -- I was -- I did these things and I did some -- but let me such -- say one thing is that when we women, all professionals, all retired, all having worked in similar kinds of situati -- or even together during the war, at -- particularly in Rivesaltes -- when we talked about what we had done, we old ladies really became scared.</span> <span id="s2231">Our daring and our -- the things we did.</span> <span id="s2232">There’s one word -- French word for it, we all used the same word and I’ve been trying to render it in English and I don’t know exactly what it was -- [indecipherable] acrousion, you say bit, you were totally unconscious to do some things like that.</span> <span id="s2233">But it doesn’t render.</span> <span id="s2234">It gets -- you out of your mind to do things like that.</span> <span id="s2235">We were all on the same wavelength and saying, “My God, did we take risk.”</span> <span id="s2236">And that risk taking scared us at this stage of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: What -- wh -- you know, that was a -- one of the hav -- questions, I wanted to ask you about this little story that you told later in the interview, and I think we’ll be done in a moment.</span> <span id="s2238">It’s this story where you -- you met this commissar and you told him that you were working under a false name.</span> <span id="s2239">I -- I didn’t quite understand the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: I don’t understand it today, either, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: But I don’t understand what your -- what the -- the -- the impulse was of what -- what your -- what your invention was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Well, I was trying to thwart any attempt on his part to have me ar -- to -- to arrest -- to arrest me.</span> <span id="s2243">He knew I -- who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: He knew I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: And obviously I had false papers.</span> <span id="s2248">I mean, he could have asked any of his policeman in the city to stop me and ask for my paper.</span> <span id="s2249">That happened all the time.</span> <span id="s2250">And he knew I had false paper.</span> <span id="s2251">And so -- in some very daring gesture, I guess -- I don’t understand it myself, today, sounds completely crazy, but I -- you see, it was the end of the war already.</span> <span id="s2252">It was spring of ‘44 and I guess that was part of it too, the Germans were losing grounds and the collaborators were losing grounds and maybe that was part of it, that he would realize that, you know, himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2255">But I said, rath -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memor-Memorial Museum interview with Simone Lipman.</span> <span id="s2257">This is tape number five, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: -- ready.</span> <span id="s2259">It was spring of ‘44 and I guess that was part of it too, the Germans were losing grounds and the collaborators were losing grounds and maybe that was part of it, that he would realize that, you know, himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2262">But I said, rather than expose myself to the possibility of being arrested and my papers checked -- he could have done it himself in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s2263">I said, I play on both his knowle -- he -- he knew my father.</span> <span id="s2264">He was the commandant of the camp.</span> <span id="s2265">Before he was the commandant of the camp, he was the -- the -- the chief police officer in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s2266">So, he knew my family.</span> <span id="s2267">I didn’t know him then, that was -- my father had some business with him.</span> <span id="s2268">So I thought I playing -- a part of it was playing on that connection, to leave me alone.</span> <span id="s2269">And it worked, what can I say?</span> <span id="s2270">It was -- it -- in retrospect, probably was unnecessary risk taking.</span> <span id="s2271">On the other hand, it worked, so -- it -- it -- in -- in -- it -- he -- it sounds crazy, totally crazy when I think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: No, not necessarily, not if he already knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: Well, it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: And my hunches were right, so that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: Well, I think maybe we should stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: If you feel we have covered everything, I’m more than ready to stop.</span> <span id="s2278">In fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: I think so.</span> <span id="s2280">I think this is plenty.</span> <span id="s2281">I -- I -- I -- I’ve assumed -- I mean everything here -- let me -- I’ll just double check and see.</span> <span id="s2282">Oh, one -- one short thing, I -- I just wondered, could you explain to me -- this is just for -- for -- really for myself, the movement that you made from Rivesaltes to Limoge?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Oh no, here -- about the movement I made?</span> <span id="s2284">What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Oh, you started -- you started the f -- the first -- was in Rivesaltes, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: No, see my parents -- I -- I worked in Rivesaltes, my parents were right here, somewhere right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: In the -- very close to the demarcation line, right here in the peri -- no, here, Perigure.</span> <span id="s2289">This is not right, this map is wrong.</span> <span id="s2290">Perigure was not in -- this is all wrong.</span> <span id="s2291">Perigure is on this side of the line, not on this side of the line, this is the demarcation line.</span> <span id="s2292">This is much too far in.</span> <span id="s2293">Perigure is -- is the area where my parents lived and it was not in the -- in the occupied zone, it was on the unoccupied zone.</span> <span id="s2294">So this is wrong, here.</span> <span id="s2295">The -- Perigure should be right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: But what was it that made you move from working in this camp, to moving to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: But Limoge is not a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: What wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: Limoge is a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: And -- and Chatarro is just a city in which I took residence, because that’s where we hid kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: See, between -- first of all, this camp in Rivesaltes was the -- Rivesaltes was close.</span> <span id="s2304">And from Rivesaltes, I tried to go to Gerse, which was even a worse camp.</span> <span id="s2305">And they didn’t let me in any more.</span> <span id="s2306">But they were -- some people were in -- in the -- in a s-supervised residency outside of Gerse, and I stayed there for a very, very short while, because I was really sick.</span> <span id="s2307">I had jaundice, I was yellow all over.</span> <span id="s2308">So I went back to my parents farm, and I -- took me a couple of months to recover.</span> <span id="s2309">I didn’t have any medication, I was just wait until it was over.</span> <span id="s2310">But the farm was here, near Perigure and Perigure is not here, Perigure is down here.</span> <span id="s2311">Better check it on your maps.</span> <span id="s2312">So Perigure is somewhere down here.</span> <span id="s2313">So I stayed the farm.</span> <span id="s2314">Then, the camp had closed, because all the people had been deported, so -- and they didn’t let me come into Gerse and so I went to work in the children’s home outside of Limoge.</span> <span id="s2315">Limoge is not a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: You have the camps mar-marked in triangles, so Limoge has a circle, that’s a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: And so, outside of Limoge was a children’s home called Poulousant and there was a chief counselor until the end of four -- we are in ‘42 now, until the -- and I worked there f -- until ‘43 -- for almost a year.</span> <span id="s2320">And when the children’s homes were closed, and I was recruited in this underground network and I asked to be stationed in Chatarro, which is a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: It’s just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: And that -- that was when you changed your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2325">Yeah, you have all the papers at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s2326">I have them all here, but I have copies of them here.</span> <span id="s2327">So, I didn’t make myself change anything, just is -- you know, we traveled the -- in these days.</span> <span id="s2328">There were trains, but you never know whether you could get on one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: It was so mobbed.</span> <span id="s2331">There was horrible scene, but -- and so this is where I took residence.</span> <span id="s2332">And the headquarters really, of this whole area here, was in Limoge.</span> <span id="s2333">Are we still on tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Just to tell you how little I was aware of the distance and the dangers, when I -- when -- [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: -- beginning of tape three.</span> <span id="s2337">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: The -- the leader of our -- or the organizer of our underground network at Ose, George Garell, in 1947 published a book on the -- the work of Ose under the German occupation of France, from 1940-44.</span> <span id="s2339">And there wa -- it is part of a book on the activity of the Jewish organization in France during the occupation.</span> <span id="s2340">And in giving me the book, he wrote down, “To Simone Weil, un souvenir des anee difficile e exaltant vicky ensemble.</span> <span id="s2341">Lette per vrai que da fuess de leve les mountine.</span> <span id="s2342">Vous l’avez prouve.</span> <span id="s2343">A mikel d’hommage.”</span> <span id="s2344">“To Simone Weil, in memory of the exalting and difficult years lived together.</span> <span id="s2345">Isn’t it true that faith can lift mountains.</span> <span id="s2346">You have proved it.”</span> <span id="s2347">Amic -- friendly -- I don’t know -- hommage.</span> <span id="s2348">And signed by George Garell.</span> <span id="s2349">He was a fantastic leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: He -- he was the leader of the OSE?</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: No, he was the leader of the underground network.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: He was an engineer by training and he was so moved by an experience he had in Lyon, when he was part o -- that he was with a group of adults and children, had been arrested and although he was a ver -- Jewishly very fringe and very secular, he felt a need to work with -- to help the Jewish people in France.</span> <span id="s2354">And he -- he was a very personable guy and he was -- he had the lists of the children and the -- knew the movements of the children, he knew was going on and he -- he traveled around the country, touching base with all of us workers, pretending to travel, I believe -- I -- I don't have a confirmation -- as a wine salesman and everything being coded and having all his material, on the work of the network in such a way that -- pretending to be a wine salesman made it possible for him.</span> <span id="s2355">He brought us the money that we needed, he gave us the news.</span> <span id="s2356">He made the necessary contacts so that we could function.</span> <span id="s2357">He died quite a number of years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Well let me ask you this big, general question.</span> <span id="s2359">After having gone through all of this, [indecipherable] the -- the intervening years and looking back on it, does it -- how -- how does it affect your perception of human beings in general you know, mankind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: It’s a big question.</span> <span id="s2361">On the one hand, I cannot get over of the inhumanity of man against man.</span> <span id="s2362">I mean, you see it daily on television.</span> <span id="s2363">The -- the -- the -- the sheer -- the brutality, the -- the senseless brutality with which people can act towards each other.</span> <span id="s2364">And yet, on the other hand, the redeeming peace is those who help.</span> <span id="s2365">Last night on the radio there was an interview with the woman who has sheltered Anne Frank, there is an anniversary, there was something on public radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: But -- but an interview with her and you know, there is all these people who -- who have the condition of man at heart and who work to improve the world, wherever it is, when -- whatever it is, so I don’t know it’s balance, but really the inhumanity is just -- it’s rampant, it’s everywhere, it’s in our local police, it’s in the army, it’s everywhere.</span> <span id="s2368">And it’s -- that’s -- it’s devastating and I -- I don’t know what -- but it’s -- and you know -- but brutality and enjoying violence has been around for a long time.</span> <span id="s2369">Go back to the Roman times, when they watched the slaves being thrown to the beasts in the circuses, that was -- that was part of it, so -- I mean, the brutalit -- they were -- how people can -- to-today -- you hear in the news this morning that the Tutus go with machetes to cut up their neighbor.</span> <span id="s2370">Is there any -- any -- that’s human beings.</span> <span id="s2371">That -- that’s -- it’s devastating.</span> <span id="s2372">And then you lee -- read of acts of heroism here and there and I don’t know if it balances, but I -- I think it does to a certain degree.</span> <span id="s2373">Veri -- sometimes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2374">It’s very, very discouraging.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: And now, the interview with Barbara Rodbell --</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: -- that I watched.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: I know her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: She said that at the end of the war, she, I guess, fell in love with a German psychiatrist --</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: I don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: -- who had been -- someone who had gi-given tremendous help to the underground --</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: In providing pharmaceuticals and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: -- drugs and things like that.</span> <span id="s2386">And that the demise of their relationship was -- as much as she adored him, was that he was so devastated by the war, that he had decided he couldn’t have children.</span> <span id="s2387">That he just couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: -- couldn’t go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: And she knew that she had to have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2393">She has four, I think.</span> <span id="s2394">I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: I think so.</span> <span id="s2396">But it’s a very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s2398">When I first came to Chapel Hill -- am I still on tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: It’s on.</span> <span id="s2400">If you want me to turn it off, I can turn it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A:
