do you have things you want to start with?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: Well, first of all I’d like to show my veracity.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: But nobody’s questioning veracity, so I don’t understand what -- what it is that you think you have to prove.</span> <span id="s14">I mean, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: What -- what I -- what I like to do is start -- in order for my testimony, my recollections to be meaningful to any future researcher, there should be no doubt in whoever is going to go through it mind, that the person that states these things had real access and is the person he represents himself to be.</span> <span id="s16">Now you say you don’t doubt who I am.</span> <span id="s17">You still don’t know me from Adam.</span> <span id="s18">As far as I’m co -- you’re concerned, I could have -- I can be anybody.</span> <span id="s19">I could have [indecipherable] in the books.</span> <span id="s20">What proof do -- what -- you have no knowledge except my word that I am Jakuv Mozelsio, that I was born in Lódz 1924 and so on.</span> <span id="s21">But if I present you with documentation, then you are my witness, as far as the future researchers are concerned.</span> <span id="s22">You follow my meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s27">All right, I can start off by showing my birth certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you have this during the whole period?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Your birth certificate?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, I obtained that from Lódz, a copy actually, in 1969.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: So it’s Jakuv, J-a-k-u-v?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: M-o-z-e-l-s-i -- s-i-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Mozelsio?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And it’s 4 - 11 - ’24, which -- and Rolfe is your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: There’s a similar birth certificate of my sister, who is still alive, and she is -- right now is out in Los Angeles with her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s43">And she is --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: About three and a half years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Marion is three --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: -- Marion Mozelsio, and born 16 - 4 - 1921.</span> <span id="s48">Also in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Right, and as you see, the most important thing, which makes me so unique, is my father’s occupation.</span> <span id="s50">Because without my father’s occupation I wouldn’t be right now here, sitting talking to you.</span> <span id="s51">This is the key to my uniqueness.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Garbadz?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Garbadge.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Garbadge.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: A leather tanner.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And you said there were what, three leather tanneries in --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Ba -- there were basically four -- Lódz was a textile center.</span> <span id="s58">We called the -- Lódz was called before the war, the Polish Manchester.</span> <span id="s59">And the tanneries were really a minor industry, the Lódz.</span> <span id="s60">There were four of them, all three Jewish owned -- no, all four Jewish owned.</span> <span id="s61">Three of them specialized in what they call upper leather, supp leather, one specialized in sole leather only.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: In s -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Sole leather.</span> <span id="s64">Shoe leather.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Oh, ah, ah, ah, sole.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Sole.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: My father’s tannery was the supp leather, upper leather.</span> <span id="s69">Although he was a master tanner and he could produce any type of leather.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Did you work in that -- in the tannery also?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, I did -- no, I wa -- I was b -- I was born in the tannery.</span> <span id="s72">We lived --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Really in the tannery?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Ah -- oh yea -- well, it was a compound that was in -- it was a -- that consisted of the tannery and a housing complex.</span> <span id="s75">The housing -- the hou -- apartment house was occupied by partners and family only.</span> <span id="s76">So I was actually born in the tannery, on the same yard.</span> <span id="s77">And the tannery was a -- my playground, considering that we lived on the outskirts of Lódz -- in Poland there was no such thing as suburbs, a city just gradually tapered out.</span> <span id="s78">And it -- a leather tannery being a smelly and pretty dirty business, was by necessity located somewhere where -- pretty far out, away from the center.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: How does one get the -- the leather?</span> <span id="s80">The -- the skins?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I’d say it’s a very complex process.</span> <span id="s82">You start the -- actually, leather is a -- they’re two separate words.</span> <span id="s83">We start out with the hide, and when we say hide, we mean a skin of an animal beginning from the time when it’s removed from the carcass up til the tissues are saturated with some chemical that will stop it from deteriorating or rotting.</span> <span id="s84">That means -- we call it a hide.</span> <span id="s85">That part of process -- and i -- it’s a -- it’s a length -- it takes even today with modern methods, it takes anywhere from four to six weeks to process a hide into a finished product.</span> <span id="s86">And the reason I say today because in 1946 - ’47, I worked in a leather tannery in Philadelphia, for two years.</span> <span id="s87">And the process was virtually identical.</span> <span id="s88">Matter of fact, the machine I worked, I -- I was assigned to, the particular machine, was identical with the machine that we had back home, there was virtually no difference.</span> <span id="s89">The same machine, same thing, same way, same method.</span> <span id="s90">So, ou call a hide all the way up to the tanning process.</span> <span id="s91">The minute it’s tanned, that means the tissues are permeated with some chemical, from then on it’s leather.</span> <span id="s92">And all consecutive stages of it, we talk in terms of leather.</span> <span id="s93">The tannery was my playground because there were only the Jews of Lódz resided in the city, in center city.</span> <span id="s94">And as you went out to the peripheries, there were less and less Jews.</span> <span id="s95">The peripheries were populated by blue collar Gentiles.</span> <span id="s96">Especially that the native Poles were a minority in Lódz.</span> <span id="s97">Lódz had close to a million population, something like 800,000.</span> <span id="s98">There was about 250,000 Jews, about a hun -- 200,000 native Germans, which was termed in German the Volksdeutsch.</span> <span id="s99">So the Poles were really a minority.</span> <span id="s100">They were hi -- and there were streets in the city, when we talk about the city, where -- apartment houses where the only Gentile was the janitor.</span> <span id="s101">The entire apartment house complex was part -- occupied by Jewish families.</span> <span id="s102">For instance, the friend of mine with whom I’m staying right now in Silver Spring he lived on Piotkowska 20, which is center city.</span> <span id="s103">And it was a gigantic apartment house, two courtyards, house at least six, 800 apartments.</span> <span id="s104">And the only Pole was the janitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: And was this typical of the way in which the groups lived, that there was mostly separation between the groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yes, yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So you had no Gentile friends, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, well, in my case, there were on the -- to the best of my memory, I lived on a dead end -- you know, it would help us, you have that map, it’ll be a great help if we could kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: This is the ghetto, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No, this is the -- this is Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Oh, that’s Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Right.</span> <span id="s113">Now keep in mind, I didn’t make that for you, this is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Right, right, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Matter of fact, this is part of a collage.</span> <span id="s116">This is one half of a collage that I made for my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: So this is where the tannery was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Right, this is the -- this was the tannery, and this is the ghetto boundary, the future ghetto boundary.</span> <span id="s119">The Jews really occupied densely, the area from Balloot mart -- market -- going this way, which would be -- this map is very wrong.</span> <span id="s120">This is north, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Right, right, so going north.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Going north.</span> <span id="s123">The center of the city was the s -- [indecipherable] is Freedom Square [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s124">And that -- the densely populate -- the poorer Jews lived between Belt mark -- market and that’s [indecipherable] more or less here.</span> <span id="s125">That -- that was Balotte, or Balote.</span> <span id="s126">This is the old part of Lódz.</span> <span id="s127">And the new part of Lódz was centered more or less around Pietma Center Piotkowska with all -- the sizes are not shown, this densely [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: And this was all Jewish populated.</span> <span id="s130">So you see us who come out here, that was very scarce.</span> <span id="s131">This little street -- we -- I live on a dead end street, and our factory compound was actually closing the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s133">And how do you pronounce that?</span> <span id="s134">Quid --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Kwizinska.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Kwizinska.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: While the Poles were very hard Polanizing, actually the original name of the city -- of the street was feesh -- the Germans named it during the 1917 occupation, Fishagossa.</span> <span id="s138">And then the Poles called it Walitsa Fishaira.</span> <span id="s139">Apparently Fisher must have been the man that started the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s140">But the Polanizing pressure came on, and everything got Polanized, so they done away with Fisher, and they -- up til ’39, a lot of people, Jews especially, still called it Fishagossa, not Kwizinska.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: And why is there a number one to five here?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Because that’s my legend.</span> <span id="s143">The legend is --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Oh I see, I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: -- one to five, fall 1924, til winter ’39.</span> <span id="s146">And then January 20th, 1945 to October ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: To October, right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Because I left --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: You just -- you left the places in this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Right, I left the -- I was born there, and I occupied a little of the premises til November, December ’39.</span> <span id="s151">Then I relocated [indecipherable] 10 in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s152">And eventually, on the 19th of January, when I was liberated by the Red Army, I just went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: And I spent, again, th-the period between January 20th and October ’45, or when I left Lódz and Poland permanent.</span> <span id="s155">I was again at Kwizinska in my original home.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: And is your father here most of the time, or is he -- is the tan -- is the tannery moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: As of right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s159">I mean, when you moved here [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well -- wa -- what -- wa -- wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Or maybe we should go back farther.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well, what happened was the tannery was -- my father was a person with no formal education.</span> <span id="s163">He only attended a chaider, traditional chaider.</span> <span id="s164">However, he was self educated in his -- in his teens, he -- he was born into a very religious Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s165">My grandfather was a Hassid, a follower of the Alexander [indecipherable] which makes him a real Hassid, he made annual pilgrimages to the court of the rabbi.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t know whether you’re familiar with these things, are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I -- I mean, I’m -- I’m talking, but I don’t know whether I should say these things --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: -- because you know them, or whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: No, no, you s -- just explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: And so my grandparents had -- my paternal grandparents had about eight, nine children.</span> <span id="s173">I believe five boys and -- six boys and two girls.</span> <span id="s174">And the boys were of the pretty independent mind, and my grandfather was a very strict person.</span> <span id="s175">Especially that -- back then -- we talk now about the late 1800, beginning 1900, children were considered a labor asset.</span> <span id="s176">So as soon as the kids reached an age of let’s say eight or so, my grandfather put them to work.</span> <span id="s177">And they worked for him til they reached the age of reason, which would be something like 12 or 14, and at the age of 14, they simply disappeared.</span> <span id="s178">My father himself was the second born, and he run away from home at the age of 14.</span> <span id="s179">Pretty far, too.</span> <span id="s180">He run away all the way 300 miles away.</span> <span id="s181">And he stayed away til he was 19.</span> <span id="s182">At the age of 19 he was -- at the age of 14 he was self supporting.</span> <span id="s183">He had the trade that he learned between the age of nine and 14 from my grandfather, in my grandfather’s shop.</span> <span id="s184">He was so good that he was hired as a expert, or experienced worker.</span> <span id="s185">And he didn’t come home til he was 19 where he could stand up to my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And all the boys did this, they all --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: And all the boys except the youngest one, did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Was he physically rough on them as a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Well, corporal punishment was normal and expected and accepted.</span> <span id="s190">In addition, this is the period when you’re going to look at it this way, that really Poland was feudal.</span> <span id="s191">Renaissance and the Napoleonic era did not come to Russian occupied Poland at all.</span> <span id="s192">So Poland was basically feudal.</span> <span id="s193">However, the Jews, western Jews and Russian Jews, embraced a movement called the Haskallah, if you’re familiar with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Why don’t you explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Enlightenment.</span> <span id="s196">They felt that the future is in aligning themselves with the new era that went along with the -- Napoleon’s armies of education, of reaching for more material aims.</span> <span id="s197">So my father, while I guess he was absent from home, he did embrace the Haskallah movement, the enlightenment and he taught himself how to read German, how to read Polish.</span> <span id="s198">He read -- was wi -- he read a lot Polish -- in Polish, a lot in German.</span> <span id="s199">Whether it was -- I don’t think there was much choice, you read whatever was available.</span> <span id="s200">Even in my time, I read anything that was available.</span> <span id="s201">I was not particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Tell me, did your father’s sisters run away too, or was it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No, th-they stayed home.</span> <span id="s204">And then I think when my father was about 18 or 19, he embraced the Tolstoyan philosophy.</span> <span id="s205">He became a follower of Leo Tolstoy.</span> <span id="s206">As you know, Leo Tolstoy was not also a auth -- not also -- not only an author, but he also formed a specific way of life.</span> <span id="s207">I think there’s still a foundation somewhere upstate New York that was run by his sister -- fa -- by his daughter, sure.</span> <span id="s208">I wa -- I passed by Binghamton and I saw si -- a sign on the outskirts of bir -- Binghamton, something about Tolstoy and there is the foundation still there functioning.</span> <span id="s209">And that’s why my father, for example, ne -- was not a smoker.</span> <span id="s210">My father did not smoke, that was part of that Tolstoyan way of life.</span> <span id="s211">No whiskey [indecipherable] just didn’t drink, either way.</span> <span id="s212">He was not a glutton.</span> <span id="s213">That’s again the Tolstoyan principle, don’t overeat.</span> <span id="s214">Eventually he -- while he embraced it in his formative years, therefore it -- some of it, some principles of it stayed with him for the remainder of his life.</span> <span id="s215">It also involved some intangibles like honesty, like forthrightness.</span> <span id="s216">It’s a -- it’s a way of life.</span> <span id="s217">Tolstoy formulated a complete way of life, to lead a clean life, both ways, physically and philosophically.</span> <span id="s218">Eventually my father became a member of the bund, that was the Jewish Socialist Worker’s movement.</span> <span id="s219">And he was capable, while my father’s ancestors, that’s my grandfather, I imagine even people before my grandfather, were all leather tanners because in the medieval times, tanning was one of the few trades -- [phone ringing] -- Is this going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s222">I didn’t know, I thought we were just talking preparatory.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Tanning -- I don’t know whether -- a-again, you know quite a bit about me because I sent some materials.</span> <span id="s225">I don’t know anything about you.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t know how much knowledge and what areas of Jewish history is your expertise.</span> <span id="s227">So I’m really --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: You have to tell me everything, because you’re not just talking to me.</span> <span id="s229">When you put something --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: But a -- but a -- I don’t know how much am I repeating myself and it sounds to you like old -- old story.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: No, you misunderstand something.</span> <span id="s232">When you do something for an interview, even if I know things, like what Haskallah is, it’s very important that you explain, because you never know who is going to listen and what they understand.</span> <span id="s233">So you must explain as if I know very little.</span> <span id="s234">That’s the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: All right, let’s -- let’s make a deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: When I use a word like -- a term like Haskallah and then offer an explanation, if you know about Haskallah, and you don’t think that my explanation of [indecipherable] me stands for, correct me, cause I don’t want to sound like a fool.</span> <span id="s238">So if you do know about Haskallah from other sources, am I correct in the way I presented it?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Yeah, I think it’s a ger -- I mean, I’m not -- I -- I -- I mean, I’m not an expert in Jewish history.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Well, it translates into --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: -- enlightenment, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Enlightenment, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Anyway, going back to medieval times as we just should do, the medieval girls did not accept Jews, and there were very few trades available permitted to the Jews.</span> <span id="s245">The Jews were limited to money changing, trade, some thing -- whatever.</span> <span id="s246">But not skilled craftsmen.</span> <span id="s247">One of the few exceptions in crafts and trades was leather tanning.</span> <span id="s248">It was dirty, was filthy, the way it was done in medieval times, and it required a great amount of skill.</span> <span id="s249">And apparently the medieval Gentile had no inclination either to get himself all dirtied up with filthy rotting rawhides, nor put his mind to the comp -- to the complexities of tanning, converting a raw hide into a finished product.</span> <span id="s250">So that was one of the trades open to Jews, and my grandfather was a medieval leather tanner.</span> <span id="s251">However, he did not make a go out of it in his adult -- young adulthood.</span> <span id="s252">And he had to support his family by other means.</span> <span id="s253">My grandm other descended -- dese -- is a descendant of the first settlers in Lódz.</span> <span id="s254">My grandmother’s name -- maiden name was Lieverman, however there was, because there were so few Jews in [indecipherable] intermarriages in families were common, and her stepfather’s name was Hanoch Łódzki -- Łódzki.</span> <span id="s255">Łódzki means, of Lódz.</span> <span id="s256">Therefore, if we go back to let’s say 1820, when Jews only had the -- the given names, and they had to be identified by some kind of a surname or a handle, this was Hanoch from Lódz.</span> <span id="s257">Łódzki is an adjective.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Well, the word -- the letter L --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: L with a slash.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: -- with a slash is pronounced ew, like a W.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And it’s sky at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: L-o-d-z-k-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: K-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: And always a -- with a slash on top which makes it a U. Łódzki.</span> <span id="s266">Just like Jakuv could be spelled two ways.</span> <span id="s267">I can spell Jakuv with a U, or in Poland I did not spell Jakuv with a U.</span> <span id="s268">In Poland we spelled Jakuv with an O with a vertical slash above it.</span> <span id="s269">Poles use the U two different ways.</span> <span id="s270">So his name was Łódzki which definitely puts his ancestry way back into the first settlers of Lódz.</span> <span id="s271">And he was quite -- and her family was quite prosperous.</span> <span id="s272">Apparently my grandfather’s family was not prosperous.</span> <span id="s273">He was born in a little town of Skierniewice, somewhere within I would say 20 - 30 mile.</span> <span id="s274">It’s a hamlet.</span> <span id="s275">And the marriage must have been a brokered marriage, as all the marriages back then were.</span> <span id="s276">A usually young man went for the dowry.</span> <span id="s277">I mean, let’s call a spade a spade.</span> <span id="s278">So apparently my grandmother’s family was capable of offering a sizable dowry, and to satisfy the [indecipherable] family of my grandfather and the marriage took place with the condition that my grandfather will move from Skierniewice to Lódz where her family will kind of see to it that they will be able to become economically viable.</span> <span id="s279">And they opened for him, or purchased for him, a grocery store somewhere -- Staramiasta, somewhere in this area.</span> <span id="s280">Barlutai was farther down, Staramiasta was coming up.</span> <span id="s281">My grandfather was not successful as a businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: He was very strong minded, and he did not appreciate his wife’s family interference.</span> <span id="s284">So he picked up his wife and kiddies and went back to Skierniewice to get out from under his wife’s parents’ thumb.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Wait a minute, I just want to check something.</span> <span id="s286">Why don’t you just talk for a moment here.</span> <span id="s287">Just --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s290">Want to just say hello?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Yeah, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s293">Okay.</span> <span id="s294">All right, so he leaves, and went back to the he --</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: And went back to Skierniewice, and all he could do there is pick up the leather tanning in that hamlet.</span> <span id="s296">And somehow that didn’t work out either, economically.</span> <span id="s297">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Is that because all the sons left?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: -- because it just -- either he didn’t produce good enough leather commercially, he must have been behind his times in the product.</span> <span id="s302">So he came back into Lódz and started a upholstery shop.</span> <span id="s303">And that’s where his boys were trained in upholstery business.</span> <span id="s304">And that’s was my father’s occupation or trade at the age of 14 when he ran away from home.</span> <span id="s305">He was a experienced upholsterer.</span> <span id="s306">He was hired to run a shop at the age of 14.</span> <span id="s307">That must have gone on til the war broke out, the first World War.</span> <span id="s308">I don’t know about the future wars, but in the past wars, the one I know of, which is the first and the second World War, the minute the rumor of war starts, leather becomes gold.</span> <span id="s309">And as soon as the war started, there was a scarcity of finished leather and my grandfather went back to the original leather trade which all a sudden became very profitable.</span> <span id="s310">And I heard tales that he used to tan the hides in my grandmother’s kitchen, if you can imagine the kitchen.</span> <span id="s311">Well, it was illegal, because all this was black market, what we would call it in modern terms.</span> <span id="s312">Back then it was just forbidden by authorities, so was -- you would buy some hides off a peasant and --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Now is your dad working for him at this point?</span> <span id="s314">Does he come -- now he’s come back home --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: My dad came back si -- sometime in that -- at the end of that period, that means around 1916 - ’17.</span> <span id="s318">And he joined my grand -- the -- the leather trade.</span> <span id="s319">The demand for leather was so great and so profitable that all sudden all the sons engathered, and they all started producing leather.</span> <span id="s320">And all of them became knowledgeable in leather tanning.</span> <span id="s321">However, my father had the greater expectations of himself and he single-handed made the leap from medieval to modern leather tanning.</span> <span id="s322">He taught himself German, and he read -- studied German biochemistry books, because there are no book that relates specific to tanning.</span> <span id="s323">Maybe right now there are because we live in specialized times, but back then if you want a formal education in that particular profession, you had to go into it by chemistry.</span> <span id="s324">And the only biochemical -- biochemistry available was in German.</span> <span id="s325">And I still -- in th -- our house, my father continued try to improve his methods, he continued to receive from Germany, German textbooks in biochemistry.</span> <span id="s326">And he became -- he made that transition from medieval to modern process.</span> <span id="s327">He became a master tanner, one of the best known master tanners in all of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Now when you say master tanner, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: All be like a boss.</span> <span id="s330">A master tanner would be somebody that knows the process, both ways.</span> <span id="s331">The particular chemicals that -- and the -- the proportions, the mix of chemicals applied to each stage, and there are many stages, because you start off with a hairy piece of hide.</span> <span id="s332">First you got to get rid of the hair -- the hair, then you got to -- this -- and all si -- all this is done with a specific chemical.</span> <span id="s333">Some of these chemicals permeate the tissues, and before the next chemical is applied, they had to be flushed out.</span> <span id="s334">So it is a complex knowledge, which he had to learn himself out of German textbooks.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Now, when you were born in ’24 --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I was born in ’24.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Your father by then is a master tanner, or a ser --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: So by 1919, when the war ended, they -- my grandfather and his sons, two sons, three sons -- no, two sons -- my grandfather and two sons became wealthy enough from this semi [indecipherable] war time production of leather to acquire the property on Kwizinska 14, which was a factory building.</span> <span id="s341">And installed in it modern leather tanning equipment imported from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And when does your father get married, and to whom does he marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Oh, wait a minute, that was -- that was like in 1919, and because originally -- and originally there’s -- the plant was owned -- established and owned by my grandfather and my two older uncles, Israel and Simon.</span> <span id="s344">However, my rel -- my father’s was [indecipherable] that’s right, excelled in the knowledge, both my grandfather and his brothers, so they hired him to become the master tanner, in charge of the production.</span> <span id="s345">And you say -- asked me before what it was -- mean to be a master tanner, master tanner means the -- being a -- the chemist, knowing the chemicals, the mix, the application and so on.</span> <span id="s346">In addition, the master tanner also has to know, and be able to instruct -- hired workers who had no skill in that trade, how to use the mechanical part of it because there were also machines that processed the product at different stages in different ways.</span> <span id="s347">Some of them shaved it, because basically a hide is too thick, has to be more or less brought down to a specific thickness, especially that after tanning, the tissues do tend to swell.</span> <span id="s348">So if you start off with a raw hide, let’s say like a quarter inch thick, after it’s tanned, it’s three-quarters of an inch.</span> <span id="s349">Well, you can not use a finished product three-quarter of a inch thick for a upper shoe, or for a pocketbook or a belt or anything else.</span> <span id="s350">So this had to be -- the thickness had to be reduced by mechanical means, or shaved on a power machine.</span> <span id="s351">And then there was a machine that would soften the leather because at some stage of the process they were coming out as hard as a board, and they have to be like, flexible.</span> <span id="s352">And that was done by a machine.</span> <span id="s353">And then the final glaze was not a paint, but was applied again by heat, by a steel roller striking the face -- the grain of the leather that was prepared before with some type of preparation and that will produce a glaze.</span> <span id="s354">So it was a mechanical process, therefore, a master tanner had not only be -- had to be not only knowledgeable in the chemical -- in the chemistry of it, but also in the mechanical in order to instruct or pass judgment on the performance of the workers.</span> <span id="s355">So that’s a nutshell, is a master tanner.</span> <span id="s356">The man in charge of the entire production, knowledgeable in each phase.</span> <span id="s357">And by 19 -- I believe ’21, my father earned enough -- saved enough money.</span> <span id="s358">My father married, I believe in 1919, something like that, because my sister was born in 1921.</span> <span id="s359">And -- and around 1921 - 1922, my father brought himself into the partnership.</span> <span id="s360">And moved into the factory complex.</span> <span id="s361">Up til then, while he was employed, he did not live on the premises.</span> <span id="s362">The premises there -- the apartment building within the compound was restricted to owners only.</span> <span id="s363">As long as he was not an owner, not a -- a matter of fact, he lived right on the corner, in an apartment on the corner of the middle street.</span> <span id="s364">That will be 107 Demillaskaga.</span> <span id="s365">That’s where my sister was born.</span> <span id="s366">That’s the way I’m kind of trying to get the chronological data because I know my sister was born on Demillaskaga 107 in a high -- rented apartment, while I was born three years later already on Kwizinska on the premises of the compound.</span> <span id="s367">And by then my father became a partner to the [indecipherable] to the factory.</span> <span id="s368">And there just very few Jewish families, and I remember them well.</span> <span id="s369">There was at 111 Yumanoskaga, which is just a few houses down, there was some kind of textile product plant, again with living quarters, owned by a family named Friedlander.</span> <span id="s370">They were very wealthy.</span> <span id="s371">Must have been a very successful plant.</span> <span id="s372">Then going ho -- there was -- but there were no boys my age, there was a girl my sister’s age, a daughter, and my sister was friendly with her.</span> <span id="s373">Then going farther toward the outskirts, at about 137 - 140 Yumanoskaga was another textile processing recycling plant, owned by a Jew named Osher.</span> <span id="s374">The reason I’m naming these names is because by the -- by the oddest quirk of fate, I came across these people many, many years later.</span> <span id="s375">I came across the name of Osher, Heinrich Osher in the chronicles of Lódz ghetto, that the -- put it in context, that there was a Heinrich Osher who married a Gentile woman, and lived outside the ghetto, and that Pruschidsky puts together some kind of a story about it.</span> <span id="s376">And I knew the man because the head of the family, Mr. Osher was a widower and he had two sons of the first marriage, Heinrich was the youngest son of the first marriage, and they had two children, a son and a daughter after the second marriage, and the son and daughter of the second marriage were my age -- the son was my age, and the daughter was my sister’s age.</span> <span id="s377">So that was another Jewish family when my sister already had two friends, girl friends, Jewish girl friends.</span> <span id="s378">And I had at least one playmate.</span> <span id="s379">I would say up to the age of three or four, I played with Gentile kids because Kwizinska was an odd street.</span> <span id="s380">There were only six residential properties on the left side.</span> <span id="s381">The right side was a big fence with a wild garden behind it.</span> <span id="s382">So you’re talking about six properties, maybe 30 - 40 Gentile families, and us, the Jewish family, closing off the dead end street.</span> <span id="s383">And I played with the Gentile kids my age til I was about three or four.</span> <span id="s384">But once they reached the age of three or four, five, they already became permeated with the anti-Semitism at home and church and they -- I became ostracized.</span> <span id="s385">They wouldn’t play with me any more.</span> <span id="s386">And from then on I was leading a pretty solitary life.</span> <span id="s387">I had no playmates except when I would venture out to see that fellow Osher, his name was -- his name was Solomon.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Solomon?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah, we call him Sollik.</span> <span id="s390">He’s alive and kicking in Israel [indecipherable] I heard about.</span> <span id="s391">And out of necessity -- now my -- now we talking [indecipherable] we talk about my father.</span> <span id="s392">My mother, in contrast to my father was a well educated person.</span> <span id="s393">My mother did not -- family did not originate from Lódz.</span> <span id="s394">They were immigrants from Ukraine.</span> <span id="s395">And they came from a little town in ukra -- western Ukraine named Schwub.</span> <span id="s396">My mother was born in Lódz.</span> <span id="s397">The Russian and Ukrainian Jews were much -- were not Hassidic, and were much more for enlightment education.</span> <span id="s398">Therefore my mother attended a gimnasium, which is equivalent to high school, and graduated from a gimnasium.</span> <span id="s399">The gimnasium and the lyceum, that’s the two additional years preparative for college.</span> <span id="s400">My mother was fluent in Russian, both in speech and writing.</span> <span id="s401">My mother spoke accentless Polish, and wrote perfect, correct Polish, while my father never managed Polish at all and spoke broken Polish.</span> <span id="s402">My father’s native language was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s403">He would navigate in Polish, but it definitely was not the grammatical Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Did your mother speak Yiddish as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: My mother no -- well, in addition to flawless Polish, perfect Russian, good German, not so much in language as in reading and writing, she spoke Yiddish in two dialects.</span> <span id="s406">With my father’s family she spoke in Lódz Yiddish.</span> <span id="s407">With her family she spoke Litvok, Russian Yiddish.</span> <span id="s408">So my mother, out of -- I guess out of desperation having this kid four year or so old with no playmates, and I must have been pretty bright for my age, she taught me how to read.</span> <span id="s409">And I was reading fluently at the age of five.</span> <span id="s410">And I spend my ti -- in Poland’s first grade -- there was no kindergarten, first grade started at the age of seven, not six.</span> <span id="s411">So between five and seven, I spend my time between reading whatever was available, and using the plant, the factory, as my playground.</span> <span id="s412">And early on I dif -- developed an affinity to hang out in the machine shop.</span> <span id="s413">And I must have a inclination, inborn inclination to work in mechanical things.</span> <span id="s414">Early on I achieved dexterity in mechanical capabilit -- whatever mechanical.</span> <span id="s415">Because of all the places in the shop, and the -- the -- we employed about 20 some employees, it wa -- wasn’t a great big factory.</span> <span id="s416">And everybody knew me because they -- th -- the workers, that was not much of a -- what would you say, leaving and hiring, the workers are permanent.</span> <span id="s417">A matter of fact, I had a picture here of a di -- end -- entire factory group, the crew, with three men that knew me -- Gentile Poles that knew me since day I was born.</span> <span id="s418">And that picture was taken in 1946, so you can imagine there were -- once you got a job in a -- in that factory, in -- especially in -- in my f -- in a -- in a factory, in a place of work that was supervised by my father, you were never fired.</span> <span id="s419">You could quit.</span> <span id="s420">If you were fired, you were fired for -- you had to be a real bad person to be fired.</span> <span id="s421">My father did not believe in firing people, that’s part of his Tolstoy principle.</span> <span id="s422">Matter of fact, to [indecipherable] and -- and leap ahead, about 1937 I believe, the Polish parliament passed a law outlawing ritual slaughter.</span> <span id="s423">I don’t [indecipherable] but there was an anti-Semitic woman representative, in the [indecipherable] which is equivalent Polish to parliament.</span> <span id="s424">She put the bill, presented a bill to the -- saying that the ritual slaughter is inhuman.</span> <span id="s425">And the bill pass, and all the Jewish butchers went out of business.</span> <span id="s426">And my father on principle, even though we didn’t need any more help at that time, hired, I think four ex-butchers, because after all, they lost their livelihood, and being butchers, they were at least familiar and [indecipherable] hide were not odious to them.</span> <span id="s427">So he hired them.</span> <span id="s428">So anyway -- and th-these Gentile workers -- we had Jewish workers, too, I would say there was about eight or 10 Jewish employees.</span> <span id="s429">Some Hassidic Jews, but [indecipherable] very specialized trades.</span> <span id="s430">And the rest was about 17 or so Gentiles.</span> <span id="s431">And I just toddled around between them, they all kept me out of trouble, seeing I don’t wind up in a pit, salting pit and -- or in the jaws of a -- a machine.</span> <span id="s432">But of all the places that I liked best was the machine shop.</span> <span id="s433">Why the mechanic let me handle tools and do things and help him.</span> <span id="s434">I really loved -- I had an affinity to mechanical things.</span> <span id="s435">And then by the age of seven, I was -- became of school age and in Poland elementary school was compulsory education.</span> <span id="s436">However, the Poles -- the Polish authorities preferably had s -- did not preferably -- would not mix Jews with Gentiles.</span> <span id="s437">So therefore, if you run into a survivor out of Poland who will say that he attended a school, elementary school or even a high school with Gentiles together, he -- or she is from a small town where there was not enough of a Jewish population for a segregated school.</span> <span id="s438">In Lódz, with 250,000 Jews, there was no problem whatsoever.</span> <span id="s439">Therefore, I was assigned to a all Jewish public elementary school, located on Ribna one-three, which is inside the ghetto some of -- one of the streets there is Ribna Street.</span> <span id="s440">Matter of fact, on Ribna there -- there -- it was so much oppos -- in the middle of the s -- of a center of Jewish population that there were really two schools, one a -- two buildings, separate buildings.</span> <span id="s441">One at Ribna one-three, and the other one was Ribna 15.</span> <span id="s442">Each one first to seven grade.</span> <span id="s443">Each one a converted, old, beat up apartment house.</span> <span id="s444">This in spite of the fact that as you walked down Kwizinska and hit the intersection with Yumanoskaga, across the street, directly across the street was a brand new, beautiful, elementary school, built specifically for school purposes.</span> <span id="s445">And I could have attended it with a five minute walk, but that was for Poles, for Gentiles only.</span> <span id="s446">So therefore I had to take a -- I lived up here, I had to board a trolley car and tr-travel I would say about 20 minutes on a trolley car to Ribna, which would be -- this is Balskirinik, it’s somewhere right before Balskirinik, because it was during the war in the ghetto boundary.</span> <span id="s447">Well, the education in that school wasn’t very good, because the salaries paid to the teachers were minimal.</span> <span id="s448">That was state funded school.</span> <span id="s449">And we did have in the city of Lódz, our own Jewish private school system.</span> <span id="s450">Unfortunately it was in town.</span> <span id="s451">And there was no way to send a seven year old one on three different trolley cars to go to school.</span> <span id="s452">So I spend my first two years attending the first grade, second grade in this school on Ribna, and by the age of 10 my mother decided I’m big enough or bright enough or whatever, to be able to travel, take three different trolley cars, and I was signed in to a private Jewish school on Hermoska 48.</span> <span id="s453">It was a non-profit school by a -- operated by a s-society dedicated to spreading knowledge and technical capability among Jews.</span> <span id="s454">Therefore, it consisted of two separate schools.</span> <span id="s455">One wa -- was teaching first grade all the way to lyceum.</span> <span id="s456">That’s the 12th year, classic, normal curriculum.</span> <span id="s457">The other section was technical and had two departments, textile and mechanical.</span> <span id="s458">Well I start out then dar -- the separation happened on -- was offered to the student who from -- graduating from sixth grade.</span> <span id="s459">The first -- the elementary school was just one type.</span> <span id="s460">So I attended the -- the third, fourth, fifth and sixth grade elementary school in that particular school on Hermoska 48.</span> <span id="s461">I was doing very well in school.</span> <span id="s462">I was class president for four years running, and put in the public school system -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: The homeroom teacher was more -- had more activity, participated more with the student body than the homeroom teacher in the United States the way I know it, and I do know what the homeroom teacher in the United States does because my youngest daughter is a schoolteacher.</span> <span id="s464">The homeroom teacher will be assigned this particular homeroom, a group of students, and you would follow them all the way.</span> <span id="s465">That means if you acquired a homeroom teacher, let’s say in the first year of high school, you had him til you graduated.</span> <span id="s466">And he knew you thoroughly.</span> <span id="s467">And he dealt with the student body through the class president.</span> <span id="s468">So my function was not just a title, but there was a specific activity.</span> <span id="s469">I was the go-between.</span> <span id="s470">The way the chain of command went, if a visiting teacher let’s say, math, geography, whatever, had a problem with a student, he would first try to deal himself, or herself with the student.</span> <span id="s471">Didn’t get anywhere he’d turn to the homeroom teacher.</span> <span id="s472">The homeroom teacher would turn to the class president and say what are we going to do about this kid?</span> <span id="s473">And again the oddest quirk of fate, my homeroom teacher in high school was a man named Nahoum Blumenthal.</span> <span id="s474">And Nahoum Blumenthal is of [indecipherable] and Yad Vashem employment.</span> <span id="s475">I came across some monographs and some ar -- articles and I think couple books published by Yad Vashem with a Nahoum Blumenthal byline.</span> <span id="s476">Isn’t that the oddest thing in the world?</span> <span id="s477">And I know it’s him because we had terrific relationship the two of us for the two years running before the war, ’38 - ’39, and then he disappeared during the war.</span> <span id="s478">In 1945 sometime early summer I’m walking on Piotkowska, principle street, and I’m running into Professor Blumenthal, my teacher.</span> <span id="s479">And we stopped and we chatted and we remembered the old times when I was the pupil and he was the teacher, and I asked him what he is doing and he said he just arrived from unit -- from the Soviet Union where he survived the war, and he was working for the Jewish Historical Society, and the Jewish Historical Society was transferred fairly recently to Lódz and he is -- he just arrived in Lódz and he’s working for the Jewish Historical Society.</span> <span id="s480">So I pretty sure that anything appearing with the name of Nahoum Blumenthal out of Yad Vashem would be the same individual because eventually I imagine as -- I -- I don’t think he stayed any longer than 1956 in Poland, because 1956 was when Gomoka opened up a -- the borders for the Jews, and a lot of Jews left.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s482">I’m going to suggest that we try to move closer to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Okay, let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: -- to the war, only because of the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: -- at this -- at this moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: The war --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So, the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: -- the war.</span> <span id="s490">The war is at -- the war is -- how the war started.</span> <span id="s491">Because I kept no diary --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Did you think about keeping a diary?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Did you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: No.</span> <span id="s498">Because -- because I kept no diary, why the events are very strong in my mind.</span> <span id="s499">As you see that my -- I got a memory like an elephant.</span> <span id="s500">I wish I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s501">I -- I with to God that I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s502">I mean things are -- when I -- I -- I -- I-I -- I can see pi -- pictures in my mind like a film running.</span> <span id="s503">I spoke today -- this morning at breakfast, I spoke with my friend in Silver Spring, and I say to him, Henry, do you remember I -- no, said to him, “Henry, I finally pinpointed the exact day of the -- the d -- exact date of the day of interegnam, when we spent the day together with the city laying dead in front of us.”</span> <span id="s504">He says, “I don’t remember.”</span> <span id="s505">And I say to him -- and because -- and I cou -- I did prepare myself for this interview because of the chronological problems of events.</span> <span id="s506">I don’t want to confuse it.</span> <span id="s507">According to the Pruschidsky, that’s the chronicles, the Polish army pulled out September sixth, evacuated.</span> <span id="s508">The Germans entered September eighth.</span> <span id="s509">Now that gives me the date that I spent with Henry.</span> <span id="s510">I spent with Henry the day of the seventh of September.</span> <span id="s511">He lived on Piotkowska 20, which is center of the city, and I lived on the outskirts.</span> <span id="s512">I remember it like now, was a beautiful, sunny day, cloudless.</span> <span id="s513">And the city was dead.</span> <span id="s514">No vehicular traffic, no trolley cars running, hardly any people in the streets.</span> <span id="s515">And I made my way all the way from my home, all the way down [indecipherable] down, down [indecipherable] up to Piotkowska 20, and I went up and we spend day together, went on the streets, we walked the streets, and I didn’t get home til about five o’clock, and my mother thought that I already am gone permanently because there was a drive to move eastward.</span> <span id="s516">And she thought that I met some -- with some fellows in town and we decided to go before the Germans enter.</span> <span id="s517">So that’s how the war started.</span> <span id="s518">There were rumors before the war about the -- the probability.</span> <span id="s519">I remember pikou -- I was always a voracious reader even though I did develop a social life, my primary entertainment and preoccupation was reading.</span> <span id="s520">I remember sometime in the summer of ’39, I came across a book called, “The Brown Book,” which described the atrocities committed by the germa -- by the Nazis on the German Jews.</span> <span id="s521">Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s522">With pictures.</span> <span id="s523">And I remember taking the book down the factory yard where my father was kind of circulating, and stopping my father in his work and saying, “Dad, take a look what I just picked up at the library.”</span> <span id="s524">And I sh -- opened it up and showed him the pictures and some captions, how the Jews are being maltreat -- German Jews are being maltreated by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s525">And I say, “Dad, what’s going to happen when the Germans will arrive?</span> <span id="s526">When the war starts, then Germans will come here.”</span> <span id="s527">And my father’s answer was typical of the [indecipherable] generations.</span> <span id="s528">“Well,” he said, “I dealt with the Germans in 1917 - ’18.</span> <span id="s529">You can do business with the Germans.”</span> <span id="s530">Very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Tell me about this book a little bit.</span> <span id="s532">Do you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I have no idea --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: You don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: It was -- the title was “The Brown Book,” had a brown cover --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Published in Germany you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, pu -- published in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Oh -- mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Could be a translation, pretty thick.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And what year did you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: And profusely --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: It was ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: -- illustrated.</span> <span id="s544">It must have been published at least around ’37 - ’38, for me to read it in Polish in ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So you read it in ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s548">Had you known about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And where did you read about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: In newspapers.</span> <span id="s552">Radio, newspapers.</span> <span id="s553">The Poles were quite eager and exuberant, if you can use that term exuberant to announce publicly these news, how the Jews are being beaten up and -- because it gave them a more or less a moral excuse to mistreat the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s554">After all, if the western, the civilized world, which goes to Poland, wa -- German, it was the western world.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: What did yo -- did your father respond to that differently, or your mother?</span> <span id="s556">That you’re not --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I don’t -- I don’t think I discussed it with my mother.</span> <span id="s558">And that’s where my father was wrong.</span> <span id="s559">How -- now once the war broke out, again I got to use somebody else’s dates.</span> <span id="s560">After the Germans entered, the restrictive measures were announced against the Jews virtually immediately.</span> <span id="s561">And I have a date, September -- beginning September 18th, til -- til December 18th, there was a whole row, one after another of orders restricting Jews, beginning with curfew, not permitting Jews to use principle streets to -- to walk on.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And how would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: The Jews had to use side streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: And how was using --</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Piotkowska was out of bounds for Jews.</span> <span id="s566">Matter of fact, Henry’s house, which was facing Piotkowska [indecipherable] they had to break through the back wall, so there would be back entrance from a street parallel to Piotkowska.</span> <span id="s567">And then there was a ordinance about the Jews being identified first by yellow bands.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Yellow bands?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Around the arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: The star came right after.</span> <span id="s574">The armband I would say was on for about two or three months and then the order was changed to a Star of David they wore on -- on the chest and the back.</span> <span id="s575">You know, you had to have it on a -- your shoulder too.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: How did you find out?</span> <span id="s577">How were the ordinances --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Oh they were printed in a form of a large poster.</span> <span id="s579">And there were special pre -- before the war they were like round structures, I’ll say eight, 10 foot diameter by about 12 foot tall, made out of concrete, specifically for posters.</span> <span id="s580">And movie houses, movie theaters, whatever, was -- wer -- anybody was free to put a poster up.</span> <span id="s581">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Do you remember seeing these?</span> <span id="s583">You remember seeing these posters?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: The -- restricting the Jews?</span> <span id="s585">Oh sure.</span> <span id="s586">Was -- you just -- you went on the street and you stopped at this poster display and you read the -- the latest poster.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: What was going through your head at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: To tell you the truth, I was preoccupied.</span> <span id="s589">First of all, I was in love.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I was going steady with a girl, so war or no war, and maybe I was reckless, or I didn’t realize what I’m getting into it, but all these ordinance I took -- I’ll say -- I say okay, I can live with that.</span> <span id="s592">I mean, the curfew, I can live with that, I can adjust my lifestyle.</span> <span id="s593">Armband, I can live with that.</span> <span id="s594">Old --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: You are 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">Well, 14 going on 15.</span> <span id="s598">It don’t stop me from dating my girl and dating -- and taking her to the movies, even though the movies already in the center city, the first run movies, were forbidden to the Jews.</span> <span id="s599">But there were a lot of small movie theaters, because movie thea -- movies was the only entertainment available to general public.</span> <span id="s600">So movies were very popular, there was a -- a slew of movie theaters, third, fourth run.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And these are western movies as well as movies from --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Western, they were mostly western movies --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Mostly western.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: -- yeah, there were hardly any movies made in Poland.</span> <span id="s605">Also -- all -- oh, I remember the first movies I saw was Tom Mix, Ken Maynard, Elmer Lincoln.</span> <span id="s606">The first Tarzan was Elmer Lincoln.</span> <span id="s607">I remember him right now.</span> <span id="s608">He had a beard.</span> <span id="s609">Imagine Tarzan with a beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And these are translated, are these captioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Oh well, they had the captions, right.</span> <span id="s612">So I remember just taking these ordinances part of that’s the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So you forgot the book in some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Well, I didn’t forget the book, but I didn’t relate to it because now -- now we’ve gone into the specifics.</span> <span id="s615">What happened with business, because even though I was only 14, I was raised on the factory compound.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Wait a minute, let me -- let me stop this for a minute.</span> <span id="s617">I just want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: So it wasn’t like my father would go off somewhere to nowhere, leave the apartment or whatever and come back in the evening.</span> <span id="s619">Business and residence were always --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Together?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: -- together.</span> <span id="s622">My mother -- my mother participate in the -- in the business.</span> <span id="s623">A matter of fact, my mother participate very strongly because she was the only woman in the whole bunch that spoke flawless Polish.</span> <span id="s624">And the relationship between the Polish authorities, whether tax authority or whatever, and the Jews were, at the best, adversary.</span> <span id="s625">And if a Jew came with some kind of a problem to be corrected into a state run office, if he spoke with an accented Polish, he was ridiculed, he was disregarded, he wasn’t even given the proper attention.</span> <span id="s626">So my mother was -- any time there was a problem with any kind of state office, and the operation of the factory, my mother was delegated to go down and deal with the bureaucrats because her Polish was a flawless Polish.</span> <span id="s627">So -- now, therefore, I was present -- not I took any kind of active part in the business, but I was present and s -- I was -- I had the knowledge of the business subliminally, virtually by osmosis.</span> <span id="s628">And I knew that the business in the preceding months before the war was very, very dead, was virtually at standstill.</span> <span id="s629">There was no trade going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: [interruption] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Things were bad, and right after the Germans entered, all sudden things picked up.</span> <span id="s632">First of all there was a steady stream of uniform, green uniform Germans.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t know their rank.</span> <span id="s634">They definitely were not privates, coming in and buying leather, in all kind of quantities, til they reached a point where the partners, my father and his brothers were limiting the quantities because when a German or two German uniformed would come in and say they want to buy skins, finished skins, leather, they would be offered two, or three, or four skins, with the usual explanation and I was witnessing it, you are not a merchant sir, you want for some kind of private use, is two good enough, or would you like three?</span> <span id="s635">And apparently they had all the cash in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So they paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s638">They were polite, they were well behaved, they were -- they were not Volksdeutschen they were Reichsdeutschen.</span> <span id="s639">They were -- I believe they were, because of their green uniforms, they were regular Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s640">The regular Wehrmacht were just decent, ordinary Germans, they were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s641">Cause the [indecipherable] Nazis would be black uniforms, either SS -- well, SS.</span> <span id="s642">Whatever.</span> <span id="s643">They were Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s644">And they came with -- money was no problem and all of a sudden business was booming.</span> <span id="s645">And there was this stream of Germans coming in, and I became inured to the fact that the German in a green uniform is in a way, harmless.</span> <span id="s646">Can you see that complacency?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you didn’t -- you did not think about danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Right, cause I realized that we Jews are like a homeless dog, outside the law.</span> <span id="s649">Now no laws applied.</span> <span id="s650">I was at one time, some time I would say in end of September, some Germans came to the house, into the plant on a weekend when the factory was shut down.</span> <span id="s651">And they knocked on the apartment doors.</span> <span id="s652">And they wore civi -- civilian clothes but wore Nazi armbands, with the swastika.</span> <span id="s653">And they were looking for young men.</span> <span id="s654">And they grab me and escorted me, took me down to a nearby high school complex, and I was made -- German refugees from the eastern territories were arriving into Lódz because under the Soviet German pact, any German that lived wa -- east of Bug river, in the Russian occupied territory was free to leave with as much belonging as he wanted to.</span> <span id="s655">And many of these Germans fled.</span> <span id="s656">And they arrived, among other cities, they arrived in Lódz.</span> <span id="s657">And that’s where the problem started for the Jews, in the center of the city because all a sudden, end of September, October, there are hundreds of German families arriving in Lódz, trying -- and the German authorities desperate to try to find a place for them to live, so the logical answer for them was throw the Jews out of their housing, and offer the housing to the refugee Germans.</span> <span id="s658">But they wouldn’t go into Baloote, because the housing in Baloote was no running water, no indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s659">So these Jews in Baloote, the poor Jews, they were left alone.</span> <span id="s660">And it was the upper scale Jews, occupying the new sections and the new areas that had running water, that had indoor plumbing, that were the first ones to suffer of being tossed out su-summarily out of their apartments.</span> <span id="s661">So I was taken down to that relocation center.</span> <span id="s662">Germans were arriving and I -- there was a -- there was a group of Jews, young Jews, dragged in from God knows where.</span> <span id="s663">I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s664">And th -- we’re told to -- they were arriving by trolley cars, apparently from the train station.</span> <span id="s665">And we were told to help them.</span> <span id="s666">So I carried the suitcases and bags from the sidewalk into the interior of the school, was [indecipherable] it was gym or something.</span> <span id="s667">And work for about two or three hours and then there was a break and -- in the transports, and I was invited to whatever I -- ask would want some refreshment.</span> <span id="s668">Just like the refugee -- refugees.</span> <span id="s669">There were the coffee urns, or whatever, and go ahead and have a sandwich, and so.</span> <span id="s670">But on the other hand, one day I was walking the street, I was grabbed by a German who had no identity -- no identification at all.</span> <span id="s671">I don’t know even know whether he was a German.</span> <span id="s672">But he say, hey you there, grabbed me out -- by the arm and he said, “I need you.”</span> <span id="s673">And he drive me to his house and made me move some furniture for him.</span> <span id="s674">I mean, we were like a homeless dog.</span> <span id="s675">But that still didn’t stop me from --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: From moving around.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: -- from moving around because these -- these things done to me, were not like an organized systematic, but we knew that we Jews can be treated anyway an individual German wants to treat us, but basically I was treated fairly decently.</span> <span id="s678">I was never abused, let’s put it this way, even when they grabbed me for something.</span> <span id="s679">And this brings me to a very interesting point.</span> <span id="s680">That -- because that was the last time when I was permitted to travel the streets.</span> <span id="s681">From then on I became a prisoner in the compound.</span> <span id="s682">According to, again the Pruschidsky, on November 11th, the Germans destroyed the statue of Kościuszko that was placed on Plac Wolności in the center of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: That’s Freedom Square, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Freedom Square, right.</span> <span id="s685">It was a horse mounted Kościuszko -- I think the horse was on two legs, two hind legs and Kościuszko the big saver, and this -- this -- the horse and the rider were on top of a pedestal, like a -- I would say octagonal.</span> <span id="s686">A very large one, possibly 30 feet diameter.</span> <span id="s687">It was a very massive pedestal.</span> <span id="s688">[indecipherable] support, but -- and each panel of the oc -- octagon depicted different feats in life of Kościuszko.</span> <span id="s689">And apparently this was made out of bronze, were bronze relief panels.</span> <span id="s690">And that was my -- ah, no -- so once I read this, the whole event came to my mind.</span> <span id="s691">I had a date, and I went with my date to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: This is the girlfriend, this is the same girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Right, same girlfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I was going steady.</span> <span id="s696">Her name was Rainya -- my God, just told Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Well, it’ll come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I met her in ’38.</span> <span id="s699">So I met her and we went to the movies, I remember the name of the movie theater, Bika, which means fairy tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Fairy tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Fairy tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, Bika in Polish is fairy tale.</span> <span id="s704">And we went to the movies, we saw the picture.</span> <span id="s705">It was somewhere on the outskirts, and must have been shortly before the curfew and I didn’t take her home.</span> <span id="s706">We parted company one point, she went up, and I went up, and I tell you my way down again Nowomiejska, was Skerska and somewhere before I even hit Skerska, which is an extension of Nowomiejska, I get stopped by a uniformed German patrol.</span> <span id="s707">And they bring my back to Pazelnofscha and I see a group of people working at the Kościuszko statue.</span> <span id="s708">And I’m being ordered to take my overcoat off, this was November, pretty cold, put a pile of overcoats and join the workers.</span> <span id="s709">So I joined the workers, and there were some with [indecipherable] tools, chisels, sledge hammers, were banging away and trying to separate these bronze panels away from the concrete.</span> <span id="s710">And I worked til about two a.m.</span> <span id="s711">At two a.m., I guess the Germans got tired -- and they were decent enough, there was a non-com -- it was a military unit, and it was a non-com in charge, and he said, “Okay Jews, go home, that’s the end, the end of the day.”</span> <span id="s712">And we said, “How we going to go home, it’s a curfew and we will get arrested on the way home.”</span> <span id="s713">And he was nice enough to get ahold of a bunch of slips and s -- write something in German and hand out to each one of us.</span> <span id="s714">Here, here.</span> <span id="s715">You show it -- anybody stops you, you show it to him, you’ll be all right.</span> <span id="s716">So I went home and that was the end of my -- my parents withdrew permission for me to leave the factory compound from then on, that’s November 11th, I was virtually imprisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: You can imagine the [indecipherable], and -- and there was also already talk, gossip, that the Jewish businesses are going to be confiscated.</span> <span id="s719">So my father was looking for a tame or captive German to kind of be the front man.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: What word --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Be a front man.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Yeah, I know, but what word did you use?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Captive, na -- tame.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: A tame?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yeah, a tame German, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Oh, a tame German, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Tame, ye -- captive, yeah.</span> <span id="s728">And -- and again, an odd coincidence that in 19 -- between 1935 and 1938, my father did not work with his partners at this location, but around a tannery, in a -- a rented tannery in Erda Parbenietska, which is oh, somewhere in this direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: North.</span> <span id="s730">North of --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I -- yeah, there was Parbienietsa and there was Erda Parbenietska, two separate townships adjoining Lódz, with [indecipherable] running [indecipherable] platzi -- this was Platzia Monta.</span> <span id="s732">It’s not marked, but this junction is called -- was called Platzia Monta.</span> <span id="s733">It was Platzia Monta, Plaz Baranik, Plaz Bowtski.</span> <span id="s734">At these two junctions the city -- there were two separate trolley car companies.</span> <span id="s735">One was inner city, had their own trolley cars, their own colors, and there was the suburban, which had their own trolley cars, different shape, different size, and different color.</span> <span id="s736">And they were running out of [indecipherable] Platzia Monta outwards.</span> <span id="s737">These were the junction points where you transferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: So my father worked in a rented tannery.</span> <span id="s740">And that tannery belonged to a German, wealthy German family, well known in Lódz, named Ranka.</span> <span id="s741">And one of their in-law, named Rudolf Stribel, he was kind of appointed to run that tannery some time in the 30’s, I -- early 30’s and he was not a tanner, he was a bookkeeper [indecipherable] bookkeeper, he was a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s742">And he ran the tannery down the ground, and his in-laws shut it down.</span> <span id="s743">And it was vacant and my father teamed up with another merchant, and they rented the tannery, and started producing.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So he -- so he’s not running two tanneries, now, he’s closed down --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: No, he lets his brothers -- no, no, he left --</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: -- he stepped out of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: That was -- there were differences, serious differences between my father and his brothers and in 1935 he reached a point where he just chucked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: But you’re still living in the compound?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: But we -- yes, right, while he was not participating any more either in the production or the proceeds of the plant, we were still owners to the property and therefore we still occupied our apartment.</span> <span id="s752">So when they rented that tannery Erda Parbenietska, this fellow, str -- Rudolf Stribel, came around a-and introduced himself that he is the son-in-law of the owners of the property and he’s a bookkeeper, and would we -- would my father need a bookkeeper?</span> <span id="s753">And my father and his partner said yes.</span> <span id="s754">Especially that he was skilled in that particular kind of bookkeeping because he was doing the bookkeeping for the previous operators of the tannery.</span> <span id="s755">So they hired him, and he worked for them for -- between ’35 and ’38.</span> <span id="s756">In ’38 they quit that, gave up [indecipherable] ran out and they came back, both my father and his then partner, to the Kwizinska.</span> <span id="s757">Actually, what happened is that partner of my father bought one of my uncles out, and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s758">So there was a change in the make-up of partners.</span> <span id="s759">So at that point when some of the Germans that were coming in were kind of not nice, and there was rumors of being -- Jewish properties being confiscated, my parents -- well, the adults started looking for solutions, and one solution that became immediately apparent was get hold of Stribel and find out what he is doing.</span> <span id="s760">And they -- they found him, and there he is I would say two months into the German occupation, still walking next to his shoes.</span> <span id="s761">Apparently he did not benefit in the first eight weeks from being a superior German.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: What do you mean he was walking --</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Next to his shoes.</span> <span id="s764">With holes in his soles.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: He was still pretty poor shape.</span> <span id="s767">Couldn’t latch on anything, and at that point they offered him a job, that first of all he would be a front man.</span> <span id="s768">He will deal with the Germans.</span> <span id="s769">And he accepted it eagerly, anything, hey.</span> <span id="s770">And it was a -- going with mixed results because he really had no official standing, so some -- while most of the Germans would kind of act more s -- in a more subdued manner when they would deal with him, others were bolder enough to say, who are you and what are you doing, what are you, a Jewish servant?</span> <span id="s771">And it would even make the situation worse.</span> <span id="s772">So it was a mixed blessing, but it -- it worked to some extent, and business was good.</span> <span id="s773">I mean, money was rolling in like crazy.</span> <span id="s774">And then all a sudden some time again, I would say by November, the Germans established, confiscated officially -- there was a decree out of Berlin confiscating all Jewish property and establishing a special office to handle Jewish property.</span> <span id="s775">And administer Jewish property.</span> <span id="s776">It was called in German, De treuhand stellech.</span> <span id="s777">Treuhand means an honest hand, treu honest hand.</span> <span id="s778">And the administrators were named Treuhande.</span> <span id="s779">So the adults, the partners got on Stribel, and say hey Stribel, you better go down to Posum -- Posun, I -- which was the seat of the -- by then naturally, Lódz was incorporated into Bartigo and we became thoroughly Germanized, all the vestiges of pole -- Polish [indecipherable] were gone.</span> <span id="s780">We became a German city in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Bartigo, with Posun becoming the capital of the province.</span> <span id="s783">So we kind of -- the adults said, hey Stribel, you better go down to Posun and apply for the job of treuhande for this factory.</span> <span id="s784">And he kind of hemmed and hawed.</span> <span id="s785">I don’t -- I don’t know why he was timid about it.</span> <span id="s786">I -- I remember it because I was partic -- I wasn’t participating, but I was present to the conversations.</span> <span id="s787">The space was limited.</span> <span id="s788">The office was the office, big deal.</span> <span id="s789">But he went off.</span> <span id="s790">He went off, he came back I think two or three days beaming, with official papers, naming him that administra -- official administrator of the factory.</span> <span id="s791">At that point they sat down the partners with him and they wrote a private agreement where he recognize the current owners as the true owners and he will only act as their representative, while representing the German office.</span> <span id="s792">And he recognizes the right of the owners to participate in profits.</span> <span id="s793">It was like a private arrangement.</span> <span id="s794">At the same time, while this was going on and Stribel’s presence became kind of more official standing, he could deal better with the -- whoever arrived to purchase the leather, and the Jews kept in the background.</span> <span id="s795">Being in Bartigo -- located in Bartigo, in a German city, because all vestiges of Polish rule disappeared.</span> <span id="s796">The cit -- there was the Polish police disappeared.</span> <span id="s797">The shupari a-appeared, they were imported.</span> <span id="s798">Shup is the [indecipherable] the law and order, all the German institutions, and then we had -- at same time were -- became aware that not all of occupied Poland was incorporated, that the Germans just took the western part and formed three provinces, us being the center one, Bartigo.</span> <span id="s799">However, the eastern part is called general government, and there is -- the Polish rule prevails, the Polish police, national police is still in charge in their navy blue uniforms.</span> <span id="s800">Polish schools are being active.</span> <span id="s801">Polish language is -- language is the official language.</span> <span id="s802">So all things be equal, we assumed that between -- that the Jewish fate in the hands of the Germans is going to be much worse in area incorporated directly into Germany, than in -- into area that is only temporarily occupied by the Germans for the duration of the war, with its fate decided after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Now how did you find out about what was going on in the general government?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: There was travel going on, back and forth.</span> <span id="s805">Well, there was also i -- let’s -- let’s say that there was actually a four -- there was an exodus of Jews out of Lódz at least three -- three times.</span> <span id="s806">The first exodus was immediately following the Polish army as it evacuated.</span> <span id="s807">A lot of Jews left, especially Jews with -- who were Communists or Communist followers.</span> <span id="s808">And -- because they -- we already heard that the Russians are coming in from the other side, and the first wave of the Jews that left Lódz, the young men especially, kept on going.</span> <span id="s809">And went all the way across the Bug river to the Russians, to the Reds.</span> <span id="s810">And the other part of the wave, the middle edge, were the ones that were cash liquid -- had liquidity and they left hoping that the Germans weren’t [indecipherable] the Poles will at one point resist.</span> <span id="s811">So that the first wave.</span> <span id="s812">That right away reduced the po -- Jewish population of Lódz.</span> <span id="s813">And then there was the second wave, when Lódz was incorporated into Third Reich, and we became aware that eastern occupied territories are general government, so that was a second wave of emigration of Jews out of Lódz.</span> <span id="s814">Again, the ones that were cash liquid.</span> <span id="s815">You had to have liquidity to leave.</span> <span id="s816">So while we’re sitting in the tannery, making hands over fist, we considered -- I’m talking about adults -- that the state is going to be temporary, and very temporary.</span> <span id="s817">That very soon we’ll have to move on and being of a kind of a mind that looks ahead and doesn’t wait for things to happen, just like the way we hired that German before we had to, we started looking for alternatives.</span> <span id="s818">It so happened that my mother’s brother, who was operating a very successful establishment on the corner of [indecipherable] Nowomiejska.</span> <span id="s819">He had like a sweet shop, lunchroom, whatever, but very successful.</span> <span id="s820">He -- and he was able to pull out a lot of cash from the banks before the Jewish accounts were frozen.</span> <span id="s821">I remember him boasting, showing -- opening up a shoebox full with currency, high domina -- denomination currency, telling to -- telling my mother in my presence, “Don’t worry about money, because in this box there’s enough for both our families to survive the war.”</span> <span id="s822">They were childless.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: They were what?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: They were childless.</span> <span id="s825">He was a younger brother, my mother’s younger brother and they were childless.</span> <span id="s826">So the adults somehow organized, I don’t know -- I don’t remember how, but organized an apartment, some housing in a town called Tomashuv Mazovyetski.</span> <span id="s827">And that was already rented through emissaries.</span> <span id="s828">And it was sop -- the component that’s supposed to eventually occupy these premises rented in that town Tomashuv Mazovyetski was my mother’s brother with his wife, a childless couple, my parents with their children, that means my sister and me.</span> <span id="s829">And my Uncle Simon with his wife and again, son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s830">The son was born in 1910, was 14 years older than I, he was already a -- part time into medical studies in Belgium.</span> <span id="s831">And his daughter was my -- about old as my sister.</span> <span id="s832">Not very much older.</span> <span id="s833">So that was the component that was going to go to m -- settle in Tomashuv Mazovyetski when things come to an end at the tannery.</span> <span id="s834">But somehow they didn’t want to come to an end.</span> <span id="s835">The money was good and was still fairly safe haven.</span> <span id="s836">However, my uncle, the one that -- my mother’s side, he was [indecipherable] at loose ends.</span> <span id="s837">He lost his business.</span> <span id="s838">So the decision was that part of the component will go off to Tomashuv, the ones that are not necessary.</span> <span id="s839">That means my father and mother will stay on, my Uncle Simon and his wife will stay on, and everybody, the youngsters, my sister and I in early teens and my cousins in their late teens or early 20’s will leave for Tomashuv under the supervision of the two adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Now, which two adults then?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: My father’s -- my mother’s brother and his wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: -- that childless couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: And there was already a truck hired, and I remember an afternoon some time in November, possibly mid-November or so, the truck was in the factory yard and the -- they [indecipherable] after the work stopped, being loaded with basic furniture, bedsteads, mattresses, and -- and bedding and all our spare clothing, winter clothing, I mean you name it.</span> <span id="s846">Just bare necessities left behind because everybody’s already going and the only ones that are staying just for another few weeks, is my father and my mother, and my Uncle Simon and his wife, for as long as the business is good and can be milked.</span> <span id="s847">And once the truck got all loaded up with all the goods and now came the turn for the -- for humans to get loaded up and first my cousins hopped on, and then my sister went up on the tailgate, and she was in, and I was the last one.</span> <span id="s848">There is my uncle and my aunt standing, and my mother and my father, and naturally Uncle Simon and his wife.</span> <span id="s849">And I’m the last one to get on the truck, the tailgate, and my Aunt Ida turns to my mother and says, “Him I don’t take.</span> <span id="s850">He’s too nasty and he’s too fussy, I don’t want him.</span> <span id="s851">I’ll take Mary, but I won’t take him.</span> <span id="s852">I won’t put up with him.”</span> <span id="s853">And the truck went off without me.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: She hadn’t said this before, how you --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No.</span> <span id="s856">Well, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Did anybody argue --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: -- maybe that -- pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: -- did -- did anybody argue?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: There -- there was no point of arguing.</span> <span id="s861">I mean, she was a supervising adult, if she turned her thumbs down on me, that’s it.</span> <span id="s862">And besides, it wasn’t that critical, because after all, the bulk of the people went, and the bulk of the goods, it was the goods that -- and the leftover to follow would be only lightly encumbered, because all the stuff went.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Now there’s no problem about going, apparently, right?</span> <span id="s864">They’re not -- they’re not stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Apparently no --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: -- and they arrived safe in Tomashuv, and it turned out that things in Tomashuv were terrible.</span> <span id="s868">The housing, the food, or whatever, the -- both the Gentile and the Jewish native population was resentful of the newcomers, and now I stayed behind.</span> <span id="s869">I was happy.</span> <span id="s870">I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s871">I -- that was ma -- my playground, there is the plant, my factory and I was happy to stay behind.</span> <span id="s872">And that was sometime in de -- late December, or beginning of January.</span> <span id="s873">I was standing in the factory yard as usual during the day, and my father was standing in factory yard in the snow.</span> <span id="s874">And the gate opens up and my sister bursts through the gate and grabs my father by his neck and starts kissing him, saying “Tatish, Tatish, I love you.”</span> <span id="s875">And behind her comes my cousin Manasha.</span> <span id="s876">And that’s it, just two of them.</span> <span id="s877">And we start asking what’s what, and Manasha, who was older, he was in his 20’s already, he explained that things were unbearable at Tomashuv, there was a lot of friction among the -- the family itself, and friction with the neighbors, both Jews and Gentiles, with the indigenous neighbors and the newcomers.</span> <span id="s878">And finally Manasha -- Manasha took sick and there was no doctor up there and when he got well he decided to go back home.</span> <span id="s879">And my sister Mary decided to go with him; not his sister.</span> <span id="s880">And they made their way back, I would say about -- through the winter snows, at least 130 - 150 miles, hitchhiking or just walking, traveling along the highways.</span> <span id="s881">But they made it back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: So that’s a little before --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: The ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: The ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: The people in Tomashuv did not survive.</span> <span id="s886">My cousin Mina died.</span> <span id="s887">None of them survived.</span> <span id="s888">We all survived.</span> <span id="s889">Manasha died in Sweden last year.</span> <span id="s890">That’s the magic of the tannery.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Magic of the tannery.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Let’s stop for a little bit and just talk, shall we?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">End of Tape Two,
