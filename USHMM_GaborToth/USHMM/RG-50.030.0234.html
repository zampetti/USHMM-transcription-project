himself escaped from the revolution, from the Communist, escaped to Lithuania, but here in Lithuania, he appeared in the military courts as counsel for the Communists who were were were in...brought to trial for belonging to the Communist Party, leave alone if they would have done some sabotage or something like that, but the very fact that they belonged to the Communist Party, it was enough to

understand?</span> <span id="s233">All these aimed to one, to dehumanize, to to degrade, to hurt the feelings of Jews and ______.</span> <span id="s234">And this was the most dramatic and the most historic last meeting of the Jewish community in Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: On the 4th of August, 1941, at a school, there set the most prominent leaders of the community were still alive, because many were already killed.</span> <span id="s237">Approximately five thousand Jews were killed on the roads, in the city and so on and then they...it

the the rabbi's uh apartment and I listened.</span> <span id="s243">There was an elder report the first __________.</span> <span id="s244">When they came back from...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: The meeting...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: When they came back from the committee, I will not enlarge what happened to them.</span> <span id="s247">They were arrested on the way from the from the Gestapo to their homes by Lithuanians and they were...and among these uh...there...Goldberg was a mili...a military officer, a high officer in the Lithuanian army.</span> <span id="s248">He tried to speak to the military commandant of Kovno who he knew.</span> <span id="s249">He was in the same military school and this the night _____..._ we have to make it short, so this Goldberg went to one of his fellows who was well-known.</span> <span id="s250">There was established a big new ministry, as if they would gain their independence, the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s251">They sent cables of gratitude to Hitler signed by the Archbishop _____, by the Bishop ______, thanking him for liberating uh Lithuania from the Soviets, you see, and uh so the Lithuanians were...and they immediately established a cabinet of ministers of Lithuania as if they would gain independence, but the Germans, they never thought of of giving them their independence so...</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s253">So Avraham, tell me about the assembly, about the....</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s255">So the assembly, the the...can we ____, the chairman, and he and he spoke in very, very cloudy expressions and cloudy...cloudy, false pictures of the situation outside...outside the school where the where the meeting took place, and he said that the children are being killed, the women are being raped, all men are being taken to slavery, arrested and so on.</span> <span id="s256">There was not in the history of Jews a situation like that, but nevertheless there were situations, hard situations, and the Jewish people always...the ____, the _____ in the past, the ____ end was so that we survived them and he hoped that omens of this type Hitler will also...his end will be the _____ in the history of Jewish people, but nevertheless in describing the terrible situation of the Jews, the desperate situation, he collapsed and he couldn't continue to talk.</span> <span id="s257">Then came the problem the order of the Germans is that the Jews have to nominate a chief Jew and if the Jews themselves will not nominate a chief Jew, they will nominate themselves, and we had already the terrible experience of other places where they nominated, you know, a man who has no responsibility, with no background, no way...so there was also among the candidates was Dr. Elkes.</span> <span id="s258">The first candidate was, of course, Garfunkle who was a member of the Parliament, the head of the Jewish faction in the Parliament, for instance that Goldberg who had uh was a a a front ____, a fighter for Lithuanian independence.</span> <span id="s259">They had ____ but they they absolutely refused to take over the office because they knew this is going to be a servant ___ and into the of the of the Germans or the Nazis, and nobody wanted to be to betray his his his community, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s260">More so that at that time we knew already that the the chief Jew from Vilna (ph), Dr. _______, very famous Jewish leader, community leader, he ______, so nobody wanted to take over and there was a stalemate.</span> <span id="s261">In a way...no way out and nobody would take any office, so then stood up Schumuckler, Rabbi Schumuckler, who was a absolutely unknown rabbi from a suburb of _____ and he stood up but yet who was in main kind of way...everybody agreed and everybody wanted that Dr. Elkes.</span> <span id="s262">Why Dr. Elkes, Elchanan ELkes.</span> <span id="s263">Because he was one of the best physicians in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s264">He was the private physician of the German ambassador and of the Soviet ambassador and of all ambassadors, so they thought that he might because of his relationship being a private doctor for the German ambassador, he might have have some influence and maybe do some good or avoid some hardships and so on, but of course this had nothing to with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: How did he respond to the nomination?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: He...I will tell you before I answer.</span> <span id="s267">He said no because the...according to the Germans, who have to go to the ghetto, there we will have a municipality for ourselves.</span> <span id="s268">We will have our own community, a closed community.</span> <span id="s269">No Lithuanians will be will be allowed.</span> <span id="s270">No no German will be allowed to go inside.</span> <span id="s271">You will be free to manage your life as well you can, so each was supposed to be a municipal...a a chairman of a municipal council, so Dr. Elkes says I have no experience at all in municipality, in municipality...municipal work.</span> <span id="s272">I never have done anything but physician.</span> <span id="s273">He was the head of the interior department of the Jewish big hospital in Lithuania, Bikkur Holim, and he was...I said I was all my life a doctor and I have no any whatsoever experience in in municipal work.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So what persuaded him?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: So then...so then it was a stalemate.</span> <span id="s276">Nobody...and the Germans said if we will not nominate, they will nominate and this was the worst thing that could happen to us and before long in despair, then stood up the the rabbi, Rabbi Schumuckler and he said, ________.</span> <span id="s277">I appeal to Dr. Elkes.</span> <span id="s278">Everybody...since you are the most...are the most suitable to be a head

so.</span> <span id="s284">Everybody was in tears.</span> <span id="s285">He was so emotional and he was so persuasive, and Dr. Elkes stood in the corner.</span> <span id="s286">He never never stood _____, and he stood up and he said, if you all think that I must...it is me that must lead, the chief juden, the overjuden, I'm here.</span> <span id="s287">He sacrificed himself for the community

entire disposition _____ be ever be what may need, we are with you and ______ young lawyers.</span> <span id="s290">I was the speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Why did you that?</span> <span id="s292">Did you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Because...because I knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Why did you have such faith in him?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s296">There was not a person in Lithuania that didn't know the best...the the doctor but in addition I knew Dr. Elkes because the only thing that he was...he was never a

minute.</span> <span id="s302">Just a minute.</span> <span id="s303">First of all, if you know ________ well the three trustees of the _________, this is like pioneer, he was also their doctor and ____________ because we as a Zionist...as a chairman of the Zionist youth movement, I knew him from that _____, and meeting with him, and most of the people knew in Israel...in in Lithuania of Dr. Elkes as a very...very broad-minded uh physician.</span> <span id="s304">He was the physician of the president, of the prime minister and of the poorest people who gave medical help without without any pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: How would you describe him as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: He...let me tell you.</span> <span id="s307">First of all, you should know Elkes was born not far away from my town like Kalvarija (ph) and there he got a very strong religious education.</span> <span id="s308">There were no schools in...at that time...he was born in '70...in 1870 more or less.</span> <span id="s309">At that time there were no schools.</span> <span id="s310">There were only yeshivas for the bigger ones and there were only a rabbi and a hadder, you know, where they they taught the children to learn A - B - C and to pray, you see, and this is...he got a very strong religious...religious education from the very youth and then in his own way he he uh he made, you know, his doctor degree and nobody knows how he...how he managed it, how he went to ____ and he and he and he studied medicine without even prior graduating ___ so he had to make exams special and so on, but this is what he was.</span> <span id="s311">He was...he was a very well-known and he was well-known because of his great understanding for the needy and for the poor, for the _________, for...and and not only for the Jewish needy.</span> <span id="s312">For others.</span> <span id="s313">You see, he was a great man and at the same time, he didn't turn his nose up.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: He was a generous man?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: He was a most generous man and known like that.</span> <span id="s316">He was a very rich man.</span> <span id="s317">He was a very rich man and mind you, I want to jump now...in his...in his last will, in the ghetto he wrote in the ghetto in 1943 in Hebrew language, which he gave...handed over to me before I escaped from the ghetto, he he didn't mention not a single word of his of his richness.</span> <span id="s318">It was a very big property in this in this most fashionable part of the city of Kovno.</span> <span id="s319">His children he sent, because of being a rich man, he sent his two children, his son and his daughter, to London and this is Professor ____ Elkes who you met in there, he was then in London, and this is the last will that they allowed to him and to his sister, and this is will that to be passed to him (laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s320">Nobody knew will I at all succeed in to pass through and so on, so he was a great Zionist, a great Jew, a great devoted Jew with a very deep feeling of Jewish heritage.</span> <span id="s321">He had a responsibility and when he took over, he was known only as a physician, only as a great physician and we gave trust in him because of his special relationship with the German ambassador, but then he had shown himself by his day-to-day daily steps, dealing with the Russians.</span> <span id="s322">For instance...I'l give you an instance...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s324">Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: In 1940...the very beginning of the ghetto, came to me a Mr. Bronson (ph) who was a director of a Hebrew school and a lawyer who was not a Zionist, ____, and they came to me as secretary of the of the Jewish committee and they told me, look, there is a possibility to buy a gun.</span> <span id="s326">Can you speak to to to the Jewish committee that they should give money to pay, to buy the gun?</span> <span id="s327">So I went to Garfunkle, the Deputy.</span> <span id="s328">He says good, a gun.</span> <span id="s329">What they talking?</span> <span id="s330">It is dangerous.</span> <span id="s331">It will be dangerous for all the ghetto.</span> <span id="s332">Don't...don't mention it.</span> <span id="s333">So I went to Dr. Elkes.</span> <span id="s334">So Dr. Elkes said go to the treasurer and tell him that I order that you give to Bronson the money to buy the gun.</span> <span id="s335">Both very...I..</span> <span id="s336">.</span> <span id="s337">I most Jews devoted but here is a man of the season, of daring _____, most very ______, you see.</span> <span id="s338">Then the first days when you came in into the ghetto...</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Tell me about those.</span> <span id="s340">Tell me about the ghetto and the creation of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: So you see, so when it sees the the the Lithuanians attacks on the Jews in the cities, in their dwellings, in in the stores, in in the streets.</span> <span id="s342">They attacked terribly.</span> <span id="s343">It was impossible to pass the street for a Jew, and they said...uh we were three lawyers.</span> <span id="s344">The second lawyer...one of the three was killed two days after he was elected.</span> <span id="s345">On the 6th of August, there was...they killed a thousand Jews on the street, and among them prominent leaders like _________, so so we remained two, two of us.</span> <span id="s346">Dr. _____ was the elder one so he was the secretary, and I was the deputy secretary.</span> <span id="s347">On the 15th of August was the last day to close up the Jews in the ghetto, but because of the riots, day in, day out, in the city Jews left the city already by the end of July because there in this area they run out, the local Jews steps in.</span> <span id="s348">You understand.</span> <span id="s349">This was the situation.</span> <span id="s350">Jews themselves went and then when it came nearer to the ghetto, the Lithuanian municipality ordered that the Jews themselves should build the barbed wire fence around the ghetto, the Jews themselves, and I have a letter in my collection from the from the municipality of...you are ordered to bring fifty Jews for the building of the of the gate around the...not the gate but the barbed wire around the ghetto, and they should bring material, their own material.</span> <span id="s351">The next day you should bring a hundred people, a hundred Jews, and I have a photo where the Jews were building the fence around the ghetto, and this reminds me a very Russian song.</span> <span id="s352">I told you I know Russian, so there is a song...brick layer, brick layer...is that one passes by and sees brick layers are laying brick on the buildings that they are building.</span> <span id="s353">____ all the buildings, so it says brick layer, brick layer, for whom do you build these...these buildings.</span> <span id="s354">For whom are you laying the bricks?</span> <span id="s355">So he said you don't disturb me.</span> <span id="s356">_____ we are very busy in building...they are building...building a prison for themselves.</span> <span id="s357">And this what I had in mind when I saw these men building around the...but these were the Lithuanians, not the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Describe to me what were the living conditions like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: What...we are not in the ghetto yet.</span> <span id="s360">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s361">So you see, the...already from before the ghetto, they were rationed...Jews were not allowed to appear before ten on the markets, open markets, because let the Lithuanians buy whatever it is and whatever the rest, ___ were taken to Jews, but then we were now forbidden at all and this order of the 10th of July, 1941, Jews were forbidden to appear in the open markets to buy from non-Jews, to hire vehicles from non-Jews, to use help of non-Jews...absolutely.</span> <span id="s362">And they were rationed hundred grams bread a day...hundred grams bread a day.</span> <span id="s363">Hundred and twenty-five gram meat a week, fifty grams salt a month so it's clear that on this no one could could live.</span> <span id="s364">Even to starve was nothing left, but what was most important, when the ghetto was closed, there were many Jewish institutions in in social, medical, cultural, yeshiva and all kinds, so but they were all kinder...uh house for orphans, so they brought on the on the 15th of August when it was the the last day of entering the ghetto, the Lithuanians brought in a truck, two trucks load of children from orphans, from Jewish children's home that remained there and they pulled them out on the entrance of the ghetto on the on the on the pavement and they left them.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I was there.</span> <span id="s367">First of all you should know what I was not present and what I did not see and what I did not see, you'll not hear from me, because it was...I went back and forth, back and forth, so and then we were all in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: How did you respond, Avraham, when you saw that?</span> <span id="s369">I mean, what did you think?</span> <span id="s370">What were some of your...?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: ...the first thing to do was to allow....</span></p> <p><span id="s372">END OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: ...we had a fire brigade, and the fire brigade came immediately, you know, and to take these children and bring them into where...we didn't have an orphan's home in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s374">We didn't have a children's home in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s375">Where to bring them?</span> <span id="s376">So we brought them in a certain place what was formerly a school just to be able temporarily that they be under a roof.</span> <span id="s377">This was how the Lithuanians behaved ______ to to orphans, and this was...I..</span> <span id="s378">.</span> <span id="s379">if there is a God, I don't believe, but if there is a God, they should be punished for this.</span> <span id="s380">They should never gain their independence.</span> <span id="s381">Never...never...never.</span> <span id="s382">And then, three days after we were incarcerated in the ghetto, they finished the the the barbed wire fence around the ghetto and the gate and then three days...and they every day they gave Jewish committee head to mobilize Jewish workers for the various German places to to clean the barracks, military barracks and the Gestapo uh building, to clean the pavement, to...tailors, uh pressers and all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Hold up on...are we out of tape?</span> <span id="s384">OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">END OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: ...and then they commence to know what I've said.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Oh, that it's wonderful.</span> <span id="s389">They're hearing exactly everything they need to.</span> <span id="s390">OK?</span> <span id="s391">So what I'd like to start back is on those first days of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s392">Tell me about those first days of the ghetto, would you?</span> <span id="s393">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s395">So first of all, the first terrible blow that we got to to burst out of the children, orphans, on the _________ the Lithuanians, but on the third day of the ghetto on the 18th of August...15th of August the ghetto was closed...nobody comes in, nobody goes out...and the 18th of Aug..</span> <span id="s396">.</span> <span id="s397">and they used everyday used to send workers to to town, to various places outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s398">This was hard work, very hard work that Jews were not used to do, for instance in building...brick... laying bricks or in the barracks to to the the the men's rooms and the the other cleaning dirty things, so they said they need five hundred workers of academic (ph) professions for archives work, so people were so enthusiastic about this opportunity.</span> <span id="s399">Instead of going and cleaning the lavatories and and and to build the roads and so on, so there appears five hundred thirty-four, and they took them out from the ghetto and they killed them in the very same day.</span> <span id="s400">And when Lithuanians who could see from around the fort...fortress, they there were...the next day came Jewish workers nearby and had to walk to the _______ and they showed them...they ________ the Jews.</span> <span id="s401">We didn't believe.</span> <span id="s402">We couldn't believe how can...how can five hundred thirty-four innocent men, reputable then...lawyers, engineers, chemistries, uh physicians...why should they be killed without trial, without interrogation.</span> <span id="s403">We couldn't believe it because this was on the third of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s404">And then Dr. Elkes tried to go from one to the other, from one to the other, the dignitaries and not the dignitaries, and the civil...and the civil uh authority and then in the in the in the police...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: What was he doing?</span> <span id="s406">Was he trying to find out what happened or why?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s408">He said I'm the chairman of the Jewish committee and the overjuden.</span> <span id="s409">He spoke in their language and I am responsible for these Jews.</span> <span id="s410">I have to give a reply.</span> <span id="s411">I I I..</span> <span id="s412">.</span> <span id="s413">please tell me why didn't they come.</span> <span id="s414">When will they come?</span> <span id="s415">Where are they now?</span> <span id="s416">What are they doing, you see?</span> <span id="s417">He didn't speak in this tone like I'm talking now, but he...he found always the right expression...first of all not to to hurt their Nazi dignity, and second to force them to to to to answer him first of all, to answer him, and to answer him in a way like a human being, because a Jew is not a human being.</span> <span id="s418">You understand?</span> <span id="s419">So they...first of all a Jew doesn't deserve that he he should get an answer at all.</span> <span id="s420">But Dr. Elkes put it in a way and the...he just told them of his uh relationship with the German ambassador.</span> <span id="s421">_________.</span> <span id="s422">It worked some...sometimes.</span> <span id="s423">Much...not much...uh but nevertheless, but he is a very...is a..</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">was a most courageous man and he always said nothing can happen to me.</span> <span id="s426">My sixty-four...five years are behind me and he always kept in his small pocket a poison and he said if worse comes to worse, he will...he will not fall in their hands alive and uh and he...and he asked which was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s427">Nobody, no insurance company in the world would give insurance for the life of Dr. Elkes.</span> <span id="s428">Yes.</span> <span id="s429">Because every small...not don't speak about the the _______ commisar or the deputy _____ commisar who was responsible for the ghetto was himself a murderer, so a murderer...the the first ruler of the ghetto from the civil authority was the deputy ____ commisar of Kovno by the name of Jordan (ph), and why the _________...he write his name Jordan, but he was just a terrible guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Terrible person?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Terrible...a mass murderer.</span> <span id="s432">He...for instance, he used to come in into the Jewish committee office.</span> <span id="s433">He never opened the door.</span> <span id="s434">He didn't take the handle of the door and open it.</span> <span id="s435">No.</span> <span id="s436">Because the handle of the door kept Jews and he cannot make...put his hands on a on a on a handle that the Jews have kept _______.</span> <span id="s437">It would be dirty, his hands, you see, so he used to open with his boots, push the door...open the door with a with a crash and the very appearance of him was already thunder of _____ and and and unrest and of and of God knows what it brings.</span> <span id="s438">And he would be so so uh harsh and that even the superiors in Berlin thought he doesn't know how to behave before his superiors be...because ...not because he was too harsh towards Jews.</span> <span id="s439">Towards Jews you cannot be harsh enough because the the final solution is the final solution of every Jew, but he took over certain functions that wasn't in in the in the priority...in the in the authority of his superiors...________, so they sent him to the to the front and he was killed there, you see, and so it turned out that these five hundred and thirty-four, they had to admit to Dr. Elkes finally that they were killed by the thirty-four that sabotaged the Jews too.</span> <span id="s440">They were supposed to...in in a in a store of sugar, they poured in gas...gasoline, and so this was why they were killed.</span> <span id="s441">Of course, this was the Nazi ______ but

years, recorded...the Germans never wanted to that the outer world to know what's going on inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s446">They never wanted to know what activities the mass murderers had enforced.</span> <span id="s447">It was my inner impulse, a driving...inner driving force to put it in writing because I was myself overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s448">I couldn't talk to anybody about this.</span> <span id="s449">There was not a possibility to talk because there was so taken the day to day and hour to hour with work in the Jewish community and I I uh I had a secretary and I had to go to the to the German offices uh to in town to ask, for instance, let's say the the least.</span> <span id="s450">We had an office.</span> <span id="s451">We needed pencils.</span> <span

ghetto, but in in addition, we had for instance Pnina, the same Pnina, but from this Pnina would not...there was not another one.</span> <span id="s716">As I told you, she had a very tiny

need in this.</span> <span id="s734">You understand.</span> <span id="s735">Or for instance, I wa,s as I told you, one of the founders and leaders of the Zionist underground, so one day I get a call from the from the ghetto, main ghetto gate.</span> <span id="s736">There...there is one woman that speaks...she is...she wants to speak to you.</span> <span id="s737">She asked for ________ and when

id="s743">So I told her, tell him take care and bring her straight to me.</span> <span id="s744">Who was it?</span> <span id="s745">It was Irena Adamowicz, who is in the book.</span> <span id="s746">She was a Polish that was very much close to the _____ movement in Poland and she was going from ghetto to ghetto, bringing reports to each other and it was for the first time after a year that we heard ______ came.</span> <span id="s747">She said I want to talk to you, so I said please talk.</span> <span id="s748">She says no, I want to talk you in private.</span> <span id="s749">So I went in one of the rooms.</span> <span id="s750">She says I come now from Vilna.</span> <span id="s751">I am...I bring regards from _____ or from this or from this...so of course we cannot talk here.</span> <span id="s752">She says alright, so I arranged immediately a meeting of...____ meeting of the committee of the _____ of the underground at my private dwelling and I..</span> <span id="s753">.</span> <span id="s754">there were two from the underground ____ that said alarm if somebody comes in and all went to to work in my...because they were in my dining room where all the members of the executive of the Zionist underground and in addition Dr. Elkes and Garfunkle, yes, and uh and uh Dr. uh Dr. Shapiro was there.</span> <span id="s755">There was a _________ who was also a member of the underground.</span> <span id="s756">For a half a day long, she reported to us on what's going on in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s757">For the first time that it told what could be...you know, something was going on behind the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s758">We never had a slightest idea and here comes a woman.</span> <span id="s759">She spoke fluently Yiddish, and that's why the gate...they couldn't...they couldn't be suspicious because if she would speak Polish or something, they wouldn't let her in at all.</span> <span id="s760">You understand?</span> <span id="s761">And this woman disclosed to us for the first time so open, a little little ______ say in Hebrew, in English, ____, a little window, a small window to the outer world, what goes on in Warsaw, what goes on in Vilna, what goes on in Lodz.</span> <span id="s762">And then we reported to her on what's going on in the ghetto and she was amazed, so this encounter with such a Polish Catholic woman who is exceptional.</span> <span id="s763">By the way, she came to Palestine the ______ Israel, in '56, and she was _______ .</span> <span id="s764">You cannot imagine what...to tell you...unfortunately none of my sisters uh survived.</span> <span id="s765">They all were perished in the war, but even if my sister would come I wouldn't be so happy she was there, and they took her around and everything.</span> <span id="s766">I ____ out of my way and I look to please her and so on, but she was a Communist.</span> <span id="s767">Of course ____, and this is where we...where we differed.</span> <span id="s768">But this very meeting inside the ghetto with an outsider was in itself a breakthrough, not exactly what the Germans intended...their intention to to close us behind barbed wires, that nothing should be known to us what's going on and nothing should be going out what's going on inside and when the 28th of October...this terrible day, the most terrible day in the ghetto, the selection of 28,000 people, inmates of the ghetto, and they told it...I don't want to repeat because they spoke about it with regard to Dr. Elkes this morning before, so this selection of eight, ten thousand were in one day...all of a sudden we felt that we are...if it can happen in one day that the men ________ their own finger in their, ____...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Pointing.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Pointing, since ten thousand today, so we would have been _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: How did this...that happen?</span> <span id="s772">Did they call people to the square or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I beg you pardon?</span> <span id="s774">First of all, the the Gestapo said that in ghetto are people who are working hard and there are people who are working less, and people who don't work at all, so we'll know that the portions of food for those who are working is not enough.</span> <span id="s775">We know that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough, so we want to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are now only for those who don't work in order to make sure who is...these who are working, so we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto, thirty thousand, should report on the 28th of October on the big square democratic, families-wise and groups of working-wise, you see, and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one place those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't work will get the same rations as now.</span> <span id="s776">So Dr. Elkes said if this should be done, he said, we can do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s777">We take...give you the list of the people ____ ourselves out of department of supply, we'll give double rations to those who are working and give less rations, the same rations to those who are not.</span> <span id="s778">For that purpose, you don't need all of the 30,000 inmates of the ghetto to report on on on the democratic square.</span> <span id="s779">We we we do not believe that this is the true reason for for that order and Elkes worked very hard and he met twice with Roka (ph).</span> <span id="s780">As I told you...and what did they tell Elkes to __________.</span> <span id="s781">Mr. Roka, Mr. Commander, may I talk to you as man to man?</span> <span id="s782">It is not....</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Avraham, let's stop here because we have less than a minute of tape.</span> <span id="s784">And I want them to switch the tapes...</span></p> <p><span id="s785">END OF TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: OK, Avraham, you were telling me about the massive selection on that day.</span> <span id="s787">You were telling me about the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s789">So uh Dr. Elkes tried to squeeze out from Roka what is the real reason for ordering thirty thousand people, old and young, sick and healthy, uh babies in in in the arms of their...children...why do they have to go to the court?</span> <span id="s790">Will.</span> <span id="s791">.</span> <span id="s792">if it's a matter of food rationing, we'll arrange it.</span> <span id="s793">So he says no, the Jews are too much uh close to each other and they have...and they aren't very...they aren't very...for each other, they they wouldn't...they they cannot trust others will do it.</span> <span id="s794">They'll give to one and they'll share with the others and...to cut a long story short, we did not believe that this is the real reason for for ordering all on the square and a certain...certain members of the of the Jewish community...Jewish committee said that we should not uh give the instructions or we should not make public the order.</span> <span id="s795">Why should the Gestapo itself not make public?</span> <span id="s796">It should write in public...why would they want us.</span> <span id="s797">They wanted because if it would more information and an announcement of the Jewish committee, there would seem that if the Jewish committee is ordering that, and this under no circumstances wanted to do, so finally they decided that we should ask the...to consult the chief rabbi Shapiro (ph) who was a a scholar of world fame.</span> <span id="s798">He was at one time a candidate to be the chief rabbi of ____ Israel, and uh we we went to him and he he said that it's a very hard question and he has to check with the...and when we come...he told us to come at eleven...at eleven o'clock night and then he told us to come at five o'clock in the morning and he was not ready, and then to cut a long story short, he came very along and finally he said...he phoned...in in certain conditions that the Jewish community was placed into a a a a situation, that if there is a possibility to rescue part of the community and not the whole community, the Jewish leadership has to do everything in order to rescue the this what is possible.</span> <span id="s799">I'll tell you later about the the very famous story about the two went in the desert and had also left one cup of water and it was sufficient only for one of them.</span> <span id="s800">If one of them will drink the water, the other will die.</span> <span id="s801">If both of them will drink, nobody will...and this is...so after having heard this this uh consultation of the chief rabbi, it was the wording of the of the of the formation of the ________...the announcement was in a say that the Gestapo ordered the Jewish population of the ghetto to appear, not that the Jewish committee but the Gestapo ordered the Jewish community...so and those who will not appear at the...at six o'clock in the morning, and those who will not appear at six o'clock in the morning and they will be found in their house, each one which will be found in his house will be killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s802">They shall leave open the houses, the doors, the the shutters, everything, and finally uh there were several...uh and where there is a sick man, they should put in writing, they should put in writing that there is a sick man that is immovable, that cannot be transported, and of course all those who were left and killed...they killed them and at six o'clock in the morning, there was thirty thousand went with ______ in their hands, to...from various parts of the ghetto to this square and I ______ it as the funeral of the victims themselves.</span> <span id="s803">The inmates themselves went to their own funeral, because nobody knew what will happen and who will go and who will not go, and at eight o'clock in the morning, Roka stood up on the top of...</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Was the square just packed?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Over-crowded...and it was family-wise and work groups-wise.</span> <span id="s806">Those...all those who worked at the airport should be all together in one group.</span> <span id="s807">Those who worked in cleaning and and in the Gestapo building, they should all in their places of work and the name of the place of work.</span> <span id="s808">And the Jewish police separate ____ the Jewish uh committee separate with the Jewish and so on, and then Roka started...at eight o'clock, he started...he stood up on the upper hill in order to have a a a overlook all this group and he started ______...____ to march forward and they used to pass by him and then he used to say _____, _____, ____, right.</span> <span id="s809">And usually the people see that right is the better...better.</span> <span id="s810">Left is not good and at this time exactly the opposite to the right and it happened so that people were very lucky that they were sent to the to the right, but the...to the right they sent the old people, the children, those who are not capable of working, who cannot be the.</span> <span id="s811">.</span> <span id="s812">of real...any assistance to the to the to the effort of war, of the German effort of war, and this took place all the day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Was there panic?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Was there panic?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Not panic at all, but but but uh let's say uh they waited and nobody know...knew what is going...nobody knew that it's want to be dead, so maybe it's harder work.</span> <span id="s817">We are...anyhow, and uh he stood and in one end he said _______, _____, left, right...and with the other hand he kept a sandwich, and he kept handkerchiefs and they ate very tasteful ____ but they kept also that his finger should not get uh from the fat from the sandwich he had, _______.</span> <span id="s818">It was just terrible to see a man without any human feelings at all.</span> <span id="s819">He eats with one hand the sandwich and other says left, right, left, right, and Dr. Elkes stood not far away from him and tried to get out somebody from the left to the right side.</span> <span id="s820">He said this is a very important carpenter and this is a brick layer and this is a very...a very machinist, artisan and so on.</span> <span id="s821">He tried to help but in the end of the day...and and this took all the day long and people, the old men fell on the spot in on the on the democratic square.</span> <span id="s822">Old people or sick people, they fainted.</span> <span id="s823">They were left there.</span> <span id="s824">They didn't even reach the the selection point.</span> <span id="s825">They just left where they were, you see.</span> <span id="s826">And uh and the uh it it ended approximately that six in the evening when it's already sun...sunshine is down, sunset, and then then thousands of people went straight...they went over to the smaller ghetto that was...which was vacant before from the 4th of October where they put on fire the hospital with the with the patients, with the doctors and the medical personnel on the 4th of October and they liquidated the small part of the ghetto and this and this vacated part that they killed approximately the thousand people on the 4th of October...they left in the ten thousand people were and Elkes tried and when he...Elkes stood all the day long and didn't want to sip...he didn't want to take a sip...water, nothing.</span> <span id="s827">He says oh why should I live up to this day and why...what have I done wrong that destiny just goes...and he stood all day and he didn't move.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: What were some of your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: What were some of your emotions that you were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: I was close to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: And what were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: I..</span> <span id="s834">.</span> <span id="s835">I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s836">He was closing and when somebody of the police and there was a very veteran Zionist man over the age of seventy.</span> <span id="s837">He was the owner of the Hebrew library ____, so he was alone so I told Dr. Elkes, when ____ passes by, try to rescue him, you know, so we...we just told him.</span> <span id="s838">We were busy all the day.</span> <span id="s839">I at least you see, but, of course, he he he rescued that this was a very small part, and in the evening came to Dr. Elkes at his home those who were separated, husband from men and then from children from parents and so on, and they asked him...and then Dr. Elkes uh asked the ______, the commander of the police, of the Jewish police, to ask from Roka that they should take home from those 10,000, hundred men who were in to to...in his language these were very important artisan (ph)...this is a very important physician, and this is a very important this...and the next morning when they were all from the small ghetto on their march to the 9th Fortress to the to the _________, the the Germans called the 9th Fortress Anhilation (ph) Point Number 2, and of course in their secret uh but I got it, you see, and so Dr. Elkes was permitted to go in and take out the hundred but then they fell upon...all of them, Dr. Elkes rescue us.</span> <span id="s840">One took him by his sleeves.</span> <span id="s841">Another took him by his foot.</span> <span id="s842">Another took him by his head and they take him by by his coat, and then there was a great tumult, you see, and they march them to the 9th Fortress _____ all the all the the the ten thousand were mixed up and the Lithuanian partisans entered and they beat up Elkes terribly on his head and he fell and he fainted and then we rushed from the other side of the ghetto uh several people and myself and we we took him on our arms and brought him entirely...he was two days in that place.</span> <span id="s843">He was terribly wounded and this is what he he could he could always...they told him if we don't go away from you, we take you to the 9th Fortress.</span> <span id="s844">This was a terrible...the most terrible day that there was in ghetto, and another day that I think I should mention...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: We have to uh end the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: End?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s848">Your wife is in a car waiting for you outside and we'll have to pick up maybe tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I am not quarreling with my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Not after forty years.</span> <span id="s851">I'll walk down with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: You...you know where I'm at hotel...at the at the uh...what do you call it...embassy...</span></p> <p><span id="s853">END OF TAPE 3</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Avraham, what I would like to start with is for you to tell us what were some of the the private ways that people decide the Nazi regulations and the Nazi laws in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Well, we usually read and hear about the heroic uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, of the Lodz ghetto and so on.</span> <span id="s856">Also in Kovno, the uh the escape from the 9th Fortress, the legendary escape from the 9th Fortress that you read later _____, so I uh but the main...I always am trying to stress and this is what I've done in my diary I think, to stress the fight of the each individual, of the inmate, the plain man or woman in the ghetto, even the the boy...child...for survival of one day.</span> <span id="s857">Sometimes survival of another hour in the hope that something might happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: And what did they do when you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: So first of all, the rations that the Germans gave to feed the inmates was a ration for starvation.</span> <span id="s860">No one could live on a hundred grams, but also this hundred grams of bread, the uh the inmates didn't...the the the individual inmate didn't get because we had kept secret two thousand souls in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s861">Babies that had been born despite the the strict order to cut off pregnancies.</span> <span id="s862">Second there were old men or sick men that if you would put them on the register of the in...inmates of the ghetto, they would have been killed, so this two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off from the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams or eighty-five grams of bread so that the others can get also.</span> <span id="s863">So each one in his own way tried to get additional food.</span> <span id="s864">You couldn't go in in the supermarket and buy it.</span> <span id="s865">You couldn't go in because in the ghetto there was nothing, so people used to go to the...to work outside town and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not buy because nobody sold.</span> <span id="s866">It's war time and it were sanctions also in the city but the Lithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in.</span> <span id="s867">They would give you a loaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a pair of trousers or stockings or a jacket or whatever.</span> <span id="s868">I..</span> <span id="s869">.</span> <span id="s870">for reason I remember it was the 31st of December, 1942.</span> <span id="s871">My present wife sold out...already sold out everything she got, but she...there was left a gown, you know, for the ball, for very festivity...made big festivities.</span> <span id="s872">She was a rich woman, so...but nobody bought a gown in in in time of war, so we had in the opera house in in in Kovno, there were a group of Jewish workers who worked then in the opera house as dressmakers, as uh as to make the haircuts and uh you know, ____, and they were also working and cleaning the the opera house so I took Pnina and went as workers in that brigade and she took along with her the gown.</span> <span id="s873">It was a wonderful gown, you know, and with the...accordingly also a pair of shoes, you know...elegant, and there on the 31st of the...before...the eve of the New Year, the actresses there jumped on this merchandise, you see, and so she she got some bread and and a little bit of uh of uh sugar, you see, for the gown, which costed hundreds and hundreds.</span> <span id="s874">Just in one of the examples of one fought for the survival of another day, more so when she had a small child and she needed...badly needed milk that you couldn't get in the ghetto, leave alone an egg, you see, so this was an opportunity for her to bring milk and then when she got it all and she got rid of her gown and this, it was a problem how to pass the control at the ghetto gate.</span> <span id="s875">When...at the ghetto gate there always sentries of the ghetto commandant, the German ghetto commandant, then all the Lithuanians on one side.</span> <span id="s876">From inside there were the uh employees of the Jewish labor exchange who used to to arrange the exit of the laborers in the groups from the ghetto out to outside to their places of work and they were...had ways and means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German, and so they keep uh close... close an eye and and they pass by, take part of it and give them as bribe you see, but nevertheless something left, and in this way people tried...tried not to starve, just plainly...very plain words...not to starve.</span> <span id="s877">And uh some some others used to to get a..</span> <span id="s878">.</span> <span id="s879">make this deal of trade in above or through the ghetto fence.</span> <span id="s880">There was a barbed wire fence, two meters high.</span> <span id="s881">The Lithuanians knew that there is a shortage of food inside the ghetto, so they used to come and from a from a distance show a loaf of bread or show a a sugar or show five eggs, you see, and the and the...from inside the ghetto they used to show a pair of trousers or a jacket or something like that, and when they...when they nod of the of the of the head, they came to to an agreement or they trade in, so when the...along...along the barbed wire always twenty-four hours a day, the sentry used to go back and forth, back and forth, so the moment when the sentry used to go, let's say to the left, they used to throw above...above the the uh fence to the Lithuanians and they used to to send...to throw above the the food, and we used to call it _____.</span> <span id="s882">A ______.</span> <span id="s883">You know what is a ____ in the war, a _____, and this was a _____ merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Avra...Avraham, tell me, you mentioned the opera house.</span> <span id="s885">Is that where the orchestra in the ghetto played or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: No.</span> <span id="s887">In Kovno they had a wonderful opera house.</span> <span id="s888">It was in the center of the city and they had excellent, excellent Lithuanian...Lithuanian uh singers.</span> <span id="s889">Also one Jew was...a Jew...one of the main singers was a Jew, but the orchestra, the musicians mostly were Jews and part of them, those who were not killed before entering the ghetto, they were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s890">First-class musicians.</span> <span id="s891">For instance, this soloist of the of the musicians, yes...he was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s892">A soloist, violinist.</span> <span id="s893">And several others.</span> <span id="s894">The doorman at the uh Jewish committee offices were a first-class pianist.</span> <span id="s895">We didn't send them to work because we wanted to to to save their hands, their fingers, you see, but he was a doorman and was very happy to be a doorman.</span> <span id="s896">You understand?</span> <span id="s897">Others were policemen, you see.</span> <span id="s898">They were such policemen like you were but they...this was the way to keep to keep uh their fingers, you know, that not be entirely...and in addition they were certainly not used to hard labor, you see, and some use...I can switch over...when I talk about the ______, I want to finish with regard to the to the fight ____ and then small children were in danger of being killed in the first place because they don't...so what did we do?</span> <span id="s899">We arranged a so-called vegetable garden guard of young children of the age of eight to twelve.</span> <span id="s900">From the age of twelve they could already get a work and be laborers and and a a card, a labor card which was absolutely vital in the ghetto, but what would we do with the children from eight to twelve, so we organized this.</span> <span id="s901">They were a group that was called ______, _____________...the the guards of the gardens.</span> <span id="s902">We had only vegetable gardens, and the very _______ about about a hundred and yet they had a uniform, you see, and they had an arm band and so in this way we could...and these young...youngsters also wanted to eat, so they used to try, you see, first of all uh when they were in the gardens and the gardens were along the ghetto...the ghetto fence, so they also sometimes...being small children, they used to squeeze through the ope...raise a fence.</span> <span id="s903">One keeps the fence...two people comes from both sides.</span> <span id="s904">He is a small child so he came through, dig a little bit in the earth, you see, and he went out and brings, sneaks in some bread or something and and he makes in the ghetto, you see, so even small children were cautious of the danger of starvation and they have knowingly lent into danger of life in order to get some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: How about the kids that were under eight and twelve, the the children...what did they do during the day?</span> <span id="s906">You know, the six year olds or five year olds or four year olds?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh yes...well, you see, so uh fortunately... unfortunately from the beginning we were not...we were not conscious of the great danger of these children because we never thought that they can take children and kill them, but when the the aktion of the 4th of October, 1941, when they put on fire the contagious hospital in the small ghetto with the patients inside, with the uh doctors and with the personnel, medical personnel, all of the them, they were put on fire and they lead...but before they put on fire this building, the adjacent building was a children's home, an orphan's home, and there were approximately five, six hundred children so they took them out from the building in the broad...in the courtyard of the...of the contagious diseases hospital and were just plain put them...I can never forget the picture.</span> <span id="s908">There were small children and babies, just babies, in the in the orphan's homes so the Germans when they put them on the on the on the ground, on the ground, and they just kicked them from one side to the other side with their with their boots, the Gestapo men.</span> <span id="s909">People like beasts.</span> <span id="s910">They behaved just like beef...beasts.</span> <span id="s911">They used to kick them...when the children laid, for instance, with their faces up to to heaven, yes, so they kicked them, then turned down, and then again.</span> <span id="s912">This was a just terrible, terrible, terrible sight to see it and then they took them from that courtyard straight to the 9th Fortress and they killed them in the very same day together with another thousand uh inmates of the small ghetto, after they put on fire the the the hospital.</span> <span id="s913">They did not let...our firemen were very...were the fire brigade in the ghetto...excellent fire...firemen were trained years and they were ready to to to...but they didn't let them come near to the place, you see.</span> <span id="s914">There were Lithuanian fire brigades who came close to the close to the uh ghetto fence, but they came just to safeguard that the fire shouldn't come over to the other side of the of the fence.</span> <span id="s915">You understand?</span> <span id="s916">And this is...so you see they were just not to to to fight the fire but to see that the fire shouldn't grow to the other side and uh this was one of the most tragic days and what...it is worthwhile mentioning, in that very contagious diseases hospital, you see, we were...we didn't have so much space and so many hospitals, so part of this contagious diseases hospital served as a maternity where children...women gave birth to to children.</span> <span id="s917">This, of course, was absolutely against...contrary to the to the restrictions of of pregnancy and so on, so when they took out the uh the uh the uh the uh...they took out from their beds many sick people and they brought them in one place where they couldn't ___ for sure.</span> <span id="s918">They shouldn't remain sometimes in ____.</span> <span id="s919">There was left some part of the building, left after the ___, so in one...they they left...they didn't...they just pass by one room where two women were laying after giving birth to the child, to the babies, and the two babies were on, you know, on the window there is a..</span> <span id="s920">.</span> <span id="s921">big window there is such a..</span> <span id="s922">.</span> <span id="s923">you know, like let's say this is the window and here is such a small...a small wooden...wooden...</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Like a ledge...</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s926">So at this two...there are the two children, so when they came to control if somebody was left in the room, so they saw the two women and they were about to take them out, but then one of them saw the children, so he...he came near to the babies and they looked and they looked and they and they...all of a sudden, some human...human feeling came perhaps in in in his in his heart, you see, so he said to the other one, what do you think?</span> <span id="s927">Shall we leave these two babies?</span> <span id="s928">You see...and in silent they went out and they left the two women with the two children.</span> <span id="s929">I..</span> <span id="s930">.</span> <span id="s931">I am telling this to stress that even among the murderers were single, very rare, very rare...but there were sometimes people with human feelings and they behaved sd human beings and not like beasts like all their their comrades.</span> <span id="s932">Being with the swastika and over the Nazi, you know, the grey...the grey uniform with the with the swastika with all this...to look at them was...one got frightened, you see, but these men, that they came back and they looked at the faces of the baby, he couldn't withheld from being...they they commit...and these two women and these two babies were the only one that left from from from that hospital, you see, and this is...this is...we always remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Avraham, you brought Esther, the artist...</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: You brought Esther, the artist, to draw scenes from that hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Well...so so at that time...at that time, when they liquidated the ghetto, the small ghetto, they took thousand men from the ghetto and they liquidated to the 9th Fortress, so I didn't have any _____ more in '42...it was...in '41 in the beginning I have to say prior to the aktions on on human beings, on life, they took...confiscated all the belongings and they were...when the ghetto inmates were ordered under threat of death to give all their gold, their belongings, their silver, furs, _____, post stamps, collections...whatever valuables, and there were two stations in the in the...near the Jewish committee where the Jews had to bring bring all their belongings and wherever they...while making the searches inside the houses, each other, and sometimes on the spot killing them and and this brought about the people to run and get rid of their gold, to get rid of their silver, to get rid of their of their of their furs, you see, so we didn't have any cameras anymore.</span> <span id="s937">If...in...on the ____...it was in August.</span> <span id="s938">The the big...the big confiscation, the total confiscation of whatever people had had with them.</span> <span id="s939">Others digged it in the earth or somewhere and they didn't...like Mack (ph)...I'll think about them later, but the the overwhelming majority, they were left without a penny and without any valuable, clothing or or furs or whatever it was, so I didn't have a camera anymore, and I thought it is absolutely possible...impossible that this event, that this side should not be somehow eternalized for posterity, but this already...the ghetto, small ghetto was out of bounds.</span> <span id="s940">It was cut off from from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s941">I'm sorry I didn't take along with me my documents.</span> <span id="s942">I would have shown you.</span> <span id="s943">So I went to to Esther _____, and I told her, Esther, you must draw what remained from the burned hospital, so she said how can we come in.</span> <span id="s944">It is it is out of bounds, so I I went to the commandant of the ghetto and I told him that since it was it was October...in in Lithuania in October it is already cold and very cold and we had no firewood in the ghetto and what they used to give us, just like the hundred grams of bread, this was the same story with the with the firewood, so I told them in the small ghetto, some families left some firewood.</span> <span id="s945">Would he allow us to take out from this from these dwellings inside the small ghetto, to take out the firewood?</span> <span id="s946">So he he...and I don't remember that I mentioned it yesterday that the commandant of the ghetto, mostly they were elderly men and they were not so, you know, fanatic like this, so they had understanding...he had understanding for this and he tells me alright, I give you two hours, two hours to go in into the into the...so I said I need a uh a wagon, you know, but I didn't need a wagon.</span> <span id="s947">I wanted that Esther, so he he gave a wagon and I took Esther and I went in inside there and we stood and we looked where would be the best position geographically for Esther _____, to the painter, to stand and to paint it, but to paint from outside would be would be very dangerous because they could have killed us on the spot because all the time the sentries go around the gate...the the fence, so I decided that we should go inside a building and the adjacent building from the left side of the burned hospital was a two-story house so we went into this story...two-story and we arrived on the second floor and Esther from the the window from which she could have a good look on the remain...what remained from the hospital and she painted and she drawed and she draw and this is what she have made it, but all of a sudden when...as she paints she...and I am on the outlook...all of a sudden I hear somebody went in in the first floor so I got frightened to death because if they would found us, Esther... probably it would have been the finish for her, and I was responsible.</span> <span id="s948">I'm the bad guy that brought her about her about it, you see, and I felt terrible, frightened to death, so I went closer to the staircase in order to see who is there, so that when they heard the...my footsteps so they run out.</span> <span id="s949">What happened?</span> <span id="s950">These were Lithuanians who had...who came in just to to to to steal and to take away what the Jews have left, so you see this was also...and this ______ but to to learn the moment of danger to death was always there and uh she has done it and, of course, I took her some firewood from the house, from another house and be...behind the firewood I put the the drawings of Esther ______ and we safe came back to the to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s951">There was another place where I took Esther _____.</span> <span id="s952">I don't know.</span> <span id="s953">I think I mentioned to you that the...were the ____ of the Lithuanians in the...in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s954">This is the very suburb where later was the ghetto, that on on the very beginning, on the...at the night of June 25th to the 26th, the Lithuanians massacred thousand Jews in the Slobodka...in the Slobodka suburb.</span> <span id="s955">They just went from street to street and one of the houses...I I..</span> <span id="s956">.</span> <span id="s957">then I I'm always after to see what it looks like, but they closed up the area and nobody could go in and and the and the houses after they have been looted, they closed up with uh wooden blocks and uh and uh and plywood so you couldn't go in inside the the the houses because it was locked from ____.</span> <span id="s958">Anyhow, I I went in with Esther _____ and one house that I knew was a a Zionist leader.</span> <span id="s959">He was the director of the _______ in in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s960">_____ was his name, a famous veteran Zionist.</span> <span id="s961">His wife was a dentist, and I wanted to know what happened to him, so I took Esther ____ again and, you know, I am a sportsman so for me to to, you know, to to ____, that was not such a big problem, but for Esther _____, it was not easy.</span> <span id="s962">So first of all I had to to take off some wooden...how do you call it...the such uh they closed the the doors...</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: The panels.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Panels.</span> <span id="s965">Yes.</span> <span id="s966">Panels.</span> <span id="s967">Board (ph) of panels...but they were only only with nails, not very...not very steady, not very strong so I could easily take it off, you see, and we scurried (ph).</span> <span id="s968">First of all I went in and then I made it broader so Esther _______ could go in and then I took it again, so from the outside it was as as it was before before we climbed in and we climbed in in the house.</span> <span id="s969">What we have seen was a terrible, terrible thing.</span> <span id="s970">There were three rooms.</span> <span id="s971">In one room was the head of ______ and his body was on the on the _____.</span> <span id="s972">There was blood on the on the walls.</span> <span id="s973">Uh you know, all the feathers from the from the from the

<p><span id="s976">Q: What was your reaction when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s978">It was just terrible but but but you you had no way out.</span> <span id="s979">You had to...so so until until until Esther ____...you know, I had to calm her down and to calm myself down first of all, but I brought her in.</span> <span id="s980">I'm responsible for her and she's there and she painted it...and she painted it.</span> <span id="s981">And she cried and she cried and then she painted and cried again and this was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s982">Look, there was in the ____ where ____ were, I have a photo, one of my photos, of a yeshiva man on his ____, on his ______,on the ______...______, and with his talis (ph) on himself.</span> <span id="s983">He _____ so killed, so he he remained on it, so this was one of the paintings and there were many other paintings like that that I went on in order to produce visual evidence to what I have writ...I have written, because nobody would would...I said to myself and I told it to myself...who would believe what I am writing.</span> <span id="s984">It is out of human understanding and it is out of what any community in the world could think of.</span> <span id="s985">A barb...barbarism is not the right word for it.</span> <span id="s986">And...but I was lucky enough that Esther _____ and Joseph Schleslinger (ph), and then there was another...another uh...on the 11th of January, 1942, the German Gestapo ordered to the one area of the ghetto, the _____ area, to...they should vacate their their dwellings within four hours and whoever will be found in the in their dwelling in this area after the expires the four hours, you will be shot on the spot without any clarifications and whatever will be remain of their belongings will be confiscated.</span> <span id="s987">They said, the Gestapo said that they need the area and these dwellings to settle the Jews who are to come at this very day from Germany and from Austria, five thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s988">That area lived only three thousand, but they squeezed...so when we heard, we took it for granted that first of all five thousand Jews are coming to the ghetto and Dr. Elkes, the head of the Jewish Council, said we have to meet them as brothers, give them the feeling they are coming to brothers, so he ordered that the women should prepare hot coffee for them because the terrible cold...in January was the thirty...thirty centigrades below...below uh below uh below...thirty below...the most hard winter in the ghetto was in 1942.</span> <span id="s989">Dr. Elkes himself stood all the day from the beginning whenever we we got word of that five thousand are to come in the ghetto, he stood at the main gate with several people, and with women who were ready to give them...offer them coffee.</span> <span id="s990">He felt very much...and he he says I can understand the feeling that these people were taken out from the houses, from the from the countries, and they don't know where they're being brought.</span> <span id="s991">At least give them a greeting for...when they will have to cross the gate behind barbed wires, they should...barbed wires they should know that they're coming with brothers.</span> <span id="s992">So we...those inmates from this area to be vacated in four hours didn't have any transportation.</span> <span id="s993">They were not allowed to to use transportation, horses or wagons, so they dragged, you know, in their hands, bundles on their on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s994">They uh...some uh some uh home uh utensils like uh like uh for children to bath, you know, the...it was used to drag it and on the snow.</span> <span id="s995">You understand?</span> <span id="s996">I I saw the the the the picture of all the people frightened to death to be in time not to remain there after the...it was just...I said this scene I must put on a drawing, and then I didn't find Esther _____, so I run to...there was one young...the youngest painter in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s997">He was Schmidt.</span> <span id="s998">Schmidt, Joseph Schmidt, but we called

put under his under his overcoat and bring just running.</span> <span id="s1008">It was far away from his...it was on the other side of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1009">Running we came to the site and there I had to find a place where he could stand and make his paintings that should not be seen by the Germans, not even before Jews.</span> <span id="s1010">You understand?</span> <span id="s1011">And he stood in a certain place which he found...he found a place we thought for him ____ and I stood on the outlook and then I called for two of our underground...there were...everybody

and they put them in their hip pockets.</span> <span id="s1038">They don't bring it to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1039">You understand?</span> <span id="s1040">From the board where the suitcases, on the trucks...so we had always several size that are workers in that building uh used to work and uh this was also one day in the ghetto unexpected.</span> <span id="s1041">You never knew what the next day will bring you.</span> <span id="s1042">There is a very nice poetry, Russian language...what does you today or tomorrow bring upon us.</span> <span id="s1043">______________.</span> <span

very, very nice poet from a very famous uh Russian poet.</span> <span id="s1047">We don't like the Soviets, but we like very much the poetry and their language and their literature.</span> <span id="s1048">I am telling you I I I was uh I was...I lived...Lithuania was under under these Russian czars and I studied law, the Russian law, not the Bolshevik law.</span> <span id="s1049">Come back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: So with that, I mean you never knew what the next day would bring.</span> <span id="s1051">How did people keep their spirits to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: So so...you know, there were...there were...there were...there were various kinds of reactions.</span> <span id="s1053">There were people in the ghetto that didn't...they they thought maybe this is the last day so why not eat?</span> <span id="s1054">Why not drink, that people will manage to bring in, to smuggle in...we called them ______...the smugglers of the gate or the smugglers of the fence.</span> <span id="s1055">You see, _______, in Yiddish, ______, and smugglers, when they used to make...they turned it into a trade and they used to make big money.</span> <span id="s1056">They even got to eat meat and and butter and eggs.</span> <span id="s1057">Said let's eat.</span> <span id="s1058">Tomorrow we will not...we will not...even on the eve of the of the 28th of October, people were...most of the people were in tension and and didn't know what is going to happen tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1059">Others thought this is the last day, so they used to concentrate in their thoughts, in their minds.</span> <span id="s1060">Others took out everything that they had and said they will eat up everything, not to leave for the Germans the next day anything.</span> <span id="s1061">You see?</span> <span id="s1062">It...look...it's thirty thousand people.</span> <span id="s1063">It is not a a..</span> <span id="s1064">.</span> <span id="s1065">you don't think by order.</span> <span id="s1066">You don't act as somebody would expect you to act.</span> <span id="s1067">Everyone in his own way.</span> <span id="s1068">You understand?</span> <span id="s1069">And so there was a very very thin...a very thin group of people who ate in meat, in butter, in eggs, a very thin few...those were the smugglers, but they, of course, uh uh rescued their...risked their life.</span> <span id="s1070">Some of them were killed.</span> <span id="s1071">You know, you can uh make a _____ once, twice, but the third time you...a bullet comes and finish...finishes you.</span> <span id="s1072">You understand?</span> <span id="s1073">For instance, Dr. Elkes and all those...he was close to starvation.</span> <span id="s1074">Although he was very...again and again offered by the smugglers, we'll bring you butter.</span> <span id="s1075">We'll bring you this.</span> <span id="s1076">He never accepted not a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1077">He used to share with me my my piece of bread, you see, or offer me his piece of bread, but he would never never have any connections with smugglers which we thought it's...the underground...it's the...what we are trying to fight, just to keep the standard of of human of human behavior, of Jewish heritage, to keep alive even under these terrible circumstances of the ghetto, and this is only thanks to Dr. Elkes and to those leaders who were known as community leaders before the war and they were elected by...elected, and this was the difference, the big difference between the ghetto of Kovno leadership and the leadership in other...in other ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Avraham, let me ask you quickly...we had gone over to another story and I wanted to ask you, what was done with the children who were under eight years old?</span> <span id="s1079">What did they do?</span> <span id="s1080">Were they educated?</span> <span id="s1081">Were there schools in the ghetto they kept

id="s1145">We're just changing tapes now.</span> <span id="s1146">We'll pick up from where you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">END OF TAPE 4, SIDE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: OK, Avraham, we're going to start with the underground and the Zionist movement, the Zionist resistance movement.</span> <span id="s1149">Tell me how that was established, what some of your activities were, and who some of the leaders were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1151">Now uh the the situation prior to our being incarcerated in the ghetto behind barbed wires, the uh terrible attacks and killings of uh Jews in the streets of Kovno, right after the outbreak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto, called for immediate resistance because we had a..</span> <span id="s1152">.</span> <span id="s1153">also even under the Soviet occupation, 1940, June 1940 to June 1941, we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zionist uh movement or leadership let's say it was, but this is entirely different character.</span> <span id="s1154">While under the Bolsheviks it was our main aim to assist the families economically.</span> <span id="s1155">Of the leaders we were being arrested right on the first days of occupation, they were arrested.</span> <span id="s1156">They were taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1157">Second, to try and ourselves try and avoid our own exile

religious.</span> <span id="s1170">To the contrary, my my brother-in-law, her husband Benjamin, a very decent, very honest and very fine person, he wasn't...he was uh in the so-called...there was a movement of Jewish left, Bundists (ph)...</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Bundists...</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Bundists.</span> <span id="s1173">And he was a Bundist.</span> <span

Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So how was the Zionist resistance different than that ____?</span> <span id="s1177">You said they...they supported people economically.</span> <span id="s1178">Then how...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: I I'll come immediately.</span> <span id="s1180">And then we were assisting one another.</span> <span id="s1181">He told me...my brother know this what I've told you but remember, it was...he told me, look Avraham, you're on the list to be exiled to Siberia, so just try to to to...from the surface...disappear.</span> <span id="s1182">So I told him wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1183">I will sleep with you.</span> <span id="s1184">He says what?</span> <span id="s1185">You'll sleep with me...if they want to find you, you will...they will come to me.</span> <span id="s1186">They know that I am your brother-in-law and they know that...your sister.</span> <span id="s1187">So I finally tried hiding in various places in the outskirts.</span> <span id="s1188">I run away to Vilna (ph), to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1189">Yes...which was then the capital of Lithuania, and in Vilna I found out who...with whom could I make contact, also Zionist leaders, but they themselves were hiding, so we are hiding together in a park, in a in a lane, you know, uh somewhere out...in the outskirts of the city, and it was an absolutely impossible situation.</span> <span id="s1190">You understand?</span> <span id="s1191">And to the end, you know, I couldn't...couldn't see any other way out but to come back to Kovno, and when I came back to Kovno, two days later...</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: The invasion...</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: The invasion...German...German war break out and so as I said yesterday, I went

of different dimensions and entirely different aims so uh when the historic and dramatic meeting or assembly of the Jewish...of the Jews...Jewish leadership of Kovno to elect a over-Juder (ph), a chief Jew, and this...and the committee, in the very same place, in the very same school, former school, two hours later we we held a meeting in another room of this very same school for leaders of

<p><span id="s1198">A: Oh of course.</span> <span id="s1199">They were my best friends, so to start with _____ Goldschmidt.</span> <span id="s1200">He is now Sam Goldsmith, Saul Goldsmith in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1201">Yes.</span> <span id="s1202">Uh the second one was _____ Kohn from the labor.</span> <span id="s1203">By the way, this Saul Goldsmith was from the very left, uh ________.</span> <span id="s1204">And is now quite a millionaire, you see, and uh the second one was ______.</span> <span id="s1205">Belkahn (ph).</span> <span id="s1206">Belkahn...he lives in New York.</span> <span id="s1207">He from the labor movement.</span> <span id="s1208">The...from the _______ were the head, the chairman of the _______ movement in Lithuania, ________ or as I call him, ______, who passed away in Israel two years ago, and uh myself representing the Zionists, general Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s1209">Three or four.</span> <span id="s1210">Right after joined us a fifth one, very active.</span> <span id="s1211">This was _______, Issac _______.</span> <span id="s1212">He was most uh instrumental because he was a pharmacy and the...was the head of the oldest pharmacy in the ghetto, and since we considered that the pharmacy is the most place that nobody will think of that there is any hidings or some contra...contrary Nazi activities, so we below the...below the the pharmacy where there was a cellar and in this cellar we arranged uh to have one...to listen to a radio from abroad.</span> <span id="s1213">The...it was the only..._______.</span> <span id="s1214">This is what you have from the...to to listen, you see.</span> <span id="s1215">_______ we used to go down the the the pharmacy in the cellar and listen to radio.</span> <span id="s1216">Mostly himself would listen but because each one was busy in certain tasks and then we used to come frequently...once a week, even sometimes more...but this was really top secret.</span> <span id="s1217">Also for all various groups.</span> <span id="s1218">I never told my ______ from general Zionists that we have a leadership of the uh of the for...of the underground in the ghetto resistance.</span> <span id="s1219">What I told them is that we have first of all, to be organized ourselves, keep together, be ready to oppose the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1220">For instance, after the 28th of October, we had a decision of the underground, of the all the the the underground, the Zionist underground was called ________ Kovno.</span> <span id="s1221">_____ the the letters, the initials as _______.</span> <span id="s1222">____ as you know, the Hebrew...in English to translate it is, in in in distress, in in in uh...not sulk.</span> <span id="s1223">You are in a very hard position.</span> <span id="s1224">You cannot move.</span> <span id="s1225">You are surrounded and you are in in in in in a uh in a very bad situation, let's say...and uh the _____, we called _____ always to be on the alert, to tell us, to signal us whatever they know in their dwellings or in their working places, what they have heard and what they know, to bring us the news, so we used to concentrate after the day of work when they used to come back from the works from the places, they used to to report to us on what they have heard that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Where would you meet, Avraham?</span> <span id="s1227">Would you meet...be hidden someplace...?</span> <span id="s1228">How many of you would be...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: We...we...first of all, there was only small, very small _____, four, five.</span> <span id="s1230">Not more.</span> <span id="s1231">Six was the maximum, so we used to...we meet either in a a in a in one's dwelling or somewhere on the vegetable gardens as if we are working those vegetables.</span> <span id="s1232">Sometimes we meet in the center of the village because...or or in the or in the cellar of the of the uh pharmacy.</span> <span id="s1233">Because for us was...we were cut off of the outer world.</span> <span id="s1234">This was exactly the very meaning of the Germans by setting up the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1235">First of all to keep us behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1236">We cannot go out.</span> <span id="s1237">We cannot have any contact.</span> <span id="s1238">We didn't have telephones, and later when we had telephones, it was also for the...only for the inner...inner communication between the pol...Jewish police and the and the and the German commando of the ghetto for even...for his convenience, not for the convenience of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1239">Or there was a a telephone in the Jewish committee, in the labor department, and so on, for the convenience of the Germans, not for us.</span> <span id="s1240">But we knew to exploit also these.</span> <span id="s1241">For instance, the telephone...there was at the gate, there was a service police station at the at the ghetto gate, Jewish police station.</span> <span id="s1242">For the other side, outer side, there was a German's and the Lithuanian's police.</span> <span id="s1243">Inside there was the Jewish police, so whatever...if...whenever some top official of the Gestapo or of the Wermacht or the stock commissar, entered the ghetto immediately they signal by phone to us.</span> <span id="s1244">In the Jewish committee it was myself.</span> <span id="s1245">In the labor, we had another man.</span> <span id="s1246">In the police, we had another man and this used to come __________.</span> <span id="s1247">Immediately...if there...for instance, when Roka came into the ghetto, we were...the the streets were cleaned up.</span> <span id="s1248">Everybody run away and then so we used first of all together use or information on what is transpiring in the various places of work in the ghetto and what they have heard and there were rumors more than than facts, you see, but even the rumors for us...we...not having any kind of communication with another city.</span> <span id="s1249">There were three ghettos in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1250">The Kovno ghetto, the Vilna ghetto and the ____ ghetto, but there was no communication so the first work what the Zionist underground have done, to establish a communication between the Kovno ghetto underground and the Vilna ghetto underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: How did you do that?</span> <span id="s1252">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Oh, this is a good question.</span> <span id="s1254">You are a very intelligent interviewer, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1255">So you see, there was a Jewish...Jewish worker group...worker...who worked at the railway station in Kovno, and we the the head of this group, usually a group of workers...in in the terminology of the ghetto it was a brigade...a brigade, and the head of the brigade was _____ Silverman (ph), who was a member

to Vilna.</span> <span id="s1258">Try to bribe one of the workers of the of the railway...of the...of the...who are working on the train, yes, so as to get that you could send some letters from Kovno ghetto to the leaders of the underground in the in the Vilna ghetto, whom we knew.</span> <span id="s1259">And this Silverman succeeded in bribing the man who drive...the driver of the train...how do you call it...the driver of the train...the loco...</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Conductor...</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Conductor of the locomotive.</span> <span id="s1263">You see?</span> <span id="s1264">And first I remember he came, right, give me...so we gave him ten letters.</span> <span id="s1265">Each one of us knew one or two from the Zionist, previous Zionist leaders in the in the in Vilna.</span> <span id="s1266">For instance, I knew _____ ___ was from the youth Zionist general youth movement, so I sent to him a letter.</span> <span id="s1267">The others sent to their...to their respective ___ in Vilna and we and the same Silverman gave these ten letters.</span> <span id="s1268">Of course, it's not easy to take out ten letters from the ghetto because if they would find...if they would check him on the date when he goes out as head of the brigade and finds the letters, it was the end of him and of all the brigade, so you you you had to be very, very careful.</span> <span id="s1269">But he succeeded and he and he he bribed this conductor of the locomotive, of the train, and uh he was supposed to give these to one of the underground in the _____ or ______.</span> <span id="s1270">______ was from the, you know, the name.</span> <span id="s1271">He was one of the leaders of the Vilna ghetto and the Glaserman (ph) was the leader of the ______, so each one sent to his man in Vilna, and luckily the next day, he brought letters from them.</span> <span id="s1272">This was something that opened our eyes and our minds and you couldn't know but of course this was...the the letters were restricted to several lines only because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1275">So first of all, we are telling them in a in a in a very...in our own language to make them understand that we are trying with them...saying that we are organized, that we are trying to keep ____ together, and from time to time we meet, and we are trying...we are trying to keep the the mood of ______ and give them the feeling they are...they are not alone.</span> <span id="s1276">They...its give them to renew the sense of belonging so that gives them also more security, more defense, that in case something happens, they know they have to...they...as ever a man to whom they can go and open their arms and their pains and and their problems and so on, and there were, believe me, everyone had a full heart and pains himself or his family or his parents, or his friends, and that we want to get a ______.</span> <span id="s1277">We didn't say it like that.</span> <span id="s1278">We want to get from you a _______.</span> <span id="s1279">You understand?</span> <span id="s1280">And we didn't have to put the more words in the in the few lines that we wrote because we were...had to be ready that it will be detained and then go and explain.</span> <span id="s1281">And so it was that we got first...the first contact with the with the Zionist underground in the ghetto of Vilna, and we developed later on also to send letters from families from the ghetto of Kovno to families in the ghetto of Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Avraham, tell me what those first letters from Vilna that came to you...you told us what your letters were to them.</span> <span id="s1283">What were those first letters to you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: First of all, he tells me, for instance, this is what he said.</span> <span id="s1285">First of all I am very pleased to hear that you survived, that you live, that you are among the living.</span> <span id="s1286">Second, I am the same...I am pleased to tell you that I and my wife and my brother-in-law and my sister-in-law and ____ and this, this and this is already...this is in Siberia and this is there and this was killed.</span> <span id="s1287">The names of the leaders, the former leaders, you see...this is what ____, and even ____ of who is and who is not, and believe me, this was most important.</span> <span id="s1288">You see?</span> <span id="s1289">And then uh in the next letters...already we started always your problem...food or is the problem of labor, what are the the possibilities of uh of uh fight...____...we didn't say fight...____...you

bird that is in distress knows exactly how to keep a most either shout or cry very aloud the form out express ourselves and tell what...what...what is...what is their interfering or what is their desire, you see, so the situation brought about to bring our news that we wanted to to transfer to the...to the _____ in Vilna, was in a very, very masked vocabulary, and we used to say the next time, ____ or ____, whatever it is, you see, and we used then the slang or just uh new words that wouldn't mean to anything...to any...nothing to anybody but for us it was understood _____ Gestapo we didn't mention the name Gestapo would be in another form ____ of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Did you share information about the deportations or the liquidation of the ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1296">Of course.</span> <span id="s1297">This was the first thing which we have done, and we wanted for them to ___.</span> <span id="s1298">Then we wanted to know...certain family when they started to write, they wanted to know about their members...there were certain families that part of them were in the Vilna ghetto and part of them were in the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1299">For instance, my wife, her brother, two brothers were in Vilna, and this was the first time that she learned that that he is alive while the other brother was killed, and this was the first time, and the very first uh communications.</span> <span id="s1300">So when more more letters were sent and we had to distribute the letters to to the to the inmates of the ghetto, we used the...we had an office of statistics in the ghetto, administration.</span> <span id="s1301">We didn't speak about it but uh statistics.</span> <span id="s1302">We...they wrote every birth and every passing away from the ghetto, every marriage.</span> <span id="s1303">We had marriage in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1304">Life went on.</span> <span id="s1305">Of course, a good...there was a bar mitzvah in the ghetto and uh and and I want to tell you...I must tell it.</span> <span id="s1306">Once I was sitting in my office in the Jewish committee and all of a sudden I got a call from the workshop, big workshops in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1307">We had big workshops that worked eighteen hundred, mostly women who could not go out of work from outside the ghetto, and there were a carpentry and tailorship and and plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing, cleaning...all for the German army, but we...and so so uh the German supervisor of the ghetto used to come to the Jewish committee or he used to come straight to the workshop.</span> <span id="s1308">There for...he liked very much to go to the workshop because he could order a suit for himself, a pair of boots, from his wife he ordered dresses.</span> <span id="s1309">It didn't cost him money, you know, sent, so all of a sudden I get...I get a call from the workshop, big workshops uh that I should immediately come.</span> <span id="s1310">Miller is there.</span> <span id="s1311">Miller was the deputy ____ commissar who were at the supervision of the ghetto and when Miller says I should come immediately, I have to come immediately.</span> <span id="s1312">So on my way from the Jewish Committee to the ghetto workshops, I passed by a small lane, a street... it's not a street...it is a a..</span> <span id="s1313">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: An alley?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: An alley?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: An

you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: What's upsetting you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: So finally he left me off and I came to the uh to

have to the say the blessing ____ so you can say that you fulfilled the mitzvah (ph) of sitting in a ____ and make the blessing, and this...my son is bar mitzvah, so I have to drink...it was...most certainly it was not vodka, but it was something of...there was...I certainly didn't care very much but I was overwhelmed of the spirit.</span> <span id="s1360">This is, my friend, part of the resistance.</span> <span id="s1361">It's nothing but revolt against the German order, strict order to press us, to dehumanize us.</span> <span id="s1362">We shouldn't think of bar mitzvah and we shouldn't think of holy days, and we should think only only slavery, work, on the very hard work that we should think only how to get another piece of bread and not think of _____ and not think of holy days and not think of bar mitzvah and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s1363">This is the day in, day out resistance of the common man, the inmates inside the ghetto, and this is what kept them alive, because _____ is a great meaning.</span> <span id="s1364">_____ is when the...the Jews were in the desert and they had no place to live and they built tents and they were lived forty years

id="s1366">And uh it it keeps...it moves me so innerly to the bottom of my heart when I think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: We can stop now.</span> <span id="s1368">Do you want some more water?</span> <span id="s1369">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: But of course we had much more serious things to do.</span> <span id="s1371">We...the four of us or more precisely the five of us, the leaders of the underground, before they found us, __________________ leadership, we made a final decision...after the 28th of October, no more respond to orders of concentrating on one place of all the...of the all the ghetto or not even part of it.</span> <span id="s1372">No more.</span> <span id="s1373">And to resist, to oppose and really it happened so that I think a month or six weeks afterwards, there was the order to report on the very same square.</span> <span id="s1374">They need five hundred workers to be sent to Riga (ph), from the Kovno ghetto to the Riga ghetto.</span> <span id="s1375">We believed no more what they say because they said the five hundred, they were to to the archive and they were killed.</span> <span id="s1376">They said they need to to to make order to divide between those who get more bread and those who get less bread, and they killed ten thousand so this ___ that we had no confidence whatsoever and we made up our minds no more response to...and then they tried...they started to grab people from the street, and they could grab three hundred because most of the people from the ghetto were at work outside the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the people, so they took these three hundred and brought them to the place, to the democratic square.</span> <span id="s1377">I went there and saw the sight.</span> <span id="s1378">At that time there was _____ and the supervisor of the ghetto in ______.</span> <span id="s1379">He was a mass murderer, and he...all of a sudden I hear that he says maybe those will want to volunteer to walk to walk to Riga should make five steps ahead, and I was sure nobody will will go, but there were five who stepped ahead, and finally I disclosed that these five were insane or very...not insane but crazy people.</span> <span id="s1380">For instance, I..</span> <span id="s1381">.</span> <span id="s1382">one of them was a former high officer of the Lithuanian army and I thought what what..._______ was his name...so I said _____, why did you volunteer?</span> <span id="s1383">Do you know...are you sure that you want to to work in Riga?</span> <span id="s1384">Don't you know what happened with the five hundred.</span> <span id="s1385">He says he's ____.</span> <span id="s1386">Kovno alone must know that I am a crazy man.</span> <span id="s1387">_____.</span> <span id="s1388">Let also Riga know that I am _____ and this only showed you who you are talking with, and also this type of people were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1389">Now this was one thing.</span> <span id="s1390">Fir...second, for...when Elkes was going in town to meet the chief of the Gestapo, I always tried to escort him...from a distance, of course, just in case something happens.</span> <span id="s1391">Now we...we...our clandestine uh uh _____ that lasted for five months and then they were caught and the man, ______ was put in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1392">He was always almost killed.</span> <span id="s1393">They arrested the the the main clerks in the Jewish Committee...first of all the secretary of the Jewish Committee, Berenstein (ph).</span> <span id="s1394">He had not the slightest idea because I have done nothing.</span> <span id="s1395">They arrested the chief of the statistic bureau although he had no idea but his assistant deputy.</span> <span id="s1396">They arrested the main uh the main uh clerk _____ of the of the office of the altestenrat.</span> <span id="s1397">They had not the slightest idea but Elkes turned heaven to earth and earth to heaven until he got them free.</span> <span id="s1398">You see, and this was...but he was not allowed to be any more the secretary of the of the Jewish committee and so I became the secretary in May '42.</span> <span id="s1399">Then when we had in course of our correspondence we were told that they have partisan groups in the forests around Vilna and this was far behind...from Kovno more than a hundred kilometers, and that they will be ready to assist if we send a group to those forests so they should come to Vilna and from Vilna they...so we had a contact and then we started very seriously in training our movement, our Zionist underground movement, in in uh weapons and we had among our _____ two officers who were officers in the Lithuanian army and were very well-trained in in in ammunition, and they were the instructors that instructed these small groups, of course, in two, in three...not in always in the same place.</span> <span id="s1400">Always in some other place.</span> <span id="s1401">You understand?</span> <span id="s1402">And they...I think I told you yesterday that the first gun that we bought was in 1941 in the beginning when when the ______, the teacher...master of the Hebrew school and _____, a lawyer from Charlotte (ph), that I knew them very well before...they came to me and said we'll...we have a possibility to buy a gun.</span> <span id="s1403">Could you provide the money for it?</span> <span id="s1404">And I went to Garfunkle, the Deputy and he said what are you talking about.</span> <span id="s1405">It will be a terrible risk for all the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1406">So I didn't give in.</span> <span id="s1407">I went to Dr. Elkes.</span> <span id="s1408">Dr. Elkes didn't say another word.</span> <span id="s1409">He says go...go to the treasurer and tell him that I ordered to give the money uh to to to _____ yes, and _____ and this was the first gun we had in the ghetto, but this really was the first but not the last one.</span> <span id="s1410">And then, little by little, we used to try and how can we bring in weapons to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1411">So first of all, ______ worked in many places, workshops where they had...especially those who...to repair German weapons in the in German units, to repair weapons, so he is planning to steal and and how did they steal?</span> <span id="s1412">For instance, they were about thirty or forty people working in that place where they...you know, where the ammunition stores and the Germans, for them it was a uh a just a lost uh let the Jews try to repair it, so each one of them used to take a part of a gun in the pocket, and when they used to come to the ghetto, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Put it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: But to pass with a part of it is also...it was not so...believe me, it was not so easy.</span> <span id="s1415">Unfortunately, one of our best men was caught with a weapon.</span> <span id="s1416">He...he dared to take a weapon himself home, and they thrash (ph) him and they killed him on the spot.</span> <span id="s1417">So we paid very high price, very, very high price, but uh when the...yes...and now I want...when the first group of the Zionist underground was ready to go to the woods, and we knew that there will be the...yes...and we knew that there was a ____ from the Soviet Union in the woods, a top uh officer of the Red Army who trained them and who supervised them, so we knew that they are going in a place where there will be a communist surrounding and there will be also many non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1418">It was very important for me that they in their leisure time could have talks about Zionism, about ____ Israel, about the events in Jewish history, sing Palestine songs, so I came to some let's say understanding...we didn't sign any contract... with the the communist leader in the ghetto who later as I said they had also their own underground.</span> <span id="s1419">I said look Heim (ph)...he was a very...he he was an idealist.</span> <span id="s1420">He was a communist, but he was also one of the circle, of the cultural circle that we met once in two weeks, you see.</span> <span id="s1421">He was also a writer, so I tell him, Heim, I am sending...we are sending the Zionists, first Zionist group to the partisan woods.</span> <span id="s1422">I want you to to see to it that in their leisure time they could sit together and hold conversations.</span> <span id="s1423">When there is a real Jewish holiday, they could just mark it.</span> <span id="s1424">They would sing Hebrew songs and they could tell each another, so he says Avraham, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1425">We are want to convert them to communism.</span> <span id="s1426">This is what he said.</span> <span id="s1427">He was a very honest man and I believed every word that he told me because he was a very, very honest man.</span> <span id="s1428">But fortunately they came to the to the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s1429">From there they brought them to the forest, but then a month later I got word that they...not they were to mention Hebrew and not a song of ____ Israel, and not mention _____ Israel, leave alone prayers and so on.</span> <span id="s1430">You understand?</span> <span id="s1431">And I was very much uh disappointed.</span> <span id="s1432">Yes.</span> <span id="s1433">We...when the...when in 1943 when the the communists raised also and and organized their their resistance in the ghetto, aided by Heim _____, so we made an agreement among us to join forces.</span> <span id="s1434">For the Germans a Jew is a Jew, whether he is a communist or whether it is religious or whether it is combat or whether...whatever it is, so uh we had a uh joint command.</span> <span id="s1435">Two from the Zionist underground and two from the communist underground.</span> <span id="s1436">I together with three ______ represented the Zionist underground in the joint command, but after this incident, I said I'm...I know it's not you but we'll...I know you cannot do anything about it but I joined a communist...a command joint with communists.</span> <span id="s1437">I I I resign.</span> <span id="s1438">I cannot...it's against my my concept of life.</span> <span id="s1439">I am a Zionist from early years, and then came

Jewish workshops in the ghetto, the big workshops in the ghetto, so we used to send them to work there.</span> <span id="s1449">Those who were the first to go to the woods, they should go and work in the place where they repair the German uniforms, see, and then they used to adjust to ____.</span> <span id="s1450">Also, we needed German uniforms just to...you know, as a mask so there they used to take, to measure (laughter) and not plainly fabricated but to measure.</span> <span id="s1451">Everyone was equipped with everything.</span> <span id="s1452">We just stole from the German stores and from the German repair and it worked very good.</span> <span id="s1453">The...unfortunately, the the main man who led the groups from the Kovno ghetto to the Vilna ghetto to the forest was the leader of the communist ________ and uh he used to to dress himself as a as a Wermacht officer, you see, with the all equipment and he came to take a group out of the ghetto, all the partisans, and we

that worked together with the underground.</span> <span id="s1462">They helped them.</span> <span id="s1463">They didn't work together but they helped them.</span> <span id="s1464">And they...for reasons once so he he was...I want to finish with him.</span> <span id="s1465">So he used to take the lead and bring them to the forest and come back.</span> <span id="s1466">It took him, of course, a

id="s1701">When all people in the ghetto leave him all their gold and silver and money and valuables, he digged a..</span> <span id="s1702">.</span> <span id="s1703">below the earth and he remained with two kilos of gold and coins and silver and whatever it is, and he tried to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1704">He was in a contact with a Lithuanian group that promised him to take him through the Baltic Sea to Sweden, and paid a lot of money, but they had to go through the ghetto, so he tried...he and another...another friend of him, to go through the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1705">They cut down the barbed wire, he...Mack...but what...he was a very short...uh you couldn't see from afar, you see...how do you call it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: You couldn't see from...short-sighted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Short-sided, yes.</span> <span id="s1708">So he caught...cut the barbed wire and they went out.</span> <span id="s1709">He just jumped on the commander of the ghetto, Fleishman.</span> <span id="s1710">And he...even that and this is not enough...he took out a gun from his...from his pocket and says, commandant, get away from here.</span> <span id="s1711">Otherwise I will...I will shoot.</span> <span id="s1712">He didn't finish the word and the and the and the commander had already his hand on his gun and everything and it was a mess in all the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1713">Immediately all the ghetto was surrounded by machine, you know, from the Gestapo and military and police and whatever you say.</span> <span id="s1714">The Germans brought him to the to the commander of the ghetto and they wanted him to disclose...the other one who was with him, he retreated inside the ghetto, disappeared.</span> <span id="s1715">And they wanted from Mack...the name of the man was Mack...and they wanted from Mack that he should disclose who was the second man that uh that retreated, that disappeared.</span> <span id="s1716">They beat him up.</span> <span id="s1717">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s1718">When when we came...so what did they do?</span> <span id="s1719">They didn't succeed in in in in getting the name so they so they called the...as hostages took the the Jewish committee, this Garfunkle and Goldberg and Dr. Elkes was sick in bed for...he had a very hard rheumatism, so so the secretary should come, so they took me, so the three of us came, were brought and came here, were brought to the to the to the uh commander of the ghetto and the first thing that they wanted us that we should influence, impose upon Mack that he should disclose who the second was.</span> <span id="s1720">We had an iron rule in the ghetto...not one Jew be handed over to the Germans by us.</span> <span id="s1721">So we keep quiet.</span> <span id="s1722">When I saw Mack in the...in the commander's... commandant's office, you couldn't recognize a person because all his head was a piece of of flesh.</span> <span id="s1723">You hardly could see his eyes, so was he beaten, and mind you, Mack was not a member of the underground, not of the Zionist and not of the Communists.</span> <span id="s1724">He was just a plain man, but he did not disclose...more they beaten and beaten and beaten and he didn't open his mouth, so then they said...</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Avraham, we have to stop here.</span> <span id="s1726">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1727">We'll have to pick up...</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: We have to pick up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: We have to pick up later.</span> <span id="s1730">I'm told that we have to stop at this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">END OF TAPE 6</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Avraham,

I'm talking...we are talking about the escape from the ghetto and not from Kovno.</span> <span id="s1736">It is two different things.</span> <span id="s1737">Well, as I already mentioned before, I was one of the four founders of the Zionist underground movement which was a resistance, and we we...there prepared in the very end when the when the ghetto is...before liquidating the ghetto, the leaders will escape to the woods, to the partisan groups, and this was the planning.</span> <span id="s1738">It was a matter of timing when should we escape from the ghetto and this was a very important question...which one of the four leaders of the Zionist uh resistance movement were all the positions in the ghetto life, so it wasn't just a matter of once a decision.</span> <span id="s1739">It had to be a decision with the consent of the chairman of the Jewish committee and so on.</span> <span id="s1740">But it happened so as I also told you that I was very much engaged in this looking and finding a place of hiding for ____ which was then seven years.</span> <span id="s1741">When I found such a place and the legendary escape of ______ from the ghetto, she fell very ill and when she came into the farm of hiding, it was absolutely necessary that Pnina should go there at least for a week because we couldn't bring a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1743">Let me...let me back up and if you could tell us on tape that ________ was Pnina's daughter, just so we have it and and how she got to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1745">Well...well, ______...Pnina's first husband was killed, was murdered by the Lithuanians...they already in the first days of the outbreak of the war and Pnina went ___ to the ghetto with a small child of five years, her name ______...____ less than five years, and she could bring nothing with her from home because her apartment in...a Jewish apartment, a most elegant apartment in Kovno, was taken over by German generals and they didn't let her in when she was taken to prison.</span> <span id="s1746">All...the all the family was taken to prison.</span> <span id="s1747">There they were separated.</span> <span id="s1748">Her husband separated...</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: We have all that.</span> <span id="s1750">We have all that from...we have all that from Pnina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Anyhow, so she remained in the ghetto alone with ____ and uh we uh she's...Pnina was uh hiding my uh my entries in the diary and my collection of documents.</span> <span id="s1752">I felt I must help uh ____, Pnina in hiding...finding a address for ____, to cut a long story short.</span> <span id="s1753">Uh it was very difficult but in ____ I I I succeeded in finding a contact with a priest who found a place for her hiding and when I took her out from the ghetto, three times I tried and I didn't succeed.</span> <span id="s1754">It was...it failed.</span> <span id="s1755">There always were a a Gestapo officer or somebody else that we we...our plans failed.</span> <span id="s1756">On the third time I succeeded in taking her out of the ghetto, but in the two first times of trying, it was winter.</span> <span id="s1757">It was cold so she got a cold.</span> <span id="s1758">She got a cold and when she finally reached the farm, forty-four kilometers away from Kovno...it's about eighty miles...excuse me, about forty miles...she was entirely sick, ______.</span> <span id="s1759">And only by accident I..</span> <span id="s1760">.</span> <span id="s1761">it's not here in the places...by accident got to know that she is ill in the farm, and I immediately went to the priest and I told him we must uh...we must give medical help _________.</span> <span id="s1762">No doctor can be...can be brought to ____ to cure her.</span> <span id="s1763">At least Pnina would go, take along with her medicine.</span> <span id="s1764">We had excellent doctors in the ghetto and she took along and the priest was very opposing it because it was the danger.</span> <span id="s1765">Anyhow, I said it would have meant nothing if she would die, ____, from from illness.</span> <span id="s1766">It's the same we didn't do nothing, so she was there but instead of being there a week, Pnina stayed there four montheses.</span> <span id="s1767">And she worked there in the farm in all works as was she was considered as a as a relative, far relative from town that she run away from Kovno from bombardments and from the war, but she was for all things and purposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them and uh it was a woman, a widow whose husband, the boss of the farm, fell from a from a thunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm, and the widow was a very good-hearted, that was very religious, and that's why the priest could talk her in that she should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina came because she didn't know what to...______ was crying all the time...Momma, Momma...and uh I..</span> <span id="s1768">.</span> <span id="s1769">as I said she lived there instead of a week, she stood there for about four, five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman, the widow had three daughters and one son.</span> <span id="s1770">The son was about eighteen years, but because his father was dead so he was the head of the family and around the farm and he couldn't attend school.</span> <span id="s1771">He was illiterate and he very much wanted to learn to write and to ready, so Pnina told him, look..._____ was his name...______, I have a man.</span> <span id="s1772">He is a lawyer and he is a educated man and he will edu...educate you in writing Lithuanian and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Did this man...did this young man...you helped him.</span> <span id="s1774">We...we do have to cut it a bit.</span> <span id="s1775">Did you help him?</span> <span id="s1776">Did he help you escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: And then he was the one who who agreed that to to...that I should be brought and he himself prepared a special hiding place for me inside the the farm, faraway from everyone, and so I came to the farm.</span> <span id="s1778">So one day I was surprised by from the priest for me that a wagon will be waiting for for me on the 23rd of February, 1944, for the farm.</span> <span id="s1779">I was, as I said, prepared to go for the woods but not for the farm, but since I got such a a word from Pnina so it was nothing doing, so I had to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1780">The night before...so I told...of course, I told Dr. Elkes about my plans, that I have to escape from the ghetto, and the the last night I spent in the house, in the tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes, the head of the community, and his deputy Garfunkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the very full sense of the word.</span> <span id="s1781">Just a lady, and the two people, I disclosed to them and I told them that my...the hiding place of the five crates of my diary and collection and they should know where it is but Garfunkle, the deputy, said ____, you cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1782">It is already no ghetto.</span> <span id="s1783">It's already a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1784">And you are going to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1785">Who can escape now from the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1786">And how will you make the fifty-four kilometers?</span> <span id="s1787">I beg of you, don't do it.</span> <span id="s1788">It is terrible.</span> <span id="s1789">It's dangerous.</span> <span id="s1790">Don't you know the case of Mack.</span> <span id="s1791">Mack was the one who was caught...they caught at the at the...when he tried to to escape through the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1792">He was hanged publicly.</span> <span id="s1793">Don't you know it?</span> <span id="s1794">You were there at night, the whole night in the Gestapo together with him in the cell.</span> <span id="s1795">But Dr. Elkes said go.</span> <span id="s1796">If you would be my son, I would tell you go because you are the only one who know best what expired in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1797">You kept a diary and you have a collection and documentation and it is...you have a mission to go and bring the knowledge to the world, to the outer world that it shall remain to the future generations...the Germans digged out the corpses of the sixty thousand that were killed in the 9th Fortress, so that there remain no sign of it.</span> <span id="s1798">That's why...that's why I think...I'm sure you have courage.</span> <span id="s1799">You have knowledge.</span> <span id="s1800">You have the persistence and you will succeed I'm sure about it, so uh in order to encourage me more, he took out from his drawer his last will.</span> <span id="s1801">His two children...a son, Prof..</span> <span id="s1802">.</span> <span id="s1803">now Professor Elkes, and a daughter Sarah, were studying in London and he says here is my last will.</span> <span id="s1804">Give it to my children.</span> <span id="s1805">I rely upon you.</span> <span id="s1806">You...your...your wisdom and your courage and I..</span> <span id="s1807">.</span> <span id="s1808">what you have done in the ghetto for the three years, you have shown that you have enough power will and you'll...you'll make it, and this is what gave me the courage really to escape and it was very, very exciting for us and we embraced and we kissed each other and then I left his home, two...after midnight, two-thirty after midnight.</span> <span id="s1809">Two hours later I was already at the main ghetto gate and there were my two friends, the...one of the most activists of the underground, Zionist resistance movement.</span> <span id="s1810">________ was an officer in the Lithuanian army.</span> <span id="s1811">He trained in in in the underground and he and the second one was _______ _______.</span> <span id="s1812">He's now in New York.</span> <span id="s1813">He...we called him the savior at the gate.</span> <span id="s1814">He knew how to bribe the sentries at the gate and when one gate...one sentry will be and what sentry is good, so he fixed it all.</span> <span id="s1815">At five o'clock in the morning when only one sentry is at the gate...they start only at six o'clock they start move from the ghetto, so you come at five o'clock in the morning and he bribed the the the sentry.</span> <span id="s1816">He...he _____ they were on the on the...we had...at the ghetto gate there was a station of the ghetto Jewish police and of the legal department, so they were officially the ghetto, so they let me through the the gate and and then and this way I escaped from the from the from the ghetto with the wagon of another four people, allegedly to bring from the wagon uh bread for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1817">They returned, of course, without me, but this is how I succeeded...succeeded to pass through the gate and then the very dangerous time when Geck was the liquidator of the ghetto, he would not spare a minute just to put a bullet himself in the _______, but when I escaped, I got known later that the Gestapo and the ghetto commander uh announced that they'll...five thousand marks they give the one who disclose where...the whereabouts Avraham ____ or his dead body.</span> <span id="s1818">Dead or alive we need him.</span> <span id="s1819">You see?</span> <span id="s1820">And this will show you how important it was, the great help of my very close friend.</span> <span id="s1821">______, the policeman was was questioned at the 9th Fortress.</span> <span id="s1822">He was the one who knew, who saw me last.</span> <span id="s1823">Where did I go and how did I go?</span> <span id="s1824">And they beat him to death, but he didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s1825">Even they took one of his eyes out and then they killed him, but he didn't disclose a word.</span> <span id="s1826">I want to tell you and when I came...when I escaped from the ghetto, I came to the priest and the priest told me the the the widow, the the the...from the farm, she is here with a wagon and two horses and I should take the wagon and the horses and I should cross the bridge that between Kovno and the and the other and the other suburb, _______, which leads to the farm where the where the...they had the farm with the widow, but the the the priest said he wouldn't want to rescue the life of the of the widow, the very good Christian woman in case they are be caught at the at the at the bridge, because on both sides of the bridge were stationed military gendarmes, and they checked each and every one, the documents and everything, so it was not very easy.</span> <span id="s1827">I had no other choice, so and he said that we will meet two miles after the bridge, after the second part of the bridge, and when we...I came to the horses you know, and they had a very big coat as a a ____ and they came to the bridge.</span> <span id="s1828">There was a Jew of _____ and because they checked and double-checked, each one will take.</span> <span

by the the the sentry, the gendarme and he says heil Hitler, and he passes by and they let him go.</span> <span id="s1832">So I say, well, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1833">I can also say heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s1834">You see?</span> <span id="s1835">So...but it was a a..</span> <span id="s1836">.</span> <span id="s1837">to to decide in a second...this is your life or you live or you possibly don't, but I had nothing to to loose, only to win, so I take out my horse...with the horse my wagon aside and I pass by and I say heil Hitler and with the with the...what weapon I had in my sack then, I showed them below that the wagon is entirely empty.</span> <span id="s1838">There is nothing, only straw, you see, so ____, and I said heil Hitler, and without ___, I showed them there is

heaven.</span> <span id="s1843">It is...it is a miracle, but I don't believe in miracles.</span> <span id="s1844">I believe in persistence, in hard work, in making up your mind and know what you do and know where you go, and don't give in and don't take no as an answer.</span> <span id="s1845">And they...nothing like that not permitted.</span> <span id="s1846">What was permitted for us?</span> <span id="s1847">The German was really...in the ghetto he came in and they saw in in in a dwelling and they saw a woman lying in her bed, so he said why don't you work.</span> <span id="s1848">What are you so lazy in the bed, so she said, _______, I'm ill.</span> <span id="s1849">I have thirty-nine grade of uh temperature.</span> <span id="s1850">It was a very high temperature.</span> <span

was...I was..._____ I was beating the horses and I was saying ______ and when the woman stood there, she didn't believe her eyes.</span> <span id="s1857">She was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q:
