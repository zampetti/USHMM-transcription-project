know, and what are your earliest memories of Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Well, I – I started school there.</span> <span id="s219">Well, I was – I must have been six, maybe I – I’m – I don’t ha – have exact memories or – maybe I went to school or s – school in Tann over there, or started in Tann.</span> <span id="s220">Then in Nuremberg I went to school that was associated with an Orthodox synagogue.</span> <span id="s221">I b – and then later on – all right, I se – I think the – the arrangements, or the – the setup for schooling in – in – in Nuremberg was you go four years in el-elementary, and then five years in high school.</span> <span id="s222">Or it used to – I think it used to be six years, but under Hitler they cut it short to five years.</span> <span id="s223">And I – I – I believe later on Jewish children couldn’t stay – go to public school as I’m – anymore, so that I – a Jewish larger school was formed, and my ti – and my father was teaching there.</span> <span id="s224">So, if I remember colle – correctly, I probably stayed in the Orthodox school for about four years.</span> <span id="s225">And I remember I was in my father’s class for one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s227">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: So – pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What was that like, having your father be –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: He was very strict with me.</span> <span id="s231">But he was a very good teacher, and so I think after the fifth year, I went to high school for four years in – in Fürth.</span> <span id="s232">Yeah, there was a real – a – a Jewish high school in Fürth.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What did he teach?</span> <span id="s234">Remind me again, what was it – what subjects –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: The whole curriculum for a fifth g-grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Oh, so everything from math, to history, to science, to –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Ri-Ri-Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s239">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: In the – when I was in the Orthodox school, I also was in the choir in the synagogue; we had a boys and men choir.</span> <span id="s241">I still remember s-something o-o – you know, I still reme – I still wish – see it, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did you enjoy that, being in the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, I liked to sing.</span> <span id="s244">I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s245">And then later on in the schooling in – in Fürth, in the high school, we used to take a streetcar from Nuremberg to Fürth every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And how long would that take?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Oh, I don’t – maybe a half an hour, o-or y – maybe even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Now, when you were in high school, Hitler was already in power.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Oh yes, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So were there any incidents on the streetcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: No, I – I don’t re – I was thinking about that the other day, I don’t remember any.</span> <span id="s252">I don’t remember any.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Do – do you remember – do you remember when Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s254">You would have been eight years old, or seven years old.</span> <span id="s255">Do you remember whether it was talked about at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I don’t remember what ta – we talked about at home.</span> <span id="s257">I remember, you know, the – my parents, they were really aware of – you know, they – they kept up to date with the newspapers and I remember Hindenburg and Hitler taking over, but n-no details, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: No incidents stick out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s260">You see, su – in – in some way my – my father was not too much involved in it, by being employed by the – a main synagogue.</span> <span id="s261">While others, who had businesses in other – boycotts, and smashed windows, and that k-kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s262">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: When was the first time that you felt perhaps a bit of danger, a bit of insecurity out in public?</span> <span id="s264">Or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I didn’t – I – I – I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s266">You know, Nuremberg was the – the big

don’t remember too much about that.</span> <span id="s351">I am – my memory is not that great.</span> <span id="s352">It’s – there’s a certain instance – incidents I have on paper, I don’t

Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: I wanted to go back to something I was trying to establish before.</span> <span id="s359">Did you have any non-Jewish neighbors?</span> <span id="s360">When I asked if it was a Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah, well – and, yes, I would say we were the only Jews in the hou – in the building, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s363">Did – how did – did you have any interaction with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, with the bake – bakeries –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Whe-When you

there.</span> <span id="s371">No, I think there was a good relationship at your – in – in the story later on, I might come up with something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s373">All right.</span> <span id="s374">So, when you’re – when you’re now in Nuremberg and growing up, again you still don’t – like you said, you don’t feel particularly threatened, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s376">You mean now?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: No, I meant, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: At that time.</span> <span id="s379">Not real – may-maybe you – well, you know, in the – in the street, there were the kids, so you ha – you – you might have – I think ab – I – I – I had some problems with, you know, in the street kids, and – sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And they were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: But in – in – in nothing – I thought – I thi – I might have had a fight with – with somebody, because I remember I – I broke a finger, or sa – or you know, in – in one of these incidents.</span> <span id="s382">But I – I don’t know any details, I just remember I – you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: You just remember the broken finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yeah, right, right, and – well, also later in the story, in – in – at – something might cu – you know, something comes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: When did – did – did your parents ever start talking about the larger world out there, and the f – the events that are taking place in di – as things develop?</span> <span id="s386">I mean, when did that become part of, let’s say, home life discussion?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I don’t know any details about that, but I – I – you – like I mentioned before, they were pretty worldly, you know, read new-newspapers and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And I remember they used to listen to the – the radio from Luxembourg, and you know, our – from tiffin – you know, from abroad.</span> <span id="s390">So, you know, the – they were inquisitive enough to – to find out what’s going on in the world, you know, a-apart from what’s fed to you within Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s392">Well, what I’m trying to – what I’m trying to establish is the beginnings of their decision to get you out of the country.</span> <span id="s393">It must have – something must have happened to make them say, I want to get –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, the – there was the Kristallnacht –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: So tell us about that –</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: – how that – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: There was a lot of – very early in the mornings, a lot – or maybe it was still partially in nighttime, a lot of this tumult in – in the street.</span> <span id="s401">So we all got up, everybody got dressed except me, I stayed in my pajamas.</span> <span id="s402">We looked out the window.</span> <span id="s403">And this is what we heard a-afterwards, th-that somebody came to the bakery and asked if there are Jews in the house, and they said no.</span> <span id="s404">So they went away.</span> <span id="s405">And apparently one of the kids I tangled with at one time mentioned, on the second floor, Jews living.</span> <span id="s406">So they ca – so th-they came in the house, went onto the second – the second floor.</span> <span id="s407">On each floor there were two apar – uni – each landing, you know, there were two apartments.</span> <span id="s408">So the other party on out floor – we were the Müellers, and they were the Meyers(ph), not je – not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: So, these people went to the Meyers, assuming they were the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: The Jews, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: They made them in – in the – in the house, everybody in the ba – had in the basement a little compartment where you keep your coal and your wood, and you chop your wood.</span> <span id="s413">So they asked them to get the ga – an ax from the basement.</span> <span id="s414">So they came up, and just before they went into their apartment, they said, are you Jews?</span> <span id="s415">And they said no, we are not Jews, they are the Jews.</span> <span id="s416">S-So they came into our apartment, and they chased us out.</span> <span id="s417">So we went one floor up, in the – you know, the next floor up, so up the stairs.</span> <span id="s418">And they started smashing furniture, musical instruments, split open the feather beds.</span> <span id="s419">The mur – mur – we had a – a – sort of a big cupboard where my mother had made jams and you know, pickled stuff, they smashed that.</span> <span id="s420">So you can imagine the feathers, and the pickles, and a real mess.</span> <span id="s421">But fortunately, they didn’t arrest my father.</span> <span id="s422">Because a lot of men were arrested.</span> <span id="s423">As a matter of fact, even people my age were arrested.</span> <span id="s424">I don’t know, it may come up later in the story, a fre – friends of ours, the son was arrested wi – and the father.</span> <span id="s425">But the son was released right – right away.</span> <span id="s426">So after that we had to move into a house where only Jews lived.</span> <span id="s427">So we –</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: What kind of a shock – that must have been a huge shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Sure, it came – you know – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Do you remember how your parents reacted?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: They were pre – no, not really, but thinking back that nu – they were pretty ca-calm.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Maybe for the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s434">You know, I’m a – probably they realized what – you know, they – they realized the – I got – I said before, we were not involved in having windows smashed and that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s435">But this really – at that time it sinks in that – you know, that you’re threatened, you know.</span> <span id="s436">So we had to move into a house where only Jewish people lived.</span> <span id="s437">Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Before that happens – excuse me – were you able – able to salvage anything from your old apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Sal – I guess some – some of it, I – I – I – I – I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And then, did you ever – did the Meyers(ph) ever come to speak with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I – I don’t remember – I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s444">I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: And what about the bakery downstairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Well, they were kind of re-reprimanded, but they – I think they had a son who was a Nazi judge or something, you know, it’s a sort of a safety for them.</span> <span id="s447">No, I mean, we – we knew them for many years where – you know, for a num – a bunch of years.</span> <span id="s448">That was the only apartment we had in Nuremberg, you know, prior to moving to that house wa – in Sunstrasse(ph).</span> <span id="s449">And there we had [indecipherable] apartment with a – a very Orthodox, elderly couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s451">How – what was it like, that apartment?</span> <span id="s452">Explain first your – your first one, how large was it, how many rooms, and then the second one.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: There again, one, t – there was my parents’ bedroom, then there was another bedroom, and there was a, like a living room and it was a fairly large apartment, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: The first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: The first one.</span> <span id="s456">Th-The second one I don’t remember too much either.</span> <span id="s457">You know, we had combined kitchen and pa-parents’ bedroom, I think.</span> <span id="s458">My grand – or later my grandmother joined us.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Your mother’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s461">Well, wh-what happened, I don’t know, sh – da – whether th-they had to move, or they moved from Tann, and they – well, at that time there was only my grandmother and my – my uncle; he was not married.</span> <span id="s462">So my grandmother moved to another of her daughters in Würzburg, who later came to the United States, and then my grandmother came to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: It was kind of – kind of close living, you know, changing – you know, having the same apartment with a – with another party.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Especially as they were really, strictly Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Hang on just a second.</span> <span id="s468">Did your parents – excuse me – did your – did your parents behavior or demeanor change after Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s469">Because to me, it sounds from your telling, that that was the most significant event up until that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Right, right, right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Well, we – we all got passports – well, that was in ’38, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: We all got passports, and my parents must have regist(ph) me and my sister for the – you know, the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s475">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s476">We – the – the people we shared the apartment with, their name was Munk, m-u-n-k.</span> <span id="s477">And they had, like I said, very religious family, and they had a number of rabbis in the – as relatives.</span> <span id="s478">And one of them was in London, and I have some letters that – that came from Berlin and from – from – I think Berlin, and from London, that soon I wou – I would be going to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: So, can I assume then your parents started talking to them about their feeling of – of lack of safety, and wanting to get you out?</span> <span id="s480">Was that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Ri-Right.</span> <span id="s482">And you know, other acquaintances, or relatives had moved on, you know.</span> <span id="s483">Either they had to, you know, they were pushed or – or they were forced to evacuate – to em-emigrate, or voluntarily emig-emigrated.</span> <span id="s484">And, you know, they received reports from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Was there talk about the whole family leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: You know – yes.</span> <span id="s487">The – it’s a – it so happened that people started to learn English, people like – people tried to te – learn a tre – maybe some – some trade.</span> <span id="s488">My mother learned how – how to make pr-pr – in German it’s praline, and pra –</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Oh, praline.</span> <span id="s490">They’re sort of like candies, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah, but you know, the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: With the marzipan?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: – the pedit –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: – you know, the pe – chocolate –</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: A hard quality, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s498">And – and my father tried to learn different instruments, you know, the – the – in preparation for eventually moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What happened with – I’m so – oh, I’m sorry, I’m interrupting you.</span> <span id="s500">Did you want to say something?</span> <span id="s501">[interruption] So, what did I want to say?</span> <span id="s502">So they’re in preparation for moo – what happened with school now, after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Oh, I – well, I – I cont – I continued, and I think I finished high – high school in –</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So the clu – it wasn’t closed down?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I don’t know – no, it wasn’t closed down.</span> <span id="s506">It came up in wa – one of th-the letters I later received from my – my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: I finished high school, and my father and another fre – family friend, somehow found a place for me and –</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Excuse me for a second [crowd noise]</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: – my father and the other –</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s512">Tell me when.</span> <span id="s513">Okay, so we were at high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Right, we finished high school, and my father and a friend, they found someone to teach me and this friend [indecipherable] my friend, to learn how to weld, welder.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Really, weld?</span> <span id="s516">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yes, and I assumed that he pay – they’re paid, this man.</span> <span id="s518">He used to be an ex-communist, and he had a little shop on – on Canal.</span> <span id="s519">And so we, you know, we learned, and people came in, heil Hitler, and you had to mumble something, you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Were you – were – were you ready to go?</span> <span id="s521">That is, were you thinking it’s only a matter of months til I’m out of here?</span> <span id="s522">Or did you have no idea of what was going on behind the scenes, as far as the rabbis being contacted in London and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No, you know, the – it – it was planned to, you know, to – to get the – get me and my sister, you know, before – where – my fr – no, my parents already registered with the American consulate, you know, for a quota number.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: You know, there were the – there was a long line of people who wanted to go to the States, so we had a – we had a quota number, so the eventual goal was to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s526">Now comes the interesting part.</span> <span id="s527">This other fe – the – the – the oth – the – the family who son with me learned swa – welding, th-the father was – at the Kristallnacht, was arrested and was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s528">And he was supposed to – he was al – a – go-going to be freed, if he leaves the country.</span> <span id="s529">So one day they were leaving – you know, they made arrangements, they were leaving for England to wait out their quo-quota number, to be called at a later date.</span> <span id="s530">And my father s – I don’t know ho – I – I don’t know what go-got in his mind.</span> <span id="s531">He said to me, you want to go with them?</span> <span id="s532">And I said, if you come along.</span> <span id="s533">I think he re – tried to smuggle me – you know, we had those letters that – th-th-these letters were August ’39, and the war started September –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: September.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: – ‘39</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: So, this was in – this was in Se-September, when these fre – when these – the fre – the friends were moving to England.</span> <span id="s538">On that day he asked me if I want to come, he s – he – I said, if he would come.</span> <span id="s539">So we went, and there’s some things, like I said, I for – I forgot completely, but was aware of again, when I received – when I was re-recently reading my let – the letters.</span> <span id="s540">So what happened was, they were going on a – on the train to Würzburg, to m – get an express train that goes through Holland.</span> <span id="s541">And I had – didn’t have papers.</span> <span id="s542">I – I – I don’t know what was in his mind, I didn’t have papers to go to Holland.</span> <span id="s543">In Holland we had a – a cousin living.</span> <span id="s544">Maybe he tried to smu-smuggle me over.</span> <span id="s545">I don – I really don’t know what was in his mind.</span> <span id="s546">Okay, so we were supposed to take that train to Würzburg, took an express train.</span> <span id="s547">And according to the story in the letters, the – the train was delayed, which meant that we didn’t get the express train.</span> <span id="s548">So when we go to Würzburg, we got another train, it stopped in Cologne.</span> <span id="s549">Wa – as we were in the station, a group of Kindertransport was going to England.</span> <span id="s550">My father asked them if I could travel with them, so they said okay, if – if – if you have papers.</span> <span id="s551">And it so happened that in Cologne was an English consulate.</span> <span id="s552">We go – he and I, we went there.</span> <span id="s553">It was closed.</span> <span id="s554">They told me to wait a block away.</span> <span id="s555">Somehow he got inside.</span> <span id="s556">He got a stamp in my passport.</span> <span id="s557">It was the last day of the co – the consul to be there.</span> <span id="s558">It’s the last day.</span> <span id="s559">So he got in, got a stamp in my passport, with a notation, see letter.</span> <span id="s560">You know, the letter from Berlin and –</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: – and then I traveled with that group to England.</span> <span id="s563">It – you know, this was like miracles, one fo – you know, if one – if one would have – if – if the train, the first train would have been on time, I would have been at the border and not go any further.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: So, there was this –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, but it was almost like a goodbye on the quick.</span> <span id="s567">A goodbye that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Right, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: – sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: And – and th – and it was like a puzzle where one piece fitted into the other.</span> <span id="s571">If – if – if there wouldn’t have been a – a children transport in Cologne, I wouldn’t have been – come to England.</span> <span id="s572">If there wouldn’t have been a consul, an English consul, I wouldn’t have got into England.</span> <span id="s573">This – th-this like I –</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So one of my questions is, what about Suza(ph)?</span> <span id="s575">Why wasn’t she part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, she was younger.</span> <span id="s577">We – and she was a girl.</span> <span id="s578">Maybe my parents hesitated to send her on in a – you know, in a strange world, and – and I don’t know if they had any correspondence that she would be going to England or –</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: You know.</span> <span id="s581">Later on they tried all kinds of things, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: To get her out?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: So did you have time to say goodbye to Suza(ph), to your mother, before you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: I – probably.</span> <span id="s586">I don’t – I – I – this is – I – I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: There are certain things I – that I – I – I don’t memor – I – you know, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: But your father saw you off in Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Do you remember that goodbye?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah, well, was kind of sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: So when I got to England, the – the group went one way – well, we stayed overnight in – in – in a place, you know, everybody had a little cubical.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Tell me a little bit about the journey.</span> <span id="s596">So, you – you have your papers, you have the stamp, you have the – the notation, see letter –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah, so – so we traveled on to H-Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Was there any problem at the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No.</span> <span id="s600">[technical interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s602">So, when you’re leaving Cologne, do you cro – do you have any memories of crossing the border from Germany into Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s604">But I have a – I se – sort of ma – I kept a little bit of a diary, so I – I reme – I had it written down, and I slept on a – a – a – a – on a bo – on a boat, on – on – in the open on – o-on – o-on the – on a boat, you know, before the boat.</span> <span id="s605">Then left to Ha-Harwich, in England.</span> <span id="s606">So then, from there were traveled by train to London.</span> <span id="s607">And we li – on the – se – sta-stayed overnight there.</span> <span id="s608">And then the group went one way, and I was on my own.</span> <span id="s609">And this was the – the place where we stayed, it was in Whitechapel, which is a Jewish area in London.</span> <span id="s610">And I spoke to some of the pe – the people, and this directed me to that Rabbi Munk, a-and I stayed with him about three days, and after that, he arranged for me to be accepted – accepted in a place for refugee boys for – from Austria and Germany and you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: And you were 15, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yeah, I was 15 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: And that was in Croydon.</span> <span id="s615">It was in a girls’ school that had been evacuated to the countryside.</span> <span id="s616">And I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s617">And then they sent me to a school, I stayed there for t-two or three weeks, and then they send me to east London, to a rabbi whose family was e-evacuated, and he took in four or five boys, and we lived with him for a while.</span> <span id="s618">He find jobs for us.</span> <span id="s619">First, in some – some factory, knocking out pots and pans and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s620">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Did the welding have anything to help you –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, it – because of the welding, he found me some other j-job in a machine shop.</span> <span id="s623">And I had to do the welding, but I wasn’t any good.</span> <span id="s624">But they took me anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: I want to back up just a little bit, so I understand correctly.</span> <span id="s626">You were probably on one of the last Kindertransports.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I would say so.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Because the war had already started.</span> <span id="s629">If the British consul was –</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: No, he was c – he was closed, he was probably going to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: But it was still three days before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: So it was late August, late August ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Okay, okay, so the war was imminent.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Truly imminent.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: And when was the first time that you wrote to your parents and you got something from them?</span> <span id="s640">Where were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Cause if you’re moving around from one place to another, did you have an address to which they could send letters to?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s644">I think I must have sent – I – I think maybe as soon as I arrived, I probably sent them something.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: And then we – we co – we corresponded, and eventually I had about 30 letters from – from them.</span> <span id="s647">At first they sent their letters to an uncle.</span> <span id="s648">Actu – we called him uncle, but he was my mother’s uncle, in Belgium, and he then forward the letters to me.</span> <span id="s649">And after Belgium was occupied, my father sent them to Sweden, some acquaintance, or a – a friend, and they forwarded.</span> <span id="s650">And my mother’s sister and family were already in the uni – United States, so they’d send it – you know, United States wasn’t in – a-at war with germ –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: In the war yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: – at – at that time.</span> <span id="s653">And then the – they forwarded – so you know, so roundabout way.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: What did they describe in those letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Well, th-their – their life at the time.</span> <span id="s656">Like I said, they tried to prepare for the eventual emigration, you know, they tried the English, and e-even my mother tried to te – learn it, and she had some difficulties doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So even when the war starts, there is a possibility to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Peop – yes, people left.</span> <span id="s659">He describes how ma – he mentions many people that left at certain times, oh this family is leaving, now this.</span> <span id="s660">And they – well, they were – they – they used to go maybe to Spain or Portugal, and to get a ship, or maybe even in the beginning to Rotterdam to – to get a ship the States.</span> <span id="s661">You know, there was no war between the United States and Germany.</span> <span id="s662">Th-They carried on.</span> <span id="s663">My father helped out many friends who left without having – without being able to take furniture or anything with them.</span> <span id="s664">But they called them lifts at that time, but he did a lot of footwork for them, you know, go to the off – get all the proper papers to have these things sent off.</span> <span id="s665">At the same time one of the musician friends was afraid for the – so he was able to have – well, in the very early time, when Holland was not invaded yet, he had a suitcase sent to Holland and then forwarded to me, with some clothing and papers and photos.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So that’s how you have the family photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s669">I see.</span> <span id="s670">Did they think – oh, okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Well, he – he hinted on the restrictions like, they had to be in – indoors by eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s672">My mother had her line out for fish, and – and they fished for quite a bit.</span> <span id="s673">But they still – I wouldn’t say normal life, but they still – he describes my sister going a ride on a – on a bike to a – with friends, and you know, described things.</span> <span id="s674">They were – they’re learning stenography, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Did they have any – did they put all their hopes, do you think, on that quota number with the American embassy, or were they trying other ways to get out to other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: They – they – there is a mention, I think, in a letter, said they tried to go to South America somewhere.</span> <span id="s677">And my grandmother lived with us, and sh-she also only had a much, much later quota number, be – and my menti – my parents – my father mentioned many times in the – in the letters that he didn’t know what to do, because he – he didn’t want to just leave her on her own, if the family would move to States.</span> <span id="s678">He writes of trying to get my sister to go to – to Palestine.</span> <span id="s679">He tried many ways to, you know, to speed up getting out, without having to wait for the – you know, the quota number to be called.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Do you think – this is a hindsight kind of question, but do you think that the danger, the sense of danger, came to him too late?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: We-Well, when you talk about danger, I – I – I would assume – you – you know, these killing camps were no – weren’t existing at that time.</span> <span id="s682">So nobody had the faintest idea what the future would bring.</span> <span id="s683">I would say that in in their mind, they felt we had to get out; we were restricted, we were persecuted.</span> <span id="s684">But they figured, there is going to be a war, which eventually ends, and sooner or later we’ll be out of here, you know?</span> <span id="s685">That’s – that’s – that’s my feeling.</span> <span id="s686">I mean, they – they tried.</span> <span id="s687">They tried to get out.</span> <span id="s688">They had reports from friends in this – that emigrated to here, that was not too rosy, you know.</span> <span id="s689">I – I just translated one of letters, and the – the – the cantor of the synagogue, who was here, he writes he just lost his position.</span> <span id="s690">He’s now selling canned goods.</span> <span id="s691">You know, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: It’s hard for – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: It’s [indecipherable] you know, it – it didn’t pull him to – to ye – ye – and – and – and always grandma being left behind was on his mind, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Oh, and no – it sounds like a hellish position to be in.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Because there’s so many unknowables.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: How did – do you remember how you felt as you were receiving these letters, one after another?</span> <span id="s699">And what were you writing to them about this – should – were you urging them to leave, were you – were you in – did you menti – comment on that situation, or were you writing more about what was going on with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Well, mostly what was going on with me.</span> <span id="s701">They – they were in – you know, they were, of course, very interested in my life.</span> <span id="s702">I was happy to receive letters from them, and vice versa, they, you know, receiving the letters from me.</span> <span id="s703">And they wrote to me about their lives, and he was very active.</span> <span id="s704">And they still had cultural happenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Had he lost his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So they’re still with the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: But later on –</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: – later on – so, in this last letter I translated, the people, you know, in the ground fl – ground floor were just going – leaving, and he was – they were considering moving down into the ground floor, and they mentioned it’s – it’s cheaper and they had some reduction in the – in the income.</span> <span id="s711">And he was very active in these cultural performances he put together even before, you know, before the war, where we were restricted of attending cultural perform – you know, happenings.</span> <span id="s712">He formed orchestras and he had the musical events, concerts, and he was leading them.</span> <span id="s713">And he writes about the – the dep – having a – perform in the old age home, or in the schwester haus.</span> <span id="s714">I don’t know what that means.</span> <span id="s715">Schwester heim, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Schwester haus.</span> <span id="s717">Schwester heim.</span> <span id="s718">That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I – I – I-I da – I don’t – but he mentioned it many a times.</span> <span id="s720">And then at the – at these performances, he acted as MC, you know, and he had that quartet singing and my – my sister was playing the harmonica and all – you know, all these details he wrote to me, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Did you feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: – and – and then, a-at one ti – we were talking about the school –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: – in – in Fürth.</span> <span id="s725">He, in one of his letters, he mentioned that the – the – the school in Fürth was closed, and he – they got some pupils from there in their school.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s727">I see.</span> <span id="s728">So the school still was operating, even children –</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yeah, they had – they – their school was operating, and even they had the service, religious service in the turnhalle, you know, in the gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Did you get letters from your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yeah, my mother’s and grandmother’s and you know, they included a few lines, or a whole page; sister, grandmother and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: What did they write about?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Well, you know, about they’re happy that I’m fine and you know, my sister s – didn’t come home in time, or they were stopped on – on a bicycle tour because she and her friend was riding to – you know, together and th-they were fined and you

id="s734">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: But we were restricted in, your rights, you know, like in normal times I would still take the letter to the post office, but you know, you can’t take – can’t leave the house.</span> <span id="s736">He arranged some things – he invent – he could have invented something to – for the windows, for the lighters and shine, you know, at night, and probably they had the – they had pr – probably had air raids.</span> <span id="s737">I mean, he didn’t – he didn’t talk about that, because the letters were censored many a times.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: So did you get letters?</span> <span id="s739">I mean, did you get all the letters you think that he sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I would say so.</span> <span id="s741">But I have about 20 - 30 letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: And

Jungfernhof?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Well, the – well the very rough accommodations, and – well, actually, I didn’t – didn’t read much about it, it just – what I did read were, you know, th-the place, Jungfernhof, which I think was a – it used to be a farm, and it was outside Riga.</span> <span id="s936">And the – the books I – I read was actually about the events in Riga, and there was a ghetto in Riga that was – a-and th-they killed the people in that ghetto in order to make room for more to – people to – to get there to be killed, and – and this Jungfernhof was outside and –

officers and the happenings from day to day, they describe how they were killed, you know.</span> <span id="s946">The trenches were dug and they undress and – and they got shot and – and I very often, even nowadays, I – I think, what went on in – in my father’s mind at that moment?</span> <span id="s947">Did he feel it’s all his fault, or he did – he – he missed out on doing something to – or didn’t he – he didn’t push hard enough to get out earlier, or g-get different country, or send my si – the sis – my sister to Israel.</span> <span id="s948">Or did he, in the last moment, think of

ever get any kind of death certificate, any list from the Red Cross, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Well, I – I in-inquired at the – I inquired a-at Yad Vashem also, and I also – in Nuremberg they issued a memorial book, and I – I knew through some other friend that they were going to do it, and I sent them some pictures of my family, grandmother and – and father and mother and sister.</span> <span id="s964">And that gives details when they were deported, you know, November da – some date.</span> <span id="s965">And, well they declared them dead at the end of the war, you

id="s1000">And he collected all kinds of Jewish articles, books.</span> <span id="s1001">And they found books that belonged to my father.</span> <span id="s1002">And we went to Nuremberg to the library.</span> <span id="s1003">There was a whole section of hundreds of books that were supposed to be in that museum.</span> <span id="s1004">And there were maybe – maybe eight or so that belonged to my father.</span> <span id="s1005">And they traced me through Yad Vashem, and this – and not – not th – not directly to me, but I had – a cousin of mine made inquiries also, and they went – contacted her in California an-and they informed them that I’m – I exist in New York.</span> <span id="s1006">So we went there to look at the books, and there’s a Jewish librarian who is i-in – in charge of that, and we went there and we took a few of those books, I have them at home.</span> <span id="s1007">It’s mostly on the liturgy, you know, the – the synagogue services.</span> <span

we light candles o-o-on that particular day, yah – Yahrzeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: And it’s inscribed, let’s say, in a book, or in a – in a certain kind of a book?</span> <span id="s1020">Is it like in the Bible, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Well, that’s – in the olden times maybe people used to do that, but no, we – we – we don’t – we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: But the book – I’m talking about the books that you got from that library.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah, this wa – this was my grandmother’s, my father’s mother’s.</span> <span id="s1024">She had an inscription, you know, in memory of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: – her husband, or maybe her father, I da – I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1027">So we went there and we got – we – we – h-he sent us some books [indecipherable] they were big, heavy books.</span> <span id="s1028">And eventually we probably donated them to – that’s when we went to Nuremberg, but we went to look where we used to live in one – one place.</span> <span id="s1029">Well, that was like a parking lot.</span> <span id="s1030">Then we went to where we had to move to the house where only Jews lived.</span> <span id="s1031">A dentist lived th-there.</span> <span id="s1032">And sh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: So the apartment still existed, the building still existed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: No, no, no, th-these were – this building in Sunstrasse(ph), where we used to live in that one ve-very [indecipherable] apartment, that was a new building.</span> <span id="s1035">That – th – you know, it was the same number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: But a new building.</span> <span id="s1038">And around the corner was the Orthodox synagogue, and they just have a memorial.</span> <span id="s1039">You know, it’s not existing memorial in the street, it – that – the – th-the synagogue was there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Was there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: – years back.</span> <span id="s1042">But otherwise, the [indecipherable] different, you know, it’s a – they were bombed out, and you know, they – they have beautiful shops and traffic and you know, it’s – it seemed the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: So, I mean, did – was the city recognizable to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Well, it still – you know, it – it – it was an old city, there was a wall around the city, and a – and a moat.</span> <span id="s1045">You know, part of that still existed, there was a castle on the hill, and that existed.</span> <span id="s1046">But otherwise, we didn’t spend much time there.</span> <span id="s1047">Steven brought a friend along, who – who lived near him in – in – in Italy, an Englishman.</span> <span id="s1048">He was a photographer, he took a lot of pictures.</span> <span id="s1049">And he sort of reported our meeting this librarian.</span> <span id="s1050">I remember we took him out to lunch at –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Was this the only time you were back to Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: So, after the war, right immediately after, you didn’t go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: No.</span> <span id="s1055">No.</span> <span id="s1056">I wa – there were people that we invited to Nuremberg by the – the municipality.</span> <span id="s1057">Some people asked to be invited.</span> <span id="s1058">I – I didn’t – or somehow I didn’t feel I wanted to go, really.</span> <span id="s1059">After the war [indecipherable] but probably was the first vacation in Europe, went to Switzerland and we rented a car, my wife and I. My wife also came from Germany, but she came to the States earlier, with her parents.</span> <span id="s1060">And we went into Germany, we went to a place called Königheim, where my wife ca – was born, and her – the family lived there.</span> <span id="s1061">An aunt still corresponded with the non-Jewish family, we visited there.</span> <span id="s1062">And we went to Tann.</span> <span id="s1063">And in – in – in – in the – we went to Tann, and we went to Kerolla(ph), where my mother-in-law came from, and we went to the different cemeteries.</span> <span id="s1064">It so happened that we made arra – Steven was traveling too – my son, and – in France, and we made an arrangement to meet him on the certain day at the railroad station in Tauberbischofsheim, and when we drove up, he was sitting there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1065">But he had come there on a previous occasion, and he said, you know, that he came to the cemetery in Königheim, and his wer – it was locked, and he climbed over the fence, and he said the shema al(ph), you know, Hebrew prayer.</span> <span id="s1066">He – y-y – you know, he’s – he has a Master’s in history, b-besides his other degree, and he’s, you know, very much in – into history, al-also family history.</span> <span id="s1067">And very much involved in the letters.</span> <span id="s1068">And he already p-put that book together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Well, they’re very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: They’re very special in a personal way, and very special historically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: So they have – they have a lot of significance.</span> <span id="s1074">Your wife and yourself, what language did you speak with one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: English mostly.</span> <span id="s1076">And – and in – and wh-when we tra-traveled to Germany, I didn’t want to speak German.</span> <span id="s1077">You know, I – we – we still – we spoke English.</span> <span id="s1078">And l-later on, you know, I did quite a bit of traveling after my wife died, and you always came across Germans.</span> <span id="s1079">I didn’t want to – I didn’t want to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1080">And when I heard the German language, it – it – it – it sounded so stiff and I didn’t – I didn’t care for it.</span> <span id="s1081">I d – I – I – I hated hearing it.</span> <span id="s1082">But we didn’t spare – speak German, you know, just words, we spo – with her parents maybe, we spoke German.</span> <span id="s1083">But after a while I – I – you know, I wasn’t fluent in German any more.</span> <span id="s1084">I got a little more fluent by translating these letters, which, you know, with a – need a good dictionary, and go on the computer, get the translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Sometimes that’s – yeah [indecipherable] that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: But it’s – it’s important, you know, it’s important – a person’s relationship to the world they were born in, the country they were born in, through the experiences that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: That’s – that’s part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: – what I wanted to ask you about, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Well, I – I – I wasn’t drawn to go back.</span> <span id="s1093">We – you know, over the years you sort of mellowed, and you – you don’t give it much thought, you know, you don’t dwell on – o-o-on that, you ha – you have no problems.</span> <span id="s1094">But I hope to – to visit Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: These – yeah, these are painful places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: You know.</span> <span id="s1098">I think maybe we stop now for lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: And we’ll – [break] End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Okay, so this is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Norman Miller.</span> <span id="s1103">And I would like now to turn to another track.</span> <span id="s1104">We talked earlier about the trajectory, the very tragic trajectory of your family; your mother, your father, your grandmother, your sister.</span> <span id="s1105">And the last time you heard from them, and the unanswered Red Cross messages, or messages through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1106">Tell me, from that time, from let’s say mid-1941, what was your life like?</span> <span id="s1107">What was going on with you in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Well, the – th-the – the Bloomberg – not Bloomberg, Bloom – the – the – some kind of Bloomsbury(ph) House, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: – organization, they – they sort of supervised your life, so after I went to a Rabbi Munk(ph), who then sent me – well, he a-apparently contacted that organization.</span> <span id="s1111">They sent me to a place in Croydon where there were other refuge – about maybe 40 re-refugee boys.</span> <span id="s1112">And then, little while later, I was sent to a school in Swiss College part of London, a – a boarding school, but I only stayed there few – two – a few weeks, maybe a month, and then again there – was sent to a Rabbi ren – refren – Ferdleman(ph) in Forest Gate, that’s in the east end of London, and he found us jobs.</span> <span id="s1113">His wife, and family was evacuated during the war, and they were living in the countryside.</span> <span id="s1114">And there was a Polish girl who did the cooking and house – housework.</span> <span id="s1115">And he found jobs for us, and I worked in a factory, and then, having a fair knowledge, or a little knowledge of welding, I – I got a job in a machine shop, and I worked there for a while.</span> <span id="s1116">You know, you – you – you had the – you start at the bottom, cleaning up and getting sandwiches and I didn’t – my English wasn’t tha-that good, and I had to go by the sort of fo – phonetic – how it sounded, to order the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: So you never used to – you never had proper English language lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Well, I had in Germany, I had some in high school.</span> <span id="s1119">So after a while, the – you know, this was the east end, and there was a l – a lot of bombing, German air raids.</span> <span id="s1120">It was near the wharfs.</span> <span id="s1121">And so the company evacuated somewhere in the country, not too far, you know, one of the smaller towns outside.</span> <span id="s1122">So I commuted there for a while, and then I stopped, and I got another job back in – in east end.</span> <span id="s1123">I worked there s – it was a scientific instrument company, machine shop type of work.</span> <span id="s1124">And well, as I said, a lot of air raids.</span> <span id="s1125">We – we watched – i-in London they had – they had a lot of balloons up, you know, to make it more difficult to get – for the planes to get lower, difficult to have a straight run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: How would a balloo – I mean, this is just my lack of technical knowledge – how would a balloon hinder a plane?</span> <span id="s1127">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Well, maybe they interfered with the – with their flight plans or – or something like that.</span> <span id="s1129">And then we se – we saw dogfights also, you know, the – the British planes attacking the German planes, and you s – sometimes you saw them sh – sh – being shot down, or y – or you – at times you didn’t know where the – this was the English arm – a German plane was shot down.</span> <span id="s1130">So, there was a program where they had what they called Anderson shelters in the backyards of the building – of – of the houses; in the garden, they d – they dug a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s1131">Then it had corrugated iron, and then some more soil on top.</span> <span id="s1132">That’s where we used to sleep at during the nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: And I also was asked to sleep at our place of j – work, you know, under the benches a – a few times during the week, because they had these fire bo-bombs.</span> <span id="s1135">These were sa – you know, th-they started a lot of fires, small.</span> <span id="s1136">So we had sandbags and – in order to suffocate, you know, the flame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Did it actually happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Ye-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: I mean, there was an anticipation, but did it actually [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: No, no, sure, they had the fire, they had these – you know, th-they started th-the – the, you know, firebombs, and – by – by the hundreds as – they dropped these things.</span> <span id="s1141">So I – I worked, and I lived in the – with that rabbi, and then he died, and then I was sent to another hostel for – for boys, for refugee boys in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1142">I kept on working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Can I ask here; what authority – what British authority, or government authority was the one that kind of regulated your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: I don’t think it was a – a government, I think it was a Jewish private organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: I see, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: I think Bloomsbury(ph) Hall was in the name of the organization.</span> <span id="s1147">Also the – the – I-I guess they were in charge of bringing the Kindertransports to th-the – to the States and find them homes.</span> <span id="s1148">So, I lived in this place, Clapton(ph) – you know, I used to play the che – cello, and I want to something musical, so I bought a clarinet in a pawn shop, and – but I had to give it up very soon, because we slept in a dormitory, you know, a whole bunch, and as soon as – that’s the only place I could practice, and you know, as soon as you try to do that, someone wants to sleep, and – I also had a – a – a bad experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: You know, I – I didn’t earn much money, but I tried to save as much as I could, and I had a – a pa – a post office savings book, and one day I ha – I kept it in a little table next to the bed, and it disappeared.</span> <span id="s1151">So I went to the director of the – that – the place, and he went straight to one particular person, and he had it.</span> <span id="s1152">So, he must have had some previous record.</span> <span id="s1153">So after a while –</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Did that mean you lost your savings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: No, he – he – he had – he had – he had my book, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: He had your book, but he wasn’t able to withdraw anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: No, n-no, no, yeah.</span> <span id="s1158">Yeah, later on a few of us moved to a boarding house, you know, English boarding house, about four of us, and then decided, you know, decided to join the army, volunteer in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Can I interrupt?</span> <span id="s1160">At this point I want to ask, a lot of refugee kids, particularly who had been on Kindertransport, who came from Germany or Austria, sometimes were classified as enemy aliens –</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Oh yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: – by the British government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: So I wonder, what was – what – what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Well, when I wa – when I turned 16, I had to appear before a tribunal, and I was classified, friendly alien of enemy origin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: So, had it changed a little by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Ri-Ri-Right, you know.</span> <span id="s1168">I – I know others that were interned a-a-at that stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Later on I was thinking maybe living with a rabbi, and maybe there was some – maybe he had some influence, or they recognized that I’m not really a dangerous person.</span> <span id="s1171">So I, you know, was a friendly alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: And then you – that would have been – you would have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: That wou – when I was 16, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: So, pretty early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1181">So – so that experience is one that you avoided, of being interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Right, yes, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: – not interned.</span> <span id="s1185">And I ear – I – I – I made some English friends, one particularly, and he went in the air force.</span> <span id="s1186">So, I wanted to get – you know, I thought – you know, my friends to – do their duty, I have – you know, I – I ought to do something.</span> <span id="s1187">You know, I joined too, and I tried to get in the air force.</span> <span id="s1188">And I – you know, I appeared before a board and I re – I – I was refused.</span> <span id="s1189">It was be – I – I would say because of the German background.</span> <span id="s1190">You know, if you had been Polish or Czech, where they had Polish people in the air force, maybe it would have been made lighter, easier.</span> <span id="s1191">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Was that disi – was that very disappointing for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yeah, yeah, sort of, you know, right, right.</span> <span id="s1194">So then I volunteered for the army, and I would – and I figured maybe with my ma – ma – mechanical background, I get into engineers or something like that.</span> <span id="s1195">Well, they put me in the infantry.</span> <span id="s1196">First it was, you know, begin in London.</span> <span id="s1197">It was the Royal Fusiliers.</span> <span id="s1198">Then was basic training, and when that was over, they needed ra – it was already towards the end of the war, you know.</span> <span id="s1199">They needed reinforcement.</span> <span id="s1200">As a matter of fact, I s – I saw in one of my army books, a notation about Far East.</span> <span id="s1201">I think they were going to send me – vaguely I remember they were going – you know, they had everybody lined up to go to the Far East, and I said I speak German, and then they changed by it – you know, sort of destination.</span> <span id="s1202">And, you know, I had my medical basic training.</span> <span id="s1203">And then we were flown over to Belgium as reinforcement, and I joined the 53rd division, which was a Welsh division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: It was f – 40 – beginning of ’45, you know, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So the war was coming to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1208">So – and I – and it – in the infantry platoon of the ra – the – the Welsh fusiliers.</span> <span id="s1209">On – a-a-at that stage of the war, they had sort of cur – columns with tanks ahead, just moving until they hit resistance, or – you know.</span> <span id="s1210">So, at – well, in – in my platoon already, the lieutenant found out that I speak German, so he kept me close to him.</span> <span id="s1211">And one day, you know, the – a-and afterwards, the company, you know, that’s the next stage, found out I cou – you know, there was a German speaker, so I was transferred to the company headquarters.</span> <span id="s1212">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: As an interpreter, as a translator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Oh yes, interpreter, yes.</span> <span id="s1215">You know, I still had my rifle and, you know, all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1216">And while I was there, my platoon was riding on tanks that were, you know, just traveling into Germany, and they were ambushed, and – and you know, they were sitting on the tanks, and a whole bunch of them got killed, and some captured, and some wounded.</span> <span id="s1217">So I escaped that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: And soon after, when the battalion headquarters realized there’s a German speaker, they put me in the intelligence section of the battalion.</span> <span id="s1220">So, you know, we – we – we had – we had sa – we still had some fighting on the way into Germany.</span> <span id="s1221">I ha – I ke – I kept a little diary, and I put down every little town we passed through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Do you remember the first town you hit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Do you remember what part of the country you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Well, it was a – a – northern – northern Germany.</span> <span id="s1226">I know we had a – some kind of a – quite a battle in a place called Bocholt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Bocholt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1229">Well, we ended up, on the day the war ended –</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: May fifth – either fifth, sixth or seventh.</span> <span id="s1232">Fifth – well the – they were – we ended up in Hamburg, you know.</span> <span id="s1233">You know, the city was very – very much destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: I want to step back a bit.</span> <span id="s1235">What was your job in the intelligence work, when you were now on company level, I believe, and you were part of the – what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I li – [indecipherable] because there was not – th-there wasn’t much to – you know, at that time there wasn’t much to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1238">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: And in – verg – you know, maybe th – if there was a prisoner or something, you know, asked a – a – a few questions.</span> <span id="s1240">I-I – I don’t – I don’t – I don’t rem-remember.</span> <span id="s1241">I’m – well, I – yes, you know, wh-when we came upon German civilians, you know, and th-there had to be some conversation, you know – you know, you – you were always called –</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: – to i-interpret.</span> <span id="s1244">So in – in Hamburg, we stayed there for a while, and we couldn’t – it was the end of the war, and we controlled the – th-the traffic on the bridges, you know.</span> <span id="s1245">So I was there quite often, and one day a – a limousine came by and it was sto – you know, the – the – the – the people, the platoon, they stopped the – the car, and looked at the papers, and they went to a German policeman and asked, are the papers in order, you know.</span> <span id="s1246">And he said yes, but the – the – the British – I think it was a lance corporal, wasn’t quite sure.</span> <span id="s1247">He came over to me, showed me the paper.</span> <span id="s1248">And I real – realized, we have a big Nazi fish there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: It was Seyss-Inquart.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1288">And then we – then we went down to Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s1289">We were on the a -- Dusseldorf airport we occupy – you know, we lived there.</span> <span id="s1290">And I – I – there

id="s1306">Well, you know, go to – if they had that meetings, you know, report on that.</span> <span id="s1307">I remember once there was sa – [indecipherable there was someone who came up with a da – a Danzig manifesto.</span> <span id="s1308">I don’t know wha-what is really consisted of, but I handed it, you know, up, the letter.</span> <span id="s1309">And they were very interested in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: What was the behavior, and the – how did people – how did the local Germans in this village, in this small place, react to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Well, they – no problems really.</span> <span id="s1312">Friendly, you know.</span> <span id="s1313">And then – then, this was in ’45, and then the – it was the occupation – military occupation, military – so, at first I – I – you know, I had a house in Bad Pyrmont and I – and the servant to clean up, a cook, you know.</span> <span id="s1314">But – when – and had my own Jeep, or, you know, a transportation.</span> <span id="s1315">But then, when military occupation was declared, I had to have a driver, an English driver.</span> <span id="s1316">So I had a English civilian driver to br – you know, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Sounds like you were – you were the chief of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Sort of.</span> <span id="s1319">There were

id="s1326">A: Well, they – they – as a matter of fact, I – I – I was quite friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1327">They had a fairly easy life.</span> <span id="s1328">They – you know, they were taken care of, food and wise.</span> <span id="s1329">They – they enjoyed, they drank a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Was there any effort, was there any movement to send them back forcibly, to the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1332">I think later they – they moved on to Canada, Australia, different places.</span> <span id="s1333">So

that formerly belonged to a Nazi, who had been arrested, to straighten out my motorbike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Yeah – well, that – he – he – he had some employee there – there who did it.</span> <span id="s1341">So after that, unfor – I think it was in ’47, I had to go to some other, you know, a – a regular, bigger army unit, to be – to become a citizen, you know, to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Yes, now, a couple of thoughts here.</span> <span id="s1343">So it means that you were in Germany for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Almost two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: That’s quite a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1349">’45 - ’47.</span> <span id="s1350">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: A-A-And I was like a – a – either you couldn’t consider me a German, because I da – wasn’t English, or stateless or wha – I don’t know what to call myself then.</span> <span id="s1353">But then I became – you know, I’d applied to become a British citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: But you were no longer Norbert Müeller, you were already Norman Miller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Yeah, or – ri – yes.</span> <span id="s1356">From day one when I went in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1358">That’s where you changed na –</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: But it’s also interesting that in the British military, you could have been transferred into these intelligence units without being a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yeah, th – well, then, nobody knew that.</span> <span id="s1362">I mean, the people I – I – I associated with, other soldiers, or – they didn’t know I was not a citi – you know, th – nobody asked, so – nobody asked, so nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1364">It wouldn’t be something that would occur to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1367">S-So, in 1947 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: ’47, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: How did that process start?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Did you start it, or did they come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: – no, I sta – I started it, I requested it.</span> <span id="s1373">Probably a – probably quite earlier.</span> <span id="s1374">And you know, th – I – I went to that a – I think it was an engineering unit of the army, and some officer sort of took on the details and, you know, I had a oath, and I became a British subject, they called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Were there requirements?</span> <span id="s1376">I mean, did they require what people would require after the war, or was it that you had served in the military and that was enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: No, no, that’s separ – sep –</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Well, let’s say I put in an application, and during the war they just filed it, because they – I – I – I – I’m not sure if I’m right, but I think even Prince Philip wasn’t – became British til after the war.</span> <span id="s1380">I don’t know whether – where – where I got that, but that’s what I her – heard.</span> <span id="s1381">So the – so I went back to England, to the same boarding house.</span> <span id="s1382">Oh, when I joi – when I joined the army, my employer didn’t want to let me go.</span> <span id="s1383">And h-he put in an application that – you know, that I would stay with the – you know, wartime work and that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s1384">But I is – insisted I want to go in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Did he do that to – for self-interested reasons, or to try and save you from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: No, self-interest.</span> <span id="s1387">I – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Self-in – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: – you know, the job, yeah.</span> <span id="s1390">I – I – you know, I did – did good work, and he appreciated it.</span> <span id="s1391">And then when I came back, he took me in again.</span> <span id="s1392">And while I was in the army in Bad Pyrmont, I got to know another British soldier who came to visit Bad Pyrmont.</span> <span id="s1393">It seems his sister lived there, was married to a German.</span> <span id="s1394">Jewish – a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1395">And so when I returned to – to England, I – fo-for a few months I stayed there, and this friend – ne-newfound friend and his wife went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1396">So I decided I, you know, go follow them, and I went in Toronto.</span> <span id="s1397">And I was there for about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s1398">I was working in this tool-making field.</span> <span id="s1399">And I had my uncle and aunt in

the map, where is it.</span> <span id="s1521">You know, where this place?</span> <span id="s1522">And Michael went ga – he went – where did he – oh, he went to – my – Michael went – he always went to something little different from what everybody else would do.</span> <span id="s1523">He went to school – he went to college in – at the – to – in – at McGill in tur – in Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: That’s quite prestigious.</span> <span id="s1525">That’s a – quite a prestigious college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: And there already, he studied geography.</span> <span id="s1529">When he came out, when he came back to New York, when he was finished, he went in Columbia to get a Master’s in geography.</span> <span id="s1530">And on the side, he worked for – oh, while he was still in school, remote sensing, that’s – the pictures from – of satellites, o-of the earth, it tells you a lot, that they have the ultraviolet, or something like that, they – they can forecast about floods, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1531">And so after he f – got the Master’s, he went to – it was difficult to find jobs, because they wanted experience before you get a job, you know.</span> <span id="s1532">So he g – finally worked for the Army Corps of Engineers in New Hampshire, with this lance – Lancet(ph) remote sensing of the snow cover, you know, forecasting floods or – or th – the springtime tar –</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: So in some ways he’s in meteor – meteorology as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Right, right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: And then he came back to New York, and there was a job opening in the city government, and he had to know computers, and he didn’t know computers.</span> <span id="s1537">So he bought a book, and he learned in a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: And it was sufficient for them to be – to be accepted.</span> <span id="s1540">So he worked for – ever since, he worked for the city planning in N-New York City, in the – you know, in – in th-that field, ever since, and – oh, and before that, in his spare time, before he was married, he went to one – as a human – human – human at – humanitarian organizations, who issued a lot of books about what’s going on in different parts of the world, and he’s – he told them, you know, you have all these place names, but ne – but people don’t – they don’t know where they – where they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: So he started making maps for them, beautiful maps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: And you know, in – in a – in a – in the books, beautiful maps – maps for them.</span> <span id="s1545">And he enjoyed that, he do – did a tremendous amount of research.</span> <span id="s1546">He ca – let’s say he had, like in Iraq –</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: – the – there were the – the government fo-fought the Kurds, they had fights, and he did research, he went to the consulates or embassies, cause he came to here to get maps and he made his own maps, and he really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1549">But he has no time for that now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Do you remember the name of the organization that he worked for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: No, th – the big, well ca – well-known organizations.</span> <span id="s1552">Something watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Human rights watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Well, some – some of those, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Human rights watch is – is – is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: – one of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: – largest human rights organizations, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: So he has on Iraq, he has on Sudan.</span> <span id="s1561">I have – I have the – some of the books at home.</span> <span id="s1562">Very, very creative, you know, the way – the way he’s shown mountains, he way – th-the – where the Kurds were bombed, on what dates, and – there – there were – both of them, they’re very – what the word?</span> <span id="s1563">They put their whole personality, life, into what – you know, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Into what they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: – conscientious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: I enjoyed that, and he was precise.</span> <span id="s1568">But now he is married, and he has to co – he wi – still works in the city and he lives upstate, so he has to commute every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1570">It takes time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: The – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: It da – takes time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: [indecipherable] time, and his wife is also working, she – she’s an environmental engineer.</span> <span id="s1574">I don’t know what she do – does, really.</span> <span id="s1575">Something to do with water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: What do you see as the – is there a thread between the family that you were born into, and the family that you created, that you see it got passed down?</span> <span id="s1577">You mentioned a little bit about – about geography, and how your father taught it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Right, right, an-and then the – you know, like we – we did – we liked the outdoors, we liked hiking, and they do too, this – my sons, especially Michael.</span> <span id="s1579">And like I said, he’s always – h-he doesn’t – he – he does everything a little different than other people.</span> <span id="s1580">His traveling, he – he went to places where nobody went, you know.</span> <span id="s1581">When – when he went, to Italy, he went to a place fr – I think it’s called Friuli, which is on the border to Yugoslavia; I never had heard of it.</span> <span id="s1582">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: What would you have wanted to tell him about your gra – about your father?</span> <span id="s1584">You know, what would you want him to know about your father, again in a – as a person?</span> <span id="s1585">And the question’s also gonna be reversed to, what would you have wanted your father to know about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Well, he – well, h-he would be very, very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1587">But n-now that you say that, I also have to bring up my wife, who, you know, as – I would say my sons were closer to the – my wife than to me.</span> <span id="s1588">My wife was very – an avid reader, and both of my sons are.</span> <span id="s1589">Michael can’t do it now, he has – doesn’t have the time, but Steven, he – he reads all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1590">He is – I think they call him intellectual, in Italy, you know, amongst the expatriates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: Sure, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: And it – you know, m-my – well, both of my parents would have been very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1593">You know, it – so, you know, the grandchild, a-and we, especially me, you know, when we leave Mi-Michael’s house, we often t-talk, you know, how – what a shame that my wife couldn’t enjoy th-the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1594">And she would be a great grandmother.</span> <span id="s1595">A very warm person.</span> <span id="s1596">And like I said, she was a – more outgoing than me.</span> <span id="s1597">Steven is really outgoing.</span> <span id="s1598">Michael is l – little less so, more like me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Do you see family traits in your children that you also saw in your parents, and other members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: I never – never thought of that.</span> <span id="s1601">I never – well, they – you know, my father being a teacher, he was very much – the wer – e-education was very important to him.</span> <span id="s1602">Knowledge, you know.</span> <span id="s1603">My mother less so, also education-wise.</span> <span id="s1604">And you know, I have pictures here where the – wh-where the whole family went bicycling.</span> <span id="s1605">I have pictures of – of us in front of the Lorelei on the Rhine with four bi – four bicycles.</span> <span id="s1606">Now, if you ask me how we get there, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1607">I have pictures of the four of us – actually five of us, as a – a cousin was with us in some – in touring in where my father’s brother lived.</span> <span id="s1608">I don’t remember how we got there.</span> <span id="s1609">You kn – I-I – I – I don’t – you know, lots of things escaped my mind.</span> <span id="s1610">So, my father, we liked the outdoors, we liked to doing things.</span> <span id="s1611">My fa – we – we were all Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1612">But not – well, maybe in this – in this country it would be similar to a ya – young Israel, which is all Orthodox, but not extreme.</span> <span id="s1613">And we – I – like I belong to a congregation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: I was going to ask you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Since maybe 1960, when – in the – in the 60s, when my kids were Bar Mitzvahed, and I’ve been a member ever since, and paying my dues, and supporting the synagogue, but I’m not religious.</span> <span id="s1616">I – I don’t go to a service very often.</span> <span id="s1617">When I do go, I always get called to the Torah to – you know, when they read the Torah?</span> <span id="s1618">Because I’m a Levi.</span> <span id="s1619">You know, they’re the – they are the three stages; there are Kohens, Levis and Israelites.</span> <span id="s1620">So, you know, the – so I’m a Levi, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s1622">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: That’s a – you know, one [indecipherable] above – at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Is there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: They had – they had duties – duties, and – at the temple, way back, yo-you know.</span> <span id="s1626">So I’m – I – I – I-I don’t go to the service very often.</span> <span id="s1627">I mean, I go on the high holidays, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: – also during the year, once every six weeks, or s – you know.</span> <span id="s1630">I’m not learned, overly.</span> <span id="s1631">I-I know quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1632">I wouldn’t be surprised that my sons who are more studious, know more in certain respects than I do.</span> <span id="s1633">I would say that, if my parents would have come here and had to – th-th – maybe they would be less religious if they had to be, than they used to.</span> <span id="s1634">But years ago, they followed all the – the rules.</span> <span id="s1635">And my father was pretty learned, and he sometimes quotes in the letters –</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Some passages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Wa – well, he – he compared my trip to England, you know, with all these incidents with the, you know, train and Kindertransport, consulate and all that to some Biblical occasion where one of the – abra – not Abraham, Jacob or somebody looked for a wife or a son, and there were so many incidents involved that just like wi – in my case, there were so many, and the final result was positive, they found a bride, or – never heard of it before.</span> <span id="s1638">I – I mean, I never, but he wa – he was, you know, learned in – in many respect.</span> <span id="s1639">He was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: It also sounds like it was his rock, that – that – that in difficult times, you look to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: He was a strong person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: You know, he would – he – he – I wouldn’t say fearless, but he – or – or – or – or aggressive, but he – he followed his plan, he – he pushed for it, you know, he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: He had so much on his shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Yeah, right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: He had so much on his shoulders at a very thankless time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: And he did a lot for other people that had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: And he do – he was known, because you know, he was – he was very active in cultural – Jewish cultural happenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: We’ve talked rather intensively about him.</span> <span id="s1651">Do you – do you think your children have a sense of who he was, of who your mother was, of who your sister wa-was, as people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: I don – I don – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1653">I – I don’t – well, in the letters – I’m more involved with Steven, who is – takes great interest –</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: – and being hi – ha-having a historical back – history background –</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Michael doesn’t talk so much about it, you know.</span> <span id="s1658">But he’s aware of it.</span> <span id="s1659">He showed interest to coming here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: And this wa-wa – ap – yeah, these letters, and the – apart from the letter – letters, I was going to write my history, and – for my grandchildren, you know.</span> <span id="s1662">They oughta know, they should know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: It’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: What i – what is it that you would want your grandchildren to know about you?</span> <span id="s1666">I know it’s a – it’s a sort of like well, how do you answer that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: But – but, if there’s a way of – if there’s a way of phrasing it, what would you want them to understand that you think is important for them to understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Well, they should know that – what I went through, you know, to get here.</span> <span id="s1670">And, you know, I – I – I f – I mean, people usually don’t talk about themselves that way, but I feel I’m de – a dependable perso – person, and they could depend on me.</span> <span id="s1671">I – I – I do a lot on – I-I’ve done quite a bit for others just lately – I don’t know if I mentioned this before.</span> <span id="s1672">One of my neighbors died.</span> <span id="s1673">He was 101 years old.</span> <span id="s1674">He had no family, he never had children, they never had children.</span> <span id="s1675">I wa – in – I live in my house about 50 year – over 50 years, he came later.</span> <span id="s1676">And we weren’t really friends and – for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1677">He was a fisherman.</span> <span id="s1678">I never got fish from him.</span> <span id="s1679">But later we got – you know, I did gardening in my garden.</span> <span id="s1680">He gave me – let’s say, he gave me a gooseberry bush, I gave him a raspberry bush, and you know, we got friendlier.</span> <span id="s1681">And after a while, he – I visited – you know, I – they get older – I used to visit him every si – e-every week, let’s say Saturday or weekends, or Friday, if I couldn’t make on the weekends.</span> <span id="s1682">I stayed there for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s1683">He lo-loved astrology and he used to try to teach me, and – but it went in one ear and out the other.</span> <span id="s1684">And he ser – he came from Poland – Poland.</span> <span id="s1685">He reached his old age by eating salamis and cheeses and vodka – drinking vodka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: All the healthy food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1688">So I – he always offered me a vodka, and – but he ha – he also ha – made a vodka fermented with the cherries in it, o-or strawberries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: That’s still – tha – one I drank, but it still had a kick.</span> <span id="s1691">And so over the years – then his wife died, and – and he had no plans whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1692">I – I took him to a funeral home, I got him a plot in the – in the cemetery, I got him a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1693">And I realized he had no plans even before that, and I worked – I – I attended a woodworking shop in a senior center, and that organization was – it – it – it was sort of sponsored ot – it was an organization – it was a center of an organization called Self Help.</span> <span id="s1694">And so I went to a social worker and talked about him, and then ta – got me in touch with her office, and I got him – a social worker for him, and meals on wheels.</span> <span id="s1695">And I took him to a doctor once in a while, but there was another neighbor, a woman that took him even more to the doctor, got the medication for him.</span> <span id="s1696">I took him – I – I helped him collect his –</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Social Security?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: – ma – ser – the – his number – no, his numbers for filing the income tax, I took him – we went to the library, where it was free, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: But you – first come first serve.</span> <span id="s1701">Then he got older, I go – I took him to some other place where he didn’t have t – where he had to pay for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1702">I took him – this was the worst – I took him to – to voting, yet he cancelled my vote, because he voted the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: There’s payment for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: There’s gratitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: So I – you know, he had – so he had no relatives i-in New York, he had a niece, and – who had two sons.</span> <span id="s1707">But he wasn’t close, only lately, when he got older, came around.</span> <span id="s1708">So he – th-th-they – the other woman had power of attorney while he was still alive, and he put her and me in his will as executors.</span> <span id="s1709">So for – he died a-about a year ago.</span> <span id="s1710">And there was problems, there was supposed to be a bro – a brother, so we had to se-se-search for a brother in Poland, which we couldn’t find.</span> <span id="s1711">Everything got dragged out.</span> <span id="s1712">Then the – the relatives, they contesting the will, it’s still not settled.</span> <span id="s1713">We – just to – 10 days ago, we saw – that was my job, you know.</span> <span id="s1714">Well, the other executor got sick, so it was all on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1715">And just recently, I – I – and the house was in a mess, and I cleared it up, making more presentable to be sold.</span> <span id="s1716">So I feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: That’s pretty big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: – I ma – I – a dependable person, and p-previous to – there was another – I had a heart attack, and I got a – I met somebody else in a – in a – in a hospital, an-and he – I looked after him for a while, it was a sickly old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: You know, I see a thread there.</span> <span id="s1720">You have your father, who was worried about your grandmother –</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: – and couldn’t leave an old woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Couldn’t leave her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: And – and there’s something in the fa – and then I saw the – the photograph of your hundred year old great-grandmother, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Who was still part of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: So, in some ways this sounds also like something that the family valued, you take care of people when they can’t take care of themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: And that’s – that’s a legacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: I don’t want to put words in your mouth –</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: – but from what you’re saying, that – that strikes me as a thread.</span> <span id="s1737">So you pu –</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: I – I da – I – I ga – you know – I mean, a-actually, this is mutual.</span> <span id="s1739">Somebody needs a ride to a doctor or something, if I’m available, I – I do it, but they do it for me also, you know?</span> <span id="s1740">But they do – hardly anybody around nowadays.</span> <span id="s1741">They died, or they moved away.</span> <span id="s1742">Just recently, somebody who was in my class in – in Nuremberg, a woman that lived a f – maybe half a dozen blocks away from me, we were quite friendly, she died suddenly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: Another friend, just now, April the fifth, moved to Pennsylvania to one of these senior places.</span> <span id="s1745">But I always say [indecipherable] you know, that if – for the last 10 years or so.</span> <span id="s1746">But now I realizes, there comes a time where I have to make a decision, you know?</span> <span id="s1747">I live on my own, I manage very well.</span> <span id="s1748">My memory is not good.</span> <span id="s1749">Even in speaking English, I – what they call senior moments, I got plenty of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: I got a few too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Heh-heh.</span> <span id="s1752">So Michael and Steven and I, we went to a couple of these retirement co-communities, near where he lives, you know, up in Westchester.</span> <span id="s1753">Beautiful places.</span> <span id="s1754">There’s one f-fairly new, overlooking the Hudson to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1755">Beautiful inside, they have covered everything, workshop, the pools, very nice.</span> <span

joining them.</span> <span id="s1774">You know, company, socializing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: And in the meantime now, I go both mor – bo-bo – both

today, that you’d want your kids to know, that you’d want your – or to understand.</span> <span id="s1784">Sometimes the facts they know, but to understand the significance of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Well, you know, to appre – to appreciate the – where they come from, you know, where they – the grandparents and the great-grandparents and their lives, their lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1786">How that developed, how – how it changed.</span> <span id="s1787">And, you know, when they see the pictures, they see us all, the whole family on the bicycles.</span> <span

Taylor was guarding one of the approaches to the bridge on Monday, May seventh, and at about four p.m. in – in the afternoon, a large, brown Opel saloon swerved out of the middle of our convoys and knocked over a couple of tins which were being used as a barrier.</span> <span id="s1946">Taylor jumped on the running board of the car, and forced the driver, who was wearing Luftwaffe uniform, to pull up.</span> <span id="s1947">There were four men in the car, and one who spoke English said he had papers for Field Marshall Montgomery to sign.</span> <span id="s1948">Taylor then asked a German policeman if the papers were in order and the German replied, yes.</span> <span id="s1949">Still not satisfied, Taylor took the occupants of the car to Fusilier Miller, the interpreter and Miller immediately had them taken before the c.o. Taylor returned to his post on the bridge and a few minutes later one of the men he had arrested was marched onto the bridge again, and his photograph was taken with the c.o. and adjutant.</span> <span id="s1950">This man was the notorious Seyss-Inquart.</span> <span id="s1951">So thanks to the vigilance of one of our battalion’s men, another war criminal was in the bag.</span> <span id="s1952">Terrific.</span> <span id="s1953">Let’s put that in there.</span> <span id="s1954">[off camera] So, is there anything else you’d like us to – to capture on film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: [indecipherable] in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: But take a look through this one, because the original letters are not in the very first –</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: I – I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1958">No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: I don’t see anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1962">[aside] So, in that case, I’d like to thank you, Mr. Miller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: I thank you for, you know, leading this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Well, thank you for sharing, thank you for telling us your story, and – and sharing it with us.</span> <span id="s1965">We much appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: You’re welc – very welcome, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Norman Miller on April 15th, 2013.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1970">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">End of File</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">PAGE 7 Interview with Norman Miller</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">April 15, 2013</span></p></body></html>
