A: No grandparents. I have a grandmother yes, a very nice grandmother.

A: Yes, mother’s side. She lived with us for a while too.
Q: Did your parents ever tell you about their own childhoods, and how they were growing up, and what –
A: No, no.
Q: No?
A: It was a very difficult life for them, so they – they didn’t want us t – us even to know or talk about it.
Q: Really? How did you know that it was difficult, then?
A: Because I – they – they didn’t want to talk about it. So I figured out, must be difficult.
Q: Okay. Okay. Did you remember as you were growing up what kind of – what kind of conversations would take place around the family table?
A: My father was reading the papers from – from beginning til end, and we will always have discussion, politics.
Q: Really?
A: A politics discussion and – and si-since Hitler came to power, so we always talk about the – about what’s going on in German – in Germany, what’s going on in Europe, yeah.
Q: Well, that’s –
A: We talk about that, and we talk about our school.
Q: Okay.
A: About the school, what we’re going through.
Q: Well, you anticipated one of my questions, because I often ask people, did events in Germany, which is in another country, were they of interest to you? And I’m interested to learn that way over on the eastern side of Poland, in Lvov –
A: But – but we were our neighbors.
Q: Yeah.
A: They were our neighbors, so we know about the war, the first World War, with the – was going on. It was on the same place, on the same grounds, and my parents remember that.
Q: Did they tell you about the first World War?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: No.
Q: Okay. But they would remember about –
A: Yeah, well, they remember, yes. And so we knew, special when he came in the 30s, Hitler to the power, so it’s something to talk about.
Q: Do you remember what you would be saying, what your parents would say?
A: First – the first thing was the – the Jewish problem. That was the first problem in – in Germany.
Q: Mm-hm, what to do.
A: And then the refugees are start – started to come in.
Q: Were there any refugees that came to Lvov?
A: Oh, a lot of German is – yes, a lot of – we helped them a lot, too.
Q: Really?
A: Yes, we did.
Q: Okay. Because I remembered speaking with some German Jews who would say, we lived in Germany, but we had Polish passports, so we were forced to leave, and go to po –
A: They were forced to leave, yes.
Q: Yes, and go to Poland.
A: Yes.
Q: In what way did your parents help them?
A: They – they lived with us for a few – few months or few days. They were relatives, but far – far rel – rel – related to us. So I – I never knew that I have them.
Q: Okay.
A: But didn’t last too long because they went to Siberia.
Q: They were deported to Siberia?
A: Yeah.
Q: And do you know why?
A: A lot of them –
Q: Okay.
A: – because they were refugees.
Q: Because they were refugee –
A: Because they were refugees, yes. They didn’t have any p – si – papers, what do you need the papers for, the Russians. And they couldn’t survive.
Q: Okay. So they had come to Poland because they, at some point, had had a Polish connection, had Polish citizenship –
A: N-Not only because of – because that – the closest country that they could run away, because they were deported. They said, go whatever you – you want to go, at that time.
Q: Right.
A: At that time. That was in 1939. We were occupied by the Russian in ’39.
Q: I understand. I – and we’ll come to that. What I am talking about now is before, when Hitler comes to power in 1933, that’s about six years earlier. And your parents – your father reads the paper, and at the dinner table you discuss both politics, and what’s going on in school, and things.
A: Yeah.
Q: When did you – was it – did refugees start coming soon after Hitler came to power? Or did it – was it later on?
A: A little later on.
Q: A little later on?
A: Yeah, late – yeah, before – before the war started.
Q: Okay.
A: Before the war they – in ’39, they came maybe two, three years before.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. Now what about the Polish – Polish politics. Was that of interest at home? Was somebody like Pilsudski someone that your parents would talk about?
A: Yes, we were very interested, yeah, we were very interested what’s going on –
Q: Okay.
A: – what’s going on in Germany, yes.
Q: All right. What about in Poland, in Poland itself? Did your father read and talk about the leadership in Poland? About Pilsudski, about when he died, wh-who came into power?
A: Yes, yes, yes. But it was quiet, in Poland, was very quiet. We didn’t have any demonstration at that time. It was quiet, yeah. Everybody was busy with their own business.
Q: Did you – did you ever experience anybody saying or doing anything to – that was disparaging because you were Jewish? A: Before the war?
Q: Before the war.
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: No, no, it’s – not any demonstration against je – Jews in Poland, no.
Q: Okay. Did you feel at home in Lvov?
A: Yes, til – til it’s started in Germany, so we s – we s – we felt a little, too. We felt a little –
Q: In what way?
A: – not – not very – very comfortable to be Jew in Poland.
Q: Okay.
A: I felt it in school.
Q: You did?
A: Yes, I did felt in school.
Q: How did that express itself?
A: It didn’t bother me at all, it didn’t bother me at all, this – but I didn’t like that, most of what was there.
Q: But this was still a Polish school?
A: Yes, yes.
Q: And it was a private school, if it was gymnasia.
A: Private – private school, yes.
Q: And how did it expre – how did – what happened, that you felt it from –
A: Di – di – nothing happened, nothing happened. But I didn’t like it when we have a subject religion.
Q: Okay.
A: That was our subject too. So we have to divide the room. The Jewish girls – they’re only girls.
Q: Okay.
A: Jewish girls in one room with – with the rabbi, and they teach us our religion, and move to another room with the priest with the other girls.
Q: The Catholic girls.
A: Catholic girls have a religion, and that’s what I don’t li – didn’t like it.
Q: Why not?
A: I didn’t like it because I felt the – the division was dividing. They’re dividing already Jews and non-Jews.
Q: Okay. It became a point of sensitivity.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. Did you have girlfriends who were not Jewish?
A: We were friendly, but they were not close friends, we were not close friends, no.
Q: Okay. Okay.
A: That was a – the separation already then.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah.
Q: Did your parents have – have a social circle that included –
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Just a family and some friends, yeah, some friends, who never survived, yeah.
Q: But were – yeah, but they’re all Jewish?
A: Yes, yeah.
Q: Okay. You said that you weren’t very religious, but you did – you did go on holidays.
A: Yes.
Q: To –
A: The high holidays, yes.
Q: The high holidays.
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. Did you belong to any youth groups?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: We didn’t have any that time.
Q: Okay.
A: No.
Q: Tell me about the kolonia that you went, because you say that was associated with your school.
A: Yes.
Q: So what kind of – what kind of experience was that?
A: Oh, it was very pleasant, very pleasant, yeah. We went hiking, we went swimming. Th-The air wasn’t as air in the city, was very, very different. And the s-see – the scenes was just beautiful, this is a very nice part of Poland, beautiful part of Poland, yes. The Carpathi(ph).
Q: Yeah. So it sounds like it was like a summer camp.

A: Yeah. Yes.
Q: Two more years. Tell me a little bit about your parents’ personalities.
A: About what?
Q: Your – the personalities of your parents. What kind of a person was your mother, what kind was your father?
A: Yeah, it was difficult, because I was still a child, you know, when a 14, 15 in Europe, you’re a child, not like here.
Q: Yes, I know, I know.
A: Yeah.
Q: I know.
A: Yeah. So –
Q: Well, were they outgoing?
A: You don’t think about that – their personality.
Q: I know, I know. And I know it’s a bit of a strange question. But what I’m trying to get a sense of is what kind of people were they? Li – what kind of interests did they have?
A: Yeah.
Q: Your mother for example, did she have any hobbies that she particularly liked?
A: No, no.
Q: No.
A: No, no. Her hobby was just home. Just home. And my father was the business – business he –
Q: Were they extroverted, or introverted people? That is, were they people who were open and gregarious, and –
A: No.
Q: No?
A: No.
Q: They were more quiet?
A: They were quiet, yeah, that’s right.
Q: And what are some of your earliest memories from your childhood? Some incidents? You know, we all have something from when we were little that we remember. It may not be significant, but we remember it.
A: Yeah, I remember very well when my aunt lost her husband.
Q: The one in Kraków?
A: And I – and I liked them a lot, and I – my uncle. And I liked them a lot, and I – they – they kept quiet, they didn’t – didn’t tell me that he passed away.
Q: Okay.
A: But through other person I found out, and I felt very, very badly about it, as I didn’t go to the funeral. That – that time the children didn’t go to funeral.
Q: Okay.
A: They kept themselves quiet, not to tell bad news. Don’t say bad news to a child.
Q: Yeah, yeah. So that was a shock.
A: So I don’t – I still remember that, yeah.
Q: That was a shock, yeah. Now, was there – was there talk outside of your family as well, about the growing unease in Europe? For example, when Germany took over Czechoslovakia, was that something that people remarked upon in Lvov?
A: That was – well, wit – first they took Poland, and then Czechoslovakia.
Q: No.
A: In – in ’41.
Q: No, no, no. It wa – first Czechoslovakia was taken, I believe in ’39.
A: Oh yes, I remember, that par – part of czecho –
Q: Yes, that’s right.
A: Yes, now I remember, yes.
Q: Yeah. Was that something that –
A: Yes, the f – of course, yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: They di – what – that’s why they were talking on a – that they gonna spread this – Hitler always say, we need l-lebensraum –
Q: Yeah.
A: – lebensraum, the – it mean that they are – they are too small, they have to spread around. We are gonna take the whole Europe.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah, that’s what he was talking about. His speech was terrible, his speech was –
Q: You had heard it?
A: Ye – no, I didn’t, we – we didn’t have radio, no.
Q: Oh, of course not, of course not.
A: No, but from the pa – newspaper.
Q: Okay.

A: Yes.
Q: Okay. Do you remember that last summer before the war?
A: Yes, wi – I still will – when the Russian came over, I went to school. We were going still to school, the two years –

A: All the poets you have to know by heart, yeah.
Q: And the classes were taught in Russian, then?
A: Russian and Ukraine. We had another language, Ukraine, which was – I was very surprised, what we need Ukraine? But with so many Ukraines on that side of – of Lvov specially, and then surrounding Lvov, that we learn. It’s a very similar language.
Q: Did you learn it?
A: It was difficult. It was – not Russian, but Ukraine was more difficult than – than the Russian.
Q: Well, there was tension between Poles and Ukrainians.
A: Always. Yeah, they hate each other, yeah.

Q: Okay.
A: All the Russian came over, the Russian people came over. They were buying everything what you – you can see in the stores. The stores were empty shelves, they were buying so – everything what you can see.
Q: Was – that must have been surprising.
A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: Did you meet or talk to any of them?
A: Oh sure, yes, I – I knew s – I knew some. Yeah, I knew a lot. But they were, like I said before, they were not too long there, because they deported them, almost all of them departed there to Siberia.
Q: Okay. So these –
A: In a cattle – cattle wagons.
Q: All right. So pretty soon then y – explain this to me, because some people will not know what this is, what – why would they have been deported? What were these deportations? What was happening when the Soviets came?
A: I really don’t know why they did it, because they were homeless people?

Q: Okay.
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.

Q: Okay. So this happens, you know the Soviets are there for almost two years.
A: Two year – two years, yes.
Q: Yeah. Then what happened?
A: Then – then the German came over with the terrific bombs over our head. We had go running again to cellar.
Q: Second time.
A: For a few days we didn’t see – we couldn’t get out –
Q: Okay.
A: – because it was very, very, very strong bombardment, and we saw the Russian running. They running. They didn’t – Poland didn’t – didn’t defend themselves, and the Russian was run – just not – not – they were not prepared either.
Q: Okay.
A: They were not prepared because the German with Russian, they were friends at that time.
Q: Strange, huh?
A: Yeah, they were friends. And then, that’s what happened, overnight, too.
Q: Okay. So what happened for you –
A: That was, I think, in June.
Q: June 1941.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. June 21st, if – if I’m not mistaken.
A: Oh, then we knew what’s gonna happen. Then we knew.
Q: You did?
A: We knew what’s gonna happened, yeah. And we’ll have lines and lines t – f-for the bread, we didn’t have. We have – but my mother had a very good – good – not the Jewish look, so she stays in line, because whoever looked Jewish, they throw them out from the line.
Q: So this is one of my questions: when the Germans arrived, how did your life change? What happened?
A: Very, very much so. First, we didn’t have anything to eat.
Q: Okay.
A: Especially Jewish people.
Q: There was a distinction made.
A: Yes. And then – so we said – for many weeks we were saying, only my mother staying in line. She was afraid to – for me to stay, that I would be in line.
Q: Did – okay.
A: So she was a – and that’s why we’re [indecipherable] a little sugar, a little that, but it was very difficult to survive.
Q: Okay. What was your father doing during this time?
A: He was hiding. He didn’t go out from the room. He didn’t room – yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: But he couldn’t hide for – o-only a few months. Few months. And I remember that he went to this – I don’t remem – but I know that he was caught on the street.
Q: Okay.
A: He was caught on the street with his friend –
Q: Okay.
A: – and deported right away to concentration camp in – in Lemberg. Maybe you heard about Janowska.
Q: I have heard of Janowska.
A: Yeah, he was there, and that was in Lvov.
Q: Okay.
A: On the outskirts of – of Lvov, yeah.
Q: Did you find – how did you find out about this? How did you find out that he was arrested, that he was taken to –
A: How we found out?
Q: Mm.
A: I – I don’t remember how we found out. Maybe because he never came back.
Q: He never came back.
A: No, never came back. He was there [indecipherable] maybe two months. He – he got typhus, the typhus fever, was it – that’s how it’s called.
Q: Okay.
A: And he died, in the – in – in the camp.
Q: Oh my.
A: Yeah.
Q: Oh my.
A: So we don’t know where – how he was buried, where he was buried, we didn’t know anything – anything about it, yeah. He was only 42 years old.
Q: And his name again was? Tell me his name again. Your father’s –
A: Solomon, but we call it Saul.
Q: Okay. Solomon Schwettzer(ph).
A: Schwettzer(ph), yeah.
Q: Solomon Schwettzer(ph). Age 42.
A: Yes. Mm-hm.
Q: What was going on with your mother –
A: Then they throw us else from our apartment, and they were starting to make ghetto, slobdo – putting together as more as possible Jews together. Two fa – three families in one room.
Q: Oh my.
A: We were going from one – one spot I remember, for Jewish section. We were there a few months, they throw us out to another place e – even smaller.
Q: Okay.
A: They catching people on the street that you – they never came back, you never saw them any more.
Q: And so you were starting –
A: And we were hiding, always hiding.
Q: So, when you say you were hiding, you were in the ghetto already, in this three roo – okay
A: Yeah, but the ghetto was open. You could still move around. Get out, come back, get out and come back, til it started – we call it akcja in Polish.
Q: Okay.
A: When they catching people on the streets, and going from ho-house to house. Raus, raus, raus, that’s what they did that.
Q: Okay. And when they – when you were hiding, does that mean you were hiding in places outside the ghetto?
A: No.
Q: You were hiding inside the g –
A: I was hiding, I remember once –
Q: Okay.
A: – I had the girlfriend, she had some papers –
Q: Okay.
A: – that she write – they didn’t touch her, the Germans – Gestapo –
Q: Okay.
A: – they didn’t touch her, because she is working for them, she was sewing or something. And she has a layout – we didn’t have closet they were built in – in the – in the wall, we have a separate – separate unit. So she has a big, big, from wall to wall a closet, and she covered the whole room. That didn’t – no – nobody is bes – behind the closet, that she has only one room and the kitchen, no more. So we were hiding there for a few days, my mother, my sister, my grandmother that time. And we were there for a few days –
Q: And this was –
A: – hiding behind the – behind the closet.
Q: Okay. And that was outside the ghetto, or inside –
A: That was part of ghetto then, yeah.
Q: Part of ghetto then.
A: Yeah.
Q: A-And if you were in the ghetto, what was the advantage of hiding? Were they rounding people up?
A: In the ghetto you couldn’t find. I wasn’t in the get – I was in the ghetto open, open ghetto.
Q: Okay.
A: But not – you couldn’t hide. It’s no room where to hide.
Q: Okay.
A: Or maybe some people did underground, something I don’t know.
Q: Okay. All right. Were you found? Did somebody find you, or was it a successful hiding place?
A: No, no, we – we didn’t hide. We – were just in that tiny, tiny room, my mother, my sister, my grandma and that’s all. We – we were [indecipherable] what’s gonna happen – gonna happened.
Q: I know, but you mention this time when you’re in the closet at this friend’s house, or this girl who was sewing for the Germans, and you say you were there for a few days.
A: Few days.
Q: Okay. My question is, why were you hiding at that time?
A: Because they were going from room to – from apartment to apartment, catching all the Jews out.
Q: I see.
A: Taking all the Jews, yeah, whatev – specially men. Specially men. But then what – didn’t matter who. So we were not in the closet, behind the closet was a room, and –
Q: So you were in the room.
A: And we were in the room behind the closet.
Q: Closet. I ha – okay, now I understand.
A: Yeah.
Q: So the closet was like a false wall.
A: Yeah, that’s – no wall – no apartment behind the closet.
Q: Okay, so there’s nothing behind there.
A: Not – nothing behind, yeah.
Q: I see. And you were in there.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: And when they – when there was no more rounding up of people, then you came out.
A: Then I came out. Then was quiet.
Q: Okay.
A: Then was quiet again for a few days, or for few weeks –
Q: Okay.
A: – so you can move around. And then, you never knew – then, he came, get out, raus, raus, this section there that you could live.
Q: Okay.
A: And that should be empty – emptied out in – in some streets –
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: – in – in Lvov.
Q: Okay.
A: So we were there again, in the very, very tiny, tiny – it was just one room, we had one room. It’s – it – and Polish people were selling – selling the apartments, and we bought that tiny, tiny room with a – with a toilet outside – outside with the open, you know –
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: – how was the toilets that time?
Q: Like an outhouse. Like an outhouse.
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.

Q: Li – okay. But not inside the ghetto?
A: No, not yet.

Q: Okay, so you bought – so people were selling and you bought that tiny room –
A: Yes, yeah.
Q: – with the outhouse and the flies.
A: We – we knew that’s only temporarily, only temporarily, that’s all.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah.
Q: All right. So what happened after that?
A: After that, I don’t know how that man – a man came around and he said, I can take you out from the – from the ghetto on – on the outskirt.
Q: Okay.
A: You can go wherever you want, but you have to have some papers. And that’s why I have those papers. We wrote those papers. The Polish people were making their false kennkartes.
Q: Okay.
A: But you have to have papers with your picture.
Q: So it was false I.D. cards.
A: Yeah
Q: False identif – okay.
A: A kennkarte.

A: Yes, yes.
Q: And so he was offer –
A: No, that was a Jewish guy who knew – who knew Polish people, that’s what their business there, they’re making a – as a business, they copy. They copy fantastically. Oh, the cop – copied the – how it’s supposed to be.
Q: Okay.
A: The kennkarte with my picture.
Q: So that meant that you were able to avoid being enclosed in a ghetto, is that right?
A: That’s what the – almost closing, almost on closing.
Q: Okay.
A: So I left my – everybody –
Q: Okay.
A: Everybody. My mother, my sister, my grandma, my aunt.
Q: Did – did they get this kennkarten as well?
A: No, no.
Q: Why not?
A: They never did, because it was too late already. I just did – left the ghetto with the horse and buggy.
Q: Okay.
A: Someone took me with my papers, with my little suitcase, and I was going out – out, I don’t know where. We went – I ha – wi-with another friend, with another girlfriend. She had the same papers.
Q: Okay.
A: And we went to kra – took the train, we’re going to Kraków. Why to Kraków? I don’t know.
Q: Okay.
A: But I had my aunt in Kraków, in ghetto. So she went –
Q: She was in the Kraków ghetto?
A: Yeah, in the Kraków ghetto. She went to warsha – Warsaw, my friend, and I went to – to see my aunt in ghetto. I didn’t know what to do, where to go. I have a little money with me, of course my mother gave me. And I went to – and I stay with her.
Q: In her ghetto?
A: Yeah. Then we’re starting a – a liquidation day ghetto. So, I don’t know how – how I moved out from that ghetto. I moved out on the s – ou-outside the ghetto.
Q: So I have a question here. You were in the ghetto – first you have this little house that you – this little room.
A: In l – in Lvov.

A: They were there.
Q: – they were there –
A: Yes.
Q: – but they don’t have time to get them.
A: Yeah.
Q: You leave that ghetto, and you get to Kraków to your aunt. How do the two ghettos compare? Did they look the same? Do the same things going on? Same buildings?
A: I don’t know how they looked.
Q: Okay.
A: I couldn’t tell you how they looked. Ghetto is ghetto, you closed in, you can’t get out.
Q: Okay.
A: Ba-Barbed wires – barb wires were all around.
Q: Okay. But the ghetto in Lvov, was that in the center of town, or a part of town?
A: No, it’s a little further.
Q: It’s a little further.
A: No – not – not that much outs – outside, bu-but much, much further, not in the middle of the city, no.
Q: Okay. You see, Warsaw was in the middle –
A: It’s too nice.
Q: Yeah.
A: It’s too nice, the city was too nice to make a ghetto there, yeah.
Q: And Kraków. Kraków ghetto is also on the outskirts, or in the center, or where is it?
A: No, it was almost – like Lvov, a half and half.
Q: Okay.
A: They – they took half of outskirts, too.
Q: Okay.
A: But I was there on the one day – no, a few days, few days. And I was walking the streets, the streets don’t – didn’t know where to go. Someone approached me, he n – oh, you see, he told me, I th – I thought you must be Jewish. How would he recognize me, I don’t know, because I had – I –
Q: And you were walking on the streets of the ghetto, or outside?
A: Outside. Outside the ghetto.
Q: Okay.
A: I was outside. Then I was already afraid to go back.
Q: Got it.
A: Because I knew I gonna ke – be caught there, and I will never get out.
Q: Okay. Okay. So he approached you and said you must be Jewish.
A: And he said, I gi – I will give you an address where I know you’re gonna be safe with a Polish woman, because she – not hiding, she didn’t know that I am Jewish, but she’s renting room.
Q: Okay.
A: Try, maybe she – she will take you in. And that was another couple there, a Jewish couple. She didn’t know that they were Jewish. She didn’t know that I am – I was there almost half a year with her.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: She was a French – French Polish old – old – old maid. And sh – that’s – she made a – a – a living renting rooms. Oh she – oh, she loved me right away.
Q: Did she?
A: She took me in. Yeah, she loved me, yeah. It was a – through – through the winter, I think.
Q: And so you were able to pay because your mother had gotten –
A: And I pay, yeah, I pay her, and she – she told me – someone said, you know, she must be Jewish – on me, on me. So she said, I don’t care who she is, I like her so much, so she can stay. Yeah. She was in danger too, you know –
Q: Yeah.
A: – Polish people were in danger when they were caught hiding, even if you didn’t know that I am. Because I have papers, perfect papers, everything. And th – I was telling her a story, and lies, I was telling it, but I had to remember those lies, not to – not to say something else.
Q: What was your false name? What was your false name?
A: Is Irena – I called Irena Starzewska.
Q: Starzewska.
A: Yeah. They ask me, if they making my papers, they ask me, what name do you want? So I said Irena I like it –
Q: Okay.
A: – and that this was a Polish name. And I have a sweater –
Q: Okay.
A: – with – with my name, Irena, which I like very much too.
Q: Okay.
A: So I said, ke-keeping my first name, and I made up Starzewska. I made this up.
Q: You made this up. But then you were able to remember these things. You were able to remember it easy.

Q: Yes.
A: – having – having this in a concentration camp –
Q: Yeah.

Q: Yeah.
A: And I s-said my mother died long time ago, and I ha – I’m sierota. I’m o –
Q: Orphan.
A: All by myself.
Q: Yeah, yeah. Did you feel fear at these times? Were you frightened that you would be discovered? Or did you feel –
A: Oh, oh, frightened all the time.
Q: Okay.
A: That was the worst thing, the fright there –
Q: Yeah?
A: – always, always, yeah.
Q: Okay. Hang on just a second. Okay, all right. It was the noise that I got – I heard. All right, we can start again.
Q2: I didn’t stop.
Q: You didn’t stop. Okay, sorry. Sorry, I was distracted a little bit. So what was this lady’s name? Do you remember, the fri – French Polish lady who liked you so much?
A: No, that – only first name, Cecilia.

Q: Okay.
A: And deporting them. Mostly they go to factories when the – making bombs, and making something. And they e – English are bombing them, the bombs are falling every day, terribly. So there – the rumors are going that when you go willingly and say you’re – I want to go to work in Germany, you can choose the name, the city, wherever you want to go, they take you.
Q: So in other words, you have a chance have – having a better situation.
A: Yes, better situation, and ben – between German I had better situation not to – with my papers.
Q: So you s – by – because you learned German, you were studying German in gymnasium, and because you had those papers, you feel – you – you thought – I – you’re in a better position.

And I knew that some – two guys are watching me in the train, and I right away was shaking. So right away, oh, something is wrong. Then when we came back to the train and he told me, we were sure that you are a Jewish girl. We were watching what papers you’re having to show. Then we change our mind. So that was my – my luck, that was my luck again.

Q: Okay.
A: And I was cleaning, and that’s –

Q: You were afraid of them? That the Poles would say something about you?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Could they tell that you weren’t Polish?

Q: And when you hear someone say evacuating by –
A: [German] So of course I was in heaven again, hearing this.
Q: Of course, of course.
A: And I was listening like that til – til they came to Lvov. I knew that Lvov is –
Q: [German]
A: [German]
Q: [German]
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. So it’s been evacuated, which means they’re retreating, they’re running.
A: They’re running, yes.

A: And they are running, yeah.
Q: So – now back in the inn, how did the – how did your bosses treat you?
A: Very good.

Q: Backpack.
A: Yeah. With two cans of milk.
Q: Oh my, mm-hm.
A: And that was a little up the hill.
Q: Okay.
A: So I – she left me. I pretended that I knew very, very little German, I was afraid to – to tell her that I understand everything what she talked – shud – what she tells me. I was a – a big actress in front of her.
Q: Well, that takes some effort.
A: Pretending, always pretending, and that was the worst part, pretending, yeah. And so, once it was so hot, and I came, I thought the – with the – with the loading this wa – I have on me. I thought I gonna faint.
Q: Okay.
A: So she said to me, remember that ich kann nicht, that word doesn’t exist in German language.
Q: Ich kann nicht.
A: Ich kann nicht. You know I remember that word, and sometimes I – I am so tired that I said, that word doesn’t exist, you ha – go, you have to do it.
Q: Interesting. Interesting.
A: Yeah.
Q: But in two years, your German must have really improved a lot.
A: Yes, yes, it did, it did.
Q: You know?
A: Yeah.
Q: And so by the end did you have to pretend any more?
A: I pretend that I – I am – when I left I didn’t tell her that I am Jewish. Even when I left. It’s such a fear on me, that I didn’t say that. And I left with – when I came to Poland, I was looking for my family, so I will – in Kraków again. So I found my mother and my – my sister. Then –
Q: We’ll come to that, we’ll come to that. I want to now go back to still this inn. Were there any other incidents that stick out in your memory from the time you were working there? Did you hear people say things that were surprising, unusual?
A: No, not really. Only when her sister came from Berlin.
Q: Okay.
A: Her sister run away f – she had two little children.
Q: Okay.
A: Sh-She came to live with her.
Q: Okay.
A: So, I was glad tha – that she’s running away from the bombs, I was glad.
Q: Okay.
A: Now – now you’ll – you’ll lo – you lost everything like we did.
Q: Yeah.
A: And when we were talking about it and I – stupid of me, butt in and said in the – between talking, nebby(ph). And she said, what, what is that? This is a Jewish word, nebby(ph).
Q: The sister said this? Oh my.
A: That was enough for me.
Q: Okay.
A: I said that – that’s not. I didn’t know that. I didn’t – never heard that, that it’s a Jewish name. I have to make up something and apologize for it.
Q: Yeah. So –
A: So that was – was another – one incident. Now, I have another incident, yes. A – one Gestapo man came – one Gestapo man came, and – to her part of apartment. She has a nice dining room for herself. I came right away, listening, being near the door, what he was talking. Of course he said in German, a-are you sure that she’s a Polish girl? So then I se – heard her answer, what do you think she could be? Maybe she’s from east, that I am a Russian girl. No. Okay, that was a little better.
Q: So there was some kind of – if not about you maybe in general, but there was – you were never safe, even with these papers, or with how you looked –
A: Never, never, no.
Q: – or – or something like that.
A: No, never. Someone will pointed at you, someone will recognize you, someone will say – will – bad words. Some Polish man that he was – they’re working outside –
Q: Yeah.
A: – said that I am walking like a Jewish girl.
Q: You’re walking?
A: Walking as a j – like a Jewish girl. So I said to that person who told me that, said, how Jewish people walk? Don’t they walk with two legs?
Q: Yeah.
A: How they walk? The Polish people have such a nose. Special nose like a dog’s, for Jewish people, to find Jewish people.
Q: That sounds quite bitter.
A: Yeah. Yeah, that was – that was another one. I have star – few of – a few of those, like – like you – you remind me.
Q: Did you see many army people come through? Did you see any German army come through there, or was it a town empty of any soldiers?

A: No.
Q: No.
A: No. She wasn’t Catholic, she was Protestant –
Q: Uh-huh, the innkeeper, okay.
A: – my boss. So she never went to church, no. I never heard from her heil Hitler. I never heard from her.
Q: Okay.
A: No.
Q: You never heard one or the other?

Q: So tell me then, what was – how did – did you have a sense that the war was coming to an end?
A: Yes. We knew it took – gonna be sooner or later, it has to be. When I heard those on the radio [speaks German] I knew it was gonna be ending.
Q: Okay.
A: It’s gonna be ending, yeah.
Q: All right. And then after that, how did – how did you experience this liberation? What happened?

A: The German?

A: Yeah. Then I – then a – I – I knew I’m liberated. I didn’t say that I am Jewish to anybody, that was a big secret. Big secret in my life. But I knew – then I was quiet – th-then my nerve was quiet down. Then I knew I – you don’t have to be afraid any more. That was in May 1945.
Q: Did they come to the inn?
A: Yes. They threw her out. They threw her out, they say, we need – you need – we need you villa. We need that place. They didn’t what to live. She has a little tiny home w-were – where I live summertime, because there was no heat there.

A: And I knew where – where he lived – where his office was, so I went there first – first, and then he told me not about my mother, that – that my aunt survived – survived, and he gave me the address where she is. And I went there. So she wasn’t home, only her daughter was there. So her daughter told me, oh you know, your mother is here, your f – your – your sister is engaged. My sister was only 18 years old when she married. She – you know sh – right away she says – says she’s engaged.
Q: Oh my goodness.

Q: Yeah, they didn’t know what happened to you.
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: And I was afraid, I was standing there near the door, what should I do? No, of-of course I – I knock, and I came in. Can you imagine? Yeah.

Q: And did they spend the war there?
A: They spend almost two years with them.
Q: Oh.
A: That’s how they survive.
Q: Oh.
A: But they were not very nice to my mother, but I didn’t – I don’t blame them, because they were afraid, too. Because they thought that war will finish few months. In few months will be over, and it took them two years, not two mo – few months. And they were saying, it’s time, you can go. Just leave me – leave us alone. They feed them. They didn’t have bathrooms, they had the pail. So they were afraid too. If someone will catch them, they all will go. So I didn’t – they didn’t blame them, but wi – they said, what the ou – we leave, so everybody will ask, where – where were you til now? How – how you – how – what you doing here?
Q: How did you –
A: They all gone.

Q: I see.
A: Yeah. Before that, they came out, everybody was pointing, oh Jews are coming, the Jews are coming, because they were so pale. The legs were swollen. They were hardly walk because they – no exercise. They hardly walk. So they knew they be recognized right away that the Jews are coming.
Q: So they decided to go to Kraków after the –
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah?
A: Yeah. Polish people were leaving that part of – of Poland. They were leaving on the – to go to the other side. Maybe they knew it’s gonna be divided again, I don’t know, because it is Ukraine now. So maybe they knew about that na – then. So they go to Kraków, that’s how we – how we managed to meet again.
Q: And how long did you stay in Kraków?
A: Less than a year.
Q: Okay.
A: Less than a year. They started with the – Israel. They talking – the English didn’t want to – her to send. When you move, move, go, go, the more the better, the more the better. We knew that Poland wasn’t the same what it was before. It wasn’t the same. So I moved with my mother. My sister had already papers to go to Argentina with her husband, because he has the family there.
Q: Okay.
A: And we didn’t know what to do. We were going to Israel.
Q: Okay. So where did you –

A: By buses we came to – to Vienna. We were saying – staying in Vienna for three weeks. And then from Vienna they say you have to go to – to – a little further. They didn’t want to have refugees in Vienna. Didn’t look good. So we went to Salzburg.
Q: A very pretty place.
A: Very pretty. We got stuck there for five years.
Q: Really?
A: Five years we lived in o – in Salzburg.
Q: So tell me –
A: Yeah, he wa – he was there.

A: Yeah, he – he went through a lot, yeah, a lot, yeah. Yeah. He was working for the Metro Goldyn(ph) Mayer pictures, after his studying in – in Paris and in Italy, he was studying.
Q: He was studying in Italy as well?
A: Yes.
Q: And so when he was working for them, what happened after that?
A: S-So, the Russian people – for them, every other person is a spy. When he works for the Metro Goldyn(ph) Mayer, he must be a spy.
Q: Okay.
A: Because this is American industry. So they came at night, like he was dressing on a – in a – in his suit and in – in shoes, and took him away. To the parents, they gi – the NKVD said, oh, he’ll be back in the morning, he’ll be back – back in the morning. He never came back, of course.

A: Or the oil. They have oil sitting on the soup.
Q: Yeah.
A: That wasn’t real oil. I don’t know, it was black – black rings around. But some people are terrible, when they were hungry, they’re in pain. It’s painful to be hungry.
Q: Yeah. So he would talk about that.
A: Yeah.
Q: He would talk about how he saw that.
A: Yeah. And then – then he – what he got, the typhus. Did he tell you he got the typhus, typhus fever?
Q: No.
A: He got typhus, he went to the hospital. They gave him a ice cold water to take a bath first. We won’t go to the bath before you don’t take a bath. He was there a few days. He was there a few days, and then they took him back by open buggy, horse and – horse and buggy. They didn’t have cars. He had the water –
Q: Let’s cut. [break] Okay, so he had typhus, and it was under those conditions that he was taken to a place to –
A: [indecipherable] back where he was before.
Q: Okay.
A: And then he decided, I won’t survive, I won’t survive here.
Q: Okay.
A: So when he – she gave him the – the papers –
Q: Now why would she have given him these papers?
A: I don’t know why.
Q: Okay.
A: He’s – because, he said, he liked me. He was joking. I don’t know why. It was dangerous for her to do that.
Q: So she was like a camp commandant, or –
A: Yeah, something er – a working person that cou – that could do it.
Q: You see, one of the reasons I ask is because when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, of course they weren’t friend any more, you know, after that attack.
A: Of course, yeah.
Q: And – and the Polish government in exile negotiated with Stalin that the Poles who are – the Polish – the Poles and the Polish citizens who are in Soviet custody in camps and prisons and labor camps all over the country, can be released. And they were released, throughout 1940 – late ’41, ’42. So it was throughout this time. And I’m wondering whether or not –
A: I never her – I never heard that.
Q: Yes.
A: Never heard it.
Q: Yeah.
A: Never.
Q: They were – yeah, they were released –
A: No. There were a lot –
Q: – now – there were a lot.
A: A lot of those labor camps, yeah.
Q: Yeah. And some made their way – some were able to leave the Soviet Union. So I’m wondering whether or not this permission that she gave to him, had anything to do with that.
A: No, no.
Q: No. It was personal.
A: Yeah.
Q: It was personal, okay.
A: Yeah. No, it has nothing to do –
Q: So she gave him papers, and what did he do then?
A: He wanted to go to Palestine.
Q: Okay.
A: He went to Asia – Asia?
Q: Asia.
A: Asia. Yeah, he went to –
Q: Soviet Asia.
A: – by train, by – by a-any means.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. Russian, yeah, Russian issue. And then il – then, it was within – when the women wa – women are against the window that he – here we are, he was on the – on the train.
Q: Okay.
A: He was on the train, and only women was there, no men in. They were very nice, those Russian women. They gave – they knew right away that – that he is from – from east, or from –
Q: From the west.
A: From west, yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: From west. How he looked, how he was dressed, how he looked. So they gave him food. They gave him cheese, they gave him some – some food. Then, I think he didn’t have this – those papers expire, he didn’t have papers any more. And the NKVD was approaching –
Q: The secret police were coming, yeah.
A: – to train, and asking for papers. Papers, papers, and he didn’t have it. So he said to the woman, I gonna hold on – or the woman told him, you go – can you hold on outside the w – the wed – the train, on the window, outside the window, and I’m going to stay back to the window, cover you. I don’t know, one woman, or two women were there. And that’s how it happened. He wa – he came out the – the train, holding on –
Q: Okay.
A: – outside, and the train was moving, train was moving. And all of a sudden the NKVD gay – guy was smoking, he wanted to put the ashes at – outside the window, outside the window. So she said to move – move away. And when he saw that, he jumped out from the car. He jumped out. He said, I was so lucky that was only grass, that I fell on the grass. He said, I was unconscious, I don’t know for how many hours, lying down, touching myself if I have still my – my legs and my arms.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: That’s what he has once. And then he start moving again. He didn’t know – I didn’t know what – he didn’t have any – anything to go by which way to go, where to go. He was going, he was walking.
Q: Do you know some of the places that he traveled through as he was – a-after he left this camp? Do – you know, you say it’s Russian Asia, but what would be the place names? Did he mention this?
A: It – was it to Tushkant(ph)? Yeah, he went to Tushkant(ph).
Q: Okay. Okay.
A: That was because he thought he gonna go through Iran to Palestine.
Q: That’s the way that many of the Poles –
A: Yeah.
Q: – were leaving the country.
A: Yeah.
Q: You know? They were joining the Polish army.
A: That’s – that’s where he – he wanted to go to [indecipherable] to the –
Q: Polish –
A: Did he tell you about that?
Q: Tell me. You tell me about that.
A: He went a few places and they didn’t accept him because he was Jewish.
Q: Mm-hm. I see. Okay.
A: He was Jewish, he didn’t say we don’t accept. They tell him straight, we don’t. But someplace – one place he found that they – they did accept him, they – because he went to the army.
Q: Oh, I see, so he went to the army then?
A: Yes, he went to the army.

Q: All right. Did he ever get then to – back to Lvov?
A: Yes, he went to Lvov.
Q: And he was already in the army by the time he did?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: But he le – that’s what – how far he went. He didn’t go any further.
Q: Okay.
A: And he – that – of course, he was starting to look – because they were talking they’re killing Jews, they’re killing Jews, the Russian, but he never believed, because they said all – all propaganda he was talking about.
Q: Yeah.
A: He never believed in that, they were –
Q: Yeah.
A: – that six million will – will go. So he was looking for the parents and for the brother. He had only one brother. And when they came to the – where they live.
