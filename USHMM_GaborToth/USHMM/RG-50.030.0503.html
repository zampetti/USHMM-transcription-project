id="s371">We were underground together, yeah.</span> <span id="s372">He -- we came together to Auschwitz, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Before you went underground into hiding, were you experiencing a lot of financial difficulties?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Did we had a lot of things in -- if I would remember -- we had a lot of things in storage.</span> <span id="s375">Some money.</span> <span id="s376">But we sold, you know.</span> <span id="s377">We sold first the big things, like carpets, Oriental carpets.</span> <span id="s378">Then we sold service [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s379">We started to sell, you know, to have money, to be able to take care of us, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Who did you sell these items to?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: There were somebody, she did it for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So you were able to manage financially?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Now, when your mother was taken away, did you stay in contact with her?</span> <span id="s385">Were you able to communicate with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: There was somebody I knew in a different district, and we sent packages to her, to Theresienstadt, and she received the packages.</span> <span id="s387">We knew that.</span> <span id="s388">Every two weeks, we made a big box.</span> <span id="s389">We sent -- we mailed -- whatever is not perishable, we mailed it to her, and she received it, because one day, the -- she was [indecipherable] she was superintendent, she got the note back from Theresienstadt this my mother is -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust

I just want to go back a little bit and talk about your childhood, about your first day at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yeah, my father took me to school.</span> <span id="s393">He opened the door, there were all girls.</span> <span id="s394">I said, I’m not going in there.</span> <span id="s395">He said why?</span> <span id="s396">They are all girls.</span> <span id="s397">I was used to boys.</span> <span id="s398">I had four cousins, my brother, and all his friends.</span> <span id="s399">And there were all girls, I didn't want to go in it.</span> <span id="s400">But I have a very good -- the teacher was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s401">She said, you know, you don’t have to sit with them, you sit with me.</span> <span id="s402">She was a little [indecipherable] so I was sitting next to her desk on the floor.</span> <span id="s403">You sit with me, you don’t have to sit with the girls.</span> <span id="s404">So, it was all right.</span> <span id="s405">Very soon I had five friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I was six.</span> <span id="s408">We -- school starts first grade.</span> <span id="s409">I wasn’t six, because the school starts in September and I-I had to make -- I had to go for examination that they should expect me -- accept me, because I was born in -- in December, so I wasn’t six years old then.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What about religious school?</span> <span id="s411">Did you go to any as you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: The Hebrew school was obligatory.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did you enjoy that?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No.</span> <span id="s415">I hated him.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: You hated the teacher, or you hated studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: The teacher, Dr. Spitz, had a little beard.</span> <span id="s418">And when he asked our names, and I told him my name, he said, oh why did God punish me with you?</span> <span id="s419">No, he ask me, you have a brother there?</span> <span id="s420">Yes.</span> <span id="s421">You have cousins there?</span> <span id="s422">Yes.</span> <span id="s423">There?</span> <span id="s424">Yes.</span> <span id="s425">Oh why does God punish me with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Why would he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Because we were very bad, the boys were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And that’s the reason you didn't like the teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: I didn’t like him</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Did you speak other languages at home with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No.</span> <span id="s432">Wa -- German, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: But you didn’t -- did you speak Yiddish at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No.</span> <span id="s435">My mother spoke with her sisters, sometimes I heard them.</span> <span id="s436">They spoke, sometimes Yiddish, yeah.</span> <span id="s437">I think it was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s438">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Now, you were telling me about your mother being taken away, and I was wondering, at that time, what did you know, what had you heard about Theresienstadt or Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: We knew -- we knew everything, because we did listen to the English in the radio, which was forbidden, you know?</span> <span id="s441">We knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: You knew that there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Crematorium.</span> <span id="s444">We knew everything, because the British, the English [indecipherable] you know, told.</span> <span id="s445">But it was very dangerous to listen to it, yeah.</span> <span id="s446">We listen in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you somehow remain hopeful that your mother might make it out of there alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Did you have a lot of hope from day to day in general?</span> <span id="s450">Optimism?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I -- I was -- my whole life I was a big optimist.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Why do you think that’s the case?</span> <span id="s453">Why were you an optimist?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: That’s my nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So even as things got worse around you --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I always had hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Now, what happens before -- what happened to cause your husband and you to decide to go into hiding?</span> <span id="s458">Tell me about that -- that phase.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, at that time, there came -- we were notified to come with a suitcase not heavier than so and so much kilogram, and with white ink, name written on the top, there and there, for relocation.</span> <span id="s460">So we knew already what happened, and we were eni -- we were denying it.</span> <span id="s461">We did have a place already, we knew already where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: When did you make arrangements for such a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: My husband made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And did that -- did he do that pretty early on after the anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Aft -- no, after we heard that people were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: It was a laundry.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: This is where you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Into hiding, yeah.</span> <span id="s470">It was a laundry in the 13th district, in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s471">And there were went.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: And how did you or your husband know these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s474">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: And who were they?</span> <span id="s476">What are their names, and who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Their name was Pukas.</span> <span id="s478">She was not married, and they were hand laundries, you know.</span> <span id="s479">Yeah.</span> <span id="s480">I don’t know how we met them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: So tell me about when you first moved into this hiding place, the transition from leaving your home, and what did you bring with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: We went every day, we took a little bit out, you know, from the apartment.</span> <span id="s483">Clothes first, like I would go to the cleaners, and then we started to take other things out, like silver, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: I’m going to take a quick break.</span> <span id="s485">Okay, we were starting to talk about you beginning to go into hiding, and I wanted to make sure I understood approximately when was this?</span> <span id="s486">How long after the anschluss?</span> <span id="s487">Was it a year or two after, or -- or sooner than that?</span> <span id="s488">Do you -- did you go into hiding in 1938, or was it later?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Later, later.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Think it may have been closer to 1941, does that seem right?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I thinks that would be 1941, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So, from 1938 to 1941, were things getting more and more difficult all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: And are there any examples that come to mind?</span> <span id="s495">What -- what sorts of things were happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Life became very complicated for us, you know?</span> <span id="s497">Everybody know when you went to the street, you are a Jew, you know?</span> <span id="s498">And it was -- and we lost all our apartments, I told you that already.</span> <span id="s499">We pushed together in small rooms.</span> <span id="s500">It was complicated, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Were you actively trying to leave the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s503">I was supposed to go to Venezuela, I told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: But after that didn’t work out, did you try other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Then you couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s506">We waited for papers who never came.</span> <span id="s507">You could leave if you have the papers, but it never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And then at some point you started looking into the option of going into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And your husband was mostly in charge of looking for those arrangements?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Now, you already told me a little bit about receiving some kind of order, a relocation order.</span> <span id="s513">What did that say?</span> <span id="s514">What was the relocation order that you received?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I didn’t receive it.</span> <span id="s516">They started to -- people started to receive it.</span> <span id="s517">[indecipherable] my mother too, I told you, to come with so and so much for relocation, and they went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s518">From there they came later to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: I thought you said you and your husband also received a relocation order.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Then we went in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: So when you received your -- the relocation order, what did it say?</span> <span id="s522">How long did it give you in order to relocate?</span> <span id="s523">Was it very short period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: I guess what I’m curious to know is, did you have to go into hiding very quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s527">But we already knew, and we were prepared to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: So does that mean you moved out of your apartment entirely?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s530">We left, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: So the first place you went into hiding in 1941, can you give a physical sort of description, whatever your memory can recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: There’s something.</span> <span id="s533">Wait a second.</span> <span id="s534">Yeah, Debbie’s little brother, was his 13th birthday.</span> <span id="s535">Debbie?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A2: Yes?</span> <span id="s537">One second.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Your little brother, what was his name?</span> <span id="s539">Ignatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Oh, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A2: Who, Ignatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: I think yeah, you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A2: Ignatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: -- her mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s545">Well, actually -- so I want to -- I want to just --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: No, not her mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s547">Debbie’s little brother.</span> <span id="s548">Debbie?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A2: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: You had a little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A2: I have a -- my brother is Howard.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Ah yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s553">Her mother’s brother, yeah.</span> <span id="s554">I-Ignatz.</span> <span id="s555">He was 13, and I said on that day, you know, family should be together, so the grandparents they were in hiding already, and we arranged they should come late in the evening while everybody goes home, and we will have a little celebration.</span> <span id="s556">And they never came, because they were arrested in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: I think actually we -- we haven’t talked about this yet during the interview.</span> <span id="s558">Maybe you can explain wh-who are these family members, or who are these friends you are referring to.</span> <span id="s559">Can you tell me a little bit about your friends Ann and Ignatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: My friend Ann?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: How did you meet them, or how long did you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Well, when I saw her first, she was 13 -- Ann Green?</span> <span id="s563">You speak about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yes, because you started to talk about her brother, so I just wanted you to give a little introduction to both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: So when I saw her the first time, she was 13, and her father was what we call a person -- they came from a small town to Vienna, they were relocated, and he could do everything.</span> <span id="s566">You want to sell, he knew who buys.</span> <span id="s567">You want to buy, he knew who will sell.</span> <span id="s568">So what we needed was money, and he knew somebody who would borrow money for a lot of interest.</span> <span id="s569">We couldn’t get our money from some reason or the other.</span> <span id="s570">And there I met Annie the first time, Ann Green.</span> <span id="s571">And his -- her little brother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So when you first went into hiding with your husband, were you also in hiding with Ann and her brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: No.</span> <span id="s574">When I went to hiding -- I wonder if her brother went with us, I wish I could remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s576">Can you --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: The 19th of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What was the 19th of May?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Was his -- her brother’s birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: And what happened on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I wanted a -- we should be all together, but her parents never came because they were arrested in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And did you know that?</span> <span id="s583">Did everybody know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, no, we did not know.</span> <span id="s585">They didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s586">So later in the evening, somebody called, and said they are arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And how did you deal with this news?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How did you cope?</span> <span id="s590">How did you deal with this news?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Well, was very hard.</span> <span id="s592">Her brother started to yell, and to cry.</span> <span id="s593">And I said, please be quiet, somebody would -- could hear us.</span> <span id="s594">And Annie went to -- Ann Green, she went to calm him down.</span> <span id="s595">Was very bad.</span> <span id="s596">It was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: And this is when -- his birthday, Ignatz’s birthday, May 19, that’s -- at that time you were all in hiding together?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Not yet, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Were you already in hiding with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s601">We knew already.</span> <span id="s602">We were in hiding and Bushie was with us.</span> <span id="s603">Ignatz was -- was with us.</span> <span id="s604">Annie came later.</span> <span id="s605">Mrs. Green, she was someplace else, she came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Tell me about the conditions of this hiding place.</span> <span id="s607">Did you have a lot of space, or a very little bit of space?</span> <span id="s608">What were the conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: It’s -- was a [indecipherable] laundry, and they had a wooden, little house.</span> <span id="s610">Was small, but it has electricity.</span> <span id="s611">It was a outhouse, you know, no toilet in the house.</span> <span id="s612">But it was all right, we managed.</span> <span id="s613">We were hiding it.</span> <span id="s614">We did feel a little bit secure, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: How many of you were in that outhouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Outhouse, no, not outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: In -- in the outhouse, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Outhouse was the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Sorry, in this little building, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: In the building.</span> <span id="s621">So who was there?</span> <span id="s622">My husband, I, and [indecipherable] then Annie came, we were four.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Were you all sleeping in one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s625">Could be, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: And where did you go to the bathroom, it was close by?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: It was outside in the garden.</span> <span id="s628">We had to go outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And you said there was an outhouse, or you just went outside and went to the bathroom outdoors.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: That was the outhouse.</span> <span id="s631">The toilet was outside, a little shed where you had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: And what did you do for food back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: For food, well you had to get it.</span> <span id="s634">And we bought it.</span> <span id="s635">We had to take -- we knew somebody, she could get everything.</span> <span id="s636">But if you needed sugar, you had to take some chickens, otherwise she didn’t give it to you.</span> <span id="s637">She was very funny.</span> <span id="s638">She always said, I’m very good to you, am I?</span> <span id="s639">But she never woulds give us anything, [indecipherable] anything if you wouldn’t have taken something else what you did not need.</span> <span id="s640">But she could get everything from the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: And was this woman Jewish, or not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: No, not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: So she was helping you, she knew that you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, yeah, she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Were there a number of non-Jewish people helping you?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yeah, there were two girls, they had -- they had some land and they grow vegetable, th -- everything.</span> <span id="s647">We got everything from them.</span> <span id="s648">And they knew.</span> <span id="s649">They didn't say it, but they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: They knew that you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s652">One of this -- one name was -- I remember one name, Fishbach.</span> <span id="s653">The second name I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s654">They knew, because they did give us everything.</span> <span id="s655">Before they go to -- went with their vegetable to the market to sell, we got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: So, you were able to get food.</span> <span id="s657">Do you remember being hungry while you were in hiding, or you had enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No, no, enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And did you have a kitchen, did you cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, I didn't cook.</span> <span id="s661">Pukas, she cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: And tell me a little bit about her, the person who was keeping you in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah, well, she had a boyfriend who was a carpenter.</span> <span id="s664">And he started -- and sh-she must have told him, because he started to ask money.</span> <span id="s665">He -- he started to stick -- tell my husband that he needs money to buy wood, you know?</span> <span id="s666">Yeah, he started to ask money for th -- us.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Well, we did give it to him, but he never stopped, and it was a lot of money, you know, for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s669">He got the money for us if he will denounce us.</span> <span id="s670">And somehow he -- he must have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: He must have done what?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: To denounce us.</span> <span id="s673">To tell that we are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: You think he’s the reason you were found?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s676">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: But the -- but the woman was very good to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yeah, we were -- but he did -- we had to from time to time to other place, which we did, you know?</span> <span id="s679">And then she -- they called us back, and we came back, let’s see, around five o’clock, when everybody was in the street going home from work.</span> <span id="s680">Was five o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s681">Four o’clock in the morning the Gestapo came, and we were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Now, before I ask you about -- about that time, I just want to try to capture more details while you were actually still in hiding.</span> <span id="s683">Why -- why did you leave -- is her name Pukas -- Pukas?</span> <span id="s684">Why did you leave, from time to time, from her hiding place?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: We had to, yeah.</span> <span id="s686">That was the arrangement.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: She told you you would need to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: That was the arrangement from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So where else did you go when you would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: To somebody -- people -- this was a couple, they were living in a completely different district, we didn’t know them.</span> <span id="s691">He was a tiny little man, [indecipherable] was his name, married to a Jewish lady, and they took us in.</span> <span id="s692">We went to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did you go to other hiding places as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, only those two.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Only those two, so this -- this one couple, or the woman who --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: -- had the laundry --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: -- business.</span> <span id="s700">So you spent most of the time at the woman’s place, or with the couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah -- no, no, at the woman place.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Did you do any work while you were staying with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, ironing.</span> <span id="s704">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Now, tell me how you were feeling?</span> <span id="s706">Every day were you worried and afraid, or what was your feeling at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: We were always worried, but we had the children and we had school.</span> <span id="s708">They didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s709">They couldn’t read, they couldn’t write, they had no schooling at all.</span> <span id="s710">Every afternoon -- no, every evening -- in the afternoon we ironed, and in the evening we had school.</span> <span id="s711">They learned to write, to read, whatever we could ba -- husband was very highly educated, and he is -- whatever we could, you know?</span> <span id="s712">We taught them, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: You’re talking about the two children who were with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s715">About Mrs. Green, and her little brother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: And how old were they?</span> <span id="s717">Well, he was 13 you said, and she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: And she was -- she is 15 years, she was born 1925.</span> <span id="s719">She was 15 years younger than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: So every night you became a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So do you feel like during this time in hiding, were there also times where things were not as, you know, heavy and worrisome?</span> <span id="s723">Did you have any lighter moments?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No.</span> <span id="s725">We were worried all the time.</span> <span id="s726">You know, you -- you are not worried all the time, that’s impossible.</span> <span id="s727">You forget yourself.</span> <span id="s728">But w-we were not really peaceful, no.</span> <span id="s729">We were hopeful.</span> <span id="s730">That’s different.</span> <span id="s731">And we always made it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Were there any humorous stories while you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s734">Two, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Can you tell me about those?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Well, you know, when she wanted something, Pukas, we have to give it to her.</span> <span id="s737">She did not stop.</span> <span id="s738">So it was a holy day and she wanted a goose.</span> <span id="s739">And finally we got the goose, but we had to pick it up by the [indecipherable] station.</span> <span id="s740">There was a stand for papers and cigarettes, and she had the goose.</span> <span id="s741">And we had to go there, was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s742">Debbie’s mother and I, we went there, a-and there was the goose, I had the canvas bag, and the goose went in that canvas bag, and there were Gestapo and gendarmes, but we finally made it, and we left.</span> <span id="s743">And there was a dog [indecipherable] after that, he smelled the blood in that canvas bag, and we were running to the streetcar, and we finally made it.</span> <span id="s744">You know, we were so afraid of that dog, that somebody will notice it.</span> <span id="s745">That was very funny.</span> <span id="s746">When we came home, and Annie got undressed, she had a blue sweater.</span> <span id="s747">Her skin was all blue.</span> <span id="s748">Was not -- at that time, nothing was colorfast, like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: At the time now you’re -- you’re laughing about it, but were you very worried at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Sure, I was worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You thought you might actually get caught that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And it was just the two of you women?</span> <span id="s754">Or she was a girl and you were a young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah, yeah, she was a girl, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Just the two of you out on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: How often did you go out like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Oh, we went out when we had to do, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Were you worried -- were you wearing the Jewish Star of David at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No.</span> <span id="s762">Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So you were trying to pass as non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Did anyone ever talk to you and say anything to you, and indicate that they thought you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: No.</span> <span id="s767">I knew that -- that one for the -- for the two girls, Fishbach, who -- who hads the -- that garden that he had all that vegetable, and so she knew.</span> <span id="s768">She never said anything, but I am sure she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Was there anything about your appearance that made it easier for you to pass in the streets as non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah, I-I didn’t look like Jewish.</span> <span id="s771">I was blonde, I have -- my hair was golden blonde, it was very light.</span> <span id="s772">No, I didn’t look like Jewish, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And what about your friend, Ann?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: She didn’t look Jewish either.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: So do you think this was very helpful in allowing you to go in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm, conducted by Amy Rubin on November 18, 2005, in Manhattan, New York.</span> <span id="s779">This is tape number two, side A. Okay, I’m going to continue asking you a little more about your time in hiding.</span> <span id="s780">And I’m wondering, during this entire time, I have the impression that you first went into hiding in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And -- and you were s -- you stayed in hiding until 1944.</span> <span id="s783">So a lot was happening during this time, and I’m wondering what did you know about the war, and what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: We knew everything.</span> <span id="s785">We listened to the British sender at night, I told you.</span> <span id="s786">We do -- we knew that attentat which, you know, there was supposed to be attentat of Hitler?</span> <span id="s787">You know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Say that again?</span> <span id="s789">There was supposed to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Yeah, attentat?</span> <span id="s791">He was supposed to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: And that -- somehow we knew that will happen, but it did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So while -- I -- I knew that you were listening to the radio before you went into hiding, but even while you were in hiding, you still listened?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: And was that -- you listened right in that little building?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s798">We had the radio, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So what were your conversations mostly about while you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s800">Did you talk primarily about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: That I should remember.</span> <span id="s802">Of course.</span> <span id="s803">We spoke about the war, we spoke about what happened, how we did live.</span> <span id="s804">We spoke about what will happen.</span> <span id="s805">Then we had the children, who didn’t learn anything, so we had school every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Did you feel like you were becoming a -- a sort of mother to these children?</span> <span id="s807">You were taking care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Well, I f -- I did feel very near to them.</span> <span id="s809">They boy was very young, you know, of course, and Annie was 15 years younger than I, so -- so Annie, I were more a friend than a mother.</span> <span id="s810">But to her little brother, I did feel like a mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Did you ever talk about sort of strategies about how you were trying to survive this entire time?</span> <span id="s812">You know, walking out on the streets, did you have strategies where you would go, how you would walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: I only noticed one thing.</span> <span id="s814">When I was liberated by the Russians, you know that -- you know I was liberated by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: That I c -- noticed that I was afraid to go on the walk part.</span> <span id="s817">I was going on the street, til I said to myself, are you crazy, you’re free.</span> <span id="s818">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Are you saying you didn’t want to walk on the sidewalk?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yeah, I was afraid, like I’m not allowed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Because that’s how it was in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: That how I did feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: So as you walked around Vienna, when you would come out of hiding from time to time, how did the city feel to you?</span> <span id="s824">What were the differences?</span> <span id="s825">How did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: I didn’t feel -- I wasn’t tired of being in Vienna.</span> <span id="s827">I was in Kraków, in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: No, I’m talking about while you were in hiding.</span> <span id="s829">Weren’t you s -- in Vienna the entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yeah, I was in -- always inside [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: So how did the city change during those war years?</span> <span id="s832">Did it feel like a different city to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No.</span> <span id="s834">In later years, when I was living in Italy, and I came back to Vienna, everything looked to me so dirty, so broken down.</span> <span id="s835">That was later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Well, what about air raids during the war?</span> <span id="s837">Did you experience those in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: When the air raid we -- well, when we were hiding by those people [indecipherable] when the air raid came, everybody had to go to the basement.</span> <span id="s839">And their apartment was in the fifth floor, and we went up to the attic to hide.</span> <span id="s840">And there, Bushie, he was afraid of the little mice.</span> <span id="s841">Oh God, he -- yeah, we did hid in the attic til the air raid was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: And you’re saying there were mice in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yeah, there were mice, yeah.</span> <span id="s844">And Bushie was so afraid of them, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Were you afraid too?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No.</span> <span id="s847">Of little mice?</span> <span id="s848">I don’t want them in my apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Now, I think I heard another story, and I’m not sure exactly the details, but something about a man and the bathtub, the water in the bathtub.</span> <span id="s850">Is that a story that you remember while you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s851">I think it was a man who drank the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: That’s not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Okay, I -- I guess I misunderstood something I think Deborah was telling me, but maybe I just got it wrong.</span> <span id="s854">So that doesn’t sound familiar to you?</span> <span id="s855">A: Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Did you have any other people who came and joined you during hiding, or was only the four of you at all times?</span> <span id="s857">A: Only the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: And did you feel like you always trusted this woman who was keeping you in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s860">Only her boyfriend, he needed money, he started to ask money.</span> <span id="s861">We were afraid of him.</span> <span id="s862">And that what -- how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: So while you were working in this laundry, did you have to make sure that nobody else would see you?</span> <span id="s864">How difficult was that?</span> <span id="s865">People in the neighborhood, were you worried about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: There were next to us, thi -- there were -- this was a cottage, you know, and there were private houses.</span> <span id="s867">And there were people we knew.</span> <span id="s868">I don’t know if they had the -- maybe they had some idea, but there was no danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Tell me a little bit about your training to become a nurse, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s871">There was a doctor, Dr. Richard Miller.</span> <span id="s872">I was already liberated then, and he trained me, because that Roosevelt Hospital in Vienna was not a hospital, it was a orphanlager.</span> <span id="s873">There were people living -- children without parents, parents without children, the [indecipherable] was bumped, and he trained me.</span> <span id="s874">Dr. Otto Vulcan, he trained me, to become a nurse, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: So this is -- this is much later, this is after the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Now, while you’re in hiding, what were some of the dreams or hopes?</span> <span id="s878">What were you hoping would happen, that you would still leave the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: What were you dreaming could happen or would happen, that you could still leave the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I don’t think I wanted to leave the country.</span> <span id="s882">I wanted to be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: So while you were in hiding, were there any other -- did you just think you would stay in hiding the entire time of the war?</span> <span id="s884">Was that your strategy and your hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: My hope was yeah, that it will not take a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Now tell me about the day when -- when they came and found you where you were in hiding.</span> <span id="s887">What -- what exactly happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: We were away -- you know, I told you, from time to time we had to go away to stay with other people.</span> <span id="s889">They called us we should come back.</span> <span id="s890">We came back around five o’clock in the evening, when everybody was in the street.</span> <span id="s891">At four o’clock in the morning the Gestapo came, and we were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Do you have any idea about who -- who told the Gestapo that you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I think her boyfriend, who always ask for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And you think this woman agreed to let him do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I don’t think she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: So, as much as you can remember the details, what exactly happened when you got arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Well, we went to jail.</span> <span id="s898">And there was already a lot of women who waited to be tr-transported to Auschwitz, but they were in quarantine.</span> <span id="s899">There was some sickness.</span> <span id="s900">So Mrs. Green and I, we were outside, and we did work.</span> <span id="s901">We cleaned the floors.</span> <span id="s902">Then the -- they did give us bread.</span> <span id="s903">We had to distribute that bread between people.</span> <span id="s904">And we did

other’s back from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1079">We had no towel to dry, I said it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1080">Because if you had the selections, one pimple on your body, you

like you tried very hard to stay clean all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1085">I knew that if -- if you are clean, you had a chance.</span> <span id="s1086">I told her that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1087">She had -- she showed me in the panties she got, there was a -- a -- a louse.</span> <span id="s1088">I said to her, “Listen Annie, if I will kill your lice, I will not be able to take care of my lice.</span> <span id="s1089">You will not live if I will not live.</span> <span id="s1090">So you take care of yours, I of mine, and just do what I tell

<p><span id="s1096">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: We worked s-six and a half days.</span> <span id="s1099">Sunday afternoon we were

doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Well, first -- that first work I did, stones like that we have to clean, and from one place we did bring it to a other place.</span> <span id="s1107">And there were the bloodhounds behind us, we have to run with the heavy stones, then we have to take the back.</span> <span id="s1108">It was just something to make us tired, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1109">There was n-n-no -- nothing what has any sense.</span> <span id="s1110">And then I -- then we made [indecipherable] to clean the pavement.</span> <span id="s1111">And then I did something,

you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1491">Yeah, well it was Mother’s day, so we ha -- didn’t have money, we were children, but in the -- before Mother’s day, my sister and I, we did [indecipherable] and my brother picked from the tree, flowers.</span> <span id="s1492">Lilac.</span> <span id="s1493">And s -- then was Mother’s day and we made breakfast, and we didn’t let her go out of bed.</span> <span id="s1494">And she had to go out so urgent, which is normal, but we didn’t let her.</span> <span id="s1495">She had to stay in bed and have breakfast which we made, in bed.</span> <span id="s1496">That was the Mother’s day story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Did she enjoy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: I don’t think so, she had to go pee.</span> <span id="s1499">Very urgent.</span> <span id="s1500">We didn’t let her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Well, it sounds like you had a lot of good fun and good memories in your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1503">Yeah, well, I really do, yeah.</span> <span id="s1504">It was a fo -- but I was a orphan at a very young age, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: There’s another story, I believe about your mother, a humorous story, something about don’t give her away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1507">My father passed away, you know, and I was in the street.</span> <span id="s1508">And I was walking, and I saw a man from the back.</span> <span id="s1509">He was dressed exactly like my father.</span> <span id="s1510">Blue jacket up to here with the fur collar, funny little hat.</span> <span id="s1511">And I started to run, and then I remember that he is dead.</span> <span id="s1512">And I stopped and started to cry terribly.</span> <span id="s1513">And a lady came, and said to me, “Child, why are you crying so much?”</span> <span id="s1514">And I said, “My father is dead, my father is dead,” and started terrible crying.</span> <span id="s1515">So she said, “Okay, where do you live?</span> <span id="s1516">Come on, I’ll take you home.”</span> <span id="s1517">She took me home and sh -- then she told my mother she wants me to come to Italy, she was a Italian.</span> <span id="s1518">She has two little boys and they will be very happy to have a little sister.</span> <span id="s1519">And my mother could take with me there to see if she likes it.</span> <span id="s1520">If she doesn’t like it, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s1521">We have horses, she will learn to ride.</span> <span id="s1522">My boys will be -- adore her.</span> <span id="s1523">And m-my brother and my sister started to yell, “Mother, please, don’t give her away, don’t give her away.”</span> <span id="s1524">So that’s the story from Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Were you interested in going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: I can’t tell you that.</span> <span id="s1527">If I would have gone, or if I was interested.</span> <span id="s1528">I wouldn’t even remember.</span> <span id="s1529">But I remember the sto -- like they started to yell that they shouldn’t give me -- my mother shouldn’t give me away.</span> <span id="s1530">Don’t give her away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Now, what about another anecdote about when your mother was sick, and you had to cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Oh God.</span> <span id="s1533">My mother became ill, and had to lay down.</span> <span id="s1534">She has a gall bladder attack.</span> <span id="s1535">And she said to me, Marianne, you have to finish -- we ate lunch, the big meal, you know?</span> <span id="s1536">Then the water cooks, then you put the -- I forgot her -- the -- in English, whatever it is in the boiling water.</span> <span id="s1537">So then I took a spoon with water, and I came into her bedroom and ask her if that water is cooking.</span> <span id="s1538">I never knew because I never cooked.</span> <span id="s1539">I never knew how it looks when water cooks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: How old were you?</span> <span id="s1541">Were you very young?</span> <span id="s1542">A: I must have been very young, and I can’t remember where -- where our maid was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Tell me a little bit about your maid, were you close to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s1545">We adored her, we were fa -- we were not afraid of our parents, oh no, we were afraid of her.</span> <span id="s1546">She was -- oh God.</span> <span id="s1547">When we came in and our shoes were not clean, we got it.</span> <span id="s1548">She had a [indecipherable] she just went over our legs, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1549">And we adored her.</span> <span id="s1550">And we were afraid of her, yeah, but we loved her yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Marie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: And she stayed with you for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Oh, a very long time.</span> <span id="s1555">My mother got her when she got married.</span> <span id="s1556">She stayed with us for a very long time, and then she met somebody someplace, a landowner, very, very wealthy, and they got married.</span> <span id="s1557">And we spend the summer with her, because she c-came and asked my mother, please send the children.</span> <span id="s1558">And we sp -- did spend the whole summer with them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: So your family was pretty well off financially, to have a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yeah, in the beginning, sure.</span> <span id="s1561">As long as my father was alive, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Now, I believe there’s another story here.</span> <span id="s1563">Maybe you already told me the one about boiling the water, but what about baking the chicken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Baking the chicken.</span> <span id="s1566">Mazie said there was a story you wanted to share about baking chicken, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Baking chicken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: I think when you had to cook for your mother?</span> <span id="s1569">You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1572">And what about another -- this is the final anecdote I wanted to ask you about.</span> <span id="s1573">Your first doll, and your brother did something with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Yeah, they opened her head.</span> <span id="s1575">I had had a beautiful doll.</span> <span id="s1576">When you pushed her belly button, she said Mama, and when you laid her down she closes her eyes.</span> <span id="s1577">And it was a big doll like that.</span> <span id="s1578">And my brother and my cousins couldn't understand why she closes her eyes, so they opened her head, yeah.</span> <span id="s1579">And that poor doll, she had to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1580">Yeah, she was very sick.</span> <span id="s1581">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: You took her to the doll hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Not me.</span> <span id="s1584">Not me, no, my parents, my mother and my father, whoever did take her to a place to be repaired.</span> <span id="s1585">They cut the head open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Were you very upset, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: I cou -- oh [indecipherable] I cried.</span> <span id="s1588">Of course I was upset.</span> <span id="s1589">It was a beautiful doll, she would s-say Mama.</span> <span id="s1590">She spoke, yeah.</span> <span id="s1591">At that time, you know, I got it for -- my father did bring it from I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s1592">It was a beautiful, beautiful doll.</span> <span id="s1593">Had hair, everything, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: And it was probably unusual to have a doll that spoke at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yeah sure.</span> <span id="s1596">She only said Mama, but she said Mama.</span> <span id="s1597">But you have to push her belly button.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Well, thank you for sharing those stories.</span> <span id="s1599">Now, I want to ask you some more questions that I had here, prepared.</span> <span id="s1600">And I wanted to make sure because I -- I don’t remember from our first session together, can you just make sure to tell me your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Seno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Ah well, I know you were married twice --</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: That’s my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: -- but your first husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Yeah, my first husband was Otto Brower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: And so that became your last name for awhile as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Now, I wanted to return where we left off in our interview.</span> <span id="s1609">We were talk -- we were starting to talk about the time of liberation at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: But I wanted to make sure that I had a -- some information even before we got to that point.</span> <span id="s1612">I don’t know if you know this by heart, or if we could somehow put this in the interview, but do you know the -- the registration number, the tattoo number that they gave to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Well, you know, I -- I know 60 - 65 - 85 A -- I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Okay, it looks like A7 -- it’s hard to read, but maybe another two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: 75 -- 72?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: I think it’s 72, and then maybe a 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: 72 - 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Does that sound --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: That sounds --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: -- familiar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: So it looks like A7225.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: I forgot it, I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Is that a good thing, to forget the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Yeah, I forgot it completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Well, thank you for showing me.</span> <span id="s1627">Now, when you were in Auschwitz, did you and others around you, did you ever have any kind of religious observance?</span> <span id="s1628">Did you try in any way to -- to observe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1630">Only to Yom Kippur, they didn’t give us any food.</span> <span id="s1631">They said that this here the day where you fast anyways, you don’t -- so you don’t need any food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: And that must have been very difficult in the conditions you were in.</span> <span id="s1633">Now -- now tell me more about liberation.</span> <span id="s1634">If you can sort of walk me through that time period, what you remember, and sort of set up the scene for me, what -- what exactly happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: I was sick.</span> <span id="s1636">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1637">I had a mer -- an infection in my right leg, and I have very high temperature, and it was very dangerous to go to the revere.</span> <span id="s1638">That revere was the s-s-sick station, where sick people went, because they made selections there, you know, and killed people.</span> <span id="s1639">But I had no other choice.</span> <span id="s1640">I was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s1641">And it happened that I was absent mind, I know that.</span> <span id="s1642">And then, I remember only that it was raining and I did feel the drops from the rain on my face.</span> <span id="s1643">And I opened the eyes, and there I saw a man with the sickle and the hammer, was a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1644">He held me in his arms, and it wasn’t raining, he was crying terribly.</span> <span id="s1645">That when we -- I was -- when we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1646">And the gates were open, people went out, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: What was the next thing that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Next thing?</span> <span id="s1649">I was there for a long time.</span> <span id="s1650">I actually couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1651">Then finally I became well enough.</span> <span id="s1652">And there were three sisters.</span> <span id="s1653">They spoke German and Polish and Russian.</span> <span id="s1654">And they saids to that -- no, there came a rus -- Russian man, and they said they will take us to Russia to -- to get well again.</span> <span id="s1655">And there were three sisters, they told me, we are not going with them.</span> <span id="s1656">You want to come with us?</span> <span id="s1657">We are going home.</span> <span id="s1658">They were from Seidenbergen, well a -- this a tar -- part of Europe.</span> <span id="s1659">And so I went with them, and we went over the mountains, oh it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1660">It was March, was snowing, cold, but we went, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1661">Took us days and days, til we came someplace, and that was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1662">We slept on the street, like where the -- you know, the -- where the bus station is, there was little houses where I could stay and wait for the bus.</span> <span id="s1663">And there a man did find us, and he said, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1664">They are looking for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1665">If they find you, they kill you.”</span> <span id="s1666">And he took us to a place where we were safe, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: How did you travel over those snowy areas, the mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: By foot.</span> <span id="s1669">Later on by coal [indecipherable] the tickets, were train with coal, so we were sitting on the coal, and went with the train.</span> <span id="s1670">You could go wherever you want.</span> <span id="s1671">You didn’t need any passport, any nothing at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: First of all, at the time of liberation, what was your feeling, what were your emotions?</span> <span id="s1673">Was it hard to believe that this was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Was it hard to believe that liberation was really happening when it happened?</span> <span id="s1676">What were your emotions at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Well, I was relieved, I would say.</span> <span id="s1678">I was happy.</span> <span id="s1679">And I couldn’t wait to come home, but it took a long time, because the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s1680">We were already liberated, but the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s1681">There was a time, finally when I came home.</span> <span id="s1682">Oh God, took a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Tell me about the rest of the journey, how you got back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Well, you could take a train, you didn’t have to pay, you know, I told you that.</span> <span id="s1685">I was sitting for days on the train with coal, that I remember.</span> <span id="s1686">It was bitter cold, yeah.</span> <span id="s1687">It was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s1688">And finally, finally, I came home.</span> <span id="s1689">And when I came home, it was night, and I was on the train, and they took us right away, whoever was in the train, they took us to a place that was a cellar in a building.</span> <span id="s1690">And there they did give us some to eat or drink.</span> <span id="s1691">I wasn’t by myself, there were maybe with me, 12 or 14 other people.</span> <span id="s1692">And they did give us some tea, not made from tea, from something else.</span> <span id="s1693">And in the morning the curfew was over, and you c -- you could go out.</span> <span id="s1694">And I went out and I did noc -- I did not know where I am, where I was.</span> <span id="s1695">The buildings were bombed.</span> <span id="s1696">I had no idea in which district I am.</span> <span id="s1697">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1698">But then I went to this Jewish community, and there -- everybody has to go there to say, I’m alive.</span> <span id="s1699">So I went there, and there was a letter from somebody who said, whoever knows Anna Vietner, that’s the name, should come to that and that address.</span> <span id="s1700">15 district [indecipherable], I remember like today.</span> <span id="s1701">I knew her, so I went there.</span> <span id="s1702">And her maid was still there, and they had the beautiful apartment taken from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1703">They run away, you know?</span> <span id="s1704">They left everything.</span> <span id="s1705">So she had a beautiful apartment, and I was home, thanks God, I was home.</span> <span id="s1706">Had a place to stay, and very soon, I got the job, I start working, yeah.</span> <span id="s1707">A displaced person camp, the hospital, start working in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1708">I met a doctor in the street, which I knew, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1709">He said to me, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1710">I said, “I am doing nothing.”</span> <span id="s1711">There is nothing.</span> <span id="s1712">There is nothing.</span> <span id="s1713">Like nothing, that doesn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1714">You come tomorrow morning to the [indecipherable] hospital.</span> <span id="s1715">But that wasn’t a hospital, was a displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s1716">There were parents without children, children without parents, and they waited to go someplace.</span> <span id="s1717">I div -- I start to work with him in the [indecipherable] room, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Is this in Vienna as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: That was in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1720">There I was home already, yeah.</span> <span id="s1721">I was home already, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: So that was your m -- that was your goal after the war, was to return to Vienna, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: I had nothi -- no -- nowhere else to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: And did you spend -- after you were liberated from Auschwitz, did you spend from January til the end of the war traveling around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Were you scared during that time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: I can’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1728">I only know I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s1729">And of course, you know, you come home and you -- there is nobody.</span> <span id="s1730">There is nothing.</span> <span id="s1731">You are home, but it’s not home any more.</span> <span id="s1732">And then my sister did find me, we had relatives.</span> <span id="s1733">One of our cousins was married to Catholic girl that the [indecipherable] relatives were living in Vienna, and my sister was in Italy.</span> <span id="s1734">And she did write to her, and so she did find out that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1735">And it wasn’t easy to go over the border.</span> <span id="s1736">There were no passports, there were nothing, and the border was closed like that.</span> <span id="s1737">And every night I went there, oh God [indecipherable] snow up to here.</span> <span id="s1738">Never could cross to Italy.</span> <span id="s1739">And finally, one day, it’s happened that I met somebody, a man to whom I did give a pair of shoes, when we had some, there was -- had also [indecipherable] from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1740">And he was, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1741">I said, “I am waiting s -- to go to Italy.”</span> <span id="s1742">So he said to me, “Don’t go, I will send you somebody.</span> <span id="s1743">Don’t be afraid, you just try to enjoy, and to get well again.”</span> <span id="s1744">And he did give me money.</span> <span id="s1745">At that time I was smoking a lot of [indecipherable] cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1746">And he said, “Somebody will come to pick you up.”</span> <span id="s1747">And one day I came home, and there was a British soldier waiting for me, and he was very rude.</span> <span id="s1748">Where were you?</span> <span id="s1749">I said, “What is your business, who are you?”</span> <span id="s1750">Break in my room, waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1751">He told me, “I come to pick you up.”</span> <span id="s1752">And I was dressed like a British soldier lady.</span> <span id="s1753">I had the [indecipherable] like that, and I -- he had papers that I belong to a troop of people who -- who went to entertain the troops in Italy.</span> <span id="s1754">That’s how I crossed the border.</span> <span id="s1755">And then I called my sister, and then everything was all right again.</span> <span id="s1756">I was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: So you stayed in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: The stay in Italy, yeah, and then I went home.</span> <span id="s1759">I -- I went to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: So you were just there for -- for a short time, for a short visit, in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Well, I was in Italy for a long time.</span> <span id="s1762">Later I was living in Rome, I was with the American Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s1763">Do you know the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Sure, what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Well, I was there, I -- I had the job there.</span> <span id="s1766">I went to the -- there were the kibbutzims.</span> <span id="s1767">You know what is a kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: So I went from one kibbutz to the other, to teach them hygiene.</span> <span id="s1770">But you know, there were mothers, 14 year old mothers.</span> <span id="s1771">But mother instinct [indecipherable] anybody [indecipherable] clean, and so the whole vehicle was

course, I had not my apartment, but I was living with friends, I told you that.</span> <span id="s1786">With -- where [indecipherable] was, and I went there to live with them.</span> <span id="s1787">And then I -- I had nothing to wear.</span> <span id="s1788">And then I remember that I had the woolen coat that was in storage someplace.</span> <span id="s1789">I went there and he was very happy to see me [indecipherable] young [indecipherable] and he had my coat, so I had the coat to wear.</span> <span id="s1790">Well, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s1791">And then I didn’t do anything til I met the doctor, Otto Vulcan, whom I knew after the war, still in Poland.</span> <span id="s1792">And he said, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s1793">I said nothing.</span> <span id="s1794">There no such thing as nothing.</span> <span id="s1795">You come to the [indecipherable] room, and I went every day to work with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm.</span> <span id="s1798">This is

difficult to interact with them after the war?</span> <span id="s1800">Did you feel resentment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Me, I can -- I can tell you only one thing, I wasn’t very happy being home.</span> <span id="s1802">When I come home, our superintendent said to me, “Oh, you are still alive?”</span> <span id="s1803">Like he would be not surprised, like he would be not very happy about it.</span> <span id="s1804">And somebody else had our apartment, so I did cr -- I did leave it to other people.</span> <span id="s1805">But I had a job, I was happy, yeah.</span> <span id="s1806">I was quite satisfied.</span> <span id="s1807">I wi -- I had the job, I had money, which it was important.</span> <span id="s1808">I remember when I got my first [indecipherable] you had to have stamps to get material, was very complicated.</span> <span id="s1809">And I was with the American Joint, and we got rations.</span> <span id="s1810">And under the rations was a big piece of chocolate, thick chocolate.</span> <span id="s1811">I went with the chocolate to the butcher, I said, “Do you want chocolate?”</span> <span id="s1812">He says yes.</span> <span id="s1813">“Will you give me meat?”</span> <span id="s1814">That’s how I -- you know, that I get food.</span> <span id="s1815">Wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s1816">See, had everything, but you have to have money, money, which I didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: What about the people who kept you in hiding before you were sent to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1818">Did you get in contact with any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1820">I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: When you -- when you returned to Vienna after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: -- did you contact them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Yeah, I contact them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Well, she was very surprised to see me, and I don’t know, we were denounced from somebody.</span> <span id="s1827">Because we were there for a long, long time, and we used -- we have to go away from time to time to stay someplace else for a week, then we came back.</span> <span id="s1828">But somebody denounced us, and we were arrested there.</span> <span id="s1829">We came back at five o’clock in -- in the afternoon, at four o’clock in the morning the Gestapo came and arrested us.</span> <span id="s1830">And then we came to Auschwitz, and then we were selected.</span> <span id="s1831">My husband went here, I here.</span> <span id="s1832">I said, “I want to go with my husband.”</span> <span id="s1833">Mengele was sitting there, and he said, “Be glad you are not going.”</span> <span id="s1834">And I never will forget the color of my husband’s face, gray.</span> <span id="s1835">He knew.</span> <span id="s1836">And I knew where he is going, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: How did you emotionally deal with that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: I never will be able to tell you, because I knew what will happen to him, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Now, after the war, when you came back to Vienna --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: -- was it -- was it nice to see the woman who hid you, what was that like to see her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Well, I can’t remember, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1843">I went with other people to [indecipherable] because the Israeli [indecipherable] there was a letter from Anna Vietner, whom I know.</span> <span id="s1844">It said, whoever knows Anna Vietner should go there and there.</span> <span id="s1845">And when I came there, they were hidden al -- th-through the whole war.</span> <span id="s1846">She, her mother.</span> <span id="s1847">Her maid must have hidden them, yeah, opened the door for me, and she started yelling when she saw me, and I was home.</span> <span id="s1848">Was with people who knew me, who loved me, and I did feel good, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Who i -- who is Anna Vietner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Well, she was a lady I knew, and much older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Was she Jewish, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Jewish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: And she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: But she looked like a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1855">She didn’t look Jewish at all, and she was dressed like one even.</span> <span id="s1856">And she went -- wherever she went, her name was Vietner, wherever she went, she said, heil Vietner, which sounded like heil Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: And that helped her get through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: So she helped you when you got back to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: And did you search for other relative -- for relatives of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: I had very little relatives.</span> <span id="s1863">My mother had two sisters.</span> <span id="s1864">One was dead already, one was deported a long time [indecipherable] there, and I had very little relatives, to think about it.</span> <span id="s1865">I had relatives, but not in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: And what about your mom -- your mother, did you already know what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: She was in Theresienstadt, you know about Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Yeah, I’m just wondering when did you learn about -- about what happened with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Well, when I came -- I -- I went to my mother from time to time -- not from time to time, but at least twice a week when I -- I was hidden, and I -- I remember it was late in the spring and I had a little box with strawberries.</span> <span id="s1870">And I had to clean my hand to open the elevator.</span> <span id="s1871">And the super come out and said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s1872">I am going up to see Mother.</span> <span id="s1873">She was picked up last evening.</span> <span id="s1874">And she was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1875">And I knew the superintendent in other district, and I spoke with her and we did make packages and mail them to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1876">And she received it, I know that, because one day, maybe after one and a half years, was a long time she was there, maybe a year or so, a red letter came back that she was relocated.</span> <span id="s1877">Then I knew that she went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Did you ever try to find her at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: How could I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Was that while you were still there, or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: No, I knew that she is not alive.</span> <span id="s1882">Children and old people they gassed right away.</span> <span id="s1883">We knew that.</span> <span id="s1884">We did listen to the British sender.</span> <span id="s1885">We knew exactly what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: When did it become clear to you -- was it already after the war, how massive the Holocaust really was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: How what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: How -- how massive the Holocaust really was, how many Jews, how many people were really victimized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: I -- I knew it.</span> <span id="s1890">I knew it from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1891">We had selections, when you had one pimple on your body -- you know, they were so afraid of scabies, because we were a labor force which didn’t cost any money.</span> <span id="s1892">We worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1893">So if they -- you had one pimple on your body, you went, yeah.</span> <span id="s1894">Were selections very often, I would say at least once a week.</span> <span id="s1895">We washed at night.</span> <span id="s1896">When we came back from work, we worked very hard, cleaning stones and everything.</span> <span id="s1897">When we came back, in the washrooms, that water was dripping, no water.</span> <span id="s1898">We couldn’t even clean ourself.</span> <span id="s1899">And one night I woke up, I saw two from our block that was where we were staying, block 13, go out -- everybody has a towel.</span> <span id="s1900">I run after them and they went into the washrooms and that water was flowing.</span> <span id="s1901">There was water and water [indecipherable] then I woke up Annie, we went every night, we washed from top to bottom with ice cold water, but we keeped ourselves clean, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: You never had hot water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: No.</span> <span id="s1904">Hot water?</span> <span id="s1905">Oh God.</span> <span id="s1906">We were glad we had cold water to wash.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: So, back to Vienna after the war, it sounds like you spent a considerable amount of time in Italy, and then you had returned to Vienna on the weekends, and about how long did -- did this go on for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Every weekend for a long time, I went back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: And how long did you stay in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Italy I was a long time.</span> <span id="s1911">One year in Milan, and two years in Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: And were you happier living in Italy than Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Oh, I was happy in Italy, oh God.</span> <span id="s1914">I loved Italy so much.</span> <span id="s1915">Wonderful country, wonderful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Were you still thinking you might return to live in Vienna someday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Why would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: -- why did you know you didn’t want to live there any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Well, I wouldn’t want to go there.</span> <span id="s1922">I -- I told you I went there [indecipherable] I wouldn’t be there, no.</span> <span id="s1923">I was there once, after the war, on a trip to Europe.</span> <span id="s1924">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1926">Is it -- was it just not the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: I wouldn’t want it any more.</span> <span id="s1928">I -- first of all, I love a -- America.</span> <span id="s1929">United States, and I loved Italy.</span> <span id="s1930">But I hated Austria, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: After the war, when did you make contact again with your friend Ann Price -- Ann Green?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Well, she was with me all the time, for a long time.</span> <span id="s1933">But then we were separated.</span> <span id="s1934">And I, very soon, was liberated, but she still was not liberated where she was.</span> <span id="s1935">They had a selection, she went on transport, and I did remain.</span> <span id="s1936">That was the night where they gassed all the Gypsies, yeah.</span> <span id="s1937">Killed them, all the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Had you known some of them personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: So when did you meet up again with Ann after the war?</span> <span id="s1941">Was it in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1943">Was in Vienna, yeah.</span> <span id="s1944">She’s not from Vienna, you know, Ann Green.</span> <span id="s1945">She’s from the little town Noyen Kyrklund.</span> <span id="s1946">She’s not Viennese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: But it seems like at some point you -- you met up with her again, and you became good friends again, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s1949">She is much younger than I am, you know that.</span> <span id="s1950">She is 15 years younger than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: But it sounds like the two of you were very helpful to one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Do you think it’s largely because of that friendship that you were able to make it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1955">I told her, when we came to Auschwitz, and she came to me very upset, showing me she had in her panties, in the seams she did find a louse.</span> <span id="s1956">So I said to her, “Annie, listen to me, if I will take care of your lice, I will not be able to take care of mine.</span> <span id="s1957">You will not live and I will not live.</span> <span id="s1958">If you will listen to me and do whatever I tell you, maybe we will make it.”</span> <span id="s1959">And that how it was.</span> <span id="s1960">We went every night, I woke her up, let’s go and wash, because then the water was flowing.</span> <span id="s1961">We had never water when we came home from work.</span> <span id="s1962">But at night we had no towel, nothing.</span> <span id="s1963">But we were undressed, we washed from top to bottom, yeah, every night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Were there a lot of people who did not wa-wash so regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1966">Sure, there was no water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: So you made a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: [indecipherable] the selections, as you know, wi -- you were not -- you were not hundred percent clean, I mean clean your skin, they were afraid of sicknesses, and you were gassed, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: So you made a special effort to stay clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1971">I knew it’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Now it sounds like you and Ann have reminisced, you know, about your experiences together.</span> <span id="s1973">Do you often talk about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: No.</span> <span id="s1975">We sometimes laugh about, you know, there were funny things too, who happened.</span> <span id="s1976">So we speak about it, we laugh.</span> <span id="s1977">But we normally, no we don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Do you think it’s too difficult to talk about these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Sure, it’s still too difficult.</span> <span id="s1980">If you were in Auschwitz, you learn how to steal.</span> <span id="s1981">You know, everybody likes to survive.</span> <span id="s1982">So whatever you see you could steal, you steal.</span> <span id="s1983">You don’t have a bad conscious if you do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: What about your memories, even if you weren’t speaking out loud about them, do these memories come to you a lot of -- of these experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: No.</span> <span id="s1986">Sometimes I do think about it, but I didn’t think about it at all because my life was full, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s1987">I had a good life, I was happily married.</span> <span id="s1988">But now, sometimes I do remember, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Do you allow yourself to remember more, or do you try to block some of the memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: No, I still like to block them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: It’s just easier that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Now tell me about your journey coming to the U.S..</span> <span id="s1994">How is it that you came to the U.S., and when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: What happened is, I was in Italy, and there was my brother, who always wrote and said everybody’s here, everybody’s here.</span> <span id="s1996">No you -- why don’t you come, why don’t you come?</span> <span id="s1997">I was so happy in Italy, but then I went to [indecipherable] and I had rheumatic fever, I told you.</span> <span id="s1998">They had put 30,000 dollar down for me.</span> <span id="s1999">And then I went to the United States, and then I went here.</span> <span id="s2000">It happened my brother even didn’t -- excuse me -- live in the United States.</span> <span id="s2001">He was living in British West India.</span> <span id="s2002">Yeah, I had nobody here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: When did you arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: I wish I would remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: I see here that somebody wrote down 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: That’s could be, yeah.</span> <span id="s2007">That’s could be.</span> <span id="s2008">Yeah, 1950 fi -- I became a citizen 1955.</span> <span id="s2009">Must be nine -- 1950.</span> <span id="s2010">After five years you -- you become a citizen, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: I believe that’s right.</span> <span id="s2012">I’m not sure, maybe something was different at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: So, even though your brother wasn’t here, you decided to come to the U.S., why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Because he s -- said I should come.</span> <span id="s2016">And then my disappointment was terrible.</span> <span id="s2017">He was living in British West India.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: So where did you first arrive in the U.S.?</span> <span id="s2019">Did you take a -- a boat, and where did it -- where did --</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: No, I came with a displaced person, 1300 people on -- on boat with a [indecipherable] SS General Stewart, I think, yeah.</span> <span id="s2021">We were 1300, everybody was seasick.</span> <span id="s2022">Oh God, what a trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: And where did it arrive, where did it dock?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s2025">Came -- we arrive Thanksgiving, and we docked next day, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Was that in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Yeah, New York, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: And what did you do when you first got here, how did you adjust to this new life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: I started to think about that -- what I did.</span> <span id="s2030">I took a job, not in New York City, in Troy, yeah.</span> <span id="s2031">I took a job in Troy, New York, was by Albany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Were you on your own, or did you have any family or friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: I had friends, yeah, I had friends.</span> <span id="s2034">Have no family here.</span> <span id="s2035">My brother then was living in Venezuela -- no, my brother in British West India, my cousins in Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: As I se --</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: But I started to make money -- to earn money and I was happy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: What kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Whatever I could.</span> <span id="s2040">First of -- I was crocheting, and then came that I had no money left, that week was over, I hardly make money to pay my room.</span> <span id="s2041">And then I went and look for other job, and I got a job as [indecipherable] a whole -- they put together orders for custom jewelry, whole day on the ladder.</span> <span id="s2042">And the boss was terrible.</span> <span id="s2043">I made 30 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s2044">I paid 10 dollars for my room, and at that time, you know, five dollar, five cent coffee and a roll.</span> <span id="s2045">I did -- then I washed my hand in the evening, my boss came, and he’d give me my envelope, put his hand in here, and said don’t tell my wife, I just give you five dollar more.</span> <span id="s2046">I called my brother, and I said, “I am not going back any more.</span> <span id="s2047">But what will happen to me?”</span> <span id="s2048">He said, “You are in America.</span> <span id="s2049">Here you don’t have to go back.</span> <span id="s2050">If he asks you why aren’t you coming back, you could tell him, I don’t like the color of your hair.</span> <span id="s2051">There’s
