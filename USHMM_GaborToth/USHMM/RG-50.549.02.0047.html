Whoa.</span> <span id="s18">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Were you asking questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: This -- As you know, a follow up interview, it’s looking at really, the kind of post Holocaust years.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: I was curious, you said that you’re going to Disney World tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes, I am, for the third and last time, with my grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What did -- When you were a little kid in Budapest, could you have imagined that now, this many years later, this is what you’d be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No, I certainly did not.</span> <span id="s29">But I think that’s probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too, that you don’t really think what you’re going to do as an adult, or even the fact that you’re going to be grandparents.</span> <span id="s30">I mean, that’s very old people, and it’s very hard to think about.</span> <span id="s31">But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in Budapest with my father, going to, not Disneyland, but to playgrounds, and theme parks, in a very small way, that -- with roller coasters, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: [inaudible] . . . Is having a good time important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, i -- when you say important, yes it certainly is, I’d rather have a good time than a bad time, you know.</span> <span id="s34">Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family remain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Did the -- the going to the amusement park with your family as a child --</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: -- how did that stay with you during all of these quite un-amusing times you’ve had --</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: That always stayed with me.</span> <span id="s39">It’s really strange, because I know we’re going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding like a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how terribly it affected them afterwards.</span> <span id="s40">Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I’ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time.</span> <span id="s41">I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me.</span> <span id="s42">Of providing me with food when there wasn’t any to be had.</span> <span id="s43">I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat.</span> <span id="s44">And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s45">So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: You said they made up a fiction, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Did you see the movie, “Life is Beautiful”?</span> <span id="s48">The Italian film that won all the awards?</span> <span id="s49">A lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I think you would have had to see the movie to know what I’m talking about, but it’s -- when you see the movie, knowing it’s about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the movies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was in the wrong movie, because there was a comedy.</span> <span id="s50">It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place.</span> <span id="s51">And it was basically about a father protecting his child.</span> <span id="s52">I didn’t think it was trivialized at all.</span> <span id="s53">I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept.</span> <span id="s54">So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the United States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us.</span> <span id="s55">And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing.</span> <span id="s56">And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay.</span> <span id="s57">So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn’t, and I guess I didn’t.</span> <span id="s58">I don’t know if that makes any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s60">I -- Yo-You had said that you previously had been able -- your -- your mother had instructed you that if she said it was black, it was black, and you were not to question.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Right.</span> <span id="s62">That’s absolutely true.</span> <span id="s63">That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the street, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it’s very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it’s one thing, it’s -- if it’s -- yes, that’s absolutely -- that’s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn’t quite as difficult for me to deal with.</span> <span id="s64">You know, your -- you speak when you’re spoken to, and you don’t question a lot, and I don’t think today’s generation would get away with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Were there other instances where your mother -- where you had to comply with your mother when you knew she was not telling the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn’t a ma -- even a matter of complying, but she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember that very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran into a farmhouse, and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made me a cake, and it needed an egg.</span> <span id="s67">A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don’t remember all that well, but I don’t think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you’re hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn’t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever.</span> <span id="s68">I was 10 years old, so I didn’t go into it, in major, you know, depth.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Was it primarily your mother then, who shaped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s71">My father and I had a wonderful relationship.</span> <span id="s72">He was a very quiet and very loving man, very successful in business.</span> <span id="s73">My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, is that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don’t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn’t look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s74">He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing is -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify.</span> <span id="s75">So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone’s house, or were stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background.</span> <span id="s76">In -- You know, during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health.</span> <span id="s77">During -- Before the hiding, during the -- oi -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down to the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened, was he a strong presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s80">Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we went to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the closet, or the wall of my room, and every evening after he came home from the office, we would play a game of identifying capitals.</span> <span id="s81">Countries all over the world, and eventually rivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today.</span> <span id="s82">The fathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship.</span> <span id="s83">In some ways, I think I was probably closer to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Is he still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Is he still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No.</span> <span id="s88">He died when I was pregnant with my daughter, yeah.</span> <span id="s89">He was -- Actually, I was the last person that he saw.</span> <span id="s90">I went up to his office, in 1957, to show him my first batch of maternity clothes, and he died on the way home.</span> <span id="s91">He got on the Fifth Avenue bus to go home, lived on Riverside Drive, my mother’s still there, and he got off the bus, and he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Was he ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: He had a heart condition.</span> <span id="s94">I was really not even aware of how serious it was, I mean, he was in the office that day, he wasn’t home.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Are you still close to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, my mother is having a very hard time right now, actually.</span> <span id="s97">My mother is 87, and she has dementia.</span> <span id="s98">So, up to two years ago, she was in better health than most of my contemporaries, and actually, she still is, except for the fact that she gets very confused, she’s getting depressed.</span> <span id="s99">She still goes to the Philharmonic, she still goes to the opera.</span> <span id="s100">She lives at home, in the same apartment on Riverside Drive, but she’s aware that she’s not as well as she was, not physically, but mentally.</span> <span id="s101">They say -- I don’t know what the difference is, but they say it’s not Alzheimer’s, it’s dementia, she has aortic stenosis, which is a clogging of the main artery.</span> <span id="s102">Blood doesn’t flow to the brain too well, and she’s really scared, and it’s -- it’s really rough right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: The cake that you talked about, where she stole the egg.</span> <span id="s104">Do you eat cake today?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yeah, I love cake, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Yellow cake?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yellow cake, chocolate cake preferably, but when desperate, I’ll eat yellow cake.</span> <span id="s108">And I love apricot jam, that was -- that went in it, and one of the other things we used to do, since food was scarce, we used to have these -- you know these kielbasa, it’s like a hot dog, but it’s like a salami texture, and it’s very long and skinny, and I don’t know how we acquired a piece, and my mother would cut one tiny, tiny little wedge, or circle, and cut it up into many, many, many pay -- many pieces, and pretend that that was a sandwich, or a piece of bread with it on.</span> <span id="s109">But instead of like eating the whole thing, it was rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: You still eat that?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s112">The only thing that I don’t eat, which really was sent to us after the war by my grandfather when they would send us care packages, is Spam.</span> <span id="s113">And I had -- We had no clue.</span> <span id="s114">They would send us Spam, and they sent nail polish, that they -- we would sell, and I don’t know what other food product, but I adored ham, and the Spam had that kind of a taste.</span> <span id="s115">And we had, you know, never seen canned products before, so that was my very favorite, and I must tell you, when we came here, and I said Spam, everybody looked at me like thi -- and I always meant to buy Spam, and it’s sort of like buying the “Enquirer,” you’re embarrassed to buy it, but you look at -- over somebody’s shoulder at the checkout counter.</span> <span id="s116">But I’ve never bought it, and I always wondered if I bought it, what it would taste like today, but that was the only thing that I ate then, and I have not eaten since.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: So clearly you didn’t keep kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No.</span> <span id="s119">No, we were definitely -- I guess by Stateside standards, we would be Reform, but there it was Conservative.</span> <span id="s120">We sat separately, but it was -- we were not kosher, we did not speak Yiddish, my grandparents didn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s121">We were definitely assimilated upper middle class Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Do you think that helped you when you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: You know, it’s very hard to say.</span> <span id="s124">You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that they’re in, and they don’t say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or lived in -- I don’t know, the lower east side, or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s125">I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food.</span> <span id="s126">You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren’t poor.</span> <span id="s127">But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high school, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner.</span> <span id="s128">And we didn’t.</span> <span id="s129">We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don’t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn’t starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were.</span> <span id="s130">So, you know, I don’t know what it would have been like.</span> <span id="s131">I think I assimilated very quickly.</span> <span id="s132">We got here in the spring of ’47, and I went to a very fancy girl’s camp in Maine, that my daughter subsequently went to, that’s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they’d be going there.</span> <span id="s133">And then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School, and Hunter College.</span> <span id="s134">And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends.</span> <span id="s135">I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half.</span> <span id="s136">I started with one language and finished with the other with my parents.</span> <span id="s137">I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they certainly spoke it well enough.</span> <span id="s138">And I married an American, and I had absolutely no reason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I would have assimilated differently, or not as easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you think of yourself as Jewish now?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Absolutely, I always have.</span> <span id="s141">We converted for a short time, strictly for acquiring papers that they -- they thought may have saved our lives.</span> <span id="s142">It probably wouldn’t have, but in those days you did everything that you could to -- just in case.</span> <span id="s143">Several of my parents friends, when they came here, remained whatever religion they converted to, and raised their children, whatever they were.</span> <span id="s144">I --I’m -- You know, I know them, but I -- they weren’t -- I was not friendly with them, so I don’t know if they were Catholic, or Protestant, or what they converted to, I really don’t know, but one of my mother’s friend’s son is a minister.</span> <span id="s145">So -- And a lot of them intermarried.</span> <span id="s146">I married twice, both Jewish.</span> <span id="s147">I’ve always belonged to a synagogue, we always observed the holidays -- holy days.</span> <span id="s148">My daughter was Confirmed, and married by a rabbi, and they are really quite -- well they’re -- they belong to a Reform synagogue also, but they are a very traditional Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: What kind of synagogue do you belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Here?</span> <span id="s151">Temple Emmanuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s154">But you know, it’s interesting, because my grandfather, and grandmother, who came here in 1939 joined Temple Emmanuel, because it was very much like the synagogue we belonged to in Budapest.</span> <span id="s155">Have you ever been?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: To Budapest?</span> <span id="s157">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, the synagogue, it’s not a shul, I mean it’s -- you know, everybody always things eastern Europe has these little Orthodox shuls.</span> <span id="s161">This is the biggest synagogue in Europe, and I think the second biggest in the world, it is huge.</span> <span id="s162">It’s very impressive looking, it’s probably not all that different looking than Emmanuel, maybe a little bit smaller.</span> <span id="s163">You do sit separately, and it is Conservative, so they do wear talisses, it’s -- you know, I don’t think they do at Emmanuel.</span> <span id="s164">But it’s not by any means Orthodox, or -- and as I said, I left when I was 13, so I didn’t go to Hebrew school or anything there.</span> <span id="s165">And my grandfather joined Temple Emmanuel, so when we came here, he started taking us to services there.</span> <span id="s166">And as I got o -- you know, older, and I was married, I got my own membership, and I was Confirmed.</span> <span id="s167">No, my -- my parents were there also, and I was Confirmed there.</span> <span id="s168">And -- And my daughter was raised there, went through Hebrew school, and was Confirmed there, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Was it important to you that she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s171">I would have been very upset if hadn’t married one.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Sounds like “Fiddler on the Roof,” but tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Was it important to your family that you marry a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I don’t think it ever came up.</span> <span id="s176">I don’t think I ever dated anyone who wasn’t, and except for one young man who was absolutely gorgeous, that my daughter dated, a very, very bright young man, she only dated Jewish boys, too.</span> <span id="s177">So, I really don’t -- I don’t know if it was just the circle of friends that I traveled with was limited, I don’t know, I mean I -- I never dated anyone who wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: I want to get to that -- that part in a little bit.</span> <span id="s179">I want to go over some of the things from the -- the past story, and then come up closer to the present.</span> <span id="s180">Yo-You -- You just talked recently about how you always did what you were told, that you’d -- you’d been told not to question.</span> <span id="s181">Is that still something that you do, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Mm-hm, yes, probably.</span> <span id="s183">I mean, not to that extent, but yes.</span> <span id="s184">And I really get annoyed with it sometimes, cause I still -- I think I was brought up that way.</span> <span id="s185">I mean, it had nothing to do with the war, I was brought up, you know, parents, teachers, God, you know, all that is up there, and you don’t question, and you do, and -- and respect, and when your parents tell you something, you do.</span> <span id="s186">You stand up when older people come into the room, I still do, even though I’m older.</span> <span id="s187">And very often, with older people, I find that I talk to them like I was a child.</span> <span id="s188">So I think there’s a little bit, you know, of that still in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What do you mean talk to them like [indecipherable] child?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: With that kind of respect.</span> <span id="s191">That when I do, I realize that, you know, I’m -- I’m a grown-up.</span> <span id="s192">And I think it’s interesting, because I’ve been married twice, and I -- I think I imposed the role on myself, of the t -- the traditional wife.</span> <span id="s193">Make breakfast, cut the bananas, put out the cereal, you know, kind of stuff, and it just the way it was, and just the way I did it.</span> <span id="s194">I -- I think at some point I questioned it.</span> <span id="s195">Sometimes I get annoyed with the fact that I’m still doing it, but I do anyhow.</span> <span id="s196">And it’s okay, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What about your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Oh my -- It’s -- It’s interesting, you know, I was going to give you a quick answer.</span> <span id="s199">She really is a traditional wife, much more so -- my daughter is very, very bright.</span> <span id="s200">She and her husband met in law school.</span> <span id="s201">She practiced for about 10 years, and she has three children.</span> <span id="s202">She worked part time after the first one was born, at the law firm, and went back after a second child, and then she realized that she really didn’t want to be doing this, and she really wanted to be with her children.</span> <span id="s203">And even though she does work part time now, sh -- it just happens -- she lives in Connecticut, and she works for Yankelovich Group, which is a big market research firm, they happened to be in Westport, and she just kind of lucked out with a good offer.</span> <span id="s204">But she works part time, strictly at her own hours, and she’s definitely a homemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What’s your daughter’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Lisa.</span> <span id="s208">Did you raise Lisa to do -- to agree with you, and not to question you?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No.</span> <span id="s210">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s211">I don’t know if she would agree.</span> <span id="s212">Actually, in many ways, even though her children are very different -- well, first of all they’re three boys, which is a very different thing than one daughter, and times are different, and what fashionable is different.</span> <span id="s213">I don’t mean fashionable clothes-wise, but behavior-wise.</span> <span id="s214">But I think in many ways, she still is quite traditional, but not to the extent I -- when they were first married, and I saw my son-in-law taking his shirts to the laundry, I was appalled, and I was -- I just say, w -- you know, this is what you’re supposed to be doing, and she gave me a look like, you know, they’re his shirts.</span> <span id="s215">And you know, so -- but it was a very small thing, and I think my son-in-law’s a wonderful father, and I think with the children it’s definitely more of a joint venture than it was .</span> <span id="s216">My ex-husband was a very good father, but i-it -- it was more the roles, you know, I was at home, and had dinner ready, and the baby bathed, and all that, and he did a lot of stuff with her, because I think in our generation, I think that was becoming more of the thing, but they were the -- th -- they made the money, and I mean, you know, they had to go to work.</span> <span id="s217">Somebody had to go to work, and somebody had to stay home.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: You went to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I went to college, and I taught -- I -- I was a teacher.</span> <span id="s220">I was home for the first six or seven years.</span> <span id="s221">And I must tell you, I wouldn’t have traded it for the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What did you teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Well, I started out with elementary school, and -- and I went back to school -- I went back for my Master’s when I was 40, and got a degree in special education.</span> <span id="s224">That was a fairly new degree they were giving, and I just kind of fell into it in public school.</span> <span id="s225">I substituted in a couple of special ed classes, and I didn’t have a clue what I was doing, but I really liked it, and I went back for my Master’s, and then I taught special ed.</span> <span id="s226">But I truly and truly believe that when you have children, when they’re little, you’re missing out on a great deal if you’re not with them.</span> <span id="s227">And so are the children.</span> <span id="s228">And it was interesting, this has nothing to do with the Holocaust, but I was watching Larry King yesterday, and Mary Tyler Moore was interviewed, and she said that was the one thing, if she had to do it all over again, she would have been home.</span> <span id="s229">I think she lost her child.</span> <span id="s230">There were a lot of tragedies there.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t even know if she has any now, but I think her child either OD’d, or something bad happened.</span> <span id="s232">I don’t know, I don’t remember what it was, but she was very adamant about it, and almost teary, that you owe your children, if you have them, to spend time with them.</span> <span id="s233">And you can’t have it all, and I think that’s really true.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: It certainly seems like your parents did that with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Well, my parents it was dif -- first of all, it was different.</span> <span id="s236">This was in Europe, I mean, that was a whole different world.</span> <span id="s237">Yes, the mothers were home.</span> <span id="s238">I mean, I had a nanny, and I had a housekeeper, and I had a cook.</span> <span id="s239">Not I, but my family, but my parents were always there, I was -- no question in my mind who -- you know, who was the help, and who were my parents, those -- al-although I loved all my -- most of my nannies.</span> <span id="s240">But that was, you know, like playtime stuff.</span> <span id="s241">But then my mother, after the war, took over my grandfather’s business, and after my father died -- my mother’s a very competent woman, I mean she -- she was not a career person, but she’s extremely bright and capable, when she had to run the business she did.</span> <span id="s242">I mean, when the war broke out, my mother didn’t know how to cook or clean or do any of those things, but that’s not how proper young ladies were raised.</span> <span id="s243">But let me tell you, within a very short time, she became a very good cook, she’s bi -- very good laundress.</span> <span id="s244">I don’t know how to iron, she does.</span> <span id="s245">So, some people just, you know, when you have to, you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: [indecipherable] this puppy.</span> <span id="s248">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Are you -- Are you comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: I’m fine, thanks.</span> <span id="s251">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Eva Cooper.</span> <span id="s252">This is tape number one, side B. Okay.</span> <span id="s253">Still a finicky eater?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s255">But I love chocolate.</span> <span id="s256">Yeah, I’ve always been a finicky eater, really was terrible.</span> <span id="s257">I don’t know how I stayed alive during the war, cause I used to have a stupid habit of smelling things before I would eat it, when I wasn’t sure what it was, cause there was -- there was a lot of yucky stuff being served, is the understatement.</span> <span id="s258">But there were a lot of dead animals on the -- on the streets, and people would get meat from horses and dogs, and that did not appeal to me, so I would only eat what I like, and I still only eat what I like.</span> <span id="s259">Course, I like a lot of things now, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did it turn you into a vegetarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s262">And I like pork, too.</span> <span id="s263">I don’t know if I should mention that for the Holocaust museum.</span> <span id="s264">But you see again, interesting, I mean, in Europe, in eastern Europe, we ate ham, we ate pork.</span> <span id="s265">It was -- you know, I never really realized any of that til I came here.</span> <span id="s266">I didn’t know about bagels, I didn’t know about Yiddish.</span> <span id="s267">This was all, you know, new to me, when we came here.</span> <span id="s268">And neither did my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Wasn’t that partly a class thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: In Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: The Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: The English?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s275">You know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s276">I mean, I just know how I was raised, and I -- I don’t think I even knew anybody that was Orthodox there, you know, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s277">W-W-We belonged to this one Temple that’s -- everybody goes to visit now when they’re in -- in Budapest, I didn’t know anybody from anywhere else.</span> <span id="s278">And it -- the other thing that was interesting is I went to a public school, and before the war, religious education was part of the public school education, and during that period you had English, whatever, geography, history, math, whatever, and then it was religion, and the Catholic kids went to their class, and Jewish kids went to their class, and it was, you know, history of -- of the religion.</span> <span id="s279">Actually, my very closest friend in Hungary was a Catholic girl, who I tried very hard to get out here.</span> <span id="s280">I wrote to the Cardinal and all that, but then I lost track of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Have you been back to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, actually, I’ve been back to Budapest oh, many, many years ago the first time, second time 20 years ago, and last year it was the best of all, my husband and I took our oldest grandson, that’s my daughter’s oldest son, who had just been Bar Mitzvahed, and we took him to London and Budapest.</span> <span id="s283">And it was really great.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did you show him where Grandma grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I certainly did.</span> <span id="s286">We went to the synagogue, we went to, you know, all the places I used to visit.</span> <span id="s287">We went out to the playgrounds, and where I used to ice skate, and went to hear Gypsy music, we went to the opera.</span> <span id="s288">We didn’t stay there too long, it was ballet, and a 13 year old boy is not heavy into ballet.</span> <span id="s289">But I just wanted him to see it.</span> <span id="s290">The music was lovely, and we -- actually I said, let’s go, and we can leave at intermission, which we did.</span> <span id="s291">And we went to hear -- went to see folk dancing, Hungarian folk dancing, and so it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What emotions did that bring up for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Oh, it was just -- I mean, it’s hard to describe, it was -- and he really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s294">Just before it was time to go, I thought to myself, I must be out of my mind, I mean here we are grandparents, he’s 13, he’s going to want to watch basketball game, and you know, look for his friends, and here I’m schlepping him, you know -- actually Budapest was his idea, and since we had like eight days, I thought, you know, that’s a bit much, and it was a great combination.</span> <span id="s295">He of all my grandchildren, was the only one that’s really been interested in my history, and the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s296">I’ve taken him several times to Washington.</span> <span id="s297">We were there for the opening.</span> <span id="s298">We’ve been there f -- at the capital, where they have the ceremony for the Holocaust, and he’s asked me many times to tell my story.</span> <span id="s299">When he was quite little, he invited me to Holocaust week at his public school, first grade class, and second grade class, as well as his Sunday school class.</span> <span id="s300">So I have gone and spoken to the kids, and stuff, and I bought him books on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s301">So he’s read a lot, and is quite interested.</span> <span id="s302">The other two are not particularly interested.</span> <span id="s303">Actually, my daughter took them to see “Life is Beautiful,” and -- and after that, my other two grandchildren sort of said, you know, what was it like for me, but it was -- took a -- s -- one sentence to answer, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How old are your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: The oldest one is now 14, and the next one is 12.</span> <span id="s306">The little one’s nine.</span> <span id="s307">And my husband has three children, and tho -- and they’re five -- five more on that side, but they were all born since we’re married, so we really -- they’re -- call them my grandchildren as well.</span> <span id="s308">So they’re eight all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It seems like you really identify yourself as a Holocaust survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s311">But probably more so since the Hidden Children conference.</span> <span id="s312">And, of course, the museum.</span> <span id="s313">I always -- I -- oh, this was years ago, when they were planning -- building the initial plans to build the Holocaust Museum, there was also one built in New York, and I know this sounds silly, but I wanted to give a major contribution, and I sort of went and interviewed both the Washington people, and New York people, and -- and made a decision, because I support the one in New York a bit, but there was something about the Washington.</span> <span id="s314">I thought if I was going to give one chunk of money, I’d rather g -- do it one place.</span> <span id="s315">And so we went -- we went to Washington to see the original plans, and they were in the office, and I went with my mother, and then I went back with my daughter, we went to the hard hat -- th -- walkthrough when the museum was being built.</span> <span id="s316">And so that’s -- was sort of -- I mean, I’ve never had a problem, or thought about not being Jewish, but somehow the Holocaust was a long time ago.</span> <span id="s317">I didn’t remain in contact with any of the Hungarians, or Holocaust survivors, so that my life kind of went on it’s own merry way.</span> <span id="s318">Every once in a while, people will ask me -- the first year that I went to camp -- and I told this on my video, I was like the token refugee, and it’s really funny, cause I’m friendly with a lot of my bunkmates, and they always tease me about my accent, and -- at the time, and about being a -- the token refugee in camp.</span> <span id="s319">That was -- I thought it would be harder than it turned out to be, and I was very lucky, because I was literally shipped from having just arrived here at the age of 13, to this very American camp, with baseball, and I asked them what those pillows were doing on the baseball field.</span> <span id="s320">And I was different, you know.</span> <span id="s321">I wore hand en -- embroidered undershirts, and I wrote home that they immediately should send me a bra.</span> <span id="s322">And that was definitely European kid, and there’s a very big difference.</span> <span id="s323">But I was very lucky, I had some nice friends, and I somehow fit in.</span> <span id="s324">I think they picked on somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Did you speak any English when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s327">And I tur -- I turned out awhile later, that the director of the camp gave my bunk a speech on how to be nice to me, because I might be different, and may not speak English so well, I may not know everything they know.</span> <span id="s328">And 13 is late to start camp, they had all been there before, they -- some of them had had friends, and -- but I didn’t know about that til later, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Why did your parents decide to send you to camp right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Well, we had relatives here, and tha -- actually, these people had honeymooned in -- in Budapest, and looked up my parents because they were related somehow or other.</span> <span id="s331">And they had a daughter who was couple of years younger than I, and they spoke to them, and they said, “Well, what -- what do you do here during the summer?”</span> <span id="s332">And they said, “Well, New York gets pretty hot, and most kids do something, or have a ha -- something.”</span> <span id="s333">I don’t really know exactly what the conversation was all about, but next thing they were -- this lady came over and showed us pictures of a camp, and I got camp clothes, and went off to cam, that’s how.</span> <span id="s334">And the cousin, whose daughter went to this camp that I was sent to, had nothing to do with me, and she was two years younger than I, and at that age it’s like a generation.</span> <span id="s335">I mean, even nine months, 10 months, is -- is a big deal.</span> <span id="s336">But, that she was in a different bunk, and she wasn’t going to have anything to do with me, so -- I’m friendly with her now, but we weren’t for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Given the -- the time that you and your -- your parents were kind of camping out as it -- as it -- in -- in effect, when you were fleeing --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: -- [indecipherable] you were with lots of other families and stuff, why would your family send you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Hm.</span> <span id="s341">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s342">I hadn’t really thought about it.</span> <span id="s343">The war ended in ’45, this was in ’47.</span> <span id="s344">I think my parents wanted me to assimilate, and I think they thought this would be a good way for me to become an American teenager.</span> <span id="s345">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s346">I have no clue.</span> <span id="s347">I -- I had no problem going.</span> <span id="s348">I had a wonderful time, I went back two years.</span> <span id="s349">I still have a lot of close friends from camp.</span> <span id="s350">My daughter went to the same camp.</span> <span id="s351">So, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s352">I mean, somebody else might have handled it differently, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s353">My parents had the opportunity to send me to a monastery to be taken care of by nuns, during the war time, and then they made the decision to stay together.</span> <span id="s354">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: How important -- It -- It seems like that was so key to your family, that the three of you --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: -- stay together.</span> <span id="s358">Has that been important to you, when you had a child too, that you stay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span> <span id="s360">Yeah, and we did, I mean, until -- until she went off to college, and then subsequently got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You talk on the previous tape about your 10th birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Oh yes, my 10th birthday.</span> <span id="s363">That’s when the Germans marched in, yeah, that was quite a birthday.</span> <span id="s364">I still like hot dogs, that’s what we had then.</span> <span id="s365">That’s what we had for my birthday party, hot dogs, frankfurters.</span> <span id="s366">Not served on buns.</span> <span id="s367">And we had a -- an apartment in the city, kind of a wide boulevard kind of a street, and we were all sitting around, lot of nannies, and mothers, and daughters, and we heard noises, like marching noises.</span> <span id="s368">And we looked out the window, and the Nazis were marching into Budapest.</span> <span id="s369">Hungary was the last country to be taken over, and I remember everybody very quietly saying, “It’s time to go home.”</span> <span id="s370">And I was not happy, cause they messed up my party.</span> <span id="s371">And it -- you know, also, interestingly enough in those days, parents did not find it necessary to explain everything to their children.</span> <span id="s372">I mean, they were going home, that’s it, you know.</span> <span id="s373">That’s -- Was nothing to question, and you didn’t, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: How do you feel about birthdays now?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Oh, I love birthdays, I just had my husband’s 70th birthday, and surprised him, we took the whole family to Las Vegas for the weekend.</span> <span id="s376">So that answers your question.</span> <span id="s377">Yeah, I like birthdays.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: You don’t have any baggage about your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Still eat hot dogs on your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, but I still eat hot dogs.</span> <span id="s382">Actually, I’ve stopped because of cholesterol, but my favorite lunch is a [indecipherable] hot dog and fresh orange juice on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: It sounds like you were pretty enterprising when you were a little kid, with the -- taking the cigarette butts, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: -- [indecipherable] things.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: But I don’t smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: No, no, I never did actually.</span> <span id="s389">I smoked one evening with -- with a friend of mine that I went to junior high school with, that was my next closest friend, right after camp, I went to junior high school, eighth grade, on the west side, and -- and she’s still -- we’re still very good friends.</span> <span id="s390">We were in her parents bedroom, and we smoked a cigarette.</span> <span id="s391">This was, I think 14.</span> <span id="s392">Her mother came in and pretended she didn’t know, cause we stuck the cigarettes under the bed, but the room was filled with smoke.</span> <span id="s393">And I hated it, I was like choking, and my eyes were bothering me.</span> <span id="s394">I said, “This is a stupid thing to do.”</span> <span id="s395">But it was grown up, which is I think what a lot of young people s -- got hooked on it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: But when you did that as a -- as a small child, when you and your -- your boyfriend, I guess it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: -- did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I have to call him.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: -- i-in -- in New York, as you know, we would call that working the angles.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Is that something that you carried over as an adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No, I don’t think so, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s404">I mean, I think that’s probably -- most of it was his idea, and I kind of went along with it.</span> <span id="s405">He’s a year older, he lives in Toronto.</span> <span id="s406">I don’t know, it just seemed like a fun thing to do, it kept us busy.</span> <span id="s407">We all were aware of the fact that our fathers weren’t working.</span> <span id="s408">We thought that this would be an income situation, and everybody was delighted.</span> <span id="s409">I mean, they were very -- there were no cigarettes to be had, a lot of people smoked, my parents did not.</span> <span id="s410">And it was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Were your parents worried about money at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: But you just had a sense that you needed to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s415">I was never worried about money, I mean, I was never worried about money when we didn’t have any, and I was never worried about it when we did, you know, it all -- and it was -- it was never really a major issue.</span> <span id="s416">My parents were very good about -- I -- I don’t know, i-it’s hard to explain.</span> <span id="s417">I think, for my mother, it was very important to have proper appearances, and contrary to a lot of people during the war, who had holes and stuff in their clothes, and I’d -- I al -- I remember that very clearly, there was -- there were never any holes in anything, it was always mended.</span> <span id="s418">When I outgrew the dress, my mother would take from another dress, and lengthen it.</span> <span id="s419">This is when the war was going on, and shortly after when there -- first there was nothing to buy, and no material, no money, you know, and all that, but I remember always looking clean and neat, and you know, the war was not a reason to not behave properly, and not to look nice.</span> <span id="s420">And it’s funny, because I said that to my husband just recently, and it sort of -- you look at some of these old war pictures, how people were going to concentration camp with suits and ties and hats.</span> <span id="s421">It’s funny, I was watching -- we were watching “Roman Holiday,” -- oh, “Three Coins in a Fountain” last night, and I said to my husband that I think I was in the wrong generation because Louis Jordan looks so wonderful, and here they’re walking around in ridiculous places, and he’s in double breasted suits, and a tie, and she has gloves on, and a hat.</span> <span id="s422">And, you know, he opens doors, and I said, you know, always walking around now in jeans and khakis, sort of, you know, casual, because that’s the world we live in, but I think I kind of like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: So if you could, you would -- you would wear gloves to go out, and hats, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Well, maybe not gloves, but yeah, I mean I kind of like -- I can go either way, I’ve always said that.</span> <span id="s425">I mean, I’d have no problem having tea with the queen, or camping out in jeans.</span> <span id="s426">You know, I -- I’m fairly comfortable wherever you -- you put me, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: One of the things that you said in the previous tape was that you need to know where you’re sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes, that I still do.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t like going anywhere, and not having a reservation, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s430">And I mean it’s -- it -- it’s -- I’m not scared the way I was, and I know where it’s coming from, and if I didn’t, I probably wouldn’t, you know, have a nervous breakdown, but I know a couple of years ago, we were coming back, I don’t know, from Boston or someplace, and we couldn’t get in somewhere, you know, just at a hotel, a motel, whatever on the road, because it was getting late.</span> <span id="s431">And I really was -- it made me uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s432">So, that should be the worst thing, you know.</span> <span id="s433">I still like traveling with my pillow.</span> <span id="s434">I still do, really.</span> <span id="s435">Actually, I was just thinking, tomorrow with the two children, with carry-ons, if I’ve got room for my pillow, but I’m going to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Why the pillow?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Because that’s the one thing I took with me.</span> <span id="s438">You know, like little children have blankies and all these things, I had my pillow.</span> <span id="s439">And I had that same pillow for many, many years.</span> <span id="s440">It’s gone, I mean the feathers, or whatever was in there is gone, but I always liked having my own pillow.</span> <span id="s441">I think it’s not for the reasons any more, I -- I don’t sleep so -- as well as I did, and most hotels have these awful foam rubber things, so I d -- I don’t think it’s anything to do with the war, I just -- I don’t sleep well, and if I -- if I have a bad pillow, I’m really up all night, so I like to take my soft, cuddly pillow.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Down pillow?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s444">Yeah, and it really mooshes up sort of small, so I can, you know, stick in into a duffel, and carry it.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Do you have the pillowcase from your childhood pillow?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No.</span> <span id="s447">No, I don’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you take it with you to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No.</span> <span id="s450">Well, I didn’t do any of the packing, so no.</span> <span id="s451">Actually, my grandson was Bar Mitzv -- was -- when he was born and -- and circumcised, he wore my grandfather’s little dress that my mother had saved.</span> <span id="s452">I have no clue how we got through a war, and my mother brought stuff.</span> <span id="s453">I mean, it’s mind boggling now that I’m going over a lot of the things, it’s just amazing, the pictures and things that she has, that you think would have stayed there.</span> <span id="s454">So -- But she has a lot -- you know, a lot of stuff, pre-war.</span> <span id="s455">She has calendars and date books from 50 - 60 years ago, that she sent here after the war, so -- I mean, they all came on a boat or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So she had put things aside for when you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s458">It all got shipped, we shipped all our furniture, and dishes, and all that kind of stuff, so whatever was packed, is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So, in a sense you’ve created part, at least, of your physical life.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s461">Oh yeah, I mean some of the furniture my parents had to sell, because it didn’t fit into any apartments here, because the rooms were big, the ceilings were high, and you know, all that.</span> <span id="s462">But my mother’s bedroom, dining room, living room, is all the European furniture.</span> <span id="s463">And it’s very European looking, except it has wall to wall carpets, instead of rugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So when you go visit your mother, you see part of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s466">And actually, my father had a beautiful desk that my mother sold after he died, and I was always sorry.</span> <span id="s467">It was a beautiful desk, I never -- I really don’t know why she sold it.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: When you go see that furniture, do you then ever go back in your mind to when you were a little girl?</span> <span id="s469">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yeah, I sort of remember our old apartment, but you know, it’s -- it’s -- I think it’s fading a little.</span> <span id="s471">Sometimes I don’t know if I remember the real thing, or if I remember stories or pictures, you know.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, as I told you, I’ve been married twice, and I would have been married 44 years all together, and every time I bought new dishes, I’ve always bought it kind of half-heartedly, because my favorite dishes, my mother has.</span> <span id="s473">And I always sort of in back of my head, knew that one of these days, hopefully the far away, those would be mine, so why should I bother?</span> <span id="s474">I mean, I’ve perfectly nice dishes, but I -- I just love her Haron dishes, which is Hungarian.</span> <span id="s475">And she has all, I think place setting for 24, and the whole thing, so -- and that all was sent over, crystal and all that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: [indecipherable] nice things is important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s478">I mean, it’s funny, cause now that my mother is not well, you sort of think about what happens if, and you know, I’ve thought about some of the things that she has, and you know, it’s a different lifestyle, and I don’t know how -- if I’d have any room, but there’s a grandfather’s clock that I really love, and that’s sort of my -- the only thing that’s really my childhood.</span> <span id="s479">I mean, otherwise it’s just nice furniture, but -- and it’s old and it’s beautiful, but it’s not something -- but the clock is like, sort of my childhood.</span> <span id="s480">It’s a grandfather’s clock, drives you nuts, chimes every 15 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: When you were in hiding, did time take on a different meaning for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Did time take on a different meaning?</span> <span id="s483">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s484">I mean, had days and nights, you know, and they were long.</span> <span id="s485">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s486">I really can’t answer that.</span> <span id="s487">I know I -- I don’t -- we didn’t have beds, we usually slept on the floor on things, and I was always in the middle, between my parents.</span> <span id="s488">I’m an only child.</span> <span id="s489">We had to go to the bathroom outside, so that was a big deal.</span> <span id="s490">I don’t know, I -- I think they all -- there was always something to a-amuse me.</span> <span id="s491">The -- Sometimes there were other children, depending on where we were.</span> <span id="s492">I don’t know, I -- I don’t really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: When you came to this country, when your parents decided to come, did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Oh yes, there was a lot of packing going on.</span> <span id="s495">We were -- It was sort of on again, off again.</span> <span id="s496">My grandparents were here, and my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s497">My uncle, my mother’s brother, also had come, in 1941 to visit his parents, and stayed, and actually joined the American army, and came to see us in Budapest after the war, part of the liberation.</span> <span id="s498">So we were coming as vi -- on a visitor visa, but sort of planning to stay, and so we pa -- they packed, I mean, we had packers, and marked things, and all that.</span> <span id="s499">So that’s how come all the furniture.</span> <span id="s500">Not everything we packed came, cause they confiscated stuff.</span> <span id="s501">My father’s paintings, library paintings, we had a Steinway Baby Grand, that didn’t show up, it’s just as well.</span> <span id="s502">But all the, you know, dishes, and personal stuff, and furniture came.</span> <span id="s503">So I was definitely aware wi -- this boy -- my boyfriend who’s in Toronto, he gave me a charm that I still have, went to the train to see us off, and another -- my other friend gave me a charm, and it was an adventure.</span> <span id="s504">I don’t remember being terribly sad about the whole thing, we -- we were traveling.</span> <span id="s505">After the war, my mother and I went to Switzerland and met my grandfather, and then came back, and we came -- we went to Liverpool, and we took a beautiful Cuinard boat, the Mauritania, which doesn’t exist any more, but it’s -- it was a beautiful boat, was very fancy.</span> <span id="s506">I had a wonderful time calling for room service, and running around.</span> <span id="s507">My mother was quite ill, she got seasick and she didn’t wear all the nice clothes that she had planned to wear.</span> <span id="s508">And so I spent a lot of time with my father.</span> <span id="s509">Saw lots of good movies, Joan Crawford.</span> <span id="s510">And then when we got here, my grandfather was here, and my uncle, who had married, and I’m very, very close to -- well, she was at the time nine -- 20 years old, so -- but I was 13, but we, you know, really very close friends.</span> <span id="s511">And as I said, I assimilated very, very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: What charms did your fr -- did your friends give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: One little gold charm -- charm -- well, I had a charm bracelet, and it just says, Thomas -- to Eva, and Tommy, that was his name.</span> <span id="s514">And we talk occasionally, because his mother and my mother were best friends.</span> <span id="s515">So were our fathers, but they all -- they died, and his mother is -- is in a nursing home.</span> <span id="s516">She -- Her mind is fine, and physically she’s a disaster, with my mother it’s the other way around.</span> <span id="s517">But my mother is very, very close to Tom.</span> <span id="s518">Actually, throughout all these years, they stayed closer.</span> <span id="s519">We talk, but it’s usually about our mothers, because his life sort of went in a different direction.</span> <span id="s520">He’s married, but he’s separated, he’s -- doesn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s521">He’s very European.</span> <span id="s522">And -- And I’m really beca -- you know, assimilated, much more so.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Are you an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Me?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: So what was the other charm that you were given?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: The other charm was from -- that was silver, this one was gold, was just a little -- plain, little silver charm from my friend, the Catholic girl, actually, that I told you about, Gloria was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Do you look at these charms?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s531">I don’t wear them, but yes I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: What kinds of memories does that bring up for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Oh, wonderful memories.</span> <span id="s534">And actually, with my Hidden Children group, a number of years ago, this woman walks into my apartment -- and most of the woman are from the New York area, and she was in -- oh, that’s my husband, I didn’t tell him you were coming.</span> <span id="s535">Oh, that’s all right, he’s going that way.</span> <span id="s536">Came from Boston, so she was like visiting our group, and she looked at me, she said, “What was your maiden name?”</span> <span id="s537">So I said, “Brust.”</span> <span id="s538">She says, “You don’t remember me?”</span> <span id="s539">I said, “I haven’t got a clue.”</span> <span id="s540">Well, I think she may have known in advance.</span> <span id="s541">Anyhow, we went to grade school together, and I found my -- what do you call that thing you sign in school?</span> <span id="s542">Not a memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: A yearbook?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No, it’s not a yearbook, it’s, you know, roses are red, violets are blue, you sign this little autograph -- isn’t it an autograph book?</span> <span id="s545">It’s got a name.</span> <span id="s546">It’s not a yearbook, it’s just blanks, and -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: This is tape two, side A, interview with Eva Cooper.</span> <span id="s548">Okay, so you saw this autograph book.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yeah, and she had written in it.</span> <span id="s550">It was really bizarre.</span> <span id="s551">And then, of course, we went through the whole thing, and there were a lot of, you know, it wa -- I mean, this Tommy from Toronto is in there, too.</span> <span id="s552">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Okay, so you came -- you were on this luxury liner, coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: What did you think you would find here?</span> <span id="s556">Do you remember, back then?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: My grandfather, my uncle.</span> <span id="s558">I don’t -- I didn’t really, you know, think about it all that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes, saw the Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I don’t -- Everybody was sort of making a big fuss about it, I don’t think I really knew too much about what it was.</span> <span id="s563">I remember getting up early, and -- as the boat came in.</span> <span id="s564">We went to -- My grandfather and grandmother, when they first came here -- she died, but he stayed there, stayed at a residential hotel on 96th Street and West End Avenue, called the Marcy.</span> <span id="s565">The place is still there, but it’s not a residential hotel any more, and so my grandfather took a small apartment for us there.</span> <span id="s566">So that’s where we started out.</span> <span id="s567">I didn’t think that was so great.</span> <span id="s568">I mean, you know, it was a small apartment, and -- but there was an ice skating ring across the street, and a tennis court.</span> <span id="s569">It was a city thing, but it changed, you know, winter and summer.</span> <span id="s570">And then, as I said, I -- within a month or two, I was gone, in camp, and then I started junior high school.</span> <span id="s571">That apartment was really very small, was like a one bedroom apartment, and then we moved into a -- another residential hotel k-kind of a thing on 86th Street.</span> <span id="s572">That’s still there, it’s called the Brewster Hotel, and that’s when I started junior high school [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s573">And my parents were looking for an apartment, and waiting for the furniture to come out.</span> <span id="s574">Oh no, the furniture went to Manhattan storage, but we didn’t have an apartment, and was very hard to find one.</span> <span id="s575">I don’t know if it had to do with size or money, but you know, we was definitely staying in Manhattan, in a nice neighborhood, so -- but I -- you know, I didn’t know where one would go, or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Did your uncle and grandfather meet you at the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yeah, oh yes, I was very close to my uncle.</span> <span id="s578">He was already married, and then he brought his young and very beautiful wife along.</span> <span id="s579">And they had a baby shortly after, so I became cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Do you remember what the landing was like when you arrived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Exciting.</span> <span id="s582">Lot of people, lot of people waiting.</span> <span id="s583">I mean, I didn’t go through Ellis Island, or one of those things, you know, we were coming out first class, so it was a perfectly nice landing, and everybody was very happy, and we, every Sunday went to some Hungarian restaurant, cause that’s where my grandfather liked to go, and there were a lot of people that my parents knew from Europe, so they very quickly ended up with a nucleus of friends.</span> <span id="s584">My parents, I don’t quite know why, but I was like the oldest child, so even though they all had children, they were all younger, and I was never -- I knew of them, and knew them, but wi -- I was never friendly with any of those Hungarian children.</span> <span id="s585">And I made friends at camp, I made friends at junior high school, and I made my own friends.</span> <span id="s586">I was occasionally embarrassed by my parent’s accent, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s587">I wa -- But, it wa -- it was funny, I mean, it’s -- it’s -- it’s ver -- kind of a snotty, childish kind of a thing, because our apartment once we moved, was very nice.</span> <span id="s588">And it was in a very nice building, and by that time I guess I was a little older, so I was conscious of neighborhoods and stuff, and so the accent, and the apartment kind of, you know, evened out.</span> <span id="s589">I mean, my parents spoke with an accent, but with an educated accent, and -- but I was definitely aware of it.</span> <span id="s590">When they came to visit in camp, you know it was a little -- but they were young.</span> <span id="s591">I mean, I was 21 -- my mother was 21when I was -- 21 when she was married, and 22 when I was born, or something.</span> <span id="s592">My father was 12 years older, but that was customary in Europe, to have the man established before he takes a bride.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: How soon before you felt more American than Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: You know, I’ve thought about that a lot.</span> <span id="s595">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s596">I think very quickly.</span> <span id="s597">And I think that’s because of the circles I got thrown into.</span> <span id="s598">My only connection to the past, really, was my parents, and the a -- and their -- their accent, which was definitely European.</span> <span id="s599">But I became American, you know, really very quickly.</span> <span id="s600">It’s interesting, my -- my son-in-law has an associate at his firm, and they adopted a Hungarian orphan, just recently, maybe four or five years ago.</span> <span id="s601">And they were a little older, they couldn’t have children, they gave up on adoption here.</span> <span id="s602">I guess they heard about eastern European children, they went there several times, then, make a very long story short, adopted a little girl, who they went to Europe to get.</span> <span id="s603">And -- And my daughter mentioned to this woman about me, and would that be a good -- well, she thought that was a great idea, cause this child did not speak English, she was five years old, and petrified.</span> <span id="s604">And so I went up to Connecticut, and I met with her.</span> <span id="s605">Well, I tell you, by the time that day was over, my daughter and I both wanted to adopt this child, and -- and tell this other lady to go away, because she had just no clue.</span> <span id="s606">I mean, she wanted to give the kid pizza, this kid didn’t know from pizza.</span> <span id="s607">Whatever she was offering her were all -- all the wrong things.</span> <span id="s608">And she meant well, but she came from a different mindset, and -- so I was trying to explain to both of them.</span> <span id="s609">And she was perfectly happy in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s610">I mean, that was her world.</span> <span id="s611">These were her friends, and her language, and she was totally uprooted from her home, and sent here, and was told that she should appreciate the color TV, and the -- and the pizza.</span> <span id="s612">She is now as American as apple pie.</span> <span id="s613">I don’t know, maybe she’s 10 years old.</span> <span id="s614">I don’t -- I think she’s going through a stage, cause I saw her, I think, the summer before last, and I said something to her in Hungarian, she didn’t respond.</span> <span id="s615">And I picked up on it immediately, and then I just switched to English, and told her I was happy to see her.</span> <span id="s616">I don’t know if she was embarrassed about it, or what, but I got the message.</span> <span id="s617">And I think it’ll be a while before she’s able to look back.</span> <span id="s618">But her circumstances were different.</span> <span id="s619">And I s -- I -- when I met the mother, she said someday they were going to plan a trip to Europe, and -- but I’m not sure going back to some orphanage is the same thing.</span> <span id="s620">I mean, when I go back, and have gone back, I have very fond memories, including the war.</span> <span id="s621">I certainly wouldn’t want to move back.</span> <span id="s622">But it’s -- it -- you know, it’s -- I sometimes dream in Hungarian, and I some -- and I count in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s623">If I just want to count, you know, a small column in my head or something, which is really weird, cause I don’t speak Hungarian unless I ha -- unless I have to.</span> <span id="s624">Well, that’s not true, a taxi driver, if I see his name’s Hungarian, I’ll -- my hairdresser’s Hungarian, so I do fall into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Do you collect the work of any Hungarian artists?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s627">And not for any reason, I -- no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Cause there are, you know, I mean, in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: -- I was thinking of a photographer I know, and he’s Hungarian.</span> <span id="s631">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: I mean, there’s some very famous ones that are Hungarian, that I would like to collect, but those are very expensive.</span> <span id="s633">Actually, for the first time about a -- a month ago, I went to the Hungarian consulate, which is a gorgeous, gorgeous brownstone in the east 60’s, because this friend of mine from Boston, that I went to school with, is a wonderful photographer.</span> <span id="s634">That’s not what she does to earn her living, and she would love to become an -- you know, more established, and she just hasn’t found -- she does some wonderful, wonderful things.</span> <span id="s635">It’d be great for corporate art, and I was trying to see if I could help her, but I haven’t done too well.</span> <span id="s636">She had an exhibit there, but that’s a dead end thing.</span> <span id="s637">I mean, who was going to go there, a lot of her Hungarian friends?</span> <span id="s638">Nothing much happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: So, dreaming -- dreaming in Hungarian, counting in Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Mostly counting, the dreaming is mixed, but every once in awhile, I wake up and realize that I was -- yeah, I’m sorry, did I interrupt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: No, no, I mean, this is about you [indecipherable] question.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Are you -- you think of yourself -- yourself now as Hungarian, American, Hungarian-American, American-Hungarian, Jewish-American-Hungarian, how do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Oh, God.</span> <span id="s645">Well, definitely not Hungarian first.</span> <span id="s646">I would definitely -- probably American Jewish Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Hungarian last?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s649">I mean, do you realize, I’m 65 years old, and I’ve been here 52 years, you know?</span> <span id="s650">And I haven’t had -- I mean, some of my Hidden Children friends are -- speak Hungarian all the time with each other.</span> <span id="s651">This one in Boston is -- she wrote to me in Hungarian once.</span> <span id="s652">I mean, I was able to read it, but with a great deal of difficulty.</span> <span id="s653">I said, don’t do this to me again, cause I -- you know, I speak it, but with difficulty.</span> <span id="s654">But some of them are definitely living more in a Hungarian world than I. I don’t really live in a Hungarian world, and it’s only because of the Hidden Children that I’ve even had contact, and became very friendly with some of them, just because I like them, not because they’re Hungarian, which is very interesting in our group.</span> <span id="s655">And I think the group is kind of changing focus a little, because in the beginning, when we first met at the conference, there was this bond, Hungarian Jewish.</span> <span id="s656">We formed the group Hidden, not a concentration camp, so a very different -- you know, who you could be in order to belong to this group.</span> <span id="s657">And we meet in New York, and there are a handful of people who have apartments in New York, I -- everybody else outside of New York, nobody wants to go to Forest Hills, New Jersey, Brooklyn, so the New Yorkers have been, you know having the meetings, which is fine.</span> <span id="s658">And there’s some very, very nice people.</span> <span id="s659">But the fact that you’re Hungarian and Jewish is not enough to have a relationship.</span> <span id="s660">I mean, there are other things in your life that have to work, interests, and what -- what has happened to your life?</span> <span id="s661">How are you living, you know, and all that.</span> <span id="s662">And -- I mean, there are some really, really nice ladies, who live in Brooklyn, who are very Orthodox, I have absolutely nothing in common with them.</span> <span id="s663">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: The notion of -- of hidden children, are there still parts of you that are in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I’d have to be in analysis to answer you, and I’ve never been, so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s666">Probably, but again, you know, I’m never quite sure -- and we’ve had this discussion with the Hidden Children, how much of -- of one’s being can be blamed on the war.</span> <span id="s667">A-As I mentioned to you before, at one point, everybody said, everyone that was divorced had to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s668">I was divorced, I don’t think it had anything whatsoever to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s669">One woman said she purposely married a non-Jew, to avoid possibility of this happening again.</span> <span id="s670">She has a daughter who is a teacher, [indecipherable] shalum, which is a synagogue affiliated school.</span> <span id="s671">She did get divorced, if it had anything to do with anything, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s672">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: How did you meet your first husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: My neighbor on Riverside Drive, where we lived, said she had a nice Jewish boy she’d like me to meet.</span> <span id="s675">I know, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s676">I was 20 years old, and -- and that’s how we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Elihu, E-l-i-h-u Tergel, that’s my daughter’s maiden name.</span> <span id="s679">And -- And you know, it was just a regular boy meets girl, we went out, we, you know, fell in love, we got married, we had a nice wedding at the Hampshire House, and we moved from a one bedroom, to a two bedroom, to a six room, you know, with a upward mobility, and then we, you know, started out working, and you know, did a little better along the way, and we had a daughter, we have a daughter.</span> <span id="s680">We didn’t have more children, which was stupid.</span> <span id="s681">I was pregnant at 40 and decided I was too old.</span> <span id="s682">If I had this generation now, it’d be just starting out.</span> <span id="s683">I think about that, and at some point, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the Holocaust, we just fell apart, which makes me sad.</span> <span id="s684">I mean, I’m -- was very lucky to meet my husband, married over 20 years, but I think it would have been kind of nice to be married 44 years, happily, to the same person.</span> <span id="s685">You know, it’s a -- it’s an upheaval, and I felt badly, you know, for my daughter, but she handled it very well, and I think she was definitely more for it than against it.</span> <span id="s686">But I think it’s -- I think in any divorce, you know, children tend to -- are formed by it somewhat, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What did your ex-husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: He was an engineer, was in air conditioning, he installed -- I’m always looking up when I say that -- commercial ducts, for the air to go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: How old was he when you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I was 21 when I was married, I must -- I remember, I was 19 - 20, and he was like four years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And how long til you had th -- had Lisa?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Within two years.</span> <span id="s693">Yeah, I was 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: That’s [indecipherable] like your mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Yeah, except I was born nine months after she was married, so she was a year younger.</span> <span id="s696">And actually, Lisa was pretty young by today’s standards.</span> <span id="s697">She’ll be 42 on July first.</span> <span id="s698">And so she was 27, going on -- you know, when Adam was -- which is still pretty young by today’s standards.</span> <span id="s699">But she, of course, has three.</span> <span id="s700">I think she’s trying to tell me something about only children.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Did -- Do you -- How do you feel that being an only child affected both your chances for survival as a child, and the way you [indecipherable] as you’ve grown up?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Well, I don’t know about survival, but probably -- it’s probably easier than if there had been more of us, you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s703">I never really had a problem about being an only child, I was -- again, I don’t know what it would have been like, I mean, all these wonderful people that have siblings hate each other’s guts, don’t talk to each other, fight, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s704">I think at some point, be -- you know, when I was a little older, when everybo -- in Europe a lot of my friends were only children, so I don’t think I -- this Tom in Toronto is an only child.</span> <span id="s705">A lot of my friends that I grew up with there were only children, so I didn’t really give it much thought.</span> <span id="s706">Once we came here, you know, I was 13 years old, so, it’s just the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Were you confirmed or Bat Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yeah, I was confirmed at Emmanuel.</span> <span id="s709">They didn’t have Bat Mitzvah then, they do now.</span> <span id="s710">The rabbi then thought there was too much emphasis on the Bar, and not enough on the Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s711">This is probably true.</span> <span id="s712">But they did -- that rabbi retired, and a new rabbi [inaudible] Bat Mitzvahed now.</span> <span id="s713">But I was confirmed, and Lisa was confirmed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Same Temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Same Temple.</span> <span id="s716">They didn’t have them then, either.</span> <span id="s717">Actually, my daughter was Bat Mitzvahed a couple years ago, at her synagogue in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s718">Yeah, she just went a-adult education [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So [indecipherable] and then that fell apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Then how old would [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: She was in -- just before she graduated college.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: So, she was an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: So she was an adult, yeah.</span> <span id="s725">And we -- we really stayed in the apartment she grew up in, right around the corner from here.</span> <span id="s726">It’s really weird, I mean, it’s so weird, cause I -- my kitchen window, you can see my old apartment, and we go to Connecticut, to exactly the same place I went to when she was little, and she’s moved there permanently, so it’s like, I don’t know what that’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: How -- How’d you meet your second husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I met my second husband in Acapulco, quite by accident [indecipherable] and as I said, we’ve been married for 20 -- it was 20 years in September, and all the children have been -- grandchildren have been born since we’re married, so even though there’s mine and his, we really refer to the children as collectively ours, sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: When they behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: You -- You said that it was just kind of almost natural that you’re very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s732">Why is that important?</span> <span id="s733">Why is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I -- You know, I -- I didn’t say it was important, I just said it happened.</span> <span id="s735">I didn’t date anybody, I didn’t know anybody that wasn’t Jewish, and it’s really weird, because it’s not that -- I mean, New York is a big city, and I don’t live in a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s736">But I remember one year, and that made an impression on me, I went to -- after I finished with my camp, the one I started out with, my parents thought that was enough of that already, and they thought I should brush up on my French, which I knew when I left Europe, and I don’t any more, either.</span> <span id="s737">But I went to another camp in Maine, that was a French camp.</span> <span id="s738">And you were supposed to speak French for the summer.</span> <span id="s739">And there were a bunch of girls, I don’t remember I bi -- I remember it was an odd number, and I’ve no idea how, and I had no idea who anybody was, I didn’t know anybody there, but it turned out that by the end of the summer, the way the pairing off went with friends, I was friendly with a Jewish girl, two Catholic girls were friendly with each other, two Protestants were friendly, and I don’t even know who the other one was.</span> <span id="s740">And nobody said my name is, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s741">And, I mean Brust was my last name, you know, it wasn’t like Cohn or something, Goldstein.</span> <span id="s742">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: And now, are most of your friends, are they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s745">There are intermarriages, and there -- you know, a couple of exceptions.</span> <span id="s746">And it’s not by choice, you know, I don’t mean -- I don’t go around again, interviewing people.</span> <span id="s747">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Cooper is your last name from?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: My husband.</span> <span id="s750">It used to be Cohn, but he changed it, and nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s751">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s752">He -- He has two brothers and a sister, well the sister has her own married name, but one brother stayed Cohn, and his older brother became Cooper, and my husband joined him in the Cooper part.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: What does your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: My husband’s in real estate.</span> <span id="s755">Their -- The family before was Cohn even, I think was Piadagorsky, because they came from Russia, and when they came through Ellis Island, or wherever, I think they became Cohn, because it was just to pick the name that was easy, or some such thing, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Do you feel that the -- given your history, that just you have some more commonality with Jews than you might with other people that [indecipherable] level, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: You know, I -- I -- I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s758">I -- I wonder about that.</span> <span id="s759">One of my husband’s -- my husband has three children.</span> <span id="s760">His two sons, they’re married to Jewish girls, his daughter’s married to a non-Jewish, very nice young man.</span> <span id="s761">I find that there’s a difference in culture.</span> <span id="s762">I remember when we first met his parents, there were two incidents that made such an impression on me, and they’re married, I don’t know, 16 - 17 years.</span> <span id="s763">This young man’s stepfather was telling a story about some incident, and how he was so lucky to have met up with Mussolini’s doctor in Europe.</span> <span id="s764">I wasn’t so excited by that story.</span> <span id="s765">And then we were talking about some -- something else at dinner, and they were talking about, you know, that Jewish lady comedian on TV.</span> <span id="s766">And I was going to say, what is this Jewish lady comedian.</span> <span id="s767">She has a name, she has a profession, but what’s this with the Jewish lady?</span> <span id="s768">And I was very uncomfortable with that.</span> <span id="s769">And I don’t think I carry religion, you know, on my shoulder.</span> <span id="s770">I’m probably less religious than some of my friends.</span> <span id="s771">Some people say I belong to the church on Fifth Avenue, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s772">But there is sort of a -- you know, a different way of looking at things, and we have a whole bunch of friends who have either Gentile wives or husbands.</span> <span id="s773">I think most of them sort of assimilated more into being Jewish than not, you know?</span> <span id="s774">So, I -- I mean -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Y-You had talked on the -- indicated about your father meeting Eichmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Do you remember when he was on trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: What did that -- How did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Oh, I’ve a terrible -- I’m really bad, I mean I -- I -- I don’t buy German products, I will not go to Germany.</span> <span id="s781">It has nothing to do with forgive, forget, all these cliches, I just -- I don’t like them, I don’t want to have anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s782">I think they would do it all over again if they had the first opportunity.</span> <span id="s783">I know it’s a terrible thing to say, it’s a prejudice, I try very hard not to do that.</span> <span id="s784">I saw a wonderful bag on sale, and I turned it over, and it said it’s made in Germany, and I -- I love bargains, I love sales, I put it down, I walked out.</span> <span id="s785">It’s my -- for lack of a good English word, mishigos, you know, it’s -- that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: How about listening to Wagner?</span> <span id="s787">You said you ha -- you like to go to the symphony opera --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah, actually I don’t go to the opera that much, and no, I haven’t listened to Wagner.</span> <span id="s789">I just -- The other day on the radio, there was this whole thing -- I wasn’t quite sure who was being interviewed, but this guy was saying about he has a big problem with people that object to Wagner because of his political views, and that people should really listen to the music, and forget about.</span> <span id="s790">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s791">It depends on how argumentative, or who I want to argue with.</span> <span id="s792">It’s like Vanessa Redgrave.</span> <span id="s793">She’s a wonderful actress.</span> <span id="s794">I don’t like her political views.</span> <span id="s795">On the other hand, I don’t have to force my political views on anyone, nor do they have to, so I can separate the two.</span> <span id="s796">My problem is with the whole German concept, and when I took Adam, my oldest grandson, and his brother -- the little one wasn’t around the first time -- no, wasn’t the first time, was the second time to Disney, wi -- no, with all three, we took all three boys to Disney a couple of years ago, and we didn’t have dinner reservations, and we were dragging, and it was hot, and we stayed -- we were going through Epcot, and we walked into a couple of places, and they just couldn’t take us, there were five of us.</span> <span id="s797">Ended up in a German brauhaus restaurant.</span> <span id="s798">I hated it.</span> <span id="s799">I mean they did the oompa pa and the whole thing, and they had the knockwurst and the this wurst and the that wurst.</span> <span id="s800">And Adam was the only one who said, “Grandma, I can’t believe we’re having dinner here.”</span> <span id="s801">And I said, “Adam, I can’t believe we’re having dinner here either, but you guys were all hungry, so here we are.”</span> <span id="s802">But I definitely did not like eating there.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: How about when you hear the German language?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I hate the German language.</span> <span id="s805">I hate listening to it.</span> <span id="s806">I spoke it fluently as a child, I spoke it pat -- when I learned how to speak it, Hungarian, I l -- I spoke German.</span> <span id="s807">Not Yiddish, German.</span> <span id="s808">I had a German fräulein when I was very little.</span> <span id="s809">Then I had an English nanny, and then I had a French mademoiselle, and I was very smart, and now I’m not so smart any more, cause I really don’t speak any other lang -- I mean, I -- when I’m in France, I can fake French a little, but it’s really a shame because I -- I did speak it fluently.</span> <span id="s810">I also was able to read and write Hebrew.</span> <span id="s811">I was very smart when I was young.</span> <span id="s812">This aging process is not so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: [indecipherable] End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: This is a continuation of the Holocaust Museum interview with Eva Cooper, this is tape two, side B. Okay, how about political events in this country, other than the Eichmann trial, as you were growing up, like McCarthy?</span> <span id="s815">Were you aware of that sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: McCarthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: That was -- I was very young, I really was not -- I mean, I knew what was going on, but that was -- when was that?</span> <span id="s819">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Oh, 50’s and 60’s, too.</span> <span id="s821">I mean, the House un-American Activities Committee was --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: -- certainly into the 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s825">I mean, I was aware of it, but I don’t think it played it a great role in my life at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Civil Rights Movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Civil Rights Movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, the Civil Rights Mo -- yeah, you know what played a -- a bigger part in my life?</span> <span id="s830">The Rosenberg trial.</span> <span id="s831">I remember that very vividly.</span> <span id="s832">Actually, I was in Washington with two of my friends.</span> <span id="s833">It was one of the first times my parents let me go, and I think I must have been either the end of high school, or the beginning of college, because I remember one friend, but I went to high school and college with her, so I don’t remember where -- what school we were at at the time.</span> <span id="s834">But I was quite upset with that whole thing.</span> <span id="s835">I don’t know if it was because they were Jewish, or the whole process of being executed, and -- there was a whole different sense of being an American, so I had kind of mixed feelings about, you know, capital punishment, and -- and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s836">I’ve changed back and forth a number of times on that issue.</span> <span id="s837">I remember seeing a movie called “Death Wish,” there were several -- I think it was called “Death Wish.”</span> <span id="s838">There were several after.</span> <span id="s839">One of them was filmed in my mother’s building, and the -- what’s his name was a vigilante.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Charles Bronson.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s842">And I was having actually, this discussion with my daughter, who was also very liberal at the time.</span> <span id="s843">She used to work for Geraldo Rivera when he was very young, and doing all sorts of good stuff, wore clogs and stuff.</span> <span id="s844">And when she saw that movie, she said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s845">Maybe there is something to capital punishment.”</span> <span id="s846">Because that was a mother being raped, and a daughter witnessing, and all that kind of stuff, so I can -- I can go back and forth on that issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Were you a strong mother, just as your mother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Was I as strong as mother as my --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Were you a strong mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s853">In so many ways, I -- it was a different generation.</span> <span id="s854">You know, I was more courteous and respectful with my mother.</span> <span id="s855">I mean, we -- you know, I -- I was a hands on mom, very differently, without -- without the staff, you know.</span> <span id="s856">So there is a difference, I think.</span> <span id="s857">The dress code does make a difference, too.</span> <span id="s858">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s859">It’s hard to say, you know, you sort of have to -- you’d have to ask Lisa, you know, her perception.</span> <span id="s860">My perception was, I mean I -- I loved -- she was a wonderful child, the -- I never had any problems with her, you know, any difficulties.</span> <span id="s861">I guess, you know, she probably will agree that she was probably the model child, she always rubs that in, that I didn’t give her -- she didn’t give me any aggrava -- she really didn’t give me any aggravation.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did you have a nanny for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Did you have a nanny for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: No, I had a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s866">I mean, yo -- you know, a housekeeper who babysat and stuff like that, but I was -- I was home and when I went back to school, she was in first grade, and I was home when she was home, so her school stuff all -- you know, always came first.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Education very important for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s869">For me, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: For you?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah, it was very important for me, and it was very important for my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Why was it important for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Well, I was brought up that way.</span> <span id="s876">I wa -- It was important to my parents, and -- well, there was not a question of was I or was I not going to college, it was a given to begin with, and I would have liked to go out of town, but we were still fairly new at it, and my parents said that college is something that you go to to learn, not to go to some campus, and whatever.</span> <span id="s877">And it was costly then, too.</span> <span id="s878">And Hunter was a very fine school, it was available, and didn’t cost anything.</span> <span id="s879">That was probably a big disappointment, because a lot of my friends were going, you know, out of town.</span> <span id="s880">I had a lot of private school friends by that time, because of camp, and -- and Sunday school.</span> <span id="s881">And everybody was going to these nice schools, and stuff, so I had dates, and was invited to football games, and stuff like that, so that was good.</span> <span id="s882">And my father said that he doesn’t care what I graduate with, but I have to have a tool, that if something happens, and I have to take care of myself, that I have to be able to do that, which was sort of a very smart thing, because my mother’s generation were raised to be ladies, and entertain.</span> <span id="s883">They learned, most of them, some had more trouble than others.</span> <span id="s884">But my father said that he didn’t care what I did, as long as when I get that degree, it enables me to do something.</span> <span id="s885">So, I majored in English, I minored in ed-education.</span> <span id="s886">I liked working with children, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: What year did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: I graduated the year we were -- we were married.</span> <span id="s889">No, I graduated the year after.</span> <span id="s890">We were married in ’55, graduated in ’56.</span> <span id="s891">I -- I went to summer school, and I graduated six months before.</span> <span id="s892">I spent that whole summer -- we were married in August -- I spent that whole summer getting this ridiculous amount of credits, and cramming stupid courses.</span> <span id="s893">And then I student taught the pers -- semester that we were married.</span> <span id="s894">And actually, I -- I had a hard time getting a job, because they wanted to put me into the worst schools, and I really -- I wouldn’t have survived there.</span> <span id="s895">I ended up in the worst schools later, but -- so I got a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s896">We lived in Murray Hill, and I got a kwi -- sort of a -- I don’t even know how I got it, but it was really nice, sort of a Girl Friday job in a wholesale drapery and bedspread manufacturing company on Fifth Avenue in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s897">And I kind of ran the office.</span> <span id="s898">I didn’t have a clue what I was doing.</span> <span id="s899">My husband used to come up and help me file, cause there were too many S’s.</span> <span id="s900">So I used to file all the other letters, except the S’s.</span> <span id="s901">And there were no computers, I was perfectly happy answering the telephone, you know, and I looked nice, and my boss borrowed my husband’s tuxedo, and so you know, we just all kind of worked, and then I became pregnant, not that far after -- w-was also -- also was very nice, cause it was in the neighborhood, and I used to run home, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s902">And then after Lisa was born, when she was little, I used to get these market research jobs.</span> <span id="s903">I used to interview people on the street with a baby, and then -- and my elevator man got me this nice lady who ended up working for us for 14 years, who used to come in to clean twice a week.</span> <span id="s904">And when she came, I left, and -- for about three hours, at nap time.</span> <span id="s905">And she was wonderful, and I used to do these market research things, so I kind of liked that.</span> <span id="s906">And then we moved up here f -- in order for Lisa to go to PS six, which was a very good public school, and those were the rent control days, and got a rent controlled apartment, and I started looking around in schools, and I went -- I taught at a school on 108th and Madison Avenue.</span> <span id="s907">Kind of lower Harlem, I guess, whatever you call it, and I stayed there for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Check the tape again.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: What do you mean, transcribe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: The -- Just as they did with the previous interview of yours, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Oh, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: -- write it out verbatim, and keep it in the archives for people who want to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: You talked about how you look good at your filing job, it’s -- i-is --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: I’m sorry, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: You talked about your appearance.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: If I remember.</span> <span id="s919">Is looking good important to you?</span> <span id="s920">Having go -- nice clothes, nice things?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Is it important?</span> <span id="s922">Yeah, I mean, as opposed to I don’t care what I look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Well, you talked about how, during the war, your mother would, you know, lengthen your dresses, and things --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah, I think -- I don’t think it was looking good, I think it’s a question of -- if a button’s missing, there’s no reason not to sew it on.</span> <span id="s927">If something is torn, sew it.</span> <span id="s928">Comb your hair in the morning, you know, those kind of things.</span> <span id="s929">So it’s really neatness, and a certain appearance, you know.</span> <span id="s930">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s931">I think it’s more that than, you know, clothes stuff.</span> <span id="s932">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Cause you’re not wearing just any loafers.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: What am I wearing?</span> <span id="s935">Oh.</span> <span id="s936">I bought these loafers, and they told me would go with everything, doesn’t go with anything, but they’re so comfortable.</span> <span id="s937">It’s a weird color.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: For the tape you want to describe them so the transcriber --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yeah, they’re -- they’re kind of funny looking suede loafers.</span> <span id="s940">I don’t know what -- what color would you call these?</span> <span id="s941">It’s supposed to be -- it’s not beige, but it’s almost bordering on a dull orange kind of thing.</span> <span id="s942">And when I bought them, I thought they would be sort of like -- go with everything.</span> <span id="s943">Every time I put them on, I think to myself, doesn’t really go with anything.</span> <span id="s944">But they’re very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: They look very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: When did you start collecting art?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Way before I could afford it.</span> <span id="s949">When I was quite young, I must have been in my 30’s, and we co-couldn’t really afford it, and a lot of my friends were starting to buy mink stoles, and whatever those awful things were.</span> <span id="s950">And some jewelry, you know, and things.</span> <span id="s951">The next level of -- you know, when your husband does well, that next level of luxury.</span> <span id="s952">And I’ve always loved going to museums and galleries.</span> <span id="s953">And I was involved with Brandeis University National Women’s Committee.</span> <span id="s954">And the National Women’s Committee was the sole supporter of the library, because it was a fairly new school, and they didn’t have the alumni money coming in for a library, so the women, when the school was first formed, non-sectarian Jewish school, because education was very important, we supported the library.</span> <span id="s955">We had a very active chapter -- junior chapter in New York, young.</span> <span id="s956">There was an older -- our parent’s generation, they formed a younger chapter, and I was very much involved with that.</span> <span id="s957">And we did a lot of book reviews, and art classes, and I guess intellectually stimulating things, as opposed to a lot of other people were playing -- younger people, that had some free time were starting to play Mah Jongg, or Canasta, and all that kind of stuff, so this was -- we had a stock group, we were learning about that, so whatever was interesting, and I was always interested in that.</span> <span id="s958">We went to look at the Barnes collection.</span> <span id="s959">And there were a lot of artists popping up that were contemporary, unknown.</span> <span id="s960">Galleries that were appearing in Soho, that were new.</span> <span id="s961">Andy Warhol was becoming, O.K Harris Gallery was -- he used to give ladies art classes, before he opened the gallery.</span> <span id="s962">And they would donate stuff, and we would auction it off, or sell it, or whatever.</span> <span id="s963">And I was just really interested.</span> <span id="s964">Some of the galleries would give us cocktail parties, and fundraisers, and stuff, and that’s how that Picasso lino cut back there, it was the first thing that I bought, that was an independent thing, and it was a lot of money at the time.</span> <span id="s965">And we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: You and your --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: My husband, my fir --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: -- first husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: First husband, yeah.</span> <span id="s970">And then a lot of the little things that you see around like that Nevillson, and multiple -- they were all multiples, and somebody asked me the other day what a multiple is.</span> <span id="s971">I said it’s a sa -- it’s like -- it’s like a lithograph, except in sculptures, and I was -- such a funny question.</span> <span id="s972">But a lot of artists did that in order to raise money.</span> <span id="s973">Louise Nevillson was very supportive of Brandeis, and some museums were.</span> <span id="s974">And that was a very -- a less expensive way of acquiring things, because they were multiples, they were one of 50, one of a hundred, whatever.</span> <span id="s975">And they certainly have, you know, done well along the years.</span> <span id="s976">So I’m happy.</span> <span id="s977">I mean, I didn’t buy it at the time, because I thought it was going to wor -- be worth it, cause I’m not selling anything.</span> <span id="s978">But I just liked it.</span> <span id="s979">And it was all -- always -- I kind of like a little bit of the cutting edge stuff, although every once in awhile -- I went to see the new exhibit at the Metropolitan, I said, you know, I could get rid of some of this, acquire one of those, but I can’t.</span> <span id="s980">It’s just -- gives me pleasure, I -- I just like it.</span> <span id="s981">We have some stuff really, and actually it’s in the closets, that are very angry, and -- stuff I wouldn’t want to hang.</span> <span id="s982">Nan Golden, do you know Nan Golden?</span> <span id="s983">We have a cookie portfolio, I mean, it’s not something I would hang, but I really like it, I think they’re wonderful photographs, and they’re very meaningful, I mean, that’s the generation of the drugs, and the OD’s and stuff.</span> <span id="s984">I absolutely can’t think of the young man who did that.</span> <span id="s985">I thought it was -- the paintings were just spectacular.</span> <span id="s986">I absolu -- I’m blanking out on his name, he’s Italian.</span> <span id="s987">But I thought they were all AIDS victims, turned out he had a brain tumor, and he’s alive and well, but they all look -- they really all look like concentration camp survivors.</span> <span id="s988">So -- But of all the things to spend money on, in the luxury category, I think art would be my -- top of my list.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Were your parents collectors?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s991">Y -- I mean, in Europe they had a wonderful -- I remember lots of paintings, and they were supposed to have been good paintings, but they never came out, and I have -- I don’t really even know who they were, or how valuable they were.</span> <span id="s992">That was not something they continued to do.</span> <span id="s993">They have a couple of Hungarian painters, that were very well known in the Hungarian circles.</span> <span id="s994">Freid -- I don’t know if you ever heard of -- kind of impressionists, faux impressionists, but they were, you know, very good friends, and actually I tried to talk my mother once, to buy a Chagall lithograph, and I think she was sorry she didn’t.</span> <span id="s995">But no, not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Well you have so-some really interesting pieces.</span> <span id="s997">And you’re not afraid of collecting German artists.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: That’s -- It’s -- It’s interesting, that was the only one that’s definitely German, and I had mixed feelings about it.</span> <span id="s999">And the other -- the one that they’re really famous for, the water tanks, that’s -- it’s -- it’s fu -- a very good friend of mine, who I went to a college with, are major collectors, I mean really major, and she’s also an art dealer, and I’ve gone with her a few times, and bought things, you know, through her and with her, and I think somebody had bought this, and they couldn’t pay the last payment, or something, and she -- she said, you know, if I don’t buy this, I’m crazy, and it was really a good buy.</span> <span id="s1000">And I liked it, and I -- I don’t even think I was paying attention to the German part, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s1001">If I had, I probably wouldn’t have bought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: You want to explain for the tape, what we’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yeah, this is a series of nine photographs taken -- what these -- it’s a husband and wife, Bescher.</span> <span id="s1004">I can’t think of their first name, Hannah, and -- I can’t think of his name, Bescher, but they’re probably one of the most predominant photographers, and they take multiple shots of the same thing.</span> <span id="s1005">They’re very well known for their water tanks, and these are houses in Germany, and it’s -- they’re no -- I mean, they’re sold as a unit.</span> <span id="s1006">There are nine, aren’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1009">And they’re kind of hung as a series.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Yeah, cause after you were talking about, you know, nothing German --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: -- and I’m sitting here looking at those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Yeah, i-i-it’s funny, you’re absolutely right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: But then, most people wouldn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1016">No, but it’s not because most people, I mean, like the bag I didn’t buy, I didn’t buy not because anybody would have known it, but I mean, I have turned like dishes or things upside down to look, so I don’t know how this kind of major thing snuck in, but it certainly did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: When you were married both times, were they religious ceremonies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yes, both times.</span> <span id="s1019">I’ve been married by a rabbi, does that mean -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1020">First time it was at the hotel, the Hampshire House, by a rabbi, actually a Hungarian rabbi, who had come here after the war, and had his congregation in New Haven.</span> <span id="s1021">And he used to tutor my mother and her brother, to earn extra money, to go through school.</span> <span id="s1022">And the second time we were married at Temple Emmanuel, in the study, of my rabbi, and my husband’s rabbi, who happened to have been classmates, so they were good friends, and it just worked out well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: This was im-important to you, to be married by a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: You know, it’s another one of those things I just didn’t think about.</span> <span id="s1025">I mean, I -- I don’t know, it just -- I didn’t even think about who else could marry you, like a Justice of the Peace, I -- yeah, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1026">I mean, if I answered you, it wouldn’t really be -- I just didn’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: You’ve talked -- Several times you’ve mentioned the Hidden Children gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: It sounds like that was kind of a focal point for you, kind of coming out as a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1031">Somebody said that, it’s like coming out of the closet.</span> <span id="s1032">I think what happened, and I don’t know how accurate this is, but I think the period of assimilation had passed.</span> <span id="s1033">I assimilated, I grew up, I was an American teenager, I was married, you know.</span> <span id="s1034">It is now at the point in time, where with my generation, it’s all over, except these tapes.</span> <span id="s1035">I didn’t think about that 20 or 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1036">I wanted to go on with my life, and my parents wanted to go on with their lives.</span> <span id="s1037">I mean, we were all very happy to be here, and still today, when people criticize this country, my European side comes out, and I always want to say, go away.</span> <span id="s1038">If you don’t like it here, go wherever it’s better.</span> <span id="s1039">Cause with all the problems here, with all the horrible things, what -- whether it’s -- from the politicians and the -- the crookedness, and th -- all that, I’d still rather live here than anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1040">And we had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical.</span> <span id="s1041">And I don’t like the American flag being burned, I don’t like this freedom of choice business.</span> <span id="s1042">I don’t mean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of choice of doing things that I -- I don’t think the right thing to do, because I don’t think you have to burn anything to make a statement, but that’s my own opinion.</span> <span id="s1043">But I am very conscious of the fact that historically, I wouldn’t like it not to be remembered.</span> <span id="s1044">Not me, because I’ve been very lucky.</span> <span id="s1045">Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents.</span> <span id="s1046">A tremen -- All of my aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1047">I have one cousin, who’s 77, who’s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm.</span> <span id="s1048">He’s married, he has a son, a nice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1049">And he’s assimilated, totally, sometimes excessively, and it’s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his Auschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn’t ready to part with it.</span> <span id="s1050">On the other hand, he lived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging in their house.</span> <span id="s1051">So -- And he also went overboard joining -- I probably shouldn’t say this on tape, case he listens to it -- a very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I wouldn’t deal too well with that, if I’m not welcome, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1052">I mean, it’s not okay, but I wouldn’t want to make a statement.</span> <span id="s1053">But that’s how he’s dealt with it.</span> <span id="s1054">He’s got his own demons, probably much worse than mine, cause his mother died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1055">So, you can’t really be critical of what other people, you know, do, and how people deal with it.</span> <span id="s1056">But I think -- Well first of all, this Hidden Children thing just happened, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Yeah, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: I guess about five years ago, and there was an article in a New York magazine, and it was getting a lot of publicity, it was going to be like maybe a couple of hundred people or something, were going to gather at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, and my daughter called me and told me about it.</span> <span id="s1059">And she said, how come I’m not going?</span> <span id="s1060">I said, “Well, I really hadn’t thought about it, what am I going to do there?”</span> <span id="s1061">And it was Memorial Day weekend, and we were invited out to the Hamptons, which sounded like a much better thing to do.</span> <span id="s1062">Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you know, I think I’m going to go.</span> <span id="s1063">And I said to my husband, “Let’s go out to the Hamptons, and I’ll come back for the one day out of the two, and you stay, and that’s that.”</span> <span id="s1064">Well, he came back with me, and I only went for one day.</span> <span id="s1065">And I went early in the morning, and by lunchtime I called him, and I said, “Come.</span> <span id="s1066">Elie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,” and you know, and he did.</span> <span id="s1067">And it was really a very interesting experience for me.</span> <span id="s1068">And one of my friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying the war was wonderful, and I had a lovely childho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some things that weren’t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn’t even aware of.</span> <span id="s1069">So I guess, you know, something is definitely there, and I -- I don’t know if it’s my personality or what, that likes to think the glass is half full, as opposed to half empty.</span> <span id="s1070">But it is definitely important that the museum is there.</span> <span id="s1071">We went to the one in South Beach, which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people have said an awful lot of money is going to all these buildings, and all of this stuff, you know, isn’t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1072">But I think the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you hear about all these shootings at schools, and stuff, it’s a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1073">But I’m not sure that it’s -- goes to the right people.</span> <span id="s1074">You know, it’s -- I remember years ago, having meetings, and chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being late.</span> <span id="s1075">But the people that were there, were there.</span> <span id="s1076">The people that were that late, didn’t hear my complaining, so I’m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are going to go to the Holocaust Museum, listen to these tapes, and say, “Well, you know, we did terrible things to these people, maybe we won’t do this.”</span> <span id="s1077">So, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Change tape aga -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: This is tape three, side A, Holocaust Museum interview with Eva Cooper, on Tuesday, June 22nd, 1999.</span> <span id="s1080">Did you always talk to your daughter about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: She claims I didn’t in the beginning, and it’s really interesting, cause that’s something that’s come up a lot at these Hidden Children meetings, about some daughters who said their parents talked too much, and other daughters who said their parents didn’t.</span> <span id="s1082">I didn’t for a long time, and she teases me about it.</span> <span id="s1083">I had all these pictures, after the war, that were taken, and I don’t know why, but it was just sort of something that came up from time to time, and I always told her that when she was older, I would show it to her.</span> <span id="s1084">There were all these dead bodies, all over the place, that were being shoveled up to be buried i-in the back of the synagogue, cause they couldn’t be identified, and -- and there were just a lot of bodies all over the place that -- when we came back into Budapest, cause we were in hiding outside, and so I remember all these bodies and stuff, and shortly after we came back, they were hanging people.</span> <span id="s1085">And you know, this -- these were all documented, and no, I didn’t want to show her the pictures, for a long time.</span> <span id="s1086">I’m not sure whether they were upsetting for me, or whether I thought that she’d be upset.</span> <span id="s1087">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1088">I did take her to a couple of movies, when she was like a young teenager, that were, I guess I thought age appropriate, and that she could handle.</span> <span id="s1089">And it’s interesting, because my -- I’ve changed.</span> <span id="s1090">You know, now I feel if the people that were victims could handle it, you know, children should be able to handle it, too.</span> <span id="s1091">I certainly started younger with my grandson.</span> <span id="s1092">I don’t -- you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1093">I guess timing.</span> <span id="s1094">With my grandson, I was at the train station, waiting for somebody, and he put out his right hand like Heil, Hitler, and it really freaked me out, totally.</span> <span id="s1095">And so -- I mean, he was little, maybe four, five years old.</span> <span id="s1096">So I kind of kneeled -- you know, bent down, at his level, I said, “Adam, why did you do that?”</span> <span id="s1097">And he said, “Well, I just had seen that in “The Sound of Music.”</span> <span id="s1098">So I said, “Well, yeah, that’s what they did,” I said, “but I have to tell you a story.”</span> <span id="s1099">And I said, “If you remember the story, some of those soldiers were the bad guys.</span> <span id="s1100">And this was this guy, Adolf,” anyhow, and I said, you know, “I don’t really want you to do that, that’s not a salute that is appropriate.”</span> <span id="s1101">I don’t know what words I used, I was really kind of emotional about it.</span> <span id="s1102">So then he said, “Will you tell me other stories about what happened to you?”</span> <span id="s1103">And I did, and actually at the Hidden Children, there was some wonderful books, and I had gotten some.</span> <span id="s1104">And I read some to him, and then, subsequently he, you know, read “Anne Frank” and all the other Holocaust related stories.</span> <span id="s1105">But now, it’s become like a joke, every time I give him a book, I say, “No, it’s not about the Holocaust.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: And what’s your relationship to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: That’s an interesting question.</span> <span id="s1108">I’m very glad it’s there.</span> <span id="s1109">I wouldn’t want to live there, and it has nothing -- it has -- I was going to say it has nothing to do with me, but that’s not quite right, that’s a flip answer.</span> <span id="s1110">I’m not as committed to it being my homeland as some people.</span> <span id="s1111">I think we’re very lucky, as American Jews, that Israel is there, it’s -- to lean on.</span> <span id="s1112">But it’s not a place I want to live in.</span> <span id="s1113">I don’t feel that because I’m Jewish, I have to be there.</span> <span id="s1114">It’s not a place, certainly, my parents chose, like a lot of people after the war, that -- I don’t -- I don’t think of it in terms of my homeland.</span> <span id="s1115">Maybe I should.</span> <span id="s1116">Maybe that’s where all the Jews belong, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1117">I mean, we were perfectly happy being Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1118">Did you ever see a movie called, “Ship of Fools”?</span> <span id="s1119">He said, “After all, I’m a German.”</span> <span id="s1120">Well, right now I’m saying, “After all, I’m an American.”</span> <span id="s1121">Could it happen here?</span> <span id="s1122">Probably.</span> <span id="s1123">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Do you feel at this point, that it’s important to talk about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: To talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Your experiences.</span> <span id="s1127">Do you tend to tell people more now than you did before the Hidden Children conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: It’s -- It’s strange, I have had friends for 40 some years, they all knew that I was born in Europe.</span> <span id="s1129">They all knew that I came, when I came, and all that.</span> <span id="s1130">And I cannot tell you how many -- and I mean, this is my -- a handful of people that I’ve known, you know, from camp, junior high school, says, “By the way, I knew you came from Europe, were you,” -- I said, “You know, where have you been all of this time?”</span> <span id="s1131">“Well, you never talked about it.”</span> <span id="s1132">I said, “You never asked me.”</span> <span id="s1133">I mean, I don’t go sit down at a dinner party, and say, “Would you like to hear my war stories?”</span> <span id="s1134">Some people do that, but I don’t.</span> <span id="s1135">I -- I don’t do it or not do it, I mean, if you ask me.</span> <span id="s1136">People will say, “Do you mind talking about it?”</span> <span id="s1137">No, I don’t mind talking about it at all.</span> <span id="s1138">But some people will ask, and then I have a sense that they’re trying to change the subject.</span> <span id="s1139">They don’t really want to know.</span> <span id="s1140">And some people are curious, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: How about with your husbands, did you talk about it with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Did they want to know, or did you want to tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Both.</span> <span id="s1145">Yeah, but I mean I’m -- you know, I can’t honestly say we sat down and had, you know -- yeah, but I mean, as -- as much as you can talk about it, or you know.</span> <span id="s1146">I mean, my husband -- my present husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Leslie, which really, interesting enough, is a very European name, it’s Lazlo.</span> <span id="s1149">And my uncle, my mother’s brother, was Leslie -- was Lazlo there.</span> <span id="s1150">His son -- which is a very un-Jewish thing to do, is an only child also, is Leslie junior.</span> <span id="s1151">And at the time my daughter had a very good female friend whose name was Leslie, so we’re loaded with Leslies.</span> <span id="s1152">But, I mean, it was with him that we, you know, gave a very nice contribution, and -- he gets very emotional about hearing or seeing things about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1153">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Is your daughter named after anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: My grandmother.</span> <span id="s1156">I mean, it was sort of a -- you know, make believe after, but I mean, we just liked the name Lisa, and her middle name is Robin, which was sort of -- my grandmother’s name was Serena, so I’m not exactly sure how we did all that, but it’s really weird, because my father -- I was pregnant with Lisa when my father died, so if anything, I probably should have -- I didn’t -- I don’t know -- I mean, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1157">I think we just named her Lisa right away, before she was born, so it just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Do you have any fears now that stem from you childhood experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: I have probably more fears now than I did before, but I don’t think it’s anything to do with my childhood, I think it’s the process of aging, you know, there’s a lot of sickness, and illness, and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: What about sirens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Oh, I hate sirens.</span> <span id="s1162">I don’t like sirens, but I’m not as -- I mean, I used to really be bad about it, but I just -- you know, I just don’t like the noise.</span> <span id="s1163">I’m not a noisy person, I don’t like noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: It’s not that it reminds you of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: It did for a long time, and cor -- yeah -- no, it really doesn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: How about being cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1168">I -- My -- All my fingers were frozen during the war, and I still -- talk about gloves, not white gloves during the summer, but I -- I’d rather wear gloves than anything else in the winter, because my hands and feet tend to get very cold, and that always is from that original freezing thing, and I don’t like to be cold.</span> <span id="s1169">Course, I don’t like to be very hot, either, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: [inaudible] Photographs you have on the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: You’ve got the Bushes in front of everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I -- That’s -- That’s just a -- a coincident, it’s really funny, because I’m not a Republican, but when we were in Washington with Adam and Peter -- this was a cut out, and when we went back, we were trying to find a Clinton cut out, but we couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1174">But it looks so realistic that people actually have come and said, “What are you doing with the Bushes?”</span> <span id="s1175">And I say it was just, you know, the kids got a kick out of it, and it’s amazing how real it is.</span> <span id="s1176">There’s one picture on the piano, it’s right up front, near the Bushes.</span> <span id="s1177">That’s my mother, my father, my Uncle Leslie and me as a baby.</span> <span id="s1178">Do you see it?</span> <span id="s1179">Yeah, that old fashioned one, yeah.</span> <span id="s1180">And that was in Europe in our living room.</span> <span id="s1181">Yeah, that was my Uncle Leslie, who came here in ’41, and he was 20 something, and immediately joined the American army, and was in Italy during the invasion, and then came to Budapest before he headed back.</span> <span id="s1182">And it’s his wife -- well, he died, my uncle died about five years ago, that was my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s1183">And his wife is the one I’m very friendly with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Do you play piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No, I did.</span> <span id="s1186">That’s another thing I did when I used to be smart.</span> <span id="s1187">I -- I’ve thought about actually taking lessons again.</span> <span id="s1188">But we just had two couples over for dinner the other night, and we played the piano, it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s1189">My grandchildren play the piano.</span> <span id="s1190">And when we got the apartment -- a very good friend of mine sold us the apartment, and she said, “This living room is so big, what are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s1191">I said, “I haven’t got a clue,” cause I had all this furniture from my other apartment that I used, and she, being a good real estate lady says, you know, she was just selling an apartment, a woman who was moving out of a big apartment, she wants to sell her piano.</span> <span id="s1192">That’s how I got the piano, so I could put my grandchildren’s pictures on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Have you ever been to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Have you ever been to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: You say that with more finality than almost anything you’ve said before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: [indecipherable] you lost so many relatives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s1201">I think I would like to go, at some point.</span> <span id="s1202">I’ve never been to Prague, which is not the same thing, but a lot of it has to do -- well, choices, and timing, because -- but the last -- when we were in Budapest the last time, we went with Adam, and I didn’t want to go to another eastern European country, which is -- I was in -- like in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1203">And then there have been a couple of, you know, Jewish congress, and UJA kind of stuff, that always has that.</span> <span id="s1204">And I think I’ve mixed feelings about it.</span> <span id="s1205">I don’t know how I feel about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: You said that there were a lot of emotions when you went with Adam to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Then you just left it at that.</span> <span id="s1209">What kind of emotions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: I felt very -- combination of this is where I’m from, to this is a strange place, all at the same time.</span> <span id="s1211">Because again, we’re talking 50 some years ago, so just like New York, on the west side where I grew up, doesn’t look anything like -- Lincoln Center wasn’t anywhere near anything, you know, so I mean, just by nature of growth, and -- things change.</span> <span id="s1212">My apartment looked pretty shabby from the outside.</span> <span id="s1213">There was still a lot of bullet -- you know, bomb sh-shrapnel things in the buildings.</span> <span id="s1214">The city is beautiful, and when we were looking out the window at night, we had a -- we stayed at the intercontinental, overlooking the Danube River, it’s a beautiful, beautiful city, and it used to be called the Paris of the Danube.</span> <span id="s1215">And all the royalty used to visit, and these shopping streets, like Madison Avenue, is -- was a beautiful, beautiful street.</span> <span id="s1216">It’s pretty crummy now.</span> <span id="s1217">Has a lot of is -- American chain store, McDonalds, you know, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1218">It’s -- The city’s a little tacky, and sad looking, you know, but it’s -- physically it’s a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1219">I was very moved at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1220">The last time we were there, 20 some years ago, you -- it wasn’t even opened.</span> <span id="s1221">So that is changed a lot.</span> <span id="s1222">And there a lot of Americans, including Tony Curtis, and the Louder family, who have given a lot of money to restore the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1223">And they’ve re -- all the furniture has been re-done, you know, all the benches, and pews.</span> <span id="s1224">And all the names were taken off, in order to re-polish the furniture.</span> <span id="s1225">So I spoke to the guy who was sort of escorting school groups around.</span> <span id="s1226">And I said, “My grandfather, and my father, and my uncle, and mother, they all had their nametags -- you know, their nameplates here.”</span> <span id="s1227">So he said, “Give me their names.”</span> <span id="s1228">And he said, “Come to the back,” there’s a little room in the back.</span> <span id="s1229">And in old shoeboxes, in alphabetical order, he pulls out my grandfather’s, my father’s, my mother’s, and my uncle.</span> <span id="s1230">That’s whose son is here, as a survivor of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1231">So I made a donation to the synagogue, and they put them on like little wooden plaques -- wooden pieces, they didn’t do such a good job, but it was very nice of them to do that.</span> <span id="s1232">And I brought it home, and I gave my mother’s, my father’s, my gr-grandfather’s to my mother, and I gave my uncle’s to my cousin.</span> <span id="s1233">We did have a choice of putting it back there.</span> <span id="s1234">I’m not sure why I bought them with me.</span> <span id="s1235">They were selling, you know, new people now, raising money for the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1236">I don’t know why, I just wa -- I ge -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1237">I mean, I’m not sure whether I shouldn’t have just had them put it back, you know, on the -- on the pews, or what they had planned to do.</span> <span id="s1238">But when they had them in the back, and they said, “Would you like them?”</span> <span id="s1239">I said, “Yes, I would.”</span> <span id="s1240">So that was quite moving, and Adam was quite impressed, moved, whatever.</span> <span id="s1241">And we bought some Judaica there.</span> <span id="s1242">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Was it important to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: I would have liked to be there for a Friday night service, but we weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Do you go here, to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: No, not regularly.</span> <span id="s1247">We do, but not, you know -- I mean, not as a regular thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Th-The decision to bring the names here, rather than leave them there, was that in any way symbolic of the fact that your whole family came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1250">I didn’t really give it a lot of thought.</span> <span id="s1251">When they found them, I just thought that -- I didn’t think my mother would ever go back.</span> <span id="s1252">I just thought she would like to have them, cause she was -- has all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1253">And my cousin actually goes back to visit.</span> <span id="s1254">All those last living relatives just died, and Europeans are very big on cemeteries, so they always go visit cemeteries.</span> <span id="s1255">I don’t know why I brought it back.</span> <span id="s1256">I really -- I mean, it wasn’t something I thought about doing or going to get, or anything else, it was just -- I expected to see them on the s -- on the pews, and my mother sat upstairs.</span> <span id="s1257">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Anything else you want to say about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: About your experience [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: I don’t know, it’s -- it’s sort of interesting, and it’s a contradiction.</span> <span id="s1262">Had it not been for the Hidden Children, had it not been for the fact that I’m conscious of this last generation, and probably my grandchildren, it would have been something of the past.</span> <span id="s1263">But the past is a very important part of your whole being, and you can’t just totally file it away.</span> <span id="s1264">What impact it will have on the future, I no -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1265">I think I’m going through a stage, I don’t know if because it’s my mother, that I feel very vulnerable about it being sort of the last chapter, you know.</span> <span id="s1266">I used to think I was young, and I used to think I was middle-aged, and now I think, you know, the senior, and AARP, and all that, it’s like a whole other chapter, and I’ve never lied about my age, so it’s not a matter of saying I’m younger than I am, but I think I have a little problem acknowledging that I’m not in my 40’s, I think I’m stuck in my 40’s.</span> <span id="s1267">But I’ve had the discussion with my daughter, and she says she’s stuck in her 20’s, so that kind of works, cause she’s having a problem thinking that she’s in her 40’s.</span> <span id="s1268">And she’s got exactly the same lines that I have.</span> <span id="s1269">And I guess that’s genetic, you know?</span> <span id="s1270">So, I just would like to think -- not even wish, I don’t know, think that the next generation doesn’t have any of this to deal with.</span> <span id="s1271">I think historically, almost every generation has had a horrendous war, or something that’s beyond their control.</span> <span id="s1272">Whether it was a civil war movement, or World War One, or Two, or lost someone in Korea, Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1273">This was a little different, and my daughter, my grandchildren are quite involved in this Kosovo, which I probably think is as close as you can get.</span> <span id="s1274">And it-it’s so sad that with all of the talk, and the political statements, that the bottom line is, there’s nothing anybody can do, it’s like a -- it’s like a chain reaction.</span> <span id="s1275">I mean, thousands of people are dying.</span> <span id="s1276">And with all the stuff that’s going there, it’s still going on, and nobody can stop it.</span> <span id="s1277">So, it’s hard to be philosophical, because it’s -- it’s sort of -- it’s empty words, you know.</span> <span id="s1278">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s1279">I would like it not to happen.</span> <span id="s1280">That’s not very profound, but I can’t think of anything more.</span> <span id="s1281">I’ve been lucky, that’s -- I guess that’s a good way to end, because I think I been lucky because in my life, the war could have been much worse.</span> <span id="s1282">I had -- could have had more serious losses.</span> <span id="s1283">I could have been in camps, which were more serious.</span> <span id="s1284">And I’m also lucky that my life after the war turned out to be a nice, and a good life.</span> <span id="s1285">And I’m very grateful for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Eva Cooper.</span> <span id="s1287">Is that all?</span> <span id="s1288">When you came to this country -- we’re back again.</span> <span id="s1289">When you -- When you came to this country, was there a class structure among the immigrants?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yes, there most certainly were.</span> <span id="s1291">Not -- Not only was there a class of -- a money class, but definitely religion.</span> <span id="s1292">And -- I mean in -- in the Yorkville section of -- of New York, you can see the Hungarian Catholics, and the Hungarian Jews, and the Hungarian Protestants.</span> <span id="s1293">And -- And the people that became friendly with each other were the people that were of the same class in Europe, and never the twain shall meet.</span> <span id="s1294">In Hungarian, there are three -- oh God, I really am losing it now.</span> <span id="s1295">It’s not the -- like in France, there’s -- do you speak French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Tu, and vous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: What do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Formal, informal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Formal, informal.</span> <span id="s1302">In Hungarian there’s a third one.</span> <span id="s1303">It gets very complicated.</span> <span id="s1304">The informal would be like, to very good friends or children.</span> <span id="s1305">The formal would be to teachers, and parents, and all of that.</span> <span id="s1306">Then there’s a third one that you would speak to -- with lower class or upper class.</span> <span id="s1307">I mean, I can’t describe it to you, but like a housekeeper would use a different way of speaking to, than -- and so -- and that still exists, and it’s very interesting, because people will remain in that category of behavior, and it’s not that -- anything that’s expected or -- or anything in today’s world, but it still exists.</span> <span id="s1308">And my parents, and a lot of their friends, that -- some people they met here, some people they knew from Europe, they came here -- they came here maybe with a little bit of money because they had visas where there was visitors, or perman -- mostly visitors, and then they applied for a permanent, and eventually became citizens.</span> <span id="s1309">But 80 or 90 percent of my mother’s friends became majorly, majorly successful.</span> <span id="s1310">Speaking with accents, not speaking very good English, and a lot of them became import, export business, in the toy building, and the gift building.</span> <span id="s1311">Some attorneys went back to school.</span> <span id="s1312">There was a Hungarian Jewish doctor’s association.</span> <span id="s1313">Not Hungarian Catholic, Hungarian Jewish.</span> <span id="s1314">And I’m sure there was another one also.</span> <span id="s1315">But they were very class conscious on every -- on every level.</span> <span id="s1316">And then the next group of people that came, it was 1956, and that was referred to as the 1956, as those people really came with just the clothes on their back, because they were escaping after the revolution.</span> <span id="s1317">And even some of those people have done extremely well.</span> <span id="s1318">So, especially the Jews that came to this country, the educated Jews, had a tremendous thirst for success again, and most of -- a businessman is a businessman, if he can sell that, he can sell this.</span> <span id="s1319">And that’s exactly what -- what happened.</span> <span id="s1320">I mean, historically, even in -- even in government, I mean, there’s some Hungarians, and for a little country, that’s amazing, to be prominent people on Wall Street, and in business, and politics, that have come out of it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: So it was essentially upper class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Your family was essentially upper class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Do you consider yourself a classist now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: No.</span> <span id="s1327">But on the other hand, I’m not poor, you know.</span> <span id="s1328">I -- It’s -- It’s a different world today, so it’s -- it’s -- I was much more aware of it there than I am here.</span> <span id="s1329">I have friends that are -- have much more than I, and I have friends that have much less.</span> <span id="s1330">But I think -- and this is probably true everywhere, I mean, people seem to put you in -- into a box, because of where you live, the car you drive, whatever it is you do, you know?</span> <span id="s1331">So it’s sort of hard to get away from it.</span> <span id="s1332">Do I pick people?</span> <span id="s1333">No, that way, because of class.</span> <span id="s1334">But the behavior of the European class system is very different than it is here.</span> <span id="s1335">And it probably -- maybe not so much now, but I think it probably still exists a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: In your head, when you meet somebody, do you -- do you go through which form of language you should use?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1338">I only speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: But I mean, do you do a kind of mental shift?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1341">No, that I definitely don’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: [indecipherable] that is you -- you work at the Whitney now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1344">I work there as a volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Yeah, just as a mem -- membership, I try to get people to join.</span> <span id="s1347">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: You sit at the desk and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: We sit at the desk, yeah, and tell people where to go, have dinner, where to park their car, where the Guggenheim is, how to take the subway, you know.</span> <span id="s1350">And just schmooze with them, and hope to sell a -- a membership.</span> <span id="s1351">The difference w -- I was just thinking what you said about class, the big difference is, in Europe, where they came from, and their breeding from before is of equal importance.</span> <span id="s1352">Here, that’s not the case.</span> <span id="s1353">I -- Maybe to some people, but you meet people usually on an equal footing, and whether they came from a poor background or a rich background is -- doesn’t become an issue in the friendship, where as it does in Europe.</span> <span id="s1354">I think probably where you came from is more important than how much money you have.</span> <span id="s1355">I think -- maybe this is my generalization, but I think here, money is more important.</span> <span id="s1356">I think in Europe, at least I had that sense, that your background, or your education was more important than -- money couldn’t buy you into places in Europe.</span> <span id="s1357">It can here.</span> <span id="s1358">That’s -- So there’s a different, I mean, it’s probably the same thing, but they come from a different approach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Do you have both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Do you have both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Yeah, I mean, I’d like -- I don’t like to think I think about it either way, but it exists, because it’s -- I was just telling somebody the other day that it’s amazing how if you meet somebody, and they go to an Ivy League school -- I mean, we’re talking people in their 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s, how, before the end of the evening, somehow or other, they will mention having gone to Harvard or Princeton.</span> <span id="s1363">And, you know, that was a while back.</span> <span id="s1364">They don’t mention city college.</span> <span id="s1365">So, it still is important to whoever it’s important to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: How long have you been volunteering at the Whitney?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Oh, over 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1370">Actually probably mo -- a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Volunteering -- the idea that you’re volunteering important?</span> <span id="s1372">That notion, that you’re giving something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1374">I think actually I -- I should be doing more than I am right now.</span> <span id="s1375">I used to do much more, but I didn’t mention, but we spend our winter in the Caribbean, and so we -- we’re away so much, that every time I sort of get involved, I don’t like to volunteer, and not take that as seriously as if I had a paying job, so I don’t like to pop in and pop out.</span> <span id="s1376">So, when I started this, it was with the understanding that I can my slot back, and I can be replaced for the three months.</span> <span id="s1377">But then, I do take it very seriously.</span> <span id="s1378">Cause we’re away during the summer, and I come in for my spot every week.</span> <span id="s1379">But I think it’s -- giving back is -- is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Where do you go in the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Connecticut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: [indecipherable] where in the Caribbean do you go in winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Saint Thomas.</span> <span id="s1384">But that’s really -- I mean, it sounds pretty good, and it’s not bad, but my husband’s business is in Saint Thomas.</span> <span id="s1385">He used to live there full time, we used to live there full time for awhile.</span> <span id="s1386">So when we’re there, he has an office, and -- and most of his business is in the Caribbean.</span> <span id="s1387">And it’s a nice place, my grandchildren come to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: This once again concludes the interview with Eva Cooper,
