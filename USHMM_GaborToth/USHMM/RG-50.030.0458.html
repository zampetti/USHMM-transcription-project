Good morning, Ginetta.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: Good morning, Joan, and thank you for coming and doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Thank you, thank you for having us here -- thank you for having me, I’m not an us.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you first just tell us when and where you were born?</span> <span id="s16">Let’s stop -- we -- I just heard the --</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Right, Ginetta, te -- can you give us your official date of birth, and where you were born?</span> <span id="s19">Yes, I was born in -- near Milan, in a little place called San Columbano Olumbro, little f-fatsioni of Milan, now it’s a little village, on June first, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And can you tell us something about the life that you led before you got into the Resistance?</span> <span id="s21">Yo -- I know that it was a rather complicated and interesting time for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life.</span> <span id="s23">And one of our circle of frien -- the circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist, and all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party.</span> <span id="s24">Yes, Jewish, but the Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist.</span> <span id="s25">It just happened that many of the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical.</span> <span id="s26">Until 1938, it wasn’t too difficult.</span> <span id="s27">Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in Italy, there was a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that.</span> <span id="s28">And yet, the discussion I vaguely remember, in our circle of friends, particularly when we went to the mountains, climbed everythi -- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political issues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution.</span> <span id="s29">The general atmosphere was that even some intellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that was 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were -- yes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a good time.</span> <span id="s30">I was touched by it.</span> <span id="s31">At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to look for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the refuge, and -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by educated people, but there were also a farmer who taught i-il pladoni, Mussolini didn’t have much hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy.</span> <span id="s32">He is doing -- you know, why is he doing this, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that?</span> <span id="s33">And then, in the discussions, and as I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were personal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to refugi for hikes.</span> <span id="s34">Near the lake of Como, there were mountains called Laigreenai, and there were refuges where we went, and we had to carry our food in the back.</span> <span id="s35">Ex -- there were some supplies left there, brought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes.</span> <span id="s36">But -- and the farmer would have milk, a -- etcetera.</span> <span id="s37">And then we would hike, and then the discussions.</span> <span id="s38">Yes, there was discussion of movies, there was discussion of theater, there was discussion of opera.</span> <span id="s39">There were discussion of work in the factories.</span> <span id="s40">There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found -- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to work.</span> <span id="s41">Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions.</span> <span id="s42">“Hey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don’t like the German.”</span> <span id="s43">Well, I didn’t like when they said, “I don’t like the German,” generally.</span> <span id="s44">I made -- and my parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the pro-Nazi and the German.</span> <span id="s45">And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some German people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the upper class.</span> <span id="s46">And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti-Fascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews.</span> <span id="s47">And it just happened that many intellectual were also Jewish.</span> <span id="s48">At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated discussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a concentration camp, to put those people in.</span> <span id="s49">It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant.</span> <span id="s50">The -- some of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were aware of the Fascist party having a special tribunal, i-i -- where the Fascist didn’t have courts of law for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in Italy, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then, they were against both.</span> <span id="s51">And instead of a court of law, with judges, which of course many of the f -- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the special tribunal could condemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect, the special tribunal had the special Italian Secret Police, called Ovra, O-v-r-a, to investigate the suspect.</span> <span id="s52">And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn’t go up climbing, we couldn’t go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I mean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the Ovra could pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work, whether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were talking about some people were killed, executed.</span> <span id="s53">Some people were sent to what was known -- oh, some people to San Vittory prison, something, somebody sent to remote area in Italy, where these people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family, except maybe once a year, twice a year, I can’t remember correctly.</span> <span id="s54">But they were deprived of the mail, very rarely they could have the mail.</span> <span id="s55">They could only receive visits from the family very rarely.</span> <span id="s56">In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in San Vittory, or sent to these remote area, there was the attempt to isolate them from society, deprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends.</span> <span id="s57">And the special tribunal had the power to do that, in Italy.</span> <span id="s58">But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and again I didn’t understand very clearly, except in Dachau was a place, after 1933, where priest, Socialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about the judicial system being damaged.</span> <span id="s59">The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function.</span> <span id="s60">That meant that it became very arbitrary, also.</span> <span id="s61">And I also remember that both in Italy, and I mention, in Germany, if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you know, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow.</span> <span id="s62">Now, that picture of the special tribunal, those memory of San Vittory, the exiled, it remained with me forever, for as long as I remember.</span> <span id="s63">But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy.</span> <span id="s64">There was country, the -- the hikes in the mountains, seldom we went to the sea.</span> <span id="s65">Occasionally we went to a place called Paylee, and I learned how to watch the farm -- the fisherman to bring in the fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and the parsley, and I wasn’t cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French eating, but mountains were the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s66">Short weekend was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s67">And, in addition to climbing, and we met -- we knew the Pastore, who had this wonderful bitar and then the cow, and they made the fresh cheese, and there was be -- song, in spite of the difficulty.</span> <span id="s68">Now, the people --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: It was what?</span> <span id="s70">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Difficulties, in spite of the difficulties --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: -- there was joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: And the mountain club, the Italian mountain club, was a social equalizer.</span> <span id="s76">There were intellectual, very wealthy people.</span> <span id="s77">Papa Bolla was the president of the Italian mountain club, the whole family, Leala, Rico.</span> <span id="s78">He was a businessman.</span> <span id="s79">The Sturani -- nobility, Count and Countess Sturani, and then the worker from the factories.</span> <span id="s80">There were engineer, there were geometry impligati clerks.</span> <span id="s81">And, of course, we met th-the wifes, and the children participate.</span> <span id="s82">In fact, in one particular refuge Pialeral, we built it.</span> <span id="s83">And we had to maintain it, and you had to walk, after you arrived with funicular above Como, you had to walk for four hours carrying your knapsack, and as I said, in summer they had donkey that they brought durable goods.</span> <span id="s84">But otherwise, y -- and then you just roam around, and in winter it was skiing, but not the skiing of today, where you go up and down, up and down, can’t stand that.</span> <span id="s85">Th -- the skiing was for sightseeing, for enjoy -- now, non-vacation was different.</span> <span id="s86">Then, we went to -- went to Nash, we went to Cherbania, and there was one funicular at that time, and we went up to anolder tel colostum becko, and that again was a reunion place.</span> <span id="s87">Summer was hiking all over, climbing.</span> <span id="s88">And I began climbing with my parents and guides.</span> <span id="s89">They were very strict about guides.</span> <span id="s90">You don’t go up in the mountains unprepared, because the mountains, like the sea is very harsh, can be very difficult, so you have to be prepared.</span> <span id="s91">And then we refuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What does that -- what does that mean, refuge?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Refuge -- refuge?</span> <span id="s94">Well, huts where you bring your supply.</span> <span id="s95">You melt the snow with Sterno, to make [inaudible], and you bring dry fruits, and a pinyotta.</span> <span id="s96">Pinyotta are dry cracker, but very hard on your teeth, you better have good teeth, or else you are in trouble.</span> <span id="s97">And, of course, the first day or so, you have fresh fruit also, but -- and, for the first day or two, you have slice of rosto polarose, but then you drive everything, and whatever.</span> <span id="s98">It was fun, it was climbing, it was hiki -- i-i -- picotsa, if there was a snow, you use the ice pick, as -- la picotsa, I think.</span> <span id="s99">You had the scarponi, and so you go to refuge -- let’s take an example, from Shamoni, this was not -- this was Shamoni, you go to -- by train to Ajohntierre.</span> <span id="s100">Ajohntierre you start hiking, I remember cutting it, sta -- to your refuge, le refuge de Ajohntierre, and you spend the night there, and the -- often the refuge can offer polenta, or zupa -- soup, or polenta, occasionally risotto, but really polenta is more [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s101">Also, they made, f-fontina [indecipherable], fontina toma.</span> <span id="s102">So polenta was fontina toma, all fresh, goat cheese, or fresh whatever there was.</span> <span id="s103">And you spent the night.</span> <span id="s104">And it’s wonderful because there is a camaraderie, I think is the word.</span> <span id="s105">Easy.</span> <span id="s106">Young people talk, talk about theaters and movie, talk about the love, talk about this, talk about that.</span> <span id="s107">The serious people talk about -- yes, some politics, or is -- Italian are very yeah, yeah, yeah, talk politics great deal.</span> <span id="s108">But, also talk about traveling, talk about culture, talking about booksa, talking about history, talking about the meaning of some opera, for example.</span> <span id="s109">And I remember in -- in Ajohntierre, we’re talking about a performance in Paris of Don Carlos, and how Verdi had a -- really used opera to express the essence of repression, a religious repression.</span> <span id="s110">The burning, the -- and then there were discussion over -- on religion, for example, because at that time, Voltaire was a prohibited author by the church.</span> <span id="s111">So needless to say, we talk about Voltaire, and -- and also, the press was controlled.</span> <span id="s112">I must confess that at that time, I was far more interested in boys and girls, I was far more interested in the mountains, far more interested in having fun, and I had a good friend at that time, that I knew when I was seven, and he was 11, and he -- I heard all this, and I paid some attentions, but I must confess that my attention at that time, when I was so young, was in the mountains, in the fu -- wildflower.</span> <span id="s113">I was crazy about wildflower, I -- I -- we went, as family and friends, to do le narche zarta, which meant we went to the refuge, and then we picked, very carefully, a bouquet of -- it’s daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very perfume, not cheesy.</span> <span id="s114">And you are taught conservation from day one.</span> <span id="s115">And again, in the mountains you talk about planning.</span> <span id="s116">Let’s go for a narche zarta in Como next spring.</span> <span id="s117">We take the picnic, we go.</span> <span id="s118">Some people work for Las meerbiscoza for factories.</span> <span id="s119">What we discovered -- and while we were talking about fun in mountain, there was a great deal of politics all the time.</span> <span id="s120">Now, the best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist.</span> <span id="s121">Anti-Fascist, many of them.</span> <span id="s122">And being Communist, but after having been in the prison of Mussolini with the Communists, they changed.</span> <span id="s123">They followed the lead of two people, that I didn’t know, and I be -- who started a movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother.</span> <span id="s124">And they were talking about the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the Stalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes, Socialism, yes, a just society, due process of law.</span> <span id="s125">That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi all the time, Contamessa -- Rainso Contamessa.</span> <span id="s126">Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no military judges, like the special tribunal.</span> <span id="s127">So there was this combination of hat -- la -- Ajohntierre was one.</span> <span id="s128">And then we went home sometime for two weeks, from refuge to refuge, refuge to refuge, and guides, always guides.</span> <span id="s129">But you have the leisure of enjoying something very much, with a diversified company, from student, and young children, to factory worker, engineer, lawyer, professor, doctors, a-academic, some very serious were very angry about the academician who had signed the Nazi manifesto for 1938 duration of Mussolini.</span> <span id="s130">And all in good humor, even those who were accused of being -- you are a damn fa -- you are an Fascist stonase, c’est une cretino, c’est qui -- the next day we climbed together, we ate together, we -- you know, it was not vindictive, it was not nasty -- yes, there were bursts of recrimination, but it didn’t become so sickening that hate, a -- hate --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Wh-Why do you think that was so?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I don’t know, to these days.</span> <span id="s133">Perhaps that question should be given to psychiatrists, or other.</span> <span id="s134">I believe then the Italian culture, with so many occupation, for centuries, by so many countries -- you know, remember in Sicily, the Swedes were there.</span> <span id="s135">In fact, there was a beautiful poem called, “Curradino dis vetsia.”</span> <span id="s136">And I have never forgotten a small part of that poem.</span> <span id="s137">The poem referred to a mother, in switzer -- in -- in swede -- in sw -- in Sweden.</span> <span id="s138">You see, in springtime, a swallow return, and the mother ask the swallow what coming -- was coming from ita -- from the south, “Dimi iveesto il filio meo,” Tell me, have you seen my son, who was sent to fight in Sicily?</span> <span id="s139">And the swallow answered, “Si, no veesto, erabuendo, erabianco, sotolarko diontempio era saipporto.”</span> <span id="s140">Yes, I saw him.</span> <span id="s141">He was blonde, he was white, under the arch of a temple he was buried.</span> <span id="s142">And I remember the discussions around that poem, and I’ve always remembered that poem because it emphasized the commonality of human being, but here it was from Sweden invading Sicily, and then of course, we had the Berber invading, and the French, and the Austrian invasions.</span> <span id="s143">And each invader brought destructions, pain, suffering, but also the need for some people to get together and help each other.</span> <span id="s144">And I have a feeling that that common bondage of seeing so much suffering, and [indecipherable] destruction the pope’s rector, in Italy one must -- I mean, there were powers, and corrupt, and -- so ou -- in one sense you were devout Catholic, went to church, you practice.</span> <span id="s145">You had also many skeptics, and the selling of the images, and all those things, were discussed, I mean, they talked about everything.</span> <span id="s146">The mountains was a teaching place, because of the situation that here you are up in a refuge, and you’re having your time, but I don’t [indecipherable] leisure to talk and think.</span> <span id="s147">Not that I understood very well everything, far from it.</span> <span id="s148">But it’s amazing how later things seems to connect.</span> <span id="s149">And I remember when they were talking about the special tribunal, the prisoner in San Vittory, the persecution of the family.</span> <span id="s150">The injustice of having a judicial system with three military judges who had the power to bring in everybody to i -- to interrogate, intimidate, frighten friends, family, butcher, maid, you name it.</span> <span id="s151">And I thought, how can they do that?</span> <span id="s152">And yet, there was the other side of helper all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Helper?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Helpers, all the time in San Vittory, which was a prison for criminal, and for political prisoners.</span> <span id="s155">And the political prisoner, I think Grandshe may have also been there, they had a great deal of help from the suaray.</span> <span id="s156">First of all, the sister were there, the doctors.</span> <span id="s157">And the suaray play, a -- were nurses at the time.</span> <span id="s158">And inside -- and these were people hired by the Fascist party, but we always found people -- the bakers, God bless the bakers -- we always found people who could help.</span> <span id="s159">I have the feeling, listening from the discussion, from my parents, from Enrico [indecipherable], all those people, that in Italy, it was easier to help than it was possible to do in aust -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s160">In -- i-in Nazi Germany, they in fact, destroyed all of the antique -- Nazi -- much more easily than they could in Italy, and I think it may have to do something -- but again, I’m not a historian, I’m a re -- an ordinary woman.</span> <span id="s161">My feeling, listening to the other, was that the German were cultured, music, but also disciplinarian.</span> <span id="s162">And they treated children with il maganello, with a stick, as they grew up.</span> <span id="s163">And therefore, that could have had an influence in the rigidity of behavior of that particular -- of -- of the German, that although there was resistance by some in the church, by intellectual, like Bunoffer, but, in the resistance had networks, mostly of Communists, and Socialists.</span> <span id="s164">They were wiped out.</span> <span id="s165">They didn’t have the support than their counterpart in Italy had from the general population.</span> <span id="s166">And we split, within the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Could -- could you just give -- give me a sense of your education beyond the more -- somewhat more formal education, because I think it’s very interesting that you had such a wide and cultured education at a very young age, and it seems to me it must have influenced you as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, first I had to work very hard, and studying.</span> <span id="s169">It’s okay to have fun, but you study.</span> <span id="s170">And I had a -- oh, for two years, when we lived in this place, which was called Santangelo de Jarno, I had -- and I lived with a family -- my family, but als -- came very often, but I also had this wonderful family who was Istytotwiss.</span> <span id="s171">And yes, I went to school in the elementary year, and I had marvelous teacher.</span> <span id="s172">Her name was Bentivania Lucia, and then she married a man whose name was Negrini.</span> <span id="s173">And I think they were anti-Fascist, but in school, the subject, history, writing, reading, she was very good, and just marvelous.</span> <span id="s174">She would inspire her student to do the best.</span> <span id="s175">Still, when we had to do the essay, we had to praise Mussolini, and -- and she did that with a wooden face.</span> <span id="s176">So we had to write our essay, how wonderful Mussolini was, and then in, I believe was ‘35, but you should check, when he went to Ethiopia, there was a horror in my -- all our circle about Mussolini invading Abyssinia, was called at that time, dropping poison.</span> <span id="s177">And the Duca da Oustar, a family wi -- a -- being there too, I mean, there was a tremendous dispute.</span> <span id="s178">Mussolini, of course, wanted an empair -- em-em-em-empire.</span> <span id="s179">The king went along with it, that idiot -- excuse the expression.</span> <span id="s180">If I understood correctly, the queen -- the wife was absolutely opposed to Mussolini, to his enterprise.</span> <span id="s181">She was born in Montenegro, Elena, and was a -- from what I’ve heard -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Tape one, side B. I’m sorry Ginetta.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s184">Now, in [indecipherable] circle of friends, the rutsini -- the rutsini [indecipherable] rutsini were the parents of Mary Mullisanno.</span> <span id="s185">Mary Mullisanno was married to Enrico Mullisanno.</span> <span id="s186">Enrico Mullisanno’s brother was Pigi Mullisanno, who was married to a wonderful woman called Marcella.</span> <span id="s187">Now, the rutsini were from monarchy, the Mullisanno were anti-Fascist, anti-king, is an idiot.</span> <span id="s188">But also they were praising his wife for her intelligence, for training her children to be useful in society, and not just idiots.</span> <span id="s189">In other word, they felt very strongly that -- the Mullisanno -- that the king was not worth anything.</span> <span id="s190">I mean, yeah -- yeah, he was -- he went along with Mussolini, and critical, went along with signing the law, went along going to Abyssinia, went along with everything, and eventually went along with Mussolini becoming allies of the German, and al -- went along when Mussolini invaded France in 1940, and throughout that, while the rutsini always defended the king, and bi -- praising the queen, of course, and the children, etcetera.</span> <span id="s191">The Mullisanno said, the king goes along with Mussolini, so he’s equally responsible, and -- and ya -- that -- that kind of -- so, it was a fairment of ideas.</span> <span id="s192">The essay we did in school had to reflect acceptance of Mussolini party line.</span> <span id="s193">And it was obvious that the teacher was very skeptical, but she had to do it.</span> <span id="s194">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s195">Then when I went home, I had to redo the whole damn thing -- excuse the expression.</span> <span id="s196">You know, I s -- what did you do today?</span> <span id="s197">And I said, well that’s what we did, that Mussolini went to Abyssinia to re-vindicate the destiny of Italy, I mean all that rhetoric, pretending the Fasci romani as if he had become -- a-and naming the king eventually, when the war was over, and [indecipherable] it was such a -- such a awful thing, that I was -- I learned that all this parade was -- was a charade, and although you couldn’t speak in public, among friend, that was discussed all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: But your parents then -- then asked you to rewrite your essay?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s200">So, you can see -- then, meanwhile I also had to learn in French, I had to -- but -- and there were wonderful travels.</span> <span id="s201">Paris was a place, and -- and I’m glad I learned French.</span> <span id="s202">History was very important, literature was very important, and victory go -- Montaigne, Monsieur Montaigne, wi -- Pascal.</span> <span id="s203">I am glad I did, as well as Italian literature, as well as Italian poetry, like Danté, an old Italian.</span> <span id="s204">I-I am glad I did.</span> <span id="s205">I didn’t understand as fully as my parents thought that I should.</span> <span id="s206">Who can understand Dostoyevsky when you are so young?</span> <span id="s207">You know, the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s208">But, I read them, and they always said, “One day, when you are 40, you will have to reread them all over again.”</span> <span id="s209">But meanwhile, I di -- I had to do it, and history was important, literature was important, and the Greek, as well as the Roman.</span> <span id="s210">The lives -- Plutark’s lives of the Greek, and the Roman.</span> <span id="s211">And that was becan -- but that was also discussed among the people with who -- if we are stuck in the refuge one day, or discuss Cicero, [indecipherable] that was part of growing up, somehow, and -- and looking back, it was a good education.</span> <span id="s212">Looking at what my children got in the school in Atherton, California, and before, they don’t have education.</span> <span id="s213">They don’t have history, except some minor history.</span> <span id="s214">American history, which is very important, they should study more.</span> <span id="s215">I’m -- we -- in other word, I could only understand how fortunate I was, how rich our -- and I’m talking about ours, not just my -- they gives you, in spite of Fascism, in spite of a dictatorship, in spite of the war, they give you a -- a -- a little richer background to understand lives, to understand other country, to understand other culture, to understand politics.</span> <span id="s216">And -- and I guess from that respect, I felt I was a fortunate woman -- now, I mean, in the last 15 - 20 years, I understood what a fortunate person I -- I have been, too.</span> <span id="s217">So, the life in -- in Italy was a happy one, until really the war started -- the -- ’38 was the beginning of difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Can you describe that -- that change in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, the first thing was that you have to be very careful never to say anything, and it’s kind of hiding, without hiding.</span> <span id="s220">And you know, you have to be careful only with your friend, don’t say anything to anybody else, don’t discuss politics, don’t discuss the racial law, don’t discuss anything about the fact that the Jewish people now are discriminated against, they cannot go to the library, they cannot go to -- t-to -- in certain profession they are removed from the profession.</span> <span id="s221">People could not practice medicine or law, and -- and the Jewish children could not go to the library, or to the regular school.</span> <span id="s222">Can you imagine if you are going to a regular school in this country, and you are told sometime very nicely, sometime by people who felt pain in saying that, and sometime not so nicely, but you cannot come back?</span> <span id="s223">And then children taunt -- tau -- te -- you know, mock other children, who are Jewish, but not as many as I learned was happening in France, or other country, and that I learned it from other people.</span> <span id="s224">Because in Italy, there was this mockery, but not mean, mean, mean, except by the Fascist, and there were not so bi -- so many which are vehement about the issue.</span> <span id="s225">So Italy had a -- had had an integration of the Jewish people with Italian, lots of intermarriage.</span> <span id="s226">Nobody thought about that until Mussolini did that in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: But Mussolini was in power in 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: ’22.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So ’38 changed something quite radically.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And was that the racial laws that made the change?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: The racial law, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s233">I think when Mussolini adopted the racial law, it was a turmoil within the society, and also the special tribunal, the political pers-persecution.</span> <span id="s234">In the jail, in San Vittory, and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those places where people were sent, and I remember my parents, my friends saying, imagine if you’re a doctor, a lawyer, a philosopher, a sociolo -- an intellectual.</span> <span id="s235">Also well as a worker who is organizing for the Communist party, or the Socialist party.</span> <span id="s236">They didn’t persecute the [indecipherable] party, not very much.</span> <span id="s237">But those people are deprived of all contact, family, friends, reading.</span> <span id="s238">I mean, those people read newspaper, republication, often they w -- spoke other language, like English, and French, and others.</span> <span id="s239">Imagine being deprived of everything?</span> <span id="s240">And be isolated, and you haven’t done anything wrong, you’re innocent.</span> <span id="s241">And then when the special tribunal even sentenced people to death.</span> <span id="s242">And there were women, also, who had been condemned to that.</span> <span id="s243">Now, some women, I understood -- and again, one should do research on that -- I understood that some women were sent south, a-and they -- sometime they were hired by well-to-do family, as maid.</span> <span id="s244">But they were separated from their family, their children, their husband, who say, if you didn’t -- if you stayed at home and you took care of me and the children, you did not have to worry about that.</span> <span id="s245">And some were kind.</span> <span id="s246">There are some cases where I heard that the woman who gave them the job, was very sympathetic, very supportive, very helpful, particularly when during the visit, the ha -- she saw the husband treating the wife, because -- if you stayed at home, you wouldn’t have had this, and you have th -- you caused me so much grief.</span> <span id="s247">I have to cook, you caused your children so much pain, and blah, blah, blah, and she became very supportive of this exiled woman.</span> <span id="s248">Now, I don’t know about the [indecipherable] cases, you know, one should look into -- into that, but it struck me once again human being are capable of great love, human being are capable of great caring, concern, and there are some who’re not.</span> <span id="s249">And my feeling at the time, when I learned from my parents, from my friends, from the people I was surrounded with, was that it makes a difference if you’re persecuted, and there are people who cares about you.</span> <span id="s250">And that began with a basket of roasted chicken, and thing that -- fruits -- and other -- than my parents, and other, brought to San Vittory at the prison, and -- and also to people who are very poor, because there was a great deal of poverty at that time, and Mussolini was encouraging women to have a lot of children -- a lot of children to provide sons to go to war, essentially, cause he was always in t -- trying that, and -- and things were bad, but then, when Mussolini met Hitler someplace, I think it was the Brenner Pass, and must have been close to the beginning of the war, maybe a couple of years earlier, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s251">Again, the propaganda was all in the hand of the Fascist [indecipherable] and the radio, there was no television.</span> <span id="s252">Osana about the alliance between Mussolini, and -- and at that time, the open hostility and contempt for the Jews, the propaganda began, to the point when Jewish people began really to es -- try to escape, to get abroad, to -- but what struck me was, when we went [indecipherable] within smuggles, and friends, and the biter, the Pastore, you know, the enormous compassion, and the enormous anger at wik Fascistoni -- there was -- were Fascistoni means big Fascist.</span> <span id="s253">Because before, many people had accepted -- they were against the alliance with Germany from day one, because of the memory of World War One, because when German and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner, farmer family treated them well.</span> <span id="s254">Apparently, when the Italian prisoner of the German came back, they had horrible story to tell.</span> <span id="s255">I was too young, but I have heard from -- from -- one we thing that happened at that time, that has remained with me very vividly, about wars, the occupation, that I mention so many French, Austrian, Berber, Swedish, that si -- that the memory of the occupation by the Austrian was very vivid when I was a child, because after all, Milan was occupied by them.</span> <span id="s256">The Aousta family, Piedmont -- regained Piedmont, the Aousta family, in 1849.</span> <span id="s257">Then, in 1859, is when finally Lombardy was freed.</span> <span id="s258">You know, if -- andre dios is nothing in human history, but my parents took me to see a little chapel in Lombardy not very far from Milan, in the countryside, and there are many of such chapel throughout Lombardy and Piedmont.</span> <span id="s259">And these little chapel, plain, there is usually an image of some saint or something [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s260">Then there is a grate, and inside the grate, there are bones.</span> <span id="s261">And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds, either in Piedmont, or Lombardy, people who died in the war in 1848, in 1858 - ’59.</span> <span id="s262">And the farmer found so many, then they erected this little chapel as a memorial to the people who died, but that memorial is a reminder that war is a horrible thing, and -- and people sometime bring matsolini di furey.</span> <span id="s263">If you pick up some poppy, and bachelor button, and -- you know, and it’s a ca -- and then there is a -- a charo, there is a -- a candle, you know, those -- and then they put, and -- and this is done spontaneously, nobody is in charge.</span> <span id="s264">But my parents reminded me then, this was a way to remember those horror, and hopefully it doesn’t happen again, but they also talk about Hitler, and Mussolini, but they also talk about Stalin.</span> <span id="s265">They felt that Stalin, and Hitler, but like this, Mussolini was considered a buffoon, less ideological, although he did put nula osta to the deportation.</span> <span id="s266">And it was not until after the war, when I met Angela Dinati, then we talk about the role of Italian Army of occupation in Greece, in Yugoslavia, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s267">Now, already were -- throughout the world, there were letter coming from soldier Italian, in Albania, in Yugoslavia, and they crying the horror of the Nazi death camp, through letters, which, although there was censorship, nevertheless, it was brought out, and everybody talked about it.</span> <span id="s268">It was like one of those telegram -- verbal telegram tree, then everybody -- no.</span> <span id="s269">Admittedly, the retay may have been difficult.</span> <span id="s270">An interesting thing happened.</span> <span id="s271">Italy had censorship, but many Italian censor made a point of passing some of the material to the anti-Fascist groups, and probably also to the church, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s272">I only know the anti-Fascist leadership, Communist, or Socialist, parti [indecipherable], were recipient of those letters from Italian soldier who decried the horror of Italian being associated with the German in this horrib -- horrendous enterprise.</span> <span id="s273">It’s against all the Italian history, culture, ence religious figure [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s274">And that’s where the split in the religious community took place.</span> <span id="s275">And the ambiguity, and the lack of clarity, with the exception of some priests, who actually gave their lives.</span> <span id="s276">Norman Zofti, I think was his name.</span> <span id="s277">One priest in Milan, I know that he was shot in a -- in a place in Milan, that’s a-another -- another period, but it was during the occupation.</span> <span id="s278">But again, there was this divisions, and of course there were many skeptics, although they were Catholic, and there were many Catholic who did everything to help the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s279">But they couldn’t give back the jobs, the jobs were taken away.</span> <span id="s280">You know, the professor of the university were removed, and doctor were -- yes, they practiced, but i-in official universe medical school, etcetera, it was the Catholic doctor who took over, and some of them were wonderful, and some of them found even way to send patients to this Jewish doctor, so then they could make some money.</span> <span id="s281">But above all, it was a time to begin looking for safe places.</span> <span id="s282">I’m going to take a break, because I have to go to the bathroom, but I also want to show you that little red book, because two years ago, three years ago, when I went back to the -- to Milan, and I went to the archive with the cardinal -- we [indecipherable] then I ask Julianna, would she please take me to see some of the conven -- the churches, and the farm in -- where we used to hide people, and also the confessional, where -- the place where we could exchange message with sympathetic priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Okay, let’s take -- let’s take a break.</span> <span id="s284">We’re back from our break, we all -- we took a walk in the beautiful garden.</span> <span id="s285">Ginetta, I wanted to ask you, when the racial laws were promulgated in 1938, did you actually -- you were what, 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: 13 - 14 - 15 years old.</span> <span id="s288">So did you feel the real difference that happened when Mussolini is moving towards an alliance with Hitler, and when the racial laws came in, did you feel that, did you understand what was happening, that there was a real difference from you had experienced before under -- under Mussolini?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Not fully.</span> <span id="s290">Not fully, and there was that sense of uneasiness.</span> <span id="s291">There was s -- you know, you play with other children, and some -- very few, but -- would make some comments about Jews.</span> <span id="s292">I would say there was a quiet sense of fear, a little bit, uneasiness, uncertitude.</span> <span id="s293">Your world had changed.</span> <span id="s294">It seems that you had to be careful about everything.</span> <span id="s295">That carefree wonderful feeling, yes, there will be uneasiness, for a [indecipherable] something changed, and I cannot describe it very well, except there was a sense of uneasiness, and probably looking back, hidden fears.</span> <span id="s296">You are not fully -- not fully understand why, but it’s there.</span> <span id="s297">And then, a-as I said, we read the newspaper, we listened to the radio, and of course, we didn’t believe in it, but the propaganda was there, day after day after day.</span> <span id="s298">And I do remember that we listened to the BBC hiding in the cellar, because it was against the law.</span> <span id="s299">The other thing that my parents always did, and friends always did, every time they went to Switzerland skiing, like from bart to lunch, going to Zermot, etcetera, they always tried to bring back a -- a pass from other countries, and I tell you, you do develop a love for the free press when you -- you pass it around from one to the other, and then -- oh, you only have t -- one day, then you have to give it to the other.</span> <span id="s300">It was just that, if you are afirmati, you were so famished for news, which were not the propaganda lying of the Fascist.</span> <span id="s301">And I -- I ha -- you know, I -- I believed then one of the reason I treasured article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was freedom of expression, which I still believe is one of civilization highest achievement.</span> <span id="s302">Now [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Shall we take a break?</span> <span id="s304">Yes, someone has entered the house, and we’re going to take a break.</span> <span id="s305">Okay, we’re now back from our second little break, and I -- a friend of Ginetta’s brought in a Amnesty International award that has a -- some of the barbed wire from the escape experiences, and we’ll talk about that later.</span> <span id="s306">Ginetta, I wanted to ask you, di -- when you were in school, did you n -- did you notice the Jewish kids who were not able to be in school any more?</span> <span id="s307">Any of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes, and that was a time when, actually, we moved to a place, at first, called San Columbano Olumbro, and went to another school for two years, new teacher, new s -- kids.</span> <span id="s311">That -- the principal of that school was a friend of my mother, and apparently she is the one who suggested that we move from this place called -- I think was called Grafeenyella.</span> <span id="s312">At first I had completed five grades, but secondly, she helped my parents to choose a place where probably we would have been more comfortable.</span> <span id="s313">And so we went for two years, a new school, new everything, and then two years later, we moved again to another place called Santangelo lo dejarno, but my parents at the time lived separately from me.</span> <span id="s314">They left me with a wonderful istydutris, a beautiful house --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: What is -- can you explain what an is --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Istydutris means a woman who is in charge of my education, teach -- continuing to teach me literature, French.</span> <span id="s317">And her name was Angeletta Souvinagi, an anti-Fascist.</span> <span id="s318">Her brother worked in Milan someplace, a -- but she loved music, and -- and of course, every weekend I would see my parents, but meanwhile I was being, quote, educated.</span> <span id="s319">I didn’t understand fully until later, that it was a one way for me to be protected somehow.</span> <span id="s320">It was such a difficult period, it’s hard to describe.</span> <span id="s321">So, but I did get a wonderful education, number one, wonderful place to live, and with my parents cooperation, Angeletta Souvinagi developed -- they bought -- they built a chicken coops, one for white chicken, Leghorn, and one for red chicken called Rhode Island, and there the rooster.</span> <span id="s322">And they also built a -- oh, oh -- I -- remo -- remodel a place, I really don’t know, but I had to learn how to feed chicken, and the feedera to mix the various ingredient, and then experiment with the white -- with the feeding white chicken, with the red with a different formula, and see which one did better, which one had more eggs.</span> <span id="s323">And it seems kind of teaching me how to study.</span> <span id="s324">And then, they also had an incubator, when -- I remember the eggs were furnished from some other place, I can’t remember where, very expensive.</span> <span id="s325">And then I could observe once in awhile, how the embryo developed.</span> <span id="s326">And then eventually, when the chicks were born, again there was an incubator -- the room was divided in two section, two incubator, and again the chicks were fed a different formula than we had to make up.</span> <span id="s327">I remember there were dry powder milk for example.</span> <span id="s328">Fish, dry fish, something like that.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t remember the ritay.</span> <span id="s330">All what I remember was it was a joyous experience.</span> <span id="s331">I could not play with other children.</span> <span id="s332">I went to school, and I came back.</span> <span id="s333">But, we could go to the mountains all the time.</span> <span id="s334">And so the chicken raising was w -- as well as studying French and literature, history, and singing.</span> <span id="s335">And -- I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: -- and remember bei -- no, not si -- studying singing, but listen to opera, and -- and -- and there were record, there was no cassette, or -- like today, but I do remember that song about San Vittory, which I learned, and of course [indecipherable] this friend was also anti-Fascist, but it was the physical environment was beautiful, there were fruit tree in summer, vegetable, chickens, and learning.</span> <span id="s338">But there were no other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Th-The tape is almost finished, let’s change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: -- except for the mountains, except for the mountain, that remained.</span> <span id="s341">Going to the mountains, going to the refuge, that remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Okay, let’s stop the tape for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan Ringleheim on September 23rd, in Atherton, California, and this is tape number two, side A. Ginetta, when we just completed the other tape, you were talking about having to be protected.</span> <span id="s345">Can you explain why you needed to be protected, and why you have to move, and stay away from the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Because my mother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s347">My father was Catholic, but my mother was Jewish, and it was not something that I fully understood.</span> <span id="s348">So I had lots of trouble to -- why do we have to move?</span> <span id="s349">Why do we have to go f -- it was not hiding, because I went to the mountains as usually, I went to the Lake of Como, I went to Valdentelvee, I went -- but there was no playing with other children, that’s -- was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Were -- were you tau -- educated in either religion?</span> <span id="s351">In either Catholicism or Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I had to study.</span> <span id="s353">I had to study the cath -- the Jewish religion, the Catholic church, and I ha -- I went to church, and I went, you know, to -- with my friends, sometime -- not very religious.</span> <span id="s354">The thing that my parents taught me was that God is a -- an entity that every person has to decide for themself.</span> <span id="s355">The most important thing then, the religion, the Judeo-Christian religion has left us, are the principle of caring, loving, and one of the thing that ins -- they insisted I would read, beside the Bible, also with some friends, we went to the Catholic church when there was a series of les parabala.</span> <span id="s356">They were telling the stories of -- from the Jewish tradition, and the Catholic tradition of when, for example, Joseph was sold in Egypt, when -- a-and all the stories.</span> <span id="s357">When the -- Jesus Christ was on a horse, and gave a -- a coat to somebody who was very poor, and the reason I remember that was because there was also a difficult depression in Italy.</span> <span id="s358">So I gave my coat, next day, to one of the s -- girls that I knew her father was out of job.</span> <span id="s359">And I remember my mother making my lunches three times more and telling me how careful I had to be, and tactful, because the father of so and so does not have a job.</span> <span id="s360">Now, I don’t know if it was because of the depression, or because they were Jewish, I have no idea, except that she made all these wonderful roasted chicken legs, and -- and reminding me how I had to be very delicate, and say, “Oh,” you know, “here, I can’t eat all this.</span> <span id="s361">How would you like some?”</span> <span id="s362">Knowing that she didn’t have some de -- I remember the coat, because I -- I went home, and I said, “I gave away my coat,” because of the parabala of giving, and so she started laughing, and they got me another coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: S-So she wasn’t angry, she --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s365">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s366">No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s367">It -- on the contrary, you know, no, acha -- they -- they smiled, and they laughed, and -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s368">But I do remember being in the mountains sometime, when I took walk -- when wa -- if I was in Shamoni, and I decided t-to -- to go and pick up some ackenberry myself, I was always staying with people, but sometime you feel like going by yourself along the stream, and the boat, and pick up a berry.</span> <span id="s369">And the owner of the pensionne would make the pastry, and -- at that time I didn’t cook.</span> <span id="s370">And thinking about -- you know, it’s really marvelous what we have around us, all this beauty.</span> <span id="s371">And then thinking about the -- Moses escaping from Egypt, the oil that lasted in -- in -- seven days, or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s372">And trying to reconcile the Jewish with the Catholic.</span> <span id="s373">And then, I had trouble understanding how the Catholic could hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s374">And so many pogrom -- that we knew, about the pogrom, and other, and -- and being puzzled, and not un-understanding how can they do this?</span> <span id="s375">You know, they -- and then saying, “Well, whichever God is up there, I like the beauty, the flowers, the mountains, the sea.</span> <span id="s376">But I don’t like what’s -- what some people are doing.</span> <span id="s377">And, so my parents would explain that it’s one thing the philosophy of a religion, and you take the best of it.</span> <span id="s378">Then we spoke about the Muslim, and how there were many wonderful thing, charity, caring, that people empower -- transformed part of that religion, in order to secure their own power, and they did that by terrorizing people.</span> <span id="s379">And then they gave me the example of the first time -- some people rebelled immediately against the tax collector, who, on the name of the -- the power of the God, given to the temple -- power, was collecting the taxes, and the people were starving.</span> <span id="s380">So finally, one day they drew him out of town, apparently.</span> <span id="s381">And that was one example of how religious power was used for temperon power, and how that power was used to oppress people.</span> <span id="s382">And that, many religion had done, throughout the centuries.</span> <span id="s383">So, we also went to Greece, and I remember how they compared the Egyptian god.</span> <span id="s384">Serious, forbidding, autocratic.</span> <span id="s385">And how the god of Greece were funny.</span> <span id="s386">And so I had to learn somehow, about religion, in a very different way than most people learned religion, but I love to go to -- to the [indecipherable] sometime, for the sola mass, we -- we did.</span> <span id="s387">And with my nurse, my wet nurse, you know, it was so comforting.</span> <span id="s388">Now, in the synagogue when I visit, I couldn’t understand why men and women were in one place, and the other, and I -- why not together?</span> <span id="s389">But again, that was -- was not something that I became deeply involved in practicing.</span> <span id="s390">I loved the ceremonial, and I remember on a Friday night, when my mother put on a white blouse, and then with the candle, and she did something like that.</span> <span id="s391">But I didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s392">What they tried to teach me were the wonderful, biblical story of the Bible, and what the Catholic church had taken, but pointing out, when the Catholic church for example, was going to forbi -- forbade study of other religions, and so they gave me Voltaire to start to read and study.</span> <span id="s393">So I studied Voltaire, and the rebelliousness of Voltaire, and then -- and the bola from the city church, exercised control, or publication through special stamps.</span> <span id="s394">I can’t remember the name of it, but Voltaire -- index, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s395">Voltaire was one of the author at the index.</span> <span id="s396">So, my parents made a point, and I had to study, read Voltaire, I loved it.</span> <span id="s397">So -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: So, there was some ritual in your house, in terms of religion, with your mother doing the Sh-Shabbas?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Occa-Occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Very occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: But -- but not with you participating?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No.</span> <span id="s404">The -- may I skip to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Occasion during the resistance where we were hiding in Milan, and it was Friday, and candela were very precious.</span> <span id="s407">But somebody provided two candle, because the other people hiding were Jewish, and so for Friday.</span> <span id="s408">So, I think sometime how lucky people are, if on Friday night, they can have the ceremonial.</span> <span id="s409">Just as I think about other religions being free to have the ceremonial, freely, without coercion, without persecution.</span> <span id="s410">But that [indecipherable] motzikoni di candela, two small pieces.</span> <span id="s411">I mean, it’s unbelievable how those things remain with you, and -- and think, if people were free to do that, they should be so happy, not to be persecuted, not to be -- or looked upon as strange, or -- and I owe that to my parents, to teach me early, early, the power of oppression, then some people gain, through a control of part of religion, and so many have done that, so many religion have done that.</span> <span id="s412">So I ended up by trying to work for every person to be free to practice their religion, or political belief, or ethnic pride, or what have you.</span> <span id="s413">But I also feel that we are so fortunate to have so many beautiful thing in earth around us, whether the mountains, the flower, the sea.</span> <span id="s414">And -- and people.</span> <span id="s415">We should bless how fortunate we are, even if we -- sometime we have some difficulty.</span> <span id="s416">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: S-So you sound li -- as if you had a very co -- close, intimate kind of relationship with your parents, with a lot of discussion, and a lot of communication, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: When they don’t -- when they didn’t disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: And then, I never knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: W -- they wouldn’t talk about what they were doing.</span> <span id="s425">Was very -- I don’t like the word secretive, but in a sense they didn’t want to expose other people.</span> <span id="s426">And I -- we could only perceive then something was going on, and we could only guess.</span> <span id="s427">I remember -- and I spoke about this, on one evening, when I was sent -- I was fed early, and I -- and then, go to your room to study, or do, you know, things.</span> <span id="s428">And I remember a heated discussion when my parents had with somebody, that I don’t know who, and they kept on saying, “You must leave Germany now,” or -- and the person saying, with an accent, “But I was born there.</span> <span id="s429">My father had meadows,” or something, I can’t remember the detail.</span> <span id="s430">And my parents, both of them, said, “We can help you now.</span> <span id="s431">We may not be able to help you later.”</span> <span id="s432">And the argument, “But I was born there, I was -- never did anything wrong, I never committed any crime, I’m not a criminal.”</span> <span id="s433">And -- and their answer was, “It has nothing to do with that, it has to do with Hitler’s law, racial law.</span> <span id="s434">You’ve got -- we can help you now, we may not be able to help you later.”</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: And what did you think when you were hearing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I was puzzled.</span> <span id="s437">I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s438">I couldn’t understand why people have to leave their country.</span> <span id="s439">And this one was not from Italy, this was somebody else now.</span> <span id="s440">When I spoke to Guido Bustelli about all this, then he -- we spent the whole day going through, and we don’t have the time to do that, but -- although I knew many things, but Guido Bustelli clarified for me so many aspect of the pre-war period, and he is the one who told me that -- Bustelli -- that in August, 1939, the chief of the Intelligence Services of Switzerland, and I re -- I believe his name was Mayzon, but I can’t swear to it.</span> <span id="s441">Mayzon because I associate it with brick.</span> <span id="s442">Mayzon -- maison in French, because my parents taught me to make association of words with things.</span> <span id="s443">Apparently, they were all called together by the chief of the Swiss Intelligence Service, and said, “Gentlemen, based on the information we received f-from excellent sources, reliable sources, Hitler will attack Poland in a couple of weeks, and that was about the middle of August.</span> <span id="s444">And of course, he did.</span> <span id="s445">And also, Bustelli told me that the Swiss Intelligence knew that they would use a Jewish prisoner in a mock attack on the German, and claim that it was instigated by the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s446">Now, I -- I haven’t read that part of history, somebody else will have to do that, but we spend the day, and then at the end of the days, when I said bus -- by then he has become very friendly, and [indecipherable] before the very official Swiss officer.</span> <span id="s447">By then he had taken me to his study, and he showed me a lot of photograph of people who had been -- I mean, you -- they had been arrested, and -- another story.</span> <span id="s448">Two, particularly, John and Eddie, and he -- he did something wonderful.</span> <span id="s449">I said -- at that time, there was this head of the network of smuggler, called Lydia, I don’t know her real name.</span> <span id="s450">[indecipherable] familiar, and he started laughing.</span> <span id="s451">So, he took my hand, we went through -- and [indecipherable] study at this point.</span> <span id="s452">So Lena, his wife, Jenna, and Lillaburra were still drinking white wine, and eating parmesan cheese, and -- and we -- a-and Guido smiled at them, and took me to the end of the courit -- [indecipherable] was a telephone, he dialed a number, and he said, “Lydia, Torpelino is alive.”</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: So she didn’t know you were alive, and you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s455">Such an emotional moment.</span> <span id="s456">Then there were -- stupid [indecipherable]creedi mocha tua morte.</span> <span id="s457">She thought -- you know, many people -- since I disappeared, I was in a convalescent home.</span> <span id="s458">They thought that either I had died, some thought that I was in a mental hospital.</span> <span id="s459">I just disappeared, and so what she did was every year to say a mass with -- for the dead one of her family, for Torpelino.</span> <span id="s460">So, someplace there is a picture of Cosmillas, who say, Lena said you were tired, and we should go home, and I said, “No, I’ve got to get to [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s461">So Lena described this get together, and of course since then, we get together all the time, and we talk all the time, and -- and she has this place in Alba, and she said, “No, you has to come next spring you come to Alba.”</span> <span id="s462">I see her -- them, all the time of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And Torpelino was one of the names that you had when you were in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: One of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s465">[indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s466">Torpelino, then Giorgio, then something else, you know.</span> <span id="s467">And the difficulty was to remember the new identity that we were given.</span> <span id="s468">It was not easy, and we had to practice, practice, practice, and on one occasion, I practice a new ident -- and others, remember we -- we -- we.</span> <span id="s469">And then, after three or four hours of grilling, where I was born, usually in a place where the allies already occupied, so we -- they couldn’t find the place now, and as I was leaving, “Ginetta.”</span> <span id="s470">“Yes?”</span> <span id="s471">Eh!</span> <span id="s472">More hours of grilling, and next day more hours of grilling.</span> <span id="s473">And you know, you just -- you just learn, but it -- I swore that I never would be involved that kind of thing again.</span> <span id="s474">Well, I ask the good lord to forgive me for breaking that promise.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Ginetta, can you ex -- describe -- do you want -- do you wish to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Maybe [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: You want to take a break.</span> <span id="s478">Okay, we’re taking a break.</span> <span id="s479">We f -- we stopped for the day at around noon, and we’re going to continue tomorrow, September 24th, on side B End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, on September 24th, in Atherton, California.</span> <span id="s481">This is tape number two, side B. I -- Ginetta, could you describe how you decided to go into the Resistance, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I didn’t decide.</span> <span id="s483">We were.</span> <span id="s484">There was no such a thing as a day when a conscious decision was made to join the Resistance.</span> <span id="s485">It was an anti-Fascist movement, and as such, dedicated to helping the victim of Fascism.</span> <span id="s486">One particular group of people, who deserves a great deal of recognition is a small convent, with nun.</span> <span id="s487">My parents were very close to them.</span> <span id="s488">These nun had the small convent in a place called, I believe, Grafinala, which was a tiny village near Milan.</span> <span id="s489">These nun were truly dedicated to helping people in needs.</span> <span id="s490">Women who had been thrown out of their home, because they’re pregnant with illegitimate children, and quietly, with the head of the -- what is -- Cosinda -- Cosinda, the mayor of this little village, Grafinala, who is also the head of the Fascist party.</span> <span id="s491">He sits there, wert, in the city hall of this little village, together with my family, friends.</span> <span id="s492">Was an incredible unit, organized to assist the victim of Fascism, although he was the head of the Fascist party for this little communit -- this little village.</span> <span id="s493">And it’s always assisted people who are hiding, who are sent by my parents, or by other people, to hide in the farms.</span> <span id="s494">They may have been Jewish, they may have been anti-Fascist, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s495">It’s just that all of us young people seems to have been recr -- not recruited, you were just par -- natural part of the assistant project.</span> <span id="s496">And then, in 19 -- I believe it is ’42, but I’m not certain, the head, th -- the Sindaco, the -- the mayor, whose sister was the employee of the city hall, who was giving coupon for clothes, for food, decided that I should work there as a temporary employee in order to, yes, give the coupon to people of the village, who paid, I believe was one lira, but I’m not -- you know, it’s such a long time ago.</span> <span id="s497">And every 10 coupons, I would put away one that I would give to the nun.</span> <span id="s498">And those were to help her -- people who were either anti-Fascist, or Jewish, hiding.</span> <span id="s499">Because in Milan, they had already established some controls of the coupon given in certain area of the city block, a city block.</span> <span id="s500">And the Ovra -- the secret police, was watching in case there were more coupon for food than the people.</span> <span id="s501">Don’t ask me how it was done, I don’t have a clue.</span> <span id="s502">All what I know that it was done, and this little village, and possibly other, I don’t know, these little group of nun, with help -- with the help of the s -- mayor -- you call it mayor, it’s Sindaco, who is a Fascist, the head of the fasc -- he was helping, and his sister, being a city hall employee, was a -- crucial.</span> <span id="s503">And they were so outraged about what Mussolini was doing to the Jewish people, or anti-Fascist.</span> <span id="s504">The question arose, apparently -- I only heard, that there was a discussion, he wanted to resign, and everybody said don’t you do it, because you are far more helpful where you are, in helping us.</span> <span id="s505">And so he stayed, and on the -- the Fascist would give away sometime, la bifana -- la bifana fashista, which was January sixth, or something like this, after Christmas, and he would give special toys and things to children in the name of the Fascist, but he was wa -- our greatest helper, and his sister, and the nun, and the Mother Superior was a gem.</span> <span id="s506">I didn’t mind working two weeks to make lace for the church, and such a warm, caring environment, trying to help.</span> <span id="s507">They -- they were never judging people, are you Jewish or not Jewish, are you Fascist, or anti-Fascist?</span> <span id="s508">Are you Catholic, or not Catholic?</span> <span id="s509">It was just -- what I felt was this is the display of true Christianity, if there is such a thing, you know?</span> <span id="s510">I’m certain that the best of the Judeo-Christian tradition in caring, I saw it at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s512">So what then happened?</span> <span id="s513">You s -- you started doing this, but then you obviously moved to more dangerous and complex acts, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s515">The group in Milan, Enrico Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa, Pigi Mullisanno, Peggy, and other, decided that apparently I was bright.</span> <span id="s516">I didn’t know how to type, but they felt that I could be very helpful working with them, for them, as a secretary, at the headquarter of the Italian Air Force in Milan.</span> <span id="s517">I think was Piazza Italibalbo number four.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: C-Could I interrupt?</span> <span id="s519">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: -- how old were you at this time, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Oh, I don’t know, 15 - 16, something like that, I can’t -- young.</span> <span id="s523">But because many clerk were away in the war, it was a terrible war.</span> <span id="s524">All young people were drafted.</span> <span id="s525">I must make a point here, than many young people who are Fascistoni, big Fascist, and pro-Nazi, who screamed moliama la guerra, moliama la guerra, we want war, we want war, they didn’t go to the African front.</span> <span id="s526">They didn’t go to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s527">They didn’t go to the Albanian front, they didn’t go to Yugoslavia, and all those places which were dangerous.</span> <span id="s528">They found a nice, warm hiding places in the office, the bureaucracy of the military, of the navy, or everything else.</span> <span id="s529">And that was, I believe, a shock for the Italian, that all these Fascistoni then proclaimed moliama la guerra, moliama la guerra, but then, they -- they were called inboscarti.</span> <span id="s530">They found a comfortable niche in the city where there was no danger of them being killed.</span> <span id="s531">They send all those poor young men to died, especially on the Russian front, as well as the African front, as well as Yugoslavia, and Albania.</span> <span id="s532">And there is a wonderful song about Albania, about the alpini, those are the mountain troops, who truly wonderful, and not politicized to the same degree as other.</span> <span id="s533">And they began writing home letters describing what was happening on the Russian front, describing what was happening in Albania, describing what was happening in Yugoslavia, Croatia, and all those places, and saying, “I am Italian, I love my country, but I am ashamed of what some people are doing, collaborating with the Nazi.”</span> <span id="s534">And they were letting their family know, and of course not everything came true, and the censorship was very strict, but we have to remember that among the censorship there were also people who were Italian, and Italian being Italian, and member of the -- letter go through, so that we seems to be aware at that time -- not that I understood it, far from it.</span> <span id="s535">But anyway, I was asked to go and work as a secretary for Enrico Mullisanno, the lawyer, Pigi Mullisanno, a lawyer, Rainso Contamessa, a lawyer, who were all officers of the Air Force dur -- in Piazza Italibalbo at the headquarter.</span> <span id="s536">All of them were anti-Fascist, all of them were part em -- of the anti-Fascist movement called jewsteetsa liberta.</span> <span id="s537">All of them intent on working with the factory, with industry.</span> <span id="s538">Industry had to produce for the German, but one person who was at -- it -- at the headquarter was Guido Chezura.</span> <span id="s539">Guido Chezura was a high ranking offi -- officer of the Pirelli, but he was a captain of something, I can’t remember his exact grade, but he was with Pirelli.</span> <span id="s540">Pirelli was supplying rubber tire, and others.</span> <span id="s541">Well, stay out of any anti-Fascist movement, you are far more valuable if you don’t say anything, if you just help.</span> <span id="s542">An incredible woman, who every time she typed anything, there was an extra copy for the committee -- but there was no committee of national liberation at the time.</span> <span id="s543">I don’t know, but it went to the anti-Fascist movement.</span> <span id="s544">Her name was Peggy.</span> <span id="s545">And I always look at her, because she was so beautiful, and beautifully dressed, and I felt like a shrimp next to her.</span> <span id="s546">But she was a wonderful friend, and on top of all, she was a very effective underground worker.</span> <span id="s547">I was simply a courier, but I learned at the time that bringing messages, such as the one preparatory to a March 1944 strike, simultaneously taking place in Milan, Torino, Genoa.</span> <span id="s548">I went back and forth, went to the factories, and I discovered in all these women working in this factory, most of them were Communists and Socialists, very hard line, very committed, very well organized.</span> <span id="s549">And I have to say this, the Communist, and the Socialist were very, very well organized against anti-Fascism.</span> <span id="s550">The leadership had been imprisoned --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You mea -- you mean against Fascism, not against anti-Fascism?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Against Fascist.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Fascism, right, yes, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Fascist and Nazi.</span> <span id="s555">And they had been part of the anti-Fascist movement.</span> <span id="s556">Some -- I mean the leadership -- some of them had been imprisoned during the Mussolini period, even before the war, in ile -- remote ila lipari, [indecipherable] and other prison.</span> <span id="s557">But they were organized.</span> <span id="s558">They had been trained to work in the underground.</span> <span id="s559">We’re not.</span> <span id="s560">We learning -- we are learning, but they were pro, because for years they had had leadership.</span> <span id="s561">Now, the Rosetti brother formed jewsteetsa liberta, that was the result of the fact that they left Communism, because they felt there is really no difference between hard line Marxist Leninism, and Nazi Fascists, and formed jewsteetsa liberta.</span> <span id="s562">Then they were thrown -- they escape to France, and this I heard, I have no first-hand experience with all that, but I was told then the Ovra, the Italian Fascist secret police, in cooperation with the French secret police, political, assassinated both of them.</span> <span id="s563">And [indecipherable] what I found at that period during the war, and especially 1942 - ’43, until the [indecipherable] was that everybody knew about them.</span> <span id="s564">And in the factory, the women, and the leadership be-began questioning whether their true commitment, total commitment to Marxist Leninism was the best way for the post-war government of Italy.</span> <span id="s565">I didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s566">I had -- you know, I tried, but I began to see that the anti-Fascism that I grew up with, and also the reference to the Communist after World War One, were bad too, but it was so remote.</span> <span id="s567">This was real.</span> <span id="s568">This I had to go from Piazza Italibalbo, every morning I went to work, every morning I was given messages to bring to this place, to that place, to this place, to that place.</span> <span id="s569">And don’t ask many question.</span> <span id="s570">I was a stuffetta.</span> <span id="s571">But also, I remember being sent to places where there was the happa leadership of industry, la falca.</span> <span id="s572">I believe it was montanapalioni, I think.</span> <span id="s573">And they were providing money.</span> <span id="s574">Whether they were working under the Fascist, and producing for the Nazi, but they were providing funds to assist the victim of persecution, and -- which I delivered but I don’t know -- there -- somebody else did the job.</span> <span id="s575">I was a simple stuffetta.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And what -- what is a stuffetta?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Stuffetta means a person who’s a courier.</span> <span id="s578">You don’t know anything about anything else except what you are doing.</span> <span id="s579">A-And the reason was because they were taking extreme precaution, because the Ovra was still very active.</span> <span id="s580">Then, on July, 1943, Mussolini fell.</span> <span id="s581">And already they had sense in this group -- and remember, this was highly educated upper contact with the military, with the foreign office, with the society, with the churches, with -- and -- and I remember that Mussolini was overthrown, and I was told not to go home.</span> <span id="s582">I stay with Peggy one day, and we made eggplants, I always remember fried eggplants.</span> <span id="s583">And -- and people who I -- the same people, I believe, not all -- not the anti-Fascists, of course, but many people had say, “Mussolini, moliama la guerra, moliama la guerra, moliama la guerra.”</span> <span id="s584">This time they were throwing mattresses out of the house on the Fascists.</span> <span id="s585">And I became acquainted with how easily political party can manipulate masses, bringing them by truck to demonstrations.</span> <span id="s586">How ya -- how do you say, whip them up for this, or against this.</span> <span id="s587">And I became very skeptical of the political processes, and le -- and began looking at the political process with a very keen eye, so to speak.</span> <span id="s588">The other lesson that I was learning at this time was the clandestine press, because we had wonderful people who did work for the press, which was all controlled by the Fascists, who did control for the radio, which was all controlled by the Fascists.</span> <span id="s589">But we were also listening to the BBC.</span> <span id="s590">I didn’t understand English, but somebody helped to understand it.</span> <span id="s591">And in the process, we were taught how to understand propaganda.</span> <span id="s592">If we had to write anti-Fascist leaflet, we had to understand why we were anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s593">The -- how propaganda is used, how it can be used, how it can be manipulated.</span> <span id="s594">And I must say that little by little, I learned that not everything is black and white, and -- however, I came away from that with a sense that the truth is very important.</span> <span id="s595">Eventually the truth emerge.</span> <span id="s596">And the other passion that I developed at that time was for freedom of expression.</span> <span id="s597">That we may not be absolutely right, but there i -- in a free expression, then there is always the mean to rectify.</span> <span id="s598">And people should treasure that, and be very careful, because dictatorship will always manipulate, distort, lie, deceive.</span> <span id="s599">And unless we keep constant vigilance, we are likely to lose those rights.</span> <span id="s600">And those rights could be privilege given by any government, political party, religious groups.</span> <span id="s601">Somehow I felt, and I was sitting at this table, and they were expert there, I was not.</span> <span id="s602">And I look at the world, where I felt we have opportunity to do something by informing people.</span> <span id="s603">And then somebody reminded me that many of the Italian were analphabet.</span> <span id="s604">They didn’t know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s605">And therefore, education was the primary need, so then other people beca -- besides elementary education, they could also read, and then understand what they were reading.</span> <span id="s606">And -- we stopping?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: So, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Then I -- we continued, it was a -- just a tremendous hi -- traffic with many, many, many women, children, old men, because the young one weren -- and we often brought the messages in shopping bag.</span> <span id="s611">There wasn’t much to shop, but whatever we could find, wi -- then the bicycle came [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: The chain?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Bicycle, you know, the tubes, or the seat where you sit, in between, to put the messages, because bicycle was a very common thing.</span> <span id="s614">Trams were working when there was no bombing, but if there was a bombing, there was no trams, so that you walk, or you go by bus, you’d go.</span> <span id="s615">And what was extraordinary was a network which didn’t have much structure -- it had a structure, the thing was that the structure was very loose, and chow Gino, chow Pierro.</span> <span id="s616">You didn’t have a clue who chow -- who Pierro, or Gino, or whoever was, except for the leadership.</span> <span id="s617">And then there was the Communist party, the Socialist party, the partito retsioni.</span> <span id="s618">The democrat -- Christian democrat, thesort.</span> <span id="s619">They all -- s-some of the top people were together.</span> <span id="s620">At the [indecipherable] place where we were working, obviously they had contact with, and very careful about the possible spy within the headquarter, in Piazza Italibalbo.</span> <span id="s621">Ba -- by the time I was there, everybody was so discouraged.</span> <span id="s622">I mean, the employee, the career people, were so discouraged.</span> <span id="s623">And when, then, the ally came to Sicily, my group, right there, opened a bottle of champagne.</span> <span id="s624">And they were very sensitive about the career people who were there to do a job, their family was in Sicily, or in the south.</span> <span id="s625">And what struck me was the sense of compassion, then, everybody had about people who had to serve, to get the paycheck, divided with -- you know, from the family, etcetera.</span> <span id="s626">There wasn’t hatred.</span> <span id="s627">And I do remember -- this is later, in September, when one of them said, “Signiorina, who’s going to pay my salary now?”</span> <span id="s628">I would like a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s630">Gonna take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: We’re back from our break.</span> <span id="s633">Ginetta, can you describe some of what was being written in the underground press?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yes, one of the goal of the underground press was to bring to the attention of the Italian under the occupation of the Nazi Fascists, what was going on.</span> <span id="s635">Arrest, execution, deportation, often with the name of people, and also the public edict of the Nazi, and the Fascist, telling citizen that unless they cooperated, then the penal -- spelling out the penalty, also the reward.</span> <span id="s636">For any allied POW, there was a certain amount of salt, if I recall correctly, some money.</span> <span id="s637">Also promise of release of a family member who was in Germany, in exchange for turning in allied POW, or Italian who were anti-Fascist and awaiting the draft.</span> <span id="s638">So our goal was really to -- to do that.</span> <span id="s639">And every party, every political party had their own newspaper.</span> <span id="s640">One of the newspaper then, I enjoyed very much helping with in the distribution was noey darnet.</span> <span id="s641">We only had four members, but wonderful people.</span> <span id="s642">And I also think that that was a maturing step for all of us.</span> <span id="s643">Noey darnet.</span> <span id="s644">Thinking about the havoc wrought in the people -- Italian people’s lives, men, women, and children, by Fascism, and how are we going to rebuild a des -- destroyed society.</span> <span id="s645">Mussolini intent was essentially to have women keep their place, produce many children.</span> <span id="s646">Women were not allowed to reach higher echelon of education.</span> <span id="s647">But they were -- women were praised and given incentive to produce more and more children.</span> <span id="s648">At one point also, the women were asked to give their wedding band, gold, in order to pay for the war material, and the queen did her duty, and put her ring.</span> <span id="s649">Later on we learned that many of the Fascists simply put a lot of the gold in their pocket.</span> <span id="s650">I don’t know if it was true or not, but it -- it’s irrelevant.</span> <span id="s651">The other thing we had to do was to give copper, our copper pots, to be used for cannon.</span> <span id="s652">And boy thi -- that turned women off, not to have your cooking pot, nice, heavy, often from grandparents, and from the farm, etcetera, to have to turn them in to make cannon.</span> <span id="s653">The other group of women, who were politically sensitive, and better organized, were limondinae.</span> <span id="s654">Those were wonderful young women who, for the period when the rice needed to be weeded, would leave their home, and go into farm, big farm.</span> <span id="s655">And this big farm would have huge places with mattresses which are not mattresses, they were simply sack cloth filled with straw.</span> <span id="s656">And the women would go, I don’t remember how long, but they could go for the period of mondini to weed the rice, which meant being in the water with leeches on their feet.</span> <span id="s657">And these women became quickly organized by the Communist party to fight Fascism, and their horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s658">They had their own newspapers too, but I do -- the one I knew was jewsteetsa liberta, no dominae, partito retsioni.</span> <span id="s659">The student paper, and -- and it was an -- a clandestine effort, needless to say.</span> <span id="s660">Paper was very scarce, and we were grateful to all the newspaper people who were employed in the regular [indecipherable] sera, yeah, for clandestinely making available to us, some precious, precious paper.</span> <span id="s661">Are you worried about the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I’m checking.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: So, it was a -- a dangerous thing to do, because if a member of the gopper -- gopeesti, those who [indecipherable] an assassination against a target of the SS, the Gestapo, and other, if they were caught, they were shot.</span> <span id="s664">That -- the Nazi Fascist put a premium on arresting, catching, and torturing for interrogation, people who were involved in distributing the clandestine press, how did they organize, where was it printed, who is doing it, etcetera.</span> <span id="s665">And gathering the information for the clandestine press, which was done by a network of people, men, women and children, the railway, the bill of [indecipherable], you know that kind, and also the insignia on the German, and trying to more or less to see if there had been changes, an increase.</span> <span id="s666">Anyone caught in that kind of work automatically was a suspect for interrogation and torture.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So anyone who was -- who had information, who -- and who was distributing information, and learning about what was going on, was in danger, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s669">And that’s when I began treasuring the freedom of the press.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: And also caught listening to the BBC, it meant deportation, or interrogation.</span> <span id="s672">In other word, the -- they put a great deal of emphasis on catching people who were providing information, education, exposing the horror, than they were doing -- although they were very stupid in many way, because on one occasion --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Let’s bl -- let -- hold that story, I -- because the tape is going to stop.</span> <span id="s674">One second.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, with -- on Friday, September 24th, in Atherton, California.</span> <span id="s677">This is tape number three, side one.</span> <span id="s678">Ginetta, on the last tape, you started talking about an incident where they were very stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: They were very stupid.</span> <span id="s680">Well, in general, you know, they were -- they were very -- they were expert in the art of interrogation, at -- at one level, because, instead of being selective, every suspect was tortured.</span> <span id="s681">They missed opportunity for getting information, because people died, or people simply decided no way, I’m going to die anyway.</span> <span id="s682">And one of the thing that must be said about the stupidity is, and for the first time, the SS and the Gestapo brought torture, not as an isolated incident, as the Ovra had used, or the police had used [indecipherable] any time, any place, anywhere, that is a systematic system of interrogation.</span> <span id="s683">And it -- torturing people to obtain information which could be useful, became routine, and that was stupid, because they really tortured many people who didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s684">And then they were hanging people publicly, in the gallows, shooting them.</span> <span id="s685">The other stupidity that they did, horrendous stupidity was -- not in Milan, but abatsaboto, they caught -- there were something like 50 -- appro -- 50 - 54 partisan, including a pregnant woman, and they made that group travel from village to village, and then they executed them all.</span> <span id="s686">In Liguria, near Genoa spitsa, there is another place where they took something like 40 or 50 young men, and publicly th-they executed them all.</span> <span id="s687">And now, when I’m using the word stupidity, is because far from frightening -- yes, people were frightened, people are terrorized, but also people said, what?</span> <span id="s688">Even many Fascists said, I don’t want to be associated with this.</span> <span id="s689">This is not Italy.</span> <span id="s690">And true, with the Nazi, there were the Italian Fascist, SS, the libreen, rigatinari, the mouti, the dechamamas, who as volunteer, joined the SS unit, and they were the one who knew Italian, they were the one who knew the addresses to take these people, etcetera.</span> <span id="s691">I use the word stupidity because it really increased our ranks.</span> <span id="s692">People who had said, “No, I can’t help you, I’m too frightened, not for me, but for my family -- what can I do to help?”</span> <span id="s693">And I suspect that in any underground movement, but I -- I only know Italy, when there is this kind of naked brutality, people will emerge, who will take far higher risk to help the victim than they had been willing to risk before.</span> <span id="s694">And the reason I felt strongly about the underground press, although I’m not a journalist, but of course the Ritsini was a journalist family, pro-monarchy, I suspect possibly pro-Fascist in the early period, but certainly against this kind of brutality, and they were a great help in understanding that some conservative, from monarchy, etcetera, maybe proconserva -- they don’t accept such brutality, and -- and had to -- had to the paper -- now, our workers -- thousand of people was to paste notices, and -- and oo -- at that time, we had to make -- to mix flour with water, and pinello, and go -- and that was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s695">And then distribute the clandestine press every place we could, in the fabrica factory, office, buildings, school.</span> <span id="s696">Now the university, the student had their own newspaper, but we have to remember then, most of the professor had been forced to flee, to hide, and so we, as a student hiding, had some time became captive audience to professor who cou-couldn’t teach, and if we were hiding someplace for few days, let me tell you, we did have good professor.</span> <span id="s697">I mean, discussions were marvelous, and unforgettable.</span> <span id="s698">You may forget something that you do in the regular school, you don’t forget something that you learn under the circumstances, debates, pro and con, and sometime deliberately, they chose one or the other to take the opposite point of view for arguing a case, for arguing a point, for arguing an essay, for arguing a book.</span> <span id="s699">And between that, and assessing the press, evaluate it, analyzing it, and then come up with a synthesis that reflected the truth in very short space.</span> <span id="s700">I believe it helps to consolidate your thinking in a way that nothing else since has ever helped me to consolidate ideas, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Do you have a recollection of any particular debate, or -- during this time?</span> <span id="s702">Was there any --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, oh yes.</span> <span id="s704">The debate, at one point, centered around the role of people who had been part of the great concit of the Fascists, and then in July, turned against Mussolini, which caused, of course, the fall of Mussolini.</span> <span id="s705">The role of the king, accepting to be emperor, accepting Fascism all those year, in spite of the terrible cost to Italy, to the Italian people, and what should be the post-war or -- of those people who had been Fascist, which of course, I believe that as soon as the Nazi came to power, tried to erase them, and executed some, like Galliazo Channo, and -- and other, or the king, for post war.</span> <span id="s706">There were pro and con, and then debate about, so -- th-th-those were political discussion, and I have not been used to, and listen to people who had been professors and -- and student.</span> <span id="s707">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s708">It was a learning lesson in politics, for when -- I made up my mind that I would have never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I would have to do something with protecting human right, and freedom of expression.</span> <span id="s709">And then the other discussion was about the slogan of the Communist, from the Ural to the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s710">Is that what we want for Europe?</span> <span id="s711">And the answer, a couple said absolutely, because they provide social and economic right.</span> <span id="s712">Other felt like hell we want from the Ural to Atlantic, to have Stalinism, and Leninism, in Europe.</span> <span id="s713">Well, but the French wants that.</span> <span id="s714">Well, the Italian don’t.</span> <span id="s715">Some did, but even the Italian who had been Communist, like Leo Baliani, and other, in the prison of Mussolini, changed, and decided it was not good for the Italian.</span> <span id="s716">And in fact, no -- Ricardo Lombardi, Leo Baliani, Federucho Parray, they all agreed that the principle of socio-economic right is important, but so are civil and political right, and the two shall be linked.</span> <span id="s717">And so the discussions was often heated.</span> <span id="s718">Then there was a discussion about why should we accept funds from the American -- from the allies, in the conduct of the underground in Italy, to assist prisoner, family, as well as assist the partisan.</span> <span id="s719">The air drops, also money from banks, and from -- funds from the army left over, etcetera.</span> <span id="s720">We should have nothing to do with funding from the allies, or somebody said that we -- the Russian are sending tons of money for the -- for the Communist, for the propaganda, for everything.</span> <span id="s721">So the discussion were often heated on that subject.</span> <span id="s722">And our feeling was that we have to win this war first.</span> <span id="s723">And then the political system that Italy will have, will have to be decided by the Italian.</span> <span id="s724">The most important thing we should ha -- must have, is a constitution.</span> <span id="s725">And so then there were the professor who -- who knew laws, and knew the -- then we read the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, and oh, this is what we should have, and -- but the most thing -- everything agreed on no more dictatorship, and then brought into the question, what about the Marxist Leninist, that’s a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s726">Oh yes, but that is a dictatorship of the proletariat.</span> <span id="s727">Does he allow freedom of expression?</span> <span id="s728">No.</span> <span id="s729">Yes, but he provides social and economic right.</span> <span id="s730">Work for everybody, houses for everybody, food for everybody, and my question was, at what price?</span> <span id="s731">So, here we are -- sometime the bombs were also falling, and having this discussion.</span> <span id="s732">But essentially I came away with a sense that open debate is crucial.</span> <span id="s733">But personally, I will never tolerate any dictatorship, no matter what the justification is -- is given by a government, period.</span> <span id="s734">And I didn’t care if it was right wing, or left wing, or whatever.</span> <span id="s735">Any government, then want to impose a dictatorship on their people, in as far as I was concerned at that time, does not deserve to be respected, or supported.</span> <span id="s736">But to do that, you need the help of everybody to understand, to begin with, the danger, then this government represents.</span> <span id="s737">And they will always find excuses, I mean, Mussolini was giving us all the excuses, Hitler was giving us all the excuses.</span> <span id="s738">Hitler wa -- Stalin was giving us all the excuses.</span> <span id="s739">And what was the result?</span> <span id="s740">Suffering for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Can you explain to me how, or what it was then, that made you say, I will never get involved in politics, but I will get involved in issues of human rights?</span> <span id="s742">What -- what was for you at that moment, if you can go back there, wha -- what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Well I realized that here were people that I loved, intelligent, dedicated, who truly believed that in the future, when the war was over, to obey the order of Stalin, for the good of the Italian, was essentialed to reveal our society in amoda, which would be different than Fascism.</span> <span id="s744">I was unable to accept that.</span> <span id="s745">The other was that there were some member of the Communist party began worrying about this kind of thing, and discussed this openly, and felt that the Roselli brother for just a salivita, and understood the danger that Marxist, Lenin, and Stalinism presented for society, we still wanted to change the socio-economic situation.</span> <span id="s746">That was freedom, and not freedom of expression suppressed in order to achieve the other.</span> <span id="s747">In fact, we felt at that time that Fascism was far more modern that Leninism -- Stalinist Leninism, and look what it has done.</span> <span id="s748">We didn’t know about many other things than Stalin had done, and we knew what the Nazi had done.</span> <span id="s749">And analyzed, discussed, studied, compared, and all -- all the others were going to become part of political parties.</span> <span id="s750">All of them became political leaders.</span> <span id="s751">And it’s okay, it’s just that I felt there has to be voices outside of the political system, that you can say, I disagree with that.</span> <span id="s752">And I remember -- I can’t remember who said this, and then later on I heard it after the war many times.</span> <span id="s753">I think it was Voltaire.</span> <span id="s754">I disagree with you, but I’m ready to die for your right to disagree with me.</span> <span id="s755">I’m not certain it was Voltaire, but that’s what I thought at that time.</span> <span id="s756">That’s what we thought at that time.</span> <span id="s757">I disagree with you, but I’m ready to die for your right to disagree.</span> <span id="s758">And we felt that post-war Italy had to be respectful of ideas.</span> <span id="s759">That there has to be a government which respect the right of citizen, and not imprison them, not torture them, not have mock trial, not have the special tribunal.</span> <span id="s760">Special tribunal was the tribunal than [indecipherable] Mussolini -- Ovra installed during the Fascist period where there were three milary -- military judges, no legal defense, no -- entrapment was the -- the word for any suspect.</span> <span id="s761">So, those are the idea that really consumed us, while we were all so activist in helping, in hiding, in pasting notices, or change slogan of the -- we knew then people were deported in railway tracks.</span> <span id="s762">We were told that they were sent to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s763">And somebody wrote [indecipherable] Tedeschi, W. Tedeschi, and we will paint Abastoy Tedeschi, I mean, stupid things like this.</span> <span id="s764">It -- it -- it was just perhaps childish, but we felt it was important, and boy if you were caught, you are shot.</span> <span id="s765">You know, th-that kind of -- that distribution of mater -- leaflet press, and also learning to communicate to others, if there was a -- a danger.</span> <span id="s766">The reason I made a copy of carla was because it’s a classic example of somebody who undertake a very important project on that ha -- on that history, that also how somebody let him know then somebody was searching him, and instead of explaining, if you read it, you get it.</span> <span id="s767">And -- and [indecipherable] translated into English, so that you can -- is an example of hundreds -- hundreds, and ordinary people doing kind of strange things all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: N-Not -- I don’t want to push this too much, but your interest in human rights, going back to that period of time, is it that you were trying to establish what you thought were the necessary conditions for a society, whereas politics sometimes undermined those necessary conditions?</span> <span id="s769">That you were -- that there was something about human life that you wanted to protect, whatever the political system was.</span> <span id="s770">So you weren’t interested in power, and accumulation of power.</span> <span id="s771">I du -- I’m trying to figure out what it is that was pulling you away from pul -- politics, into another world.</span> <span id="s772">I don’t know whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: We have to say we, because I was not the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: W -- wes -- yes, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: And I have emphasized the word we, we, we, because these were a group of people working together but who disagreed about the political system --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: -- to succeed Mussolini in post-war Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: And then we also learned that sometime funds coming in from the allies, and distributed to the church, was distributed to every group, but we also learned that the Communists were also keeping money for the post-war re-organization of the Communist party.</span> <span id="s780">And at the time when you have such horror going on, and you need every penny to help everybody, I felt, my God, I am no different than the Fascist.</span> <span id="s781">They are already beginning to accumulate money for power, for their control after.</span> <span id="s782">And the slogan, from the Ural to Atlantic really made us uneasy.</span> <span id="s783">Not just me, but Enrico Mullisanno, Pigi Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa.</span> <span id="s784">They were Communists who were queasy about it, but they still felt that they owed obedience.</span> <span id="s785">So my response was -- and this was my response, obideerai -- craderai obideerai combaterai.</span> <span id="s786">To believe -- to believe craderai.</span> <span id="s787">Obideera, obey, combaterai, fight.</span> <span id="s788">And I said, what is the difference when with the slogan of Stalin, and the slogan of Mussolini, and the slogan of the church, the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s789">Craderai, obideerai, combaterai.</span> <span id="s790">And I said, we want a force [indecipherable] of Italy, which hopefully will reflect the freedom that every person is entitled to.</span> <span id="s791">The respect, the dignity.</span> <span id="s792">If you want to be a Communist, you should be a Communist, but if I want to be something else -- I respect your right, but you have to respect mine.</span> <span id="s793">You don’t imprison me if you are in power because I happen to have different view, political or religious, because we remember also the Inquisition.</span> <span id="s794">And Italian history is replete with it.</span> <span id="s795">One discussion we had in the underground about torture was then the -- actually the Empress of Austria, not herself, but on the advice of counsel, Austria had abolished the use of torture to extract information, and I believe it was the end of the previous century, and yet, it was reinstated when the Nazi came, eliminating the judicial system, taking over the judicial system, and -- and using torture.</span> <span id="s796">So, the discussion also centered about what the -- the Austrian had done at the -- the end of the previous century -- not that Maria Theresa was necessarily enthusiastic, but she accepted the advice of her counsel to eliminate tr -- torture, and then, as Hitler comes to power, the court lose juridical prerogative, due to the court, and the judicial system, for political reason.</span> <span id="s797">And then they bring it to Italy.</span> <span id="s798">And while cases of torture had always occurred, but this was systematic torture, and it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s799">I mean, people -- the scream were heard in -- whether it was in Milan, in Biapaolocelli, in Torino, La Camradeebeeasti, Aroust, every place.</span> <span id="s800">It became an epidemic.</span> <span id="s801">But we thought about the possibility of that under a dictatorial regime.</span> <span id="s802">And we felt a dictatorship can use this method, as the Nazi, the Fascists are doing, any place, any time.</span> <span id="s803">So in a post-war Italy, what we want is guarantee, and that will never happen again.</span> <span id="s804">And we’re thinking about Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Where were you living at this time?</span> <span id="s806">Were you still living with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Oh, I -- I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Were you living with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No, I didn’t see -- I couldn’t see them.</span> <span id="s810">So I -- the underground had a assistance program, and I was actually handling three apartments, in Viama Kerajoya, ’41.</span> <span id="s811">The concierge, Mrs. Columbo, was our friend.</span> <span id="s812">Her brother-in-law was executed, was one of the partisan who, in the railway, who was helping to give us the correct bill of lading, instead of the bill of lading when the Germans said on the train coming in, whate -- instea -- they would put clothes in, but e -- as, in fact they were armament.</span> <span id="s813">And that was very important to the allies, to know what kind of material the German were bringing in for the war effort.</span> <span id="s814">And there was an army of young people, student and others.</span> <span id="s815">Now, the brother of mis -- in-law of Mrs. Columbo was caught and executed.</span> <span id="s816">Now, there were three apartment derain prepared by the underground.</span> <span id="s817">Don’t ask me, except that my little apartment was quickly -- an arch -- furnitch -- an architect came and fixed the cupboard, and it was very well arranged.</span> <span id="s818">Then there was a third floor apartment, that I was handling for a courier who came back and forth.</span> <span id="s819">And then there was one on the fifth floor that I never saw, except that when somebody came, was a special password, it was the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s820">And only later, after the war, we realized then that was probably the OSS people.</span> <span id="s821">And they kept everything compartmen -- compartmentalized.</span> <span id="s822">Then, in addition to these three apartment, we were in the -- another apartment in [indecipherable] few block further down, and a network of places where people could spend a night.</span> <span id="s823">And it was all integrated with the work done by the Committee of National Liberation, and by the churches, by political party, by groups.</span> <span id="s824">And each group was very independent of the other, so that -- for example, since I’m looking at Lydia, one little church in Drunago, the priest was wonderful, and he hid people in the belfry.</span> <span id="s825">But, it was a network of people.</span> <span id="s826">Of course, once in awhile we were caught, once in awhile it was broken, and we lost people.</span> <span id="s827">There were deportation, and -- or a book this thick has name of Italian who were deported, and many of them didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s828">And some were Jewish, and the other were Catholic.</span> <span id="s829">And they came from all walk of life, and if you look at -- I -- I think I -- I may have given it to Stan for those -- but if you look at the ages, you can see, it was truly a popular movement, had all ages, classes, education, or lack of education.</span> <span id="s830">Along the river Po, the -- the river, there are boats, and -- there are boats, and the network of people who knew the woods, in Pavia, in Bijaivino, in Mortara, Novara, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s831">But again, the churches were very important, and the confessional were very important.</span> <span id="s832">And the people went to the confession, who had never gone to confession before.</span> <span id="s833">And they were certainly not confessing sin.</span> <span id="s834">It was a mean of communication, improvised very often, but what struck me was how people can sum up the courage to do things when they haven’t thought about doing, or they would ever to, or -- or regret, and of course, many of them were deported.</span> <span id="s835">I remember one woman, a -- a peasant who hid in her farm some people, and -- and when her husband was taken -- the reason I went to see her, with another member -- another student, was to bring some money, and to wins -- you know, see what she needs, and -- and I always remember, they had been married many years.</span> <span id="s836">And she said, “He was such a good man.”</span> <span id="s837">He was such a good man.</span> <span id="s838">I still see her face.</span> <span id="s839">Those things, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s840">And I got tired in doing my work sometime, I -- I think about those wonderful, ordinary people.</span> <span id="s841">They will never be famous.</span> <span id="s842">I can’t even remember her name, but to me, they embodied -- people who in my judgement are an ornament to the human spirit.</span> <span id="s843">I’m sorry about this, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s844">I never saw her again, afterwards.</span> <span id="s845">But i-it -- I like the idea that the underground was so caring about organizing assistance, and -- and thing.</span> <span id="s846">Let me clean my nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s848">We’ll take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Unfortunately --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: We’re back now.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Unfortunately, there were some people among these mass of wonderful, dedicated, courageous people, some people were spies.</span> <span id="s852">They were informant, and I am not so sure that it was only ideology.</span> <span id="s853">In one of our discussion, in trying to understand the infiltrator, in order to prevent infiltration in our group, one of the discussion with a doctor, centered on what type of personality we had to be careful about.</span> <span id="s854">Not necessarily -- if they -- they are two anti-Nazi, anti-Fascist, too much, they -- they reminded us of Macbeth, the ladies doth protest too much.</span> <span id="s855">And in -- some of these senior people were trying to explain to us the factors -- in the human factors, psychologically, especially a doctor -- I believe his name is Grossé, I have to check it, he was working at the Hospitality Niguarda, and he treated a victim of torture, but they were trying to explain to us, in our work, we had to be very careful of some people who would offer, it could have been a trap, they may have -- may have been suspect, and -- but also there are people who are so needy of protection, whichever power is in power.</span> <span id="s856">And has nothing to do with Fascism, it can be any.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side, B</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: This is tape number three, side B, wi -- and we interrupted.</span> <span id="s859">You were ending with people who wa -- needed to be protected no matter what the power was.</span> <span id="s860">Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: And they -- who will offer their services.</span> <span id="s864">Some are psychopaths, no question.</span> <span id="s865">People who -- who used torture, for example.</span> <span id="s866">Many of the high ranking people didn’t touch themselve the prisoner, they had these thugs in the interrogation places who did the dirty work.</span> <span id="s867">And la -- later on in my own experience, many -- th-the officer was content to serve these people.</span> <span id="s868">But they needed them, they used them, and but o -- whether our senior were teaching us to be very careful, and try to explain to us why we should be very careful of such people, because in working in the underground, you have people who come and offer, and then you always pretend that you don’t know anything about it, you don’t know whats they are talking about, you know, because it could be a trap.</span> <span id="s869">And I thought there ta -- a-and they always came suggested by somebody that you knew.</span> <span id="s870">So, you always pretended you don’t know anything about it, and then you say, “Oh maybe we see each other some other time, but you know, I can’t help you, I cannot do anything,” etcetera, etcet -- then you check with the other people.</span> <span id="s871">So it becomes kind of skucky, we call it.</span> <span id="s872">I don’t know how you would [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Like a chess game?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Chess game, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: To go and [indecipherable] and this.</span> <span id="s877">The churches, by and large, were reliable, I would say, up to 90 percent.</span> <span id="s878">But even so, 10 percent of people who were not reliable, but also if the SS, the Gestapo, and the Black Brigade went to their church regularly.</span> <span id="s879">And there were Catholic the Nazi, who went to church regularly, who attended the service, who became friend with the priest.</span> <span id="s880">And according to the priest, you know, it was just s-serving a Christian.</span> <span id="s881">Now, what I also learned was there was some educated German Christian, who were helpful to us.</span> <span id="s882">Very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s883">And the way we communicated was in Latin.</span> <span id="s884">Heh, heh, heh, don’t speak German.</span> <span id="s885">But in Latin we could communicate.</span> <span id="s886">And needless to say, we checked and counterchecked.</span> <span id="s887">But some German regular army people were very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Were there a lot of people, young kids your age, teenager, 16 - 17 years old -- I mean, how -- how many people -- I -- I know you don’t know how many people were in the entire group, but in the immediate group that you were working in?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Probably approximately 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: But, we knew th -- each family.</span> <span id="s892">We n -- cousin, rela -- friends, and like let’s say, these 20, for example, they had a wonderful property in Piedmont.</span> <span id="s893">They could hide people, they were also upper class.</span> <span id="s894">And they could shelter people, but also, they were respected people.</span> <span id="s895">Enrico Mullisanno, the family Mullisanno, highly respected.</span> <span id="s896">Now, the Ritsini were from monarchy etcetera, but highly respected.</span> <span id="s897">So their son -- they have a son Enrico, and they knew people.</span> <span id="s898">Now the Mullisanno daughter were two years old, and four years old.</span> <span id="s899">But their cousin in social circle, people that you have known for a long time -- and you knew very much who was a Fascist, more or less.</span> <span id="s900">That the pro SS and Gestapo, there were very few upper class, or well-educated people.</span> <span id="s901">Many of the upper class Italian joined the resi -- supported the Resistance, because of the allies, because of the British.</span> <span id="s902">Not necessarily for the American [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s903">Max Salvadore was an ital -- an American -- Italian American, he work with the British Intelligence Services.</span> <span id="s904">He had loads of contact in Italy.</span> <span id="s905">And some other prominent exile, anti-Fascist Italian, had contact with Italian intellectual and aristocracy, or banking.</span> <span id="s906">Banking was another area, and industry was another air -- marini, [indecipherable] one of them was.</span> <span id="s907">Either way, they had contact then they kept, regardless of the war, like in -- Switzerland was the place where they could meet.</span> <span id="s908">And that’s where Bustelli, and Lydia, and others came, so -- were so important to that.</span> <span id="s909">In Switzerland, nobody mentioned, then Switzerland allowed many Jewish people, not always, some were sent back, and were killed.</span> <span id="s910">But in the Teechino area, where Bustelli was, they had the resi -- this.</span> <span id="s911">September, 1943, when the disaster occurred, the Armistice, the Swiss allowed the Italian Army people to take refuge in camps in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s912">And those camps were -- many people were expert in military affair, as well as Intelligence, as well as Morse code, and things like that.</span> <span id="s913">So, eventually, some Intelligent people, with the help of Italian, likes Max Salvadore for example, and later on Max Gorbol, they recruited people from these camps.</span> <span id="s914">And Aurora Wilomin who died, was executed, she used to go and get the people who had been selected, to bring back to Italy, to help in the undergrounds.</span> <span id="s915">That’s one important ti -- who did the communication?</span> <span id="s916">Housewife, farmer, student, children.</span> <span id="s917">They killed a young boy in Piazzo Larret, I believe he was 14 years old, was a messenger -- was a stuffetta.</span> <span id="s918">You know, it’s -- and the camps, the military camps were very important in Switzerland, also the object of penetration by the Nazi.</span> <span id="s919">In fact, the Nazi Fascist sent spies to i -- to get information about who was selected to come to Italy.</span> <span id="s920">And once again, Lydia, Bustelli, and -- and all -- and the network of people, were very important in the communication.</span> <span id="s921">And a communication from one post to the other was done by either women, or boys, or girl.</span> <span id="s922">In bicycle, on a horse, cart, or whatever.</span> <span id="s923">So it was -- [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Is -- is that wa -- because they were less suspect?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Well, the Nazi and Fascist were suspa -- suspecting everybody.</span> <span id="s926">After all, remember that while we do it -- the peaceful work in assistance, there was also the underground then blew up the railway, blew up the partisan -- the Italian partisan, the band then -- then formed after September, they attack German and Nazi Fascist post in order to get arms, because they didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s927">So they would organize, and some of the people who joined the partisan had been professional military people, particularly the Alpini in Baldosta, the Alpini, who were very good at climbing, who were very good at exercise, and -- and the German and the Nazi Fascist were determined to -- to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s928">But communication could not done by telephone, or t -- or e-mail, you know.</span> <span id="s929">Everything was done by voice, at most one page.</span> <span id="s930">But it was very, very, very serious.</span> <span id="s931">And that was rare, terribly rare.</span> <span id="s932">And code.</span> <span id="s933">We had one pad code, and I got it that once it was used, it goes in the wastepaper basket, because that was the most secure way of communicating.</span> <span id="s934">I need a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Okay, we’re going to take a break.</span> <span id="s936">We are now back from our break.</span> <span id="s937">Ginetta, when I asked you where -- where you were living, you were talking about living apart from your parents after 1943, but I gather in 1941, you were -- when you -- when you went -- started working with the Resistance, you were living with your parents.</span> <span id="s938">Can you describe --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yes, I -- I was living w-with my parents in Milan, and I was able to see also my nurse, my wet nurse, in the countryside.</span> <span id="s940">And we stayed in the countryside, because the mil -- Milan was bombed night after night by the ally, especially August 1943, lots of bombing took place, and so we rented a place in the country, and I could see also my wet nurse, th -- at a farm, like many thousand of Milanese, because many of the building were destroyed by the bombing.</span> <span id="s941">Transportations was destroyed.</span> <span id="s942">The building blocked streets, bi -- the ma -- the -- when they were bombed, all the material, the -- the rubbles.</span> <span id="s943">Or whether [phone ringing].</span> <span id="s944">Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Okay, we’re back from our telephone break.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Okay, now, at that time, July, August, af-after the Mussolini fell, it was chaotic in Milan, and in addition to the kills -- political kills, there were the bombing by the allied, especially in August, 1943, and waves after waves of bomber came, and we stayed in the countryside.</span> <span id="s947">And we could see at night the city of Milan, red -- th-the sky was red, and hear all these airplane, and you know, you understand that in order to end this war, they had to bomb, because once again, although Mussolini was gone, Badoglio took over the government, Badoglio with the king, and he said, la guerra continma, and it was not an -- so people had to get out of the cities or industrial centers, even nearby, like sise to San Giovanni or other, and find places in the country, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s948">The transportation was not working, the train were packed, whatever, it all -- it was terrible.</span> <span id="s949">But we lived outside, and then we came back, around the beginning of September, to Milan, and it was at that time that -- and my parents told me that if anything should happen, and there should be a ashugamano, a ashugamano, this is to dry your hands, a -- a cloth, on the window, I should not go home, but should go and see Enrico Mullisanno if possible, or -- so, on September, my mother gave me some money to buy some sweater from Louisa Spanoli, which is still existing, and it was going back to school, to prepare for going back to school possibly, but everything was in chaos.</span> <span id="s950">And I went, and I had this money, and the store was closed, so I had this cash on me.</span> <span id="s951">And then when I arrived home, I saw the ashugamano on the window, and there was a black car.</span> <span id="s952">And we call them the black maria, which were car used by the police to pick up Jewish people, or anti-Fascist.</span> <span id="s953">And we had, in a family living nearby, and the father simply had vanished.</span> <span id="s954">And in August, in spite of the bombing, my father had asked me to drive his car, a small car, to drive the children of this family, to Valdentelvi, and stay with our friend Hua Pastore, and bring the children to Switzerland with the help of Tonio, who was a smuggler, and the Pastore, who were dear, dear friend, an elderly couple who [indecipherable] known for many, many, many years.</span> <span id="s955">And try to do what I could.</span> <span id="s956">He gave me some money, and you know -- then, in September, I realized I couldn’t go home, so it was getting late, and there was a curfew, so I -- there was a bombed out building, and I remember a -- something dangling, chair, or something dangling with the floor from the ceiling, and it was a bombed out place, and I -- it was getting late, I felt like crying, so I stayed in that place instead of trying to go all the way to Viatalaggio, where the Mullisanno lived, because I realized it would have been too far away to go, and I may not make it, and the city was literally in chaos.</span> <span id="s957">The Fascists were beginning to look all over the place for young people.</span> <span id="s958">The military people were trying to shed their uniform, be on civilian clothes, and trying to find a place to escape, and there were thousand of people in Milan in that situation, when the armistice was announced.</span> <span id="s959">Nevertheless, the police were still hunting people.</span> <span id="s960">And -- and that was the last time, I -- I was never able to see my parents again after that, but then Enrico, and Mary, and all the other really embraced me, and -- and also, there were some funds, in cash then were available, but the underground, the Resistance took care of paying the rent, providing minimum for food, clothes.</span> <span id="s961">Clothes were very difficult, everything was coupons, for food, coupon for this, coupon for that, and with the armistice, the king, Badoglio, and the government fled to the south, leaving the people, the navy, the army, the air force in shamble.</span> <span id="s962">The headquarter of the air force, where I had been working with Enrico, all these officers, they tried to take as much documentation as they could, so we were helping to put away stuff, and prevent looting.</span> <span id="s963">But people came in and too -- and looted everything they could.</span> <span id="s964">It was a horror, and few people can imagine what it means for a government allied with a country, like the Italian government allied with the Germans, and then have an armistice with the ally, who are the enemy, the American, and the British, and the other, and flee, leaving the people, the armed forces of all, asbandati, alone.</span> <span id="s965">And the German had already suspected the armistice would come, and therefore quietly had already beg -- not quietly, everybody knew it.</span> <span id="s966">They began sending via the Brenner Pass, SS, Gestapo Panzer.</span> <span id="s967">And they are prepared the plan to take a -- intensify the cleaning -- ethnic cleaning of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s968">Simultaneously to arrest all the people who were suspect of being anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s969">And then, of course, to capture all people who had been in the navy, air force, army, or armed force, everybody, to be deported for labor -- allegedly, for labor, to Germany.</span> <span id="s970">So again, they used their tru -- th-the railway, not to help people to come back into the city, or send them ba -- to transport [indecipherable] people than they took, allegedly for labor, and the immediate work of the Resistance was to organize assistance.</span> <span id="s971">And that organization was -- POW was let out of the camps.</span> <span id="s972">When I met Leo Valiani, and spoke to him, as well as I spoke to Ricardo Lombardi and others, “How many people did the Italian ordinary people help to escape?”</span> <span id="s973">And he said, “Prissipoco diachemila.”</span> <span id="s974">App-Approximately 10,000 people, which did not surprise me.</span> <span id="s975">But people immediately helping everybody.</span> <span id="s976">The -- the Italian military of all, air force, navy, mari, everybody, army.</span> <span id="s977">Jewish people, and a lot of POW, who were let out of the camps, the camps were open, the prisoner of war were open, and so these young people, these prisoner, young and middle aged, disbanded all over they could go, seeking -- hiding in the farm, and every place, because the German began immediately trying to recapture them, and force the Italian military -- of military age, who had been in the services, immediately recruited them for deportation to Germany, allegedly for -- they were rebuilding things.</span> <span id="s978">So, it was chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: In this chaos, were you in danger because your parents were picked up?</span> <span id="s980">Were they looking for you, or didn’t they know you existed?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I don’t think they knew I existed at that time.</span> <span id="s982">But, it -- the Mullisanno, the Ritsini, Contamessa, and everybody else, who had alre -- was already organized with groups in the underground, already, but immediately they said, “Never go near your place, never go near your nurse, never go near your close friend.”</span> <span id="s983">No sisamide, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s984">And above all, there was the work of organizing assistance, and that’s what we focused on, immediate assistance, because streets were blocked by the German tank, few days, and they were looking for young people, for young men, ital -- and for Jewish people, and our job was to work with hundreds of other ch -- young children, women, men, to be the mobile telephone, human telephone from block to block, and the German are blocking the Immocatcho, they [indecipherable], the German are blocking such and such a street.</span> <span id="s985">The German are blocking such and such a street, etcetera.</span> <span id="s986">And to help people escape off -- unfortunately many were caught, because there was no way we could find civilian clothes for everybody, so we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s987">As far as POW, was e -- very difficult, because the shoes never fit, the clothes were too sm-small for those tall -- especially Australian, or -- but they w -- there were woods around the city, around Milan, Pavia, Bijaivano, there were woods, so many of the people were trying to escape, escaped to woods, and then there were farms, and then there were convents.</span> <span id="s988">Some convents, for example, were pilgrim at -- used to go through and find shelter to go to Rome, or whatever.</span> <span id="s989">[indecipherable] became places where people could find some shelter, temporary, of course, and then the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s990">The Swiss border was our salvation in many way.</span> <span id="s991">And that’s when the smuggler, who had made a living with smuggling, with contrabando for centuries, they knew where every passage was.</span> <span id="s992">And they, with very few exception, all of -- with few exception, they became our greatest helper.</span> <span id="s993">Men, women, children, it was an im -- unimaginable display of the solidarity of the human spirit.</span> <span id="s994">Needless to say, unfortunately, they were all saying filtrator, o-or infiltrated themself with the military in the Swiss camp, which were made available to the Italian Army, Navy, Air Force, and -- and specialists.</span> <span id="s995">But by and large, it was a message of how ordinary people did a s -- extraordinary thing, in extraordinary, difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Ca-Can you describe taking people through the border?</span> <span id="s997">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Well, it was not easy, because you had to have -- first of all, you would be -- I mean, we’re several places where we were living, working, hiding, and only the central group knew how to reach us, and the stuffetta, like I can mention one, Nino Benedetti, for example, he was only 15 or 16, he was extraordinary, Jako Padentichay, Meno Scapolla, or me -- and many f -- children of France, in cri -- 12 - 13 - 14 - 15, and women.</span> <span id="s999">And [indecipherable] people, old people, young pe -- it was a -- they would be sent to communicate with this church, with this convent, with this farm, with this office, and say there are two paci, tre paci, une paco.</span> <span id="s1000">Paco was the word for a person, so, chi serrano tre paci, kari verrano en Viama Kerajoya.</span> <span id="s1001">Well, three packages, which were [indecipherable] Kerajoya, they didn’t tell us how tall they were, how fat or thin, or young, or old.</span> <span id="s1002">And so the most important thing was trying to have food, which was very, very scarce.</span> <span id="s1003">And here I have to tell a story, because it’s really -- we can laugh.</span> <span id="s1004">The Fascist had a habit of preaching that we had to sacrifice for the welfare of the country, and we have to stick to your ration, etcetera, but we all knew then some -- not all, some were very honest, some believed in Fascism, and there were some who were very corrupt people.</span> <span id="s1005">And when you have a dictatorship, you will always have corrupt people.</span> <span id="s1006">And we knew then very often, they arrested people who had nagotsi a store of fromage, fr -- cheese and salami, and prosciutti, but who were rationed, everything was rationed, or brought in from the countryside, and there were often rice subtracted to the forced giving than the Fascists had implemented at that time.</span> <span id="s1007">You must give this, you make -- you work, and you produce five sacks of rice, well, one has to go to the government, and they came, and th -- to the farm, and looked, and -- and checked, and counterchecked, and if a farmer had not pr -- given everything, and they found something, it was the prison.</span> <span id="s1008">And deportation even at -- ot [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1009">Well, what we did, we found that one of these Fascists had a kashaday, a cellar full of food.</span> <span id="s1010">Salami, cheese, so one -- Guido was his name, he and others org -- first of all, they requisitioned a truck from the Fascists, pretending to be Fascists.</span> <span id="s1011">Then they went to this place, and they loaded everything they could find, and believe me, there was salami and cheese, prosciutto, and you name it, it was incredible.</span> <span id="s1012">Butter, scarce as one can be.</span> <span id="s1013">Farina for polenta, rice.</span> <span id="s1014">Anyway, they made it available to us to use for the people who were hiding, and I must confess, and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1015">I know then you don’t steal, but in these particular circumstances, I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1016">And this is some of the food that we actually use, and we stored it with the help of Mrs. Columbo in the cellar, where we could share it with other -- and I have to confess that I gorged myself too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And how did people get to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: I mean, h -- how was the network?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: It was a -- it was a network of people, I wouldn’t know the name of the people who brought -- let’s say -- let’s take Viama Kerajoya, although I can -- there were many other places, I’m using this as an example.</span> <span id="s1021">Quickly, we were given three apartments in this building, and plus another apartment in Viama Kerajoya, in another building.</span> <span id="s1022">And when we got the notice duo paci, tre paci, etcetera, the only apartment we could not use ourself, but was used by the underground, was the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s1023">And we stay away from that.</span> <span id="s1024">Well, we would get from the potinaya, from the concierge, this little note that there would be duo paci, tre paci, quattro paci, and we would have somebody staying all the time.</span> <span id="s1025">And these were like -- for example, this girl, I don’t remember her name, except then she was lame.</span> <span id="s1026">I can’t remember her name now.</span> <span id="s1027">She died of TB later, after the war.</span> <span id="s1028">But there was a whole group of children, of friends, women, old men, and everybody took turn, but then it was us who were familiar with the border, who had to take the person to the next step.</span> <span id="s1029">And for me, it was Aljanio, or it was Como, and not just for me, but for all the friends in the group of the mountains.</span> <span id="s1030">These would be mountain loving people that young -- young girl, like all that group then, is gone now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1032">You know what I thought we would do?</span> <span id="s1033">Maybe we’d look at the map, and you would -- you can trace it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Let me change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I’m getting too tired, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: You’re getting too tir --</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I have to eat something now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: I don’t know about you, but I’m [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Okay, we’re going to stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, on September 24th, 1999, in Atherton, California.</span> <span id="s1044">This is tape number four, side A. Ginetta, you wanted to speak about a sort of double person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Well, one of the difficulty we had in the underground was that we always had to be careful about infiltrator into our group of assistance to the prisoner.</span> <span id="s1046">And we have to remember that we assisted family and prisoner.</span> <span id="s1047">There were people who were working, helping the war effort, for the allies, for the Committee of National Liberation in Milan, and elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1048">Torino, Valdosta, val -- everyplace.</span> <span id="s1049">And one of the difficulty we had was when a person was taken, the interrogation in depth, which meant torture, led to picking up other people.</span> <span id="s1050">And I would never blame anyone for speaking under torture, because it’s unbelievable the horror than they can perpetrate on human being.</span> <span id="s1051">One of the places in Milan where the prisoner were taken was San Vittory, and there was a special section which was controlled by the SS, and the moti.</span> <span id="s1052">The SS had control of the prisoner brought there.</span> <span id="s1053">Usually their major interest was in information, people who are work -- working to gather information useful to the allies in the war effort.</span> <span id="s1054">One of the key people in that accession of the SS, was named Hugo Osteria.</span> <span id="s1055">Hugo Osteria had been a policeman -- political policeman for the Ovra, the secret police of Mussolini, or the Fascists, throughout that period.</span> <span id="s1056">And when, after September eight, the -- he began working for the SS, and the Gestapo in San Vittory, in the section specialized in -- in interrogation.</span> <span id="s1057">Besides Hugo Osteria, there was a -- a man, whose name was Franz, and he had huge dogs that he didn’t mind unleashing on the prisoner.</span> <span id="s1058">And another, Sawecki, something like that, s -- li -- Sawecki -- s -- I can’t remember the spelling, Sawecki.</span> <span id="s1059">He was an SS captain.</span> <span id="s1060">Hugo Osteria was the interpreter for the SS, for the Gestapo in that particular area.</span> <span id="s1061">So, he approached the committee of National Liberation, and said, “I want to help you.”</span> <span id="s1062">So he would give us the name of the people detained in the particular area if he could, and also to let us know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1063">Needless to say, we had other sources, mostly the suarai, the nun, the doctor, being careful, but was one.</span> <span id="s1064">The baker was another one who was very helpful.</span> <span id="s1065">And -- but Hugo Osteria became important.</span> <span id="s1066">So, what he did was sometime he let people be tortured, deported to Germany.</span> <span id="s1067">Among them was Jainjo Bamphi, the brother of Senator Arialdo Bamphi, a-and the husband of Mrs. Bamphi, whom I met, and she described that it was Hugo Osteria who arrested Jainjo Bamphi in their home.</span> <span id="s1068">So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them, and he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like Ferucho Parai, then later on, at the end of the war, would testify on his behalf.</span> <span id="s1069">But many other people, like Jako Perdenti, Cheenira Scapolla, and Jainjo Bamphi were not only tortured, but then deported to Mauthausen, where they died.</span> <span id="s1070">And this was typical of this man, and other working for the Nazi and the Fascist.</span> <span id="s1071">Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation, and the church, information about certain prisoner, or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by some family desperate to get help for their prisoner.</span> <span id="s1072">But essentially, you never knew.</span> <span id="s1073">Certainly she never trusted them, and eventually the allies decided that this man was so unreliable that he had to be shipped in the southern part of Italy.</span> <span id="s1074">And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss Intelligent Services, how he, personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of politsiato, political politsiato, never to be trusted, that he would give some help when it was possibly beneficial for him in the future, in the political settlement after the war.</span> <span id="s1075">But helped to arrest people, did a lot of damage, used informer, and unfortunately, because of the double game, managed to gain the trust of some people in the underground, which led to disastrous results.</span> <span id="s1076">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: I’m taking a break.</span> <span id="s1078">We’re back from our break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: But you can understand why I just don’t want to [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1080">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1081">I wanted Hugo Osteria to be known as a skunk.</span> <span id="s1082">But we have also cristori, police chief, who were asked to keep their job.</span> <span id="s1083">It was very important than they stayed where they were.</span> <span id="s1084">They had access to curfew paper, so that people could say, I’m a doctor, I’m a nurse, I need to travel after the curfew is implemented, and were very helpful.</span> <span id="s1085">One of the first thing when the Committee of National Liberation did was to have false identity card made for various people, Jewish, Catholic, the people working in the underground, and -- so, there was this man, whose name was Joe Bacigalupi.</span> <span id="s1086">I don’t know where he came from, except that he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1087">Joe Bacigalupi work with the Committee of National Liberation, and he was a genius.</span> <span id="s1088">What he did, according to my friend in the Resistance movement, and I was the beneficiary of his work for our people, what he did was to say to the cristori, “Look, this was is going to be won by the allies, not by the Fascists.</span> <span id="s1089">If you help us, we will help you, and many other people.”</span> <span id="s1090">Now, I don’t know why they -- he needed help, I have no idea, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1091">What they asked him to do was to -- the underground asked him to ask the cristori for a list of the best forgerer, who had been either in prison in Milan, or were in prison because of forgery.</span> <span id="s1092">So Joe Bacigalupi became the number one specialist in doing forged document.</span> <span id="s1093">And was an enormous help, because we helped, working as cleaning people, cleaning floor, latrine, and other, for the Fascist, and for the German.</span> <span id="s1094">And because you are a cleaner, doing meaning job, they don’t consider you a person who has hear, and -- you know, all what they knew was that we were cleaner, perfect beggar, peasant, and -- and they would talk quite freely around people, because they didn’t think that we wa -- but among all, was to steal.</span> <span id="s1095">To steal some blank -- blank paper which were the koolfer -- call curfew for the lushapasari.</span> <span id="s1096">And that was very important, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: What i -- what is luss --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Lushapasari means those papers, official paper that allowed people to travel after curfew was implemented.</span> <span id="s1099">But then it happen -- Joe Bacigalupi, and the team of forgerer, when they had this, then it was their job to duplicate, raticate, etcetera, and make it available, and there was some for the doctor, some for the people of assistance, and many -- false, of course, but the German caught on of that.</span> <span id="s1100">So every once in awhile, every two or three months, and they would change the papers.</span> <span id="s1101">So here we go, the cleaning lady, the cleaning ti -- di -- or boys, or whatever, and -- and we had to take some more, or sometime we worked as cleaning lady from some Fascist and onners, and get some more, but Joe Bacigalupi, and with the cooperation of the cristori, the policeman, whoever, he managed to get the list of all the forgerer.</span> <span id="s1102">He was best forgerer in -- in Milan, and for other paper.</span> <span id="s1103">We were told at that time, that the allied in Switzerland had botched a job of duplicating false paper, which caused immediately the arrest of the two people who were carrying this false paper into Italy from Switzerland, so Joe Bacigalupi said, “Damn it, how stupid.</span> <span id="s1104">Those allies my have much money and all that, but they don’t know how to do things.”</span> <span id="s1105">And he was right.</span> <span id="s1106">Eventually he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1107">Eventually, with the help of the inside guard, a key was left unattended, so that he could walk out at lunchtime when everybody was busy eating.</span> <span id="s1108">So this is some of my recollection.</span> <span id="s1109">And then of course, his paper were very important for people to bring to Switzerland, and all people were sent from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1110">But then, in Switzerland too, we had a problem.</span> <span id="s1111">On one point, an infiltrator, I believe his name was Cherasa, but I’m not certain.</span> <span id="s1112">I believe so.</span> <span id="s1113">He managed to go into one of these camps for Italian military, where he learned about plans by the allies, and -- to get people out, and he managed to get out and report to the -- San Vittory, to Hugo, and to the other group, what this Italian prisoner in the Swiss camp were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did in bringing back into Italy these people to help in the underground, cause the ally needed help with specialists in demolition, for railway, for bridges, and so some Italian were very happy to get out of the camp, and help the allies to -- to do these kind of jobs.</span> <span id="s1114">So you needed people to be very careful in the camps because of infiltrator, like this Cherasa, who they managed to get out, and go to report to Hugo, and to these people.</span> <span id="s1115">And you needed specialists in demolition, se -- others.</span> <span id="s1116">But the reason I think about Aurora was that here was a young woman in her 20, who gave her life to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: So, in a small way, we have tried to honor her, as well as the others.</span> <span id="s1119">This is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: And you’re referring to the Aurora Foundation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Ca-Can you just briefly -- when -- when we look at this map -- we’re now looking at a map of the northern part of Italy -- mon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah, but [indecipherable] Drunaggo is here.</span> <span id="s1124">A-All this area here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Which is the last --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: -- is border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Now, there are many other border --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: -- that we crossed.</span> <span id="s1131">[indecipherable] people -- brought people over, etcetera, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: So if you could trace --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: From -- well, all these area here, there are farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: But between Milano, Pavia, major university, major center of Intelligence gathering.</span> <span id="s1136">Actually, there was a group called U16, led by a professor of Pavia, a -- Bowerkio, who used to use my apartment for people to escape.</span> <span id="s1137">And Usmiani, somebody called Usmiani.</span> <span id="s1138">Now, all these people were involved in helping people to safety, as well people who guarded informations for the allies -- for the Committee of National Liberation.</span> <span id="s1139">Committee of National Liberation gave it to them.</span> <span id="s1140">Then, this is the area where -- I have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: We’re now looking at a colored -- colored map that will be in the file.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yes, but I have a place where I cannot see very well, I’m fogged.</span> <span id="s1143">Ronaggo.</span> <span id="s1144">All these area here, all these peasant --</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Is this Ronaggo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: I can’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No, I had a fogging, let me see if I can clean my -- well I know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: I’m looking --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: First of all, we have to find Aljanio.</span> <span id="s1151">It was from Aljanio, then the Valdentelvi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Aljanio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Aljanio, that’s Lake of Como.</span> <span id="s1154">From the Lake of Como, and there is the Valdentelvi.</span> <span id="s1155">This is Comkioni, where we had a big network.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Here’s Lugano, is it Como?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Lugano is here, Como is over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Shall we look at another map?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Let’s get another map.</span> <span id="s1160">See [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Oh, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: See [indecipherable] I -- I ha -- no, I hav -- I must have another map.</span> <span id="s1163">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Here’s Como.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1166">From Como -- this is not a good map, let me get a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: This is not a good map, okay.</span> <span id="s1168">I’m going to -- I’m going to stop the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: [indecipherable] no, no, this is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: That’s the same one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: But there was one.</span> <span id="s1172">But there was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Shall I stop the tape and let --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Can’t see, it’s so foggy.</span> <span id="s1175">I don’t understand why my glasses are so foggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Aljanio [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Okay, Aljanio, and then we find the Valdentelvi.</span> <span id="s1178">Casasco, all those little places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Ah, bide -- Intelvi -- Intelvi, I don’t know if that’s the same one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yeah, but I want to find Casasco, where I brought those children.</span> <span id="s1181">San Fidelit Intelvi, here’s a very important [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: And then, it goes all the way up here, near Lugano, and all this area here, all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Chanada austenno?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Y-Yes, but the San Fidelit Intelvi, is here.</span> <span id="s1186">On the opposite side of San Fidelit Intelvi, there are other villa -- little bitops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Now they’re all villas, but at that time they were all bitop.</span> <span id="s1189">And, goes up, and Ronaggo -- okay, Lasold Intelvi was a major center osemistamento.</span> <span id="s1190">That is to say, people were brought to Lanso, and here was a wonderful network, with Laya Basso, his wife, Lizzie Buf -- Basso, who became senator later on.</span> <span id="s1191">And Julia Bamphi, Jainjo Bamphi, their house, and was a -- a major --</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: -- smuggling center, organized it, and Lydia organized all the smuggler -- knew [indecipherable] all the smuggler throughout all this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Area, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: And with Guido Bustelli, the chief of the fra -- Swiss Intelligence Service --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: They organized passages throughout all these border.</span> <span id="s1198">And sometime was done through Ronaggo, sometime through Beesbeenyo, sometime to Arroyo, sometime -- all this area is consider a passing point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: And all this area was patrolled at first, from -- by old Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Then, when Lydia, and cohorts, began organizing dinner with food, drink, women, helped by little Katoria along the way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: -- while the churches were sheltering the people to be passed.</span> <span id="s1205">So Lydia was organizing the dinners.</span> <span id="s1206">And at first the Austrian were very easy.</span> <span id="s1207">Then, the German realized that -- what was happening, and instead of sending all the -- Austria, and they began sending SS.</span> <span id="s1208">And true, they were SS who may have been f -- wounded on other fronts, but they were SS.</span> <span id="s1209">And then they began to patrol with the dogs.</span> <span id="s1210">And then it became more and more difficult, but we had the help of Bustelli and all the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1211">Bustelli realized that his office had been infiltrated, it was somebody, ba -- so he began talking to the -- not only to Lydia, but all to the smuggler in the dialect of the Teecheeno, which is incomprehensible to many people.</span> <span id="s1212">And the day Leonard and I visited him, he -- he wrote a poem which I have in dialect, in my file.</span> <span id="s1213">But he ro -- the whole area, the churches, the smuggler, the farmer, the pe -- everybody was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: It was hilar --</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: -- helping, and on the other side, there were the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1216">So I am aware then the Swiss kept money from the Jewish people, but I want to thank the Swiss people, who helped so much, not only with the border crossing, but also in the camps.</span> <span id="s1217">I mean, there were some good people, and they deserve recognition for their courage.</span> <span id="s1218">Now the dogs became a problem, and I want to mention what Lydia said, pass the words that we had to carry precious little ground meat.</span> <span id="s1219">Inside there was a pill for the dogs, and above all, not to show fear.</span> <span id="s1220">Lie down, pretend to sleep, leave the meat available right next to you, and as soon as the dog gulps that down, then the dog goes to sleep.</span> <span id="s1221">Again, these are thing that we had no idea, but she and the network working with her, and the network with erking in Milan, all together, taught us.</span> <span id="s1222">We were really greens on this matter.</span> <span id="s1223">But the farmer, and the Pastore deser -- an-and then there was the guardida finansa, who were the Italian treasuries.</span> <span id="s1224">Some of them remained faithful to Fascist, but few of them.</span> <span id="s1225">The others all helped.</span> <span id="s1226">So that when passages had to be done, organized by a, the network of the smart lerrer, and both Lydia from the Italian point, and Bustelli from the Swiss point, but there were a thousand of people working in the whole network.</span> <span id="s1227">Then, it was very important in the guardida finansa, the Italian one, would turn their back so that we could do it.</span> <span id="s1228">One of our job was to patch the holes.</span> <span id="s1229">Now, the arrangement for passing between Bustelli, and Lydia, and their network, because obviously, was big network, was done by arrangement with special bell put on the collar of the goats.</span> <span id="s1230">And the signal of the bell suggested the place of passing.</span> <span id="s1231">It was an organization, but the -- of course, we have to remember, the smuggler have been there for thousand of years.</span> <span id="s1232">After the war, they became restaurant owner, bar owner, and we had the joy of meeting, my husband and I, and my son, actually, as well, and dot -- and granddaughter, we went to meet one of them in the Easala comatchina, on the Lake of Como, where there is a marvelous restaurant, and is run by s -- former smuggler, and their children, and their sa -- children now of course in their 40 and 50.</span> <span id="s1233">So it’s really an homage to ordinary people once again, but this woman deserve special recognition for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: You mean Lydia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Lydia.</span> <span id="s1236">She -- I believe she never went beyond the third grade, but her capacity for organizing was incredible.</span> <span id="s1237">Also her courage, and there are stories that we don’t have time to go into it, but one brief one was that on one occasion, a man than she taught was with us, sent by the Committee of National Liberation in Milan.</span> <span id="s1238">Turned out that he -- she helped him to go to the military camp.</span> <span id="s1239">From there he learned a great deal, then he -- and then he came back and started her home, and she realized that he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1240">At this point, two partisan came at her home, with guns.</span> <span id="s1241">And this man, of course, also could do something.</span> <span id="s1242">And Lydia said to the two partisan, “Please, please, I have two small daughter.</span> <span id="s1243">If you kill him, then the whole village will be burned.</span> <span id="s1244">Everything will be burned, and we will lose everything.</span> <span id="s1245">So please go away, go away.”</span> <span id="s1246">And they did.</span> <span id="s1247">So this Nazi man took Lydia to Milan, probably to the SS, she doesn’t know where they took her.</span> <span id="s1248">They sat her in a room where they gave her a big meal, and she thought this was her last supper.</span> <span id="s1249">Then somebody came, took her by train back to Ronaggo, to the train station, gave her a note.</span> <span id="s1250">Inside there was two gold coins, one for each of her daughter, and a little note.</span> <span id="s1251">“You saved my life, I am now saved yours.</span> <span id="s1252">But there will be no next time.”</span> <span id="s1253">So Lydia was so terrified by this experience, that she went to the home in the Swiss side of a friend and very active member of the underground, and she went to sleep.</span> <span id="s1254">And when she woke up -- these man had the penchant for putting mask with colored lights all over around the room.</span> <span id="s1255">So when she woke up, she saw all these mask with all these lights, and she screamed, “Ayuto, ayuto, ayuto.”</span> <span id="s1256">And -- and all of a sudden, a -- several young men in trunk, because it was hot, arrived, beautiful young men who were waiting to pass through the Italian-Swiss border, to come to Italy to work.</span> <span id="s1257">And she said to me, “Well, when I saw all those beautiful young men, I thought, if this is hell,” because she thought she was in hell, ayuto, “if this is hell, I will stay.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And what is -- what is ayuto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Ayuto means help, help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: So Shirley Dondréa came with me, and we went with -- you know, with Lydia, we saw this beautiful villa.</span> <span id="s1262">The owner was working with the underground, but he was also a major entrepreneur, traffic dinart, the Swiss knew it.</span> <span id="s1263">But when he died, he left everything to Lydia, and -- because she helped, saved his life many times.</span> <span id="s1264">But anyway, this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley took a -- pictures of this room with all the mask, with the colored light, and so we had a jolly good laugh at that time, and realized that the war was really over, we could talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Did you see Lydia much during the -- during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Oh -- oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: No, far from it.</span> <span id="s1269">We knew about the famous Lydia, but -- she did other things that are incredible, such as she dressed like a bride, with a man dressed like a groom.</span> <span id="s1270">From Milan they retrieved very precious material which was on a truck.</span> <span id="s1271">And dressed like a bride and a groom, they crossed the borders, raising her sk-skirt flirtatiously with the German border, and then as soon as they arrived, then she has a -- a str -- tremendous number of people who came out of the woods to help unload the truck, because it cor -- contained precious material than the Swiss could not get.</span> <span id="s1272">And so Bustelli commissioned her to organize from Milan, this truck, loaded with this precious material, dressed like a bride, cross the border with a groom, and then as soon as they were on the other side, say this band of bandits -- I mean no, they were -- came out, and apparently, from what I learned from others, she had a stick and ran and said, “Faster, faster, faster, get it out.”</span> <span id="s1273">Because they were afraid then the German would realize the trick, and go after them.</span> <span id="s1274">But this is Lydia for you.</span> <span id="s1275">You saw her picture.</span> <span id="s1276">No, then she thought that I was dead, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: So she said the mass, and so when I went to see Guido Bustelli with Leonard, and he’s [indecipherable] died, and said, “Lydia is here.”</span> <span id="s1279">Well, it was a very emotional reunion.</span> <span id="s1280">And let me show you a picture of Lydia in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Good, okay.</span> <span id="s1282">We’re going to take a break so that Ginetta can get this picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: This is tape number four, side B. Okay, we’re back and we’re now looking at an album, wonderful photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Oh yeah, these are the -- when we became honorary citizen, [indecipherable] I’m looking for me there.</span> <span id="s1286">You can look at [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: This is [indecipherable] lady, we had of the Institute

is the mayor, this is his assistant, who works there all the time, and she speaks English.</span> <span id="s1293">Okay, here is Lydia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: There’s Lydia.</span> <span id="s1295">And this is what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: This is Titiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: That’s Titiana?</span> <span id="s1298">A: Oh this was -- this is Titiana.</span> <span id="s1299">This was two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: When we became honorary citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Right,

of Italy, yes, in 1997.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Oh, of Brusonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Of Brusonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span

Valdosta.</span> <span id="s1319">Was a very emotional day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: And this is you and Leonard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: And Leonard.</span> <span id="s1322">See, he had regained quite a bit after surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: I’m so grateful to life than gave us that extra time.</span> <span id="s1325">There is some member of the media.</span> <span id="s1326">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s1327">This is Steve.</span> <span id="s1328">I don’t have to go to the doctor, he comes [indecipherable].</span> <span

Leonard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Well, what a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: What a life.</span> <span id="s1363">Are you -- will you talk to me a little bit about your arrest?</span> <span id="s1364">Is that okay, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: About who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Your arrest.</span> <span id="s1367">When they picked you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1369">Because our friend -- well, first of all, I was sent in Valdosta.</span> <span id="s1370">Now this is important.</span> <span id="s1371">I have written about it.</span> <span id="s1372">One of the underground activity was to organize people, sometime to go and evaluate the disaster made by certain destroy policy, by the Nazi in the valley, where we had so many partisan.</span> <span id="s1373">And in Valdosta, in particularly Valtoonage, there was a very important group led by Usmiani, called the U16, Usmiani.</span> <span id="s1374">And Buerkio.</span> <span id="s1375">Buerkio was the professor at the University of Pavia.</span> <span id="s1376">And he had access to my apartment, in fact, he personally often came on emergency, for instruction, also for training, for other people involved, into valdo -- Valdosta, and other, where the eevrie adeeoli veti company.</span> <span id="s1377">The people at the high level, chief executive officer, and others, all these people had homes in -- in Cherveenia for skiing, in the valleys.</span> <span id="s1378">That was normal.</span> <span id="s1379">But was also a center, in Valtoonage, for transmitting to the allies, informations via these whom -- I didn’t know who it was.</span> <span id="s1380">However, I was told that after the Rustellimenti, there was this page, then -- there is one page that you can copy, there was a frantic telephone call -- not telephono, some me -- some message, radio, whatever, I don’t know exactly, to the Committee of National Liberation saying why the Germans -- the Nazi are negotiating in oursta with the church, and the representative of the partisan bands, or the truvalai, bartonunch, valdayass, dressonai.</span> <span id="s1381">They are actually already starting towns to go, and people dressed in camouflage, including some very cruel troops, already starting to catch the partisan on their back -- clean up the valley.</span> <span id="s1382">So here they were negotiating in oursta.</span> <span id="s1383">The church in good faith.</span> <span id="s1384">Tito, or ever, who is the commander of the Valtoonage did not go personally, as he was asked to do, but send somebody, because he sensed -- he smelled somebody.</span> <span id="s1385">So there was this frantic call, or communication from Valdosta to Milan, to the Committee of National Liberation.</span> <span id="s1386">The information had come from -- I was told, from somebody who went to a beauty parlor from our side, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, “Oh yeah, they are negotiating with the church, but they are going to clean up.</span> <span id="s1387">The German are already started.”</span> <span id="s1388">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1389">So, immediately, there was this one page, frantic communication to Valdosta, it was too late.</span> <span id="s1390">We lost a lot of people, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1391">Many people were killed, and there was a traitor who was working right next to Tito.</span> <span id="s1392">And when the time came for this person to go and give the meecha, the fire to the bridge, so then the tank couldn’t go, he killed the other person with it.</span> <span id="s1393">So -- and he had been with -- with us for three months and nobody realized that he was a double.</span> <span id="s1394">But this I confirmed with Monsieur Tiba, when I saw him.</span> <span id="s1395">And I spoke to Tito a few years ago about all this.</span> <span id="s1396">So, after this disaster, we lost a lot of people, including young people that we had send up, because they didn’t want to go to Switzerland, they wanted to participate in the active Resistance movement, so we send them up to the banns.</span> <span id="s1397">And among them a young man, Hoos Franco from either Maltarra, or Pavia, very close by, but actually, we were involved, our group was involved.</span> <span id="s1398">Soon after all this disaster occurred, I was told by a friend, member of our group, the Benedetti, who was a mountain climber, and his son was working with us, he wife was working with us, that it was very important to go up to Valtoonage, and assess the damage, but more importantly, it was very important to go to the house of pierovono, one of the guide, one of the Alpinist, and only since last dega -- August, I knew -- I learned that he was part of this special group, like Lashincross, I didn’t know before.</span> <span id="s1399">As far as we knew, we were all in the underground, working.</span> <span id="s1400">And these gentlemen, these architect, would come and pick me up at -- sometime early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1401">He had all the permit, and he had a house, he owned a home in Chervinia.</span> <span id="s1402">His name was architect Molino.</span> <span id="s1403">Never met him in my life, but I was supposed to be his mistress.</span> <span id="s1404">And, “But he’s a gentleman, Ginetta, you don’t have to worry, but we need somebody to go up with him, he own a house, and he has a perfect reason to see if damage was done, to fix it for the winter, and he has his mistress with him.”</span> <span id="s1405">And the mistress was me.</span> <span id="s1406">And so jus -- lo and behold, here, in November come this gentleman, and kiss my hand, and I go with him, he had all the passes, everything.</span> <span id="s1407">And we arrived, traveling to a place called Shationne.</span> <span id="s1408">Shationne is right at the entrance of the Valtoonage.</span> <span id="s1409">And we stopped.</span> <span id="s1410">He was going to place his car someplace in Shantionne, and we had to carry the knapsack.</span> <span id="s1411">I ask my ri -- I ask him if I could take a little suitcase, he said, “Yeah, if you feel like carrying that plus your knapsack, go ahead,” but, you know, I didn’t bring, I put everything in the knapsack.</span> <span id="s1412">But we had to bring up some medicine, and we arrive in Shantionne, we go to this little bric and brac little store.</span> <span id="s1413">This wonderful woman, Delphina was her name, and we chatted amiably, and then this architect said to me, “Go ahead, because I will catch up with you.”</span> <span id="s1414">Remember, I was in my teen, and he was probably 60, but he was much stronger.</span> <span id="s1415">So it was obvious that he -- well, I didn’t think much, but it was obvious that he wanted to talk to her.</span> <span id="s1416">Only in retrospect I figured all that out, but I didn’t at the time.</span> <span id="s1417">And we went, and we arrived in Valtoomage, and -- at the house of this family, and it was a -- all of the women were in black, they were -- well, they broke down crying, because of the horror.</span> <span id="s1418">And one of them described to me how Franco died.</span> <span id="s1419">They killed several people.</span> <span id="s1420">In fact, about 10 years ago, I took a picture of the monument to those people, and we went, and then I realized that we -- we wanted to stay in val -- I wanted to stay in Valtoomage, and he, no, no, we have to go ahead.</span> <span id="s1421">We went to Chervinia, and at the passage, at the block passage, there was Italian young Fascist.</span> <span id="s1422">Very energetic, very ideologically committed people, but he had passes, and they were passes from the Gestapo, the SS, or some authority, and immediately everybody was, oh, please let me help you, blah, blah, blah, and all kind, and -- and I thought, oh my God, you know, I -- I trust Benedetti, no -- no -- but at the same time, you are startled.</span> <span id="s1423">I never met this person, but he was kind.</span> <span id="s1424">We arrived at his house, I was so tired.</span> <span id="s1425">He helped me to take off my shoes, made a fire, and gave me something to drink, and -- and then I lied down and I slept for awhile, and then he woke me up, and he said, “We have to go.”</span> <span id="s1426">And we went to the home -- house owned by Pierovona in the same village.</span> <span id="s1427">And we ha -- w-we had to retrieve some material, which we did, and I had to put them in my chest.</span> <span id="s1428">Then, next day -- then I went back to bed -- next day, I s -- had to say to the Fascist that were mocking me for being with such an old man, etcetera, etcetera, that the altitude was not good for me, I had to go back, and say, “Oh yeah, this old man is no good, but we are good, come with us,” blah, blah, blah all that suns -- kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1429">But they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s1430">And I was going to walk down, but then they drove me down.</span> <span id="s1431">And at the val -- at the end, th -- at Shationne, there was a little hotel where I was supposed to stay.</span> <span id="s1432">When the hotel keeper saw me arrive with this Fascist, he was as cold as one can be, he said he -- yes, he had a room, but no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s1433">So, well, I went to -- to the bedroom, and about one or two in the morning, there were shots fired in my room, the glass fu -- so I went under the bed.</span> <span id="s1434">Until the day before, the -- somebody from the Fascist or the Nazi used this place.</span> <span id="s1435">So the partisan thought then they were still there, but I was there, so I went under the thing.</span> <span id="s1436">And about oh, few minutes later, some partisan came in with the red ankle chafe, and the machine gun is -- “Where is she, where is she?</span> <span id="s1437">Oh my God, what we have done?”</span> <span id="s1438">They knew, they learned that I was there.</span> <span id="s1439">So, the face of hotel keeper changed completely.</span> <span id="s1440">He b -- the partisan actually, they said, libber, please give her some -- anything.</span> <span id="s1441">So he brought out cheese and wine and bread, and -- and apologized.</span> <span id="s1442">And then he put some coal in a scarbaletto.</span> <span id="s1443">Is a gadget with a long handle, and inside put the coals, so that his wife warmed up the bed for me.</span> <span id="s1444">I mean, it was such a change.</span> <span id="s1445">And we -- next morning, I came down and he gave me -- I realized he put something in my knapsack which was very good, cheese and a piece of meat.</span> <span id="s1446">I arrived home, and the apartment up above was where those two friends, and it was clear that something had happened, the food was left.</span> <span id="s1447">And so I quickly got out, as well as bring the material to Viabeeli, and I was told then they were caught.</span> <span id="s1448">So I began working with Dom Bickuli.</span> <span id="s1449">And this Pierro, that I still don’t know, who was an elegant man, working with the cardinal, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1450">And the idea came, then I had to go and try to find hostages for exchange.</span> <span id="s1451">That’s little field that I have, is one example.</span> <span id="s1452">And the son of Corvul sent me, because he knew then I had -- we were doing this.</span> <span id="s1453">And I went north, all the way to another place, to another valley, up to Borneo.</span> <span id="s1454">Borneo Livino.</span> <span id="s1455">From Banktband with a password at each place, and -- and in Livino, I was told than [indecipherable] for exchange with our friends in Milan.</span> <span id="s1456">Well, that was February, beginning of February.</span> <span id="s1457">I took the bus, because I couldn’t walk any more, my feet were so swollen.</span> <span id="s1458">And I arrived in a place called Tiranno.</span> <span id="s1459">And in Tiranno, the bus was surrounded, and -- and so that’s how I was arrested.</span> <span id="s1460">And from Tiranno few days later, that was the brigatanari, to Sondrio.</span> <span id="s1461">And to Sondrio, a very important story, because I saw someone died, and all sorts of thing.</span> <span id="s1462">And then I was really -- I brought Milan to the mouti, and I was told by a man whose name was Crome that I didn’t speak, but they had the means to make me speak.</span> <span id="s1463">I didn’t doubt it, but I -- but then they released me because somebody said then, oh no, no, I was not involved.</span> <span id="s1464">Two hours -- I was still black and blue.</span> <span id="s1465">Two hours later, one of the people from Sondrio, who had accompanied me to the bi -- mouti in Milan, arrived.</span> <span id="s1466">And he said, “You are not working, so you have to come to Sondrio to work for us.”</span> <span id="s1467">And I said, “Well, I have an appointment with my doctor, because I have some problem with my lungs.”</span> <span id="s1468">And, “Well, you go and see your doctor and then you come back with us.”</span> <span id="s1469">So I went to the doctor, who was one of us, and the doctor meanwhile, had arranged for my friend, Enrico Mullisanno to arrive, and they said, “If you have the courage to do it, we would like you to -- to do it, to go back.”</span> <span id="s1470">Well, once they arrived back, it was clear that it was a ruse, too.</span> <span id="s1471">And it was -- it’s a long story, but the women of the Black Brigade were as bad as the men, and all of us remaining -- one was Bruno Bianci, whom I saw, and his wife was killed, the order came from Mussolini headquarter, from -- that all the people who may have been involved in Intelligence gathering -- and evidently they sus -- suspected that I was -- actually turnous, probably they were right, but I -- I didn’t know -- they should be executed.</span> <span id="s1472">And what they did was to make a sign that you were there voluntarily.</span> <span id="s1473">They received a tremendous amount of brand new money from someplace, and they made a sign than they had given us all this money, when it was in fact they kept it, you know.</span> <span id="s1474">And they wanted to interrogate me once again, which was, you know, it was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1475">But there was something really cruel about -- not all of them, at the point they were ready to be bad, but not all of them.</span> <span id="s1476">Still holding on to this -- what they were talk about?</span> <span id="s1477">The special weapon that the German would use, and would win the war after all, except after April thir -- 23rd.</span> <span id="s1478">And they were talking about them, and I was on the floor.</span> <span id="s1479">They didn’t want to leave witnesses to what they had done.</span> <span id="s1480">It was very important that I give the name of all our people, it was -- so, they were trying once again.</span> <span id="s1481">When the telephone rung, and somebody said than the German wanted to talk to me again.</span> <span id="s1482">Well, everything was falling apart, but still they couldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1483">And they were very angry that they didn’t dare to say no to the German, they still had an inferiority complex vis à vis of the German, I think.</span> <span id="s1484">That’s my personal impression.</span> <span id="s1485">And -- and two people dressed in German uniform came in, and made jokes about these Italian sissy, that they fall down on the floor, and f -- you -- you know.</span> <span id="s1486">So the Italian dragged me up, but the German hold -- held me, and they took me out to the car.</span> <span id="s1487">And from there they took me to the hospital where the nun received me and helped me.</span> <span id="s1488">But I only learned later there were a number of people involved, not only for me, but for others, and German deserter was -- were asked to help.</span> <span id="s1489">To intercept the communication in case the brigatanari, the mouti, would check to see whether it was true, that you still -- no, they didn’t trust anybody.</span> <span id="s1490">And so these people were risking their lives to -- to help us, to -- to survive.</span> <span id="s1491">And it was from Bustelli, and -- and Lydia that they were part of the organizing with the help, with the guardiri publicani.</span> <span id="s1492">The guardiri publicani were Italian who were called to serve.</span> <span id="s1493">If they didn’t, their father, their mother, would be beaten up, so they served, but they were our allies.</span> <span id="s1494">So there was a number of people involved in rescuing last minute people in the interrogation cells, because they knew that we would all be executed.</span> <span id="s1495">And so, for a couple of days, in the hospital, oh everything, you know, little broth, wonderful care.</span> <span id="s1496">And -- but for two days, I was hidden, and then one of the people from the underground in that area -- that’s another story, it’s too complicated, but apparently I saved his life, and, “Torpelino, Torpelino,” and then he came, and -- so then they brought me upstair and I was in a bed.</span> <span id="s1497">I was ca -- I had been cleaned up, and I was being treated, and I had wonderful care.</span> <span id="s1498">And then, I have to say, the Italian government did something that every government today should do for the people who are caught in such circumstances.</span> <span id="s1499">They took care of all the care, and I was in Sondolo, it is a place, used to be for TB only, but we were rec -- put there.</span> <span id="s1500">And then, from there f -- until September, and then to another place called San Martino di Castrotsa, in the mountains, for winter, and -- and then in Baratsai, f -- at the sea for a few months of treatment, and then I went to Scotland, and Paris, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Ginetta, see -- you were captured in February?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: February, 1945, beginning of February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: February, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: And helped to get out in Apri -- on April 23rd, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: So when they were torturing you, was this consistent, every day, was it -- w-was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: No, not every day, but they would do -- not only to me -- and remember, I was just one of other people Bianchi.</span> <span id="s1507">[indecipherable] time they took turn, first him, then me.</span> <span id="s1508">They had a hand generator for electricity.</span> <span id="s1509">And I get upset when some people say, well we have to stop armament, because that only will stop torture.</span> <span id="s1510">That’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1511">Torture can be applied in any small unity, by any means, by anybody.</span> <span id="s1512">And -- and I think by doing the -- the other, you divert the attention from the reality, that any lethal piddling group, can find a way and means to torture people, including in the prisons.</span> <span id="s1513">And -- but these were sophisticated matord, and many people didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1514">Tiberio Pansini died under torture.</span> <span id="s1515">And -- but also some people who were there, who tried to help.</span> <span id="s1516">And you know, you could see in their eyes that -- and then of course, they did, they help you to escape.</span> <span id="s1517">And also put out the matchbox, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Yes, could you tell that st-story, when you got the matchbox?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Well, because one of the point of the SS, the Gestapo, and [indecipherable] other police, everywhere, the point is to make the prisoner believe, that no one knows where he or she is, nobody care, the -- you are in their hands, period.</span> <span id="s1520">And there is a consistent effort to make the prisoner believe that you are in their hands, nobody knows where you are, nobody cares.</span> <span id="s1521">And one night, one of the guard shouting really bad words for a woman, you know, kicked the door open, and send this panino, that Italian bread, which is empty inside, you know, if you go to Milan, you’ll see it.</span> <span id="s1522">And I pick it up, and it was dark, but I -- we left the door open, but -- so I saw what it was, and -- and then I started eat, I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s1523">I was also afraid that there may be some poison inside.</span> <span id="s1524">But there was a matchbox, a tiny cherino.</span> <span id="s1525">They are called cherini, I’ve never seen one so small in the country.</span> <span id="s1526">They are cherini, and I lit it, and there was this little piece of paper, coracho.</span> <span id="s1527">So I knew.</span> <span id="s1528">No matter how many time they told me that nobody knows where I was, and I was.</span> <span id="s1529">But I think it was important because I -- psychologically you feel like giving up.</span> <span id="s1530">The other thing than they repeat to you day after day, that if you tell what happened to you to anybody, we will find you to the end of the earth, you will pay.</span> <span id="s1531">And it seems to be a deliberate conditioning for the prisoner, because they did it on both places, in the tirano and the other.</span> <span id="s1532">And a, nobody knows you are here.</span> <span id="s1533">You are in our hand, we can do what we want, and b, if you tell anybody, you -- we’ll find you to the end of the earth, you know, tha -- so, and -- working with prisoner later on in Chile, and re -- same thing.</span> <span id="s1534">Former prisoner, former victim of torture would tell me time after time the same thing.</span> <span id="s1535">And if it was in Greece or Chile, or Brazil, or Italy at that time, or Prague, or the soviet -- the same.</span> <span id="s1536">So it -- it’s -- there is an institution which is not necessarily taught, but developed by each one, by -- in each country.</span> <span id="s1537">And I think most important thing is to educate the public everywhere, then there was a meaning to the universal declaration of human rights, to make sure that see will never happen again to the Jewish people, to the anti-Fascist, to the anti-Stalin, to everybody else.</span> <span id="s1538">And so I am glad I survived all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: So are we.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1541">I’ve had the friendship of so many wonderful -- I discovered after the war that I was working with all the top people of the Committee of National Liberation, who, in their turn, were so helpful to our work for Amnesty International development.</span> <span id="s1542">So that’s really another story, than it’s incredible how, because of the friendship of that period, you learn something, but above all, they helped to develop organization to help other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1544">I’m going to take a slight break.</span> <span id="s1545">This is the -- I’m taking -- I’m back from my little break.</span> <span id="s1546">This is the end of the interview with
