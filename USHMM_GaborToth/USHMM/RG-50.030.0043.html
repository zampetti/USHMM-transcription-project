and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself.</span> <span id="s40">And these are memories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather.</span> <span id="s41">Or we went walking; and uh I even remember the streets where we went.</span> <span id="s42">And he would give me a little coin; and I would go inside and give my little penny on the counter, and uh--whatever it was--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy.</span> <span id="s43">And he waited for me outside.</span> <span id="s44">And uh his birthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s45">And I came to him to give him my little poem.</span> <span id="s46">I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family.</span> <span id="s47">That was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem.</span> <span id="s48">And I went to tell it to him, and he already didn't respond.</span> <span id="s49">I think he had a stroke.</span> <span id="s50">And I came out crying, because my grandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s51">That I don't remember.</span> <span id="s52">That I was told.</span> <span id="s53">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s54">I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I thought at that time.</span> <span id="s55">That I only remember loving things about him.</span> <span id="s56">And my grandmother was with us all my growing up.</span> <span id="s57">She had her birthday five days before mine; so we celebrated, more or less, birthday together.</span> <span id="s58">She always kept a piece of her cake for me.</span> <span id="s59">She was the one who told me stories.</span> <span id="s60">Uh I would crawl into her bed, and she would tell me a fairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time from her.</span> <span id="s61">Uh when I started going to school, she would cross the big street to help me cross back again.</span> <span id="s62">And I was more concerned about her crossing safely, but she was concerned my crossing safely.</span> <span id="s63">So it got a little complicated there.</span> <span id="s64">But she was in many ways the mother on whom I patterned my life.</span> <span id="s65">And she had in her...she had a very orderly closet.</span> <span id="s66">And in the closet, she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion this is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the same grave.</span> <span id="s67">She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to Theresienstadt [Czech: Terez√≠n].</span> <span id="s68">But I knew that['s] what she wanted.</span> <span id="s69">Uh that was a sort of a thing to do every Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s70">We would go to Grandfather's grave, and we'd put little stones.</span> <span id="s71">That's a tradition--you put a little stone.</span> <span id="s72">And if she was not able to go, I always put a little stone for her on my grandfather's grave.</span> <span id="s73">And uh after the...after I returned I always...when I'm in Prague go, and go to my grandfather's grave.</span> <span id="s74">And since we were not able to put her there, we had her...I had her name put on the same gravestone.</span> <span id="s75">And my relatives in Prague are maintaining the grave, even though many...even though so many are neglected.</span> <span id="s76">And uh so she is there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What, as you grew up, as you became a young woman, what was your schooling like?</span> <span id="s78">What were your friends like?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: For the first five years I went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s80">It was more Zionistic Jewish school, not a religious school.</span> <span id="s81">We were twenty boys and ten girls.</span> <span id="s82">Out of the ten girls, we were five Hannas--because it was a very popular name.</span> <span id="s83">And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can say, I'm the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s84">Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived.</span> <span id="s85">I am in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the fourth grade, which was a real find for me.</span> <span id="s86">After that, I went to gymnasium--which was the academic level.</span> <span id="s87">And uh then I went into a business school, and I started working and be very... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly.</span> <span id="s88">And my father led me to independence.</span> <span id="s89">Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the builders money, so he would have for his payroll.</span> <span id="s90">And in the beginning they looked at this little girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: "Is that on the level?"</span> <span id="s91">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s92">And I gave them a receipt, signed it.</span> <span id="s93">He told them it's OK, because nobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money.</span> <span id="s94">So he was leading me, again, pretty much to independence.</span> <span id="s95">Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent pneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me.</span> <span id="s96">I was the only live birth uh child.</span> <span id="s97">So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating for her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick glasses because she was so near-sighted.</span> <span id="s98">Uh I was...my character was much more like my aunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: As you grew older, um you began to become involved with the young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Uh I was...uh I was fortunate in my age we were still able to have some social life and go to dancing schools.</span> <span id="s101">It's all, you know, with the long dress and uh formalities.</span> <span id="s102">I was still about the last year that['s] where we were able to do it.</span> <span id="s103">And at that time, I was going with uh a student who was three years my age--so I was about sixteen, he was nineteen--by the name of Rudolph Schiff.</span> <span id="s104">We called him "Rudla."</span> <span id="s105">And uh when I was seventeen, and uh the gates were closing on us uh and uh...things were starting really getting bad, we got married November 14th, 1939, at the City Hall.</span> <span id="s106">Again, there was no housing for us.</span> <span id="s107">I went home.</span> <span id="s108">He went home in the evening, because there was no possibility.</span> <span id="s109">In his uh...his families lived a couple of blocks away from us, so that was no big problem.</span> <span id="s110">And uh as uh the Germans were closing in, we had to go into more and more cramped quarters.</span> <span id="s111">And his parents had a big apartment what had it sub-divided.</span> <span id="s112">And each bedroom was given to another family.</span> <span id="s113">And uh the uh...so there was really no where to go.</span> <span id="s114">Then one of the families were sent with transport to camp, so for couple of months we had one of the bedrooms.</span> <span id="s115">In the meantime, he got scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s116">And at that time, when you had scarlet fever uh you had to go for six weeks into a hospital.</span> <span id="s117">Today, somebody with scarlet fever--it's [like] a strep throat.</span> <span id="s118">A couple of days, and you are fine.</span> <span id="s119">They thought that you were infectious for six weeks, until your started to peel.</span> <span id="s120">I had scarlet fever when I was in the first grade, so I knew what it meant for six weeks to be in isolation--which I was.</span> <span id="s121">By the way, I was in that isolation at children['s] hospital; and the children['s] hospital was run by nuns.</span> <span id="s122">And the nuns said...came to us and uh said, "OK, children, get off your beds, kneel and pray."</span> <span id="s123">And I said to the nun, "I'm sorry, I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s124">I don't kneel."</span> <span id="s125">And so she said, "What are you going to do?"</span> <span id="s126">I said, "I'm going to pray in bed the way my grandmother taught me."</span> <span id="s127">And that was that.</span> <span id="s128">I did not follow the party line, and in many ways the nuns respected that.</span> <span id="s129">I was only seven--barely seven at that time, because I had my birthday in the hospital.</span> <span id="s130">And uh so he had scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s131">He had to go to the hospital; and while he was in the hospital, they brought in his room a little four year old--little Frankie.</span> <span id="s132">Cute little Frankie.</span> <span id="s133">The parents were Polish uh emigres who came to Czechoslovakia; and while he was in the hospital, they had to go with a transport and leaving the child in the hospital.</span> <span id="s134">They didn't allow them to wait until he was discharged.</span> <span id="s135">So my sister-in-law--my husband's sister, Margit--uh sort of adopted him and uh was to take him.</span> <span id="s136">He went to Theresienstadt, and while he was there she took care of him.</span> <span id="s137">But, of course, when she came with him to Auschwitz, she went to gas with him.</span> <span id="s138">But when he...we had really difficulty during that time of all kinds.</span> <span id="s139">Uh during that time things were getting worse in terms of uh getting supplies, buying food, working, going places.</span> <span id="s140">I remember going on the street and meeting one of my school friends.</span> <span id="s141">Of course, by that time I had the star; and as we came closer to each other, we walked slower and slower, thinking, "Should I stop?</span> <span id="s142">Should I talk?</span> <span id="s143">Who was it worse for, her?</span> <span id="s144">Is it worse for me?</span> <span id="s145">What should we go and do?"</span> <span id="s146">So... And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each other, and passed again.</span> <span id="s147">It...it was that sort of a situation.</span> <span id="s148">You had to think, "Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s149">Is today Saturday?</span> <span id="s150">Saturday, I cannot go this place.</span> <span id="s151">Friday, I cannot get that place."</span> <span id="s152">Because the restrictions were getting tighter and tighter.</span> <span id="s153">So it was a difficult time under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s154">Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff, who was finishing his MD degree.</span> <span id="s155">By that time, Hitler came.</span> <span id="s156">And there were only two Jewish uh people who were supposed to get their degree.</span> <span id="s157">You know, that big day in Europe--it was a much bigger day to get your degree.</span> <span id="s158">Uh they gave the degree to everybody; and they took the two Jewish fellows to the bathroom, and gave them their diploma in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s159">And uh he had, as I said, a sister and a brother- in-law.</span> <span id="s160">None of them have returned.</span> <span id="s161">Uh, my father-in-law died in the transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s162">He died uh on the way.</span> <span id="s163">And my mother-in-law, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the familienlager [Ger: family camp].</span> <span id="s164">And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s165">Uh, Rudla was with them; and uh I understood he was quite sick.</span> <span id="s166">And uh he died probably before he went to gas--in the familienlager, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s168">Can you tell us a little more about the early years, of the German invasion, what that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Uh, I remember the day they came.</span> <span id="s170">I remember the day I sto...I remember the place, the street where I stood, and it was snowing.</span> <span id="s171">It was a cold day and they were pulling in - I was by myself.</span> <span id="s172">I just walked there.</span> <span id="s173">It was not far, maybe three-quarters of a mile from where we lived.</span> <span id="s174">And we were uh uh watching them on their wagons with their tanks, with their half- tracks, with guns pointing to the rooftops.</span> <span id="s175">And it was snowing.</span> <span id="s176">And we knew that the screw is going to become tighter and tighter.</span> <span id="s177">Uh we knew what was happening in Austria.</span> <span id="s178">But somehow we still had some foolish idea we are in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s179">Because, I remember so clearly, when I was about eleven or twelve, I read a book about the Marranos.</span> <span id="s180">These were the uh Jews in Spain who during the Inquisition had a choice either to give up their religion or be uh converted [to] Catholicism; and many of them became converted only in name, and still celebrated secretly all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s181">And uh this was a very interesting story about the Inquisitor, etc.</span> <span id="s182">And I remember--you know, the kind of vignettes one remembers from childhood--I remember telling my grandmother, "Aren't we fortunate that we live in the 20th century in Czechoslovakia, that such a thing cannot happen to us!"</span> <span id="s183">Six short years, six short years [later, it] happened to us.</span> <span id="s184">Not only as to them, but much worse.</span> <span id="s185">Uh, kind of took away from us the protection that it happens to somebody else but not to us.</span> <span id="s186">One becomes and realizes how vulnerable one is.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: When did things begin to change--for your family, in particular?</span> <span id="s188">How did you... Describe some of it.</span> <span id="s189">.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Uh, I worked at that time what they used to call a Palestina Amt [Ger: Palestine Office].</span> <span id="s191">Uh, at that time there were still people able to move, uh emigrate.</span> <span id="s192">And of course, when you signed your paper for emigration, if I was Hanna Schiff at that time, I had to sign it as "Hanna Sarah Schiff."</span> <span id="s193">All the women had to put down "Sarah," and all the men had to put in "Israel" as a mid...as a middle name.</span> <span id="s194">And I was go...going to the Department of Treasury where I filled up some papers, and uh they had to pay that much of a..</span> <span id="s195">.</span> <span id="s196">They had to give a list of all their property they were going to take with us in the suitcases, and they had to pay that much for this and that much for that.</span> <span id="s197">And so I was working on that.</span> <span id="s198">And therefore, I knew that the Jacob Edelstein was the head of the Palestina Amt, and knew some people there-- which later became very important to me.</span> <span id="s199">Uh the... (pause) I worked during the time, but I cannot... My father for instance, he owned a workshop.</span> <span id="s200">That was taken away; and he had to start working again, because he didn't have such means.</span> <span id="s201">But fortunate my grandmother lived with my parents.</span> <span id="s202">Uh my parents' maid--who was worked with us probably ten, eleven years, was my mother's age--uh was very helpful and undemanding.</span> <span id="s203">And she went shopping, and she did what she could.</span> <span id="s204">But of course, her ration tickets were regular ration tickets; but our ration tickets were marked with a "J," so we couldn't shop when there was food in the stores.</span> <span id="s205">We could shop only at certain hours for certain things, etc.</span> <span id="s206">But nevertheless, she was very instrumental in helping us.</span> <span id="s207">Uh my parents were... Oh, I should go back to one thing.</span> <span id="s208">At that time uh when the Germans came, of course, they went to the Jewish Kultusgemeinde--the religious and cultural community--and wanted the name[s] of the Jews.</span> <span id="s209">And from there, they named...got the names of the transport.</span> <span id="s210">And we were so stupid, we went and we registered and we did what we could at that time.</span> <span id="s211">At that time, I had an infection in this finger, and uh it was following up my arm.</span> <span id="s212">And, of course, I couldn't go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s213">By the way, at that point we were not allowed to use the hospital.</span> <span id="s214">Little bit later, there was one private hospital converted; and Jews were able to use that little private hospital, which was very crowded.</span> <span id="s215">But at that time, there was nobody; and the infection was continuing.</span> <span id="s216">Uh the uh Aryan, non- Jewish, gentile uh fianc√©e of my brother-in-law--of Karel Schiff--uh took me without a star into the hospital, told them I am her cousin, had me operated, and took me by taxi home.</span> <span id="s217">By the way, we were not allowed to use taxis.</span> <span id="s218">So at great danger to her--because she had to tell them I am her cousin--I was operated in a regular hospital, and she took me home.</span> <span id="s219">Because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get help.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, these were the kind of things one doesn't even remember, because there were so many things that happened so often.</span> <span id="s221">But uh it was only because she had took me as her cousin, and she was a physician herself.</span> <span id="s222">Uh we were trying to hide a few things with some friends, and some friends were very cooperative and kept them.</span> <span id="s223">Uh some friends were afraid.</span> <span id="s224">And some friends decided if we don't come back, you know, they will keep it.</span> <span id="s225">It very much depended on which person.</span> <span id="s226">Uh I was just trying to think of something, and it just escaped me.</span> <span id="s227">Uh (SHORT PAUSE) that the... we helped by our listening to the orders to go and register people so they can be sent by transport.</span> <span id="s228">And it depended uh what you did, where you lived, how you went with it.</span> <span id="s229">So you were continuously threatened: "Am I going to be on the next transport?"</span> <span id="s230">Uh, of course, I'm not even talking about it that we had to give up uh jewelry, radio and so forth.</span> <span id="s231">Because if we listen to radio, it was dangerous, uh because all these restrictions were coming out.</span> <span id="s232">At one point, Heydrich--who was the protector of Czechoslovakia--uh was uh killed on one of the streets when two paratroopers who were sent from England were...threw a hand grenade under the car.</span> <span id="s233">And uh he was killed, and they were looking for them.</span> <span id="s234">And it was told that one was on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s235">So they came around us and looking and confiscating bicycles and all of that.</span> <span id="s236">And we knew daily how many, we had uh lists of people.</span> <span id="s237">They were in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s238">They were posted lists of people who were shot, who were hung, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s239">Friend of mine was among them.</span> <span id="s240">Political reasons, or whatever reasons there were.</span> <span id="s241">It was like if you were in... It was a screw.</span> <span id="s242">It was a forever tightening screw, with more regulations.</span> <span id="s243">And the screw was tightening over our heads.</span> <span id="s244">Uh my parents went in July-- June or July...at the end of July (cough), July of '42, uh to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s245">My grandmother went with them.</span> <span id="s246">My grandmother was at that time bed-ridden most of the time.</span> <span id="s247">Her mind was fine.</span> <span id="s248">Her hair was black.</span> <span id="s249">At eighty-six her hair was black and was long; and when I was good, I was allowed to braid it.</span> <span id="s250">And uh she...her mind was fine; but when my parents packed and went, uh she went with them because she lived with them.</span> <span id="s251">And when they came to carry her down, they carried her on a litter down the staircase and put her with the other old people on the bottom of a spediteur [Ger: "moving van"], of a moving van.</span> <span id="s252">And that's how they took her to the gathering place.</span> <span id="s253">The last word from her was: "Love each other.</span> <span id="s254">Be good to each other.</span> <span id="s255">Love each other.</span> <span id="s256">Be good to each other."</span> <span id="s257">As they carried her down the steps.</span> <span id="s258">There was no complaint; there was just kind of a blessing.</span> <span id="s259">And from my mother, I know--because I met my mother in Theresienstadt--she said in the moment she came to the gathering place, with all the commotion and all that craziness with her, she became so confused.</span> <span id="s260">She didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s261">She doesn't know what was happening to her.</span> <span id="s262">And uh they took her to Theresienstadt, nevertheless.</span> <span id="s263">They put them on trucks.</span> <span id="s264">You know, the kind of trucks when you move the beds so to slide things off.</span> <span id="s265">And then how they slid the old people off when they brought them to Theresien[stadt], so they put them to bed.</span> <span id="s266">She died three months...three weeks after arriving at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s267">And I was told [by] somebody she was begging for couple cubes of sugar from somebody who came to see her.</span> <span id="s268">And she was buried in one of the last mass graves at that time.</span> <span id="s269">The reason I know, when we came back after the war to Theresienstadt, we went to look up the original records.</span> <span id="s270">And in the original records, it showed when she was buried and what was the mass graves.</span> <span id="s271">We went to the field, because you could still see where they dug the furrows, put the bodies in and put the soil over it.</span> <span id="s272">So it was always like heaps and valleys, heaps and valleys.</span> <span id="s273">So we could figure out, of course; because, you know, Germans registered which row it was in.</span> <span id="s274">So we could count about which row it was, put some flowers on her, and had her name put on the grave.</span> <span id="s275">Because that's about all I could do for my grandmother at that time.</span> <span id="s276">But my memory of her is that her last word was "Be good to each other, and love each other."</span> <span id="s277">There was not many people to whom one could transfer it, but that was her last words.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: When and how were you and your husband taken ?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Uh, as I said, we were living with the in-laws and we knew that it's tightening.</span> <span id="s280">And we were in bed reading--I remember it so clearly.</span> <span id="s281">Steinbeck.</span> <span id="s282">John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.</span> <span id="s283">And the knock on the door came, and our invitation to the transport.</span> <span id="s284">I don't think I ever finished reading the book.</span> <span id="s285">Uh we packed very carefully the suitcases.</span> <span id="s286">Very carefully; because this was the only possessions we were going to have.</span> <span id="s287">When we came to Theresienstadt we never got the suitcases.</span> <span id="s288">Our transport, which was the first transport of fifteen hundred people, gave these suitcases as a gift to the German nation for the bombed- up people.</span> <span id="s289">So I was so glad we had contributed something.</span> <span id="s290">But we... For the next years, we...we had only what we carried on our backs.</span> <span id="s291">Fortunately, uh when we came to the gathering station, uh we were told--we were fifteen hundred people--and all of a sudden said only a thousand will go.</span> <span id="s292">All the women will be pulled out.</span> <span id="s293">Then they pulled us back, so I didn't have the... They took my number next to my husband, and they gave me another number.</span> <span id="s294">So I went through all the years in Theresienstadt as "Transport BA" and "Number 1101."</span> <span id="s295">And uh in...uh during the time in this gathering place that used to be exhibition hall, uh we were... Over the mar..</span> <span id="s296">.</span> <span id="s297">over the PA system came: "Anybody who has money on him, or gold or cigarettes or matches will be shot, da da da da."</span> <span id="s298">I had all of this on me.</span> <span id="s299">We had to, because we had to protect ourselves somehow.</span> <span id="s300">In the lining of our coats, I had a metal...you know, Yardley talc used to come in a metal box.</span> <span id="s301">In that box, I had some jewelry.</span> <span id="s302">And so you heard all of this, and nevertheless you had to sort of stay with it.</span> <span id="s303">We came to uh our Bohu≈°ovice.</span> <span id="s304">At Bohu≈°ovice was the train stop for Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s305">And as I said--I don't know if I said it, my husband was rather weak and sickly at that point.</span> <span id="s306">And we carried a big bag--each tried to hold one handle--in which were food, mostly, and in the other side we each had a bed roll.</span> <span id="s307">And on our backs, we had a knapsack with just a change of few things.</span> <span id="s308">Turned out that was the only thing we had for the next years, what we carried with us.</span> <span id="s309">When we came to Bohu≈°ovice there, in front of the train was Jacob Edelstein, whom I knew.</span> <span id="s310">And I said, "Hello," to him; and he said to me, "Try to get yourself to confirmed to work as soon as possible."</span> <span id="s311">I didn't know what it meant.</span> <span id="s312">But what it meant: if you are not going to get work immediately, then be [perfect (ph)] that you could go on.</span> <span id="s313">And many of our people.</span> <span id="s314">Of course, I went with all possible speed about protect ourselves.</span> <span id="s315">At that time, uh all the uh civilians of Theresienstadt were evacuated; and whole Theresienstadt belonged to us.</span> <span id="s316">Because before the people were only in the kaserne [Ger: "barracks"], into the barracks; and the civilians were in the town.</span> <span id="s317">We were able to move around.</span> <span id="s318">I was very short for a house; and I went to get myself confirmed, and I found a job as a nurse.</span> <span id="s319">There were two small houses right opposite of the main kaserne, where the uh leadership was; and it was... Germans in their organizations took away all the names of the street.</span> <span id="s320">And because Theresienstadt was built as a grid, they called all these named "L," and these named "quer," [Ger: "crosswise"]--"Q" and "L." "Lang" [Ger: "lengthwise"] and "quer."</span> <span id="s321">So Q told, you would know, typical German.</span> <span id="s322">So we were... these two houses were L-17 and L-19, 217 and 219.</span> <span id="s323">These were two smallish villas that were joined together; and that was to become the hospital.</span> <span id="s324">The first doctor was Hans Schauffer (ph), a gynecologist from--I'm sorry, a pediatrician--from Brno; and he eventually had three young doctors with him.</span> <span id="s325">We had first children who had whooping coughs.</span> <span id="s326">At that time there was no antibiotics, no vaccination.</span> <span id="s327">The only thing what we had was Persan...not Persantil.</span> <span id="s328">I can't...I told you the name, and I cannot remember now.</span> <span id="s329">Uh, from P.</span> <span id="s330">It was a sulfa drug.</span> <span id="s331">It made by Bayer at the same time.</span> <span id="s332">And it was red and it created everything, dyed everything red.</span> <span id="s333">And there was few people who had some uh uh sulfa that was Cibasol, made by Ciba in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s334">But that was very very rare to get.</span> <span id="s335">And if these children got... Protosol, was I think the name.</span> <span id="s336">Uh when they got it, even their vomit from the coughing, everything was red.</span> <span id="s337">Now, we had in these two small villas, there was a iron bed next to iron bed.</span> <span id="s338">There were not even little aisles in between them, because there was no space.</span> <span id="s339">Uh if laundry was possible, maybe it was changed every week, maybe every two weeks for these children; because we didn't have the laundry available.</span> <span id="s340">It was very difficult to get it.</span> <span id="s341">So all what we had was us and the kindness, to try [to] wash them.</span> <span id="s342">Also, so many of the children got impetigo...impet--I don't know what you call.</span> <span id="s343">And they were only painted with some purple--I don't know what you call that--purple dye to neutralize it.Uh, at that time little TB came also; and we had one beautiful bright thirteen year old die of TB.</span> <span id="s344">His brother's still alive, and is a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s345">Uh many of these, uh the mothers couldn't visit them.</span> <span id="s346">There were no visiting hours.</span> <span id="s347">It was impossible to 1 Possibly gentian violet?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">get visitors in.</span> <span id="s349">There was only through the windows; because it was so crowded and many of these things were infectious.</span> <span id="s350">At that time came a very big uh ...epidemic, at that time for Theresienstadt, of scarlet fever and eventually typhoid-- abdominal typhoid.</span> <span id="s351">And the scarlet fever, the whole hospital was converted to scarlet fever hospital.</span> <span id="s352">Now, we came in and out; we didn't have any disinfection.</span> <span id="s353">I had sort of a..</span> <span id="s354">.</span> <span id="s355">a..</span> <span id="s356">.</span> <span id="s357">what we would call today a running suit, in black-- sweatsuit--and I had a..</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">somebody gave me a white apron.</span> <span id="s360">And we had only one advantage.</span> <span id="s361">And this was a terrific advantage; because of our two small villas there was a small bathroom, and you were able... There...there was a kettle, and you could make fire, you can have... So two of us at a time could take a bath.</span> <span id="s362">And that was very, very precious for us.</span> <span id="s363">That we worked twelve hour shifts, and we could go and have a bath.</span> <span id="s364">Now when I meant "shift," that means we had to serve the food, which was brought in kettles.</span> <span id="s365">We had to wash the dishes.</span> <span id="s366">We had to wash the floors.</span> <span id="s367">We had to make the fire.</span> <span id="s368">We have to wash the patients.</span> <span id="s369">We had to do everything, because people couldn't come in to do other things.</span> <span id="s370">We did everything.</span> <span id="s371">We did get a little tiny bit of extra.</span> <span id="s372">Little tiny bit of extra food.</span> <span id="s373">But it was a very little tiny bit of food, and because my husband was sickly and he couldn't work, I was giving him the extras, anyhow.</span> <span id="s374">Uh it was hard work.</span> <span id="s375">It was hard work with the children.</span> <span id="s376">It was hard work with the people.</span> <span id="s377">At that time, typhoid started coming in, as I said.</span> <span id="s378">And we had one man, his name was Rudolph...uh, Rudie Kohn...Cohen, from Germany; and he and Rudie...and Robert Kohn, was Cohen and Kohn were in the same room.</span> <span id="s379">And they both had scarlet fever and typhoid.</span> <span id="s380">And I was on duty when Rudie died.</span> <span id="s381">And uh Robert was there; but this was our first real... No, he wasn't the first one; but from the typhoid was the first death we had in the hospital.</span> <span id="s382">Uh, Robert eventually did not survive.</span> <span id="s383">And then we got seven children who had both scarlet fever and typhoid.</span> <span id="s384">And because they were [live or arrive (ph)] through the yard, there were two rooms with a little bathroom and that was made to the wards for them.</span> <span id="s385">One room had two, and the other one had the less.</span> <span id="s386">And there was a stove, so (cough) as I said, we had to wash the floor and keep the fire going and wash the dishes, because people couldn't come in.</span> <span id="s387">Uh we washed them.</span> <span id="s388">We cleaned them.</span> <span id="s389">We did get typhoid shots.</span> <span id="s390">We got them in our shoulders, not in our arms, so we could work.</span> <span id="s391">And I have...the only thing we had to protect us from the typhoid was Lysol.</span> <span id="s392">We had Lysol, so we put.</span> <span id="s393">And we also knew the only infection from typhoid is goes through excretions.</span> <span id="s394">So when we dealt with excretions, we put the Lysol in the water and washed our hands.</span> <span id="s395">That was the only thing we had.</span> <span id="s396">Uh we had two boys--seventeen, one sixteen--and then little girls.</span> <span id="s397">The youngest one was Misha Lausher (ph).</span> <span id="s398">Uh one day I came in and they brought a little...was a little feverish girl in.</span> <span id="s399">I said, "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s400">And she says, "Misha."</span> <span id="s401">I said, "Misha Lausher!"</span> <span id="s402">That was my cousin's child.</span> <span id="s403">She was only five or six years old, but she knew her temperature for the last three days.</span> <span id="s404">A very bright child, in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s405">And her drawings, I kept; because she couldn't talk with her parents and be in contact.</span> <span id="s406">I was the only contact.</span> <span id="s407">I would take what she has written or drew, and I ironed it out with the heat; and this is...I could carry it out with them.</span> <span id="s408">And at that time, Misha has made--now this child was six years old--she drew a picture of a garden and a tree with a bird on it; and the bird had an opened beak and out of it came letters.</span> <span id="s409">And I said, "What is this?"</span> <span id="s410">And this is what she [said]: "It whistles."</span> <span id="s411">And she gave me the note, "It whistles."</span> <span id="s412">Misha is the only one who survived, of all the seven children.</span> <span id="s413">(Pause) Uh, and for the parents, it was heart-breaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">They were outside.</span> <span id="s415">They didn't know what was happening to their children.</span> <span id="s416">They didn't know how they were.</span> <span id="s417">We were the only contact what we could tell them.</span> <span id="s418">In the meantime, they were afraid they will be called into transport and the children would be left there; because they didn't know what was going to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: What was your husband doing all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Uh, not much.</span> <span id="s421">Not much.</span> <span id="s422">Uh, he was in the the men's barracks the first time; and he was really going down the drain.</span> <span id="s423">He didn't wash properly.</span> <span id="s424">And that was always a very bad sign, when you didn't keep up with your personal hygiene.</span> <span id="s425">Uh, I had to go up into the kaserne-- and the men knew me--and clean up his bed, and clean up this and that.</span> <span id="s426">And uh he was sickly.</span> <span id="s427">He really couldn't do much.</span> <span id="s428">It was getting worse and worse; and uh he was, in many ways, resentful that I had the work and I could do that.</span> <span id="s429">And I remember when I came after night shift...worked on the night shift, and I wanted to sleep during the day.</span> <span id="s430">He woke me up, because here I was.</span> <span id="s431">It was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s432">It was getting very difficult.</span> <span id="s433">And the marriage...I, you know, I was seventeen at that time and a na√Øve.</span> <span id="s434">And as time went on, I realized more and more that the marriage could not last.</span> <span id="s435">When I--if I may back-track--uh, when uh I..</span> <span id="s436">.</span> <span id="s437">when we came to uh Theresienstadt, my parents were there already for three weeks.</span> <span id="s438">Uh, and couple...after I was there about... So therefore I knew about my grandmother from my mother; and my mother had her suitcases, I think.</span> <span id="s439">I don't even remember if I got something from her or not.</span> <span id="s440">Because they did get their suitcases; but they were there maybe only uh three weeks, month at the most, and they got called in a transport.</span> <span id="s441">And I went with them as far as I could go before the collection place.</span> <span id="s442">And I was giving goodbye to my father and to my mother--in a way, much more emotionally to my father--and I knew in my heart of hearts that I was never going to see them.</span> <span id="s443">I really knew that I'm never going to see them again.</span> <span id="s444">And uh as far as I can see, tracing, they were somewhere in Poland.</span> <span id="s445">Uh the book says nobody knows where it was; but our maid, our Maru (ph), was in touch with them through some gendarme and sent them packages for a while.</span> <span id="s446">And I think they must have been somewhere at that point where L'vov [Pol: Lw√≥w] is--which is Ukraine now.</span> <span id="s447">And uh we were there two years ago, and I asked what were...what were the camps around there; and they told me there was a great many camps there.</span> <span id="s448">But nobody could put their finger on it when I asked.</span> <span id="s449">And uh as far as I can again trace it, my father survived there and went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s450">Because somebody saw him in Auschwitz; and which was quite miraculous because by that time he was 55.</span> <span id="s451">And as...and he probably--as I say there's no certainty-- ended when one of those three big ships that were loaded with prisoners and sank in February of '45 in the Baltics, in the North Sea.</span> <span id="s452">Uh, my mother, I don't know.</span> <span id="s453">Uh, but I knew quite sure that I was not going to see them anymore.</span> <span id="s454">Uh, meanwhile some more distance relative came through, and they went.</span> <span id="s455">So we were forever living under a threat.</span> <span id="s456">Who is going to be in the next transport?</span> <span id="s457">Who is going to be in the next transport?</span> <span id="s458">And because I was...we were graded, we were rostered, and I was always fairly well graded...rated as a nurse, I was protecting my husband for a while, even though he didn't work.</span> <span id="s459">And how did I get confirmed for a job?</span> <span id="s460">I went to this big kaserne, to this big barracks.</span> <span id="s461">You know, these were big stone barracks with many, many hallways and yards; and I was looking for the labor department.</span> <span id="s462">And I knew the name of the labor department's name [NB: head] uh was Robert Weinberg, who's... I knew about him from when I worked in Prague in the Palestina Amt.</span> <span id="s463">But I didn't know him in person; and I know his nickname was ["Winczi" (ph)].</span> <span id="s464">And I go the hallways, and I'm looking for the office; and I meet a person and I say, "Where is the office of [Winczi (ph)]?"</span> <span id="s465">And the man looks at me.</span> <span id="s466">Says, "Well, how do you know my nickname?"</span> <span id="s467">And he was just that person I met.</span> <span id="s468">And, of course, he was helpful that I got confirmed for work.</span> <span id="s469">It was just coincidences all along.</span> <span id="s470">Coincidences all along.</span> <span id="s471">Uh, so things got pretty bad that I really couldn't tolerate it anymore; and the marriage ended.</span> <span id="s472">Which would have been ending, anyhow.</span> <span id="s473">Even if my husband had survived, it would have ended.</span> <span id="s474">And he went with the December transport, with his parents and his brother.</span> <span id="s475">Uh, and they went to the familienlager--Karel Schiff, the doctor--and uh he knew what was the end, and my mother-in-law, too.</span> <span id="s476">Uh Rudla died probably of encephalitis in the familienlager.</span> <span id="s477">I had heard that he was asking for some mashed potatoes, for something to eat; which was, of course, impossible.</span> <span id="s478">And uh I uh made a friendship and then became a wife of one of the young doctors in the hospital.</span> <span id="s479">His name was Bruno Mandel.</span> <span id="s480">He came from Prost_jov, in Moravia.</span> <span id="s481">He...he was there with his mother.</span> <span id="s482">Officially, we couldn't get a divorce and get married; because it was outside of the other jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s483">But within the jurisdiction of Theresienstadt, we got on papers changed that I would be divorced and married to Bruno after the war.</span> <span id="s484">And when we were... And I volunteered to go to Auschwitz with Bruno.</span> <span id="s485">We were the first transport of fifteen hundred people.</span> <span id="s486">Again, the second time around.</span> <span id="s487">There were five hundred women were allowed to volunteer.</span> <span id="s488">There were five transport of thousand men; and with the last one, five hundred women were allowed to volunteer.</span> <span id="s489">So, of course, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s490">And uh Bruno was carrying with him the papers, to be sure he had them with him.</span> <span id="s491">Uh, the... I don't know if I'm jumping from here to there...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Let's...let's...let's slow down a minute, before you get on the transport.</span> <span id="s493">Tell me about Bruno.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Tell me about how a romance could even flower under those conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: We worked closely in the hospital.</span> <span id="s496">He was uh...he was an internist.</span> <span id="s497">He would have trained for cardiology.</span> <span id="s498">He would have liked cardiology, and he would have been very good at it.</span> <span id="s499">Uh he has uh...uh he was very involved in his patients, and I could see it.</span> <span id="s500">So, you know, we worked together day by day.</span> <span id="s501">This is...this is the best I can say.</span> <span id="s502">It was very, very difficult, with all kinds of obstacles.</span> <span id="s503">Because these two private houses had a tiny little garden.</span> <span id="s504">We had a tiny little plot where we could plant little radishes or something, which was the only fresh food one could get.</span> <span id="s505">And uh it...it was both the proximity and the idea.</span> <span id="s506">He was also very kind to me, which was very different from Rudie.</span> <span id="s507">Uh, he spoke um English; and we were reading together "Lady Windemere's Fan.</span> <span id="s508">"And I tried to read it and had to translate it, because he was trying to help me with English.</span> <span id="s509">He was trying to help me.</span> <span id="s510">We went over all the bones, so I would know them in Czech and German and Latin, in anatomy; and uh uh he was teaching me a great deal.</span> <span id="s511">He was ten years older than I. And uh so he was teaching me a great deal, too.</span> <span id="s512">And uh I knew he valued me a great deal, too.</span> <span id="s513">So, you know, these were all 2 A play by Oscar Wilde.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">the things.</span> <span id="s515">Don't forget, I was there by myself.</span> <span id="s516">And at that time, his mother very much wanted me to be with him; while uh at Rudla's parents were also saying what am I doing.</span> <span id="s517">So I was under a great deal of pressure, besides working twelve hours a day, six days a week.</span> <span id="s518">So it was a great deal of pressure all around it.</span> <span id="s519">Nevertheless, we went in the evening to lectures that were held on the...under the rooves of the meetings.</span> <span id="s520">We were working under the uh we went to every cultural situation we could go to.</span> <span id="s521">Uh at that time, they started sending the transports of the older Germans.</span> <span id="s522">And they told them, of course, they were going into a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s523">So they came in fur coats and big hats.</span> <span id="s524">And here they were brought from the train.</span> <span id="s525">At that time, ghetto had sixty thousand people, instead of the six thousand in normal times.</span> <span id="s526">And they were put under the rooves of the big kaserne.</span> <span id="s527">Now, these were huge rooves with huge uh...uh wooden beams; and they were behind the beams, in front of the beams.</span> <span id="s528">You didn't know if they were... I was in one of the transport.</span> <span id="s529">I was delegated to go and help out.</span> <span id="s530">You didn't know if they were sleeping, or if they were dead already; because they... It was cold in winter.</span> <span id="s531">It was hot in summer.</span> <span id="s532">And here they came, with their fur coats and hats; and, of course, all...the most of the work in Theresienstadt was done by young Czech Jews, because we were the main occupation.</span> <span id="s533">So they would say, "If Hitler only knew what the Czech Jews are doing to us!"</span> <span id="s534">They still couldn't comprehend it, they couldn't put it together.</span> <span id="s535">So, of course, the survival rate there, the hygiene there, was impossible.</span> <span id="s536">There were no bathrooms, you know.</span> <span id="s537">Uh it was uh...uh there were the uh the survival rate was very, very small.</span> <span id="s538">Uh, my aunts came through Theresienstadt, and then they went on; and then came my aunt, with her two children, who was most closest to me.</span> <span id="s539">Uh, they...we were four years apart--Eva...Raymond was at that time sixteen, and Joe was twelve.</span> <span id="s540">And they came in in October '42.</span> <span id="s541">In October '42, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s542">And my aunt was legally blind.</span> <span id="s543">She was very, very near-sighted, just like my mother.</span> <span id="s544">And she was legally blind; and because I was a nurse, I was able to go with her in the...into the gathering place.</span> <span id="s545">And they wouldn't even let them go in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s546">They kept them there, in the gathering place, as they arrived, immediately prepared for a transport to go on.</span> <span id="s547">We did everything to get them out, but we couldn't.</span> <span id="s548">So I took Eva and Joe out of there, and took them where --I have to explain to you, describe to you where we lived.</span> <span id="s549">And I took them where we lived, and I put them in my bed.</span> <span id="s550">And I - this is my memory - they had boots on.</span> <span id="s551">The two pairs of boots under my bed, and they were on the bunk sleeping together so they would at least get some rest to go on.</span> <span id="s552">And when I returned them, my aunt told me, "I know I'm not going to survive.</span> <span id="s553">I know I'm not going to be back.</span> <span id="s554">But I know that you will take care of the children."</span> <span id="s555">I would have, had...had they survived.</span> <span id="s556">When I returned, I was hoping that one of them would come back.</span> <span id="s557">But, of course, they didn't.</span> <span id="s558">Eva threw out of the window a card on the way to Auschwitz, which was addressed to [Jiri Pollack (ph)], who happened to be my school-mate.</span> <span id="s559">And after the war, I met him; and he told me that he got a post card from her on the way to Auschwitz which she threw out and somebody picked up and mailed.</span> <span id="s560">They were the first transport to Auschwitz from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s561">No children and uh women survived; and of the men who survived, there were not too many.</span> <span id="s562">That was uh 27th of...they arrived 27th of October in '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: What else...about Theresienstadt ?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Uh, a great deal.</span> <span id="s565">Uh (pause) when we came in, we lived in a former brewery.</span> <span id="s566">All the nurses who worked with the infectious diseases lived in this brewery.</span> <span id="s567">So there was on the second floor, there was a kitchen; and behind it--as I said, I don't remember--three or four rooms.</span> <span id="s568">So if you went to the last room, you had to go through all the other rooms.</span> <span id="s569">And in my room, which was the second one - the first one was a very small one and there was three bunks, and then in ours and there were two, four, six, eight people living in the other one.</span> <span id="s570">And, of course, we went through to the other one.</span> <span id="s571">And uh in these eight bunks we were all the nurses who came in from day shift, night shift, you know.</span> <span id="s572">So we knew each other.</span> <span id="s573">We worked together.</span> <span id="s574">And uh the life was there...at that time men could visit.</span> <span id="s575">Uh, we got sheets as a little curtain.</span> <span id="s576">And the privacy was minimal.</span> <span id="s577">Because, if you realize, when you washed your hair, you were there washing your hair from water you brought from somewhere.</span> <span id="s578">And the men were coming into the rooms that were past your room, and seven other people were there.</span> <span id="s579">It was difficult life, very difficult life.</span> <span id="s580">The one advantage was that I was able to take a bath in the hospital when we went off the shift.</span> <span id="s581">Uh, later I worked in a hospital where they had encephalitis; and that was uh also at one time there was encephalitis.</span> <span id="s582">I worked with some older people.</span> <span id="s583">When I worked uh I had a night shift at uh hospital where all the older people were.</span> <span id="s584">I found my grandfather's sister there, who was in her eighties at the time.</span> <span id="s585">I was giving out dinner, or whatever it was, and I was able to give her an extra potato.</span> <span id="s586">And Aunt Antonia was so happy she got the extra potato.</span> <span id="s587">Uh it was such a intensive life, because even with all this long work, and all the social things and all the personal things was going on, and all diseases around you.</span> <span id="s588">One day came a message that two hundred children from Poland are coming through.</span> <span id="s589">They were to be deloused, washed, bathed and dressed and prepared for a trip to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s590">[SOUND DISAPPEARS FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE OR MORE AT THIS POINT; APPPARENT TECHNICAL PROBLEM] [And some nurses were allowed to go and be with them; and for volunteering with them, they were supposed to protect their families.</span> <span id="s591">I volunteered.</span> <span id="s592">I had my few things packed up, and...this was still, I was still with Rudolph].</span></p> <p><span id="s593">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s594">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: So one day two hundred children were... TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s597">We're back on camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Uh, oh day two hundred children were sent to Theresienstadt from Poland to be deloused, washed, fed uh...fed a little bit and put clothes on.</span> <span id="s599">And uh we were told that uh if uh some of us nurses would volunteer uh for to go with them, we would be uh able to protect our families.</span> <span id="s600">I packed up few my things, but I was told that anybody who was married cannot go.</span> <span id="s601">Only single people.</span> <span id="s602">I knew some of the nurses who went.</span> <span id="s603">They went straight to gas.</span> <span id="s604">Apparently, uh there might have been some ideas; but they were misbegotten.</span> <span id="s605">And the children were transported back and forth, and annihilated.</span> <span id="s606">Uh the...uh there were many kind of things that one was never certain what will be happening, and that was the worst part, that we were continuously in uncertainty.</span> <span id="s607">There was a Damocles uh sword hanging over you all the time.</span> <span id="s608">You never knew how much time you had for what.</span> <span id="s609">Uh the daily difficulties, the daily life difficulties.</span> <span id="s610">For instance, as crowded as we were, the hygiene as poor as it was, the laundry as impossible as it was.</span> <span id="s611">There were bed bugs.</span> <span id="s612">In summer, it was suffocatingly hot.</span> <span id="s613">We lived so close together.</span> <span id="s614">So sometimes people tried to sleep out in the yard uh because not only that it was hot, but the bedbugs were multiplying and biting.</span> <span id="s615">The fleas were multiplying and biting, which made it also much more difficult to rest.</span> <span id="s616">I remember a scene where we got very little soap.</span> <span id="s617">The soap, we got rationed soap.</span> <span id="s618">The soap was of horrible quality.</span> <span id="s619">It was like a little stone.</span> <span id="s620">And I remember being in the yard, and washing my laundry with this little bit of soap, and there was a little bit left over.</span> <span id="s621">Every little bit of that soap was precious.</span> <span id="s622">Now at one point we were issued money, and we could buy things for the money.</span> <span id="s623">And one of the things you could buy was a little bit of mustard, or a little bit of ketchup, or so...another piece of this terrible soap--if they, if it was available.</span> <span id="s624">Now people were getting packages from abroad.</span> <span id="s625">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s626">At one point--you see, there were always periods, they were like windows of permission, when you were able to get packages.</span> <span id="s627">And some people were able to get packages.</span> <span id="s628">The Danes were the best off; because the King and the Danish people, they were able to get a monthly five kilo--not pound, eleven pounds--five kilo package with salami, butter, cheeses, from Denmark.</span> <span id="s629">That was the gift of the Danish government to the few, few Danish Jews in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s630">There was a number also of prominents.</span> <span id="s631">These were Germans and Austrians, who during the war [NB: the First World War] got an uh...uh the Iron Cross, or any of the very high medals.</span> <span id="s632">And they were protected in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s633">They were not sent on, at one point.</span> <span id="s634">For some reason, that was honored.</span> <span id="s635">Uh of course, during the time Edelstein, who was a Juden√§ltester, was a wonderful man; and he did what he could.</span> <span id="s636">But he himself was deported; and we had other Juden√§ltester which made things worse.</span> <span id="s637">But nevertheless, there was this tremendous, vibrating cultural life.</span> <span id="s638">I remember seeing Fledermaus, a whole production of Fledermaus.Uh, I remember going to a poem reading.</span> <span id="s639">There were philosophical debate.</span> <span id="s640">There were concerts.</span> <span id="s641">Uh there was this need to live very intensively.</span> <span id="s642">And I think this was about the essence of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s643">You had these few years, so you have to live them so intensively.</span> <span id="s644">You have to use every minute you had.</span> <span id="s645">During that time I also had pneumonia at one point.</span> <span id="s646">I had uh middle ear infection, where they had to trepanate my ear drum; and you know with all the things we have, I was sitting in a chair like this, and they punctured my ear drum.</span> <span id="s647">And uh, you know, few things of that sort one had to endure.</span> <span id="s648">And you either got well or you didn't get well, though there were not many choices.</span> <span id="s649">Uh I remember in the room be...ahead of ours was Sister Miriam.</span> <span id="s650">Sister Miriam was a nun from Austria, of a Jewish background, but was converted to Christianity; and was a Catholic nun for about thirty years.</span> <span id="s651">She was in her fifties when she came.</span> <span id="s652">A kind, gentle soul.</span> <span id="s653">Now, of course, as a nun, she was shaved and wore a wig when she went into the public.</span> <span id="s654">And of course, all of a sudden she had to show herself without hair.</span> <span id="s655">But she worked as a nurse.</span> <span id="s656">She eventually died of cancer in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s657">But for her, it was an absolute-- not only a cultural shock--shocking... It was a destroying of her life in any direction in which she had.</span> <span id="s658">Nevertheless, she showed a great gentleness and great kindness towards everybody, in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s659">Uh for instance, if you, they had a laundry.</span> <span id="s660">You were allowed to go there so many days, for so often, and bring in your laundry; and about two weeks later you got it back.</span> <span id="s661">So with few things it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s662">There was also a shoe repair, where you could get some shoes repaired because we could not replace anything, but everything was a difficulty.</span> <span id="s663">When they were opened, when you had your work hours, when you got it back.</span> <span id="s664">Everything was difficult.</span> <span id="s665">And then you have the sight of Theresienstadt was the hearses.</span> <span id="s666">Because the hearses were brought from all over, from all over Czecho...not all over Czechoslovakia, all over Bohemia, from the Jewish uh cultural groups that brought to the cemetery in their own hearses.</span> <span id="s667">So the hearses were brought in; and not only the sick people, but the bread was transported, and wood was transported, and everything was transported on the hearses.</span> <span id="s668">Because these were the only wagons.</span> <span id="s669">Uh then there was uh the comedy-- organized and directed by Germans--where one day we were supposed to get the visit by the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s670">The houses were painted only outside, where the inspection was going to take place.</span> <span id="s671">We got better food for a week.</span> <span id="s672">The children were told if they... somebody comes to interview of them... Seidl was the SS man there, that they had.</span> <span id="s673">And they were supposed to say...they were supposed to get a box of sardines and say, "Uncle Seidl, Uncle Seidl!</span> <span id="s674">Sardinen schon wieder!"</span> <span id="s675">[Ger: "Uncle Seidl, Uncle Seidl!</span> <span id="s676">Sardines again!"]</span> <span id="s677">That became the joke.</span> <span id="s678">Uncle "Seidl."</span> <span id="s679">Calling him "Uncle Seidl."</span> <span id="s680">"Schon wieder"--"Again we are getting sardines!"</span> <span id="s681">Of course, we never ate or saw sardines.</span> <span id="s682">But here they was giving them, and showing: "We are getting it again!"</span> <span id="s683">You know.</span> <span id="s684">It became such a joke.</span> <span id="s685">We did get the coffee house at the end, where this concert, where you could see.</span> <span id="s686">Uh we used to call about the coffee, what you, how you make the coffees.</span> <span id="s687">You take one coffee bean, put it on a string and wave it over hot water.</span> <span id="s688">Uh the miracle was that the water was somehow blackish.</span> <span id="s689">It was chicory mainly.</span> <span id="s690">And uh it was warm.</span> <span id="s691">Uh then there was the counting of the people.</span> <span id="s692">One day there was counting of the people where all people had to go to this big meadow and there 3 Viennese operetta by Johann Strauss.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">was this counting that was documented in films, etc.</span> <span id="s694">Uh we were, we were in the with the children in the hospital, so we didn't have to go; so we spent that lovely day in the hospital.</span> <span id="s695">But only taking of the children, but it was so terrible because we didn't know what was happening with everybody.</span> <span id="s696">We didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s697">We didn't know what was going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s698">We didn't know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s699">It was, I remember that day was so full of tension and misery because what were we supposed...what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s700">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s701">It was a terrible day, and then another kind of drudgery.</span> <span id="s702">A woman from Germany came, with a retarded child.</span> <span id="s703">This is, today we would say, the most profound retarded child I have ever seen.</span> <span id="s704">Was seven years old, couldn't sit, couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s705">Anything.</span> <span id="s706">And nevertheless, this woman tended this child so tenderly through seven years of... He was like a newborn child, except this big; seven years old.</span> <span id="s707">And you looked around, and you kept thinking of the human tragedy of this woman under these circumstances, was tending this child so tenderly.</span> <span id="s708">And you knew what's going to be in for her.</span> <span id="s709">Uh, in uh one of the other barracks was uh a little section for insane, where they were one day loaded and went in those transport, of course.</span> <span id="s710">I'm trying to... You know, there are so many stories that keep, you know, dropping out.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you have any contact with Leo Baeck?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Leo Baeck?</span> <span id="s713">No, no.</span> <span id="s714">Uh, you know, as as I come all these different memories um pick up...(pause) of the various hospitals.</span> <span id="s715">Uh I was working for one time only... Of course, another thing--there were abortions.</span> <span id="s716">Uh Doctor Hahn, who was a gynecologist in Brno, came.</span> <span id="s717">And he was making abortions, because if women get pregnant they knew what it meant.</span> <span id="s718">Uh, so abortions were performed.</span> <span id="s719">Nobody talked about it; but abortions were performed, because they had to be performed.</span> <span id="s720">They were done by the gynecologist as kindly as could be.</span> <span id="s721">And that wasn't...that was a sheer necessity to do.</span> <span id="s722">And uh it...it was a survival.</span> <span id="s723">See, I'm...I'm trying... You know, there are so many aspects to look at; and I was in Theresienstadt from '42 until '44, for two and a half years.</span> <span id="s724">So there are a lot of stories, you know.</span> <span id="s725">How to replenish the few things how you you brought with you?</span> <span id="s726">At one point I was able to make contact; and I sold my... First, I sold a few of the...used up money I had on black market to buy extra food.</span> <span id="s727">The extra food was smuggled in by the Czech gendarmes.</span> <span id="s728">Uh so we bought some, as much as we could.</span> <span id="s729">And uh finally...we were allowed to keep a wedding ring, so I sold the wedding ring--exchanged it for bread.</span> <span id="s730">I thought the bread was more important.</span> <span id="s731">Again through the gendarmes.</span> <span id="s732">Uh Misha's mother, Irma Lausher, my cousin who had...who was teaching the children in the youth home, she was uh...she has an incredible memory.</span> <span id="s733">And she wrote me books of poems for my birthday.</span> <span id="s734">And even under these circumstances we tried to celebrate birthdays.</span> <span id="s735">You know, a slice of bread, a small loaf of bread was a wonderful birthday present.</span> <span id="s736">Somebody saved it up, or had the connections.</span> <span id="s737">Uh the the tendency was to try to uh maintain as normal life as possible.</span> <span id="s738">Misha's father had the access to go little bit uh where there was a little bit of grass; and he planted some tomatoes, so that Misha would have some fresh food.</span> <span id="s739">And tended it tenderly.</span> <span id="s740">The inventiveness of people under the circumstances was incredible.</span> <span id="s741">There was a group of women who worked in agriculture, so who were sometimes able to smuggle something in.</span> <span id="s742">It was not for us they worked on the agriculture.</span> <span id="s743">Oh, another interesting thing was--as I say, these stories keep popping in my mind--uh Lidice was the Czech village where as uh revenge for the Heydrich affair, the Germans went and killed the men and many of the women and some of the children; and the left-overs they sent to Ravensbr√ºck.</span> <span id="s744">I knew some of them.</span> <span id="s745">And there was this cleaning up to do, and there were sheep and goats and cows.</span> <span id="s746">So some of men from Aus...from Theresienstadt were commandeered to go to Lidice to clean it up and bring in the animals.</span> <span id="s747">That was not known, you know; but the guys from Theresienstadt did the cleaning up.</span> <span id="s748">Uh they were, once another group of men were sent to another uh transport in some woods to do some very hard work.</span> <span id="s749">I don't remember where it was.</span> <span id="s750">And the one man wanted to get out of it.</span> <span id="s751">And he thought that would help him; and he...he drank, I don't know if it was turpentine or gasoline, or he drank some substance that's completely ruined his lower intestines.</span> <span id="s752">And he was...he uh defecated himself to death when he, they returned him to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s753">He defecated himself to death actually trying to escape this way.</span> <span id="s754">Uh but it was through all of this pressure, there was this constantly... Transports are going.</span> <span id="s755">Are you going to be on the next transport?</span> <span id="s756">Are you going to be saved from the next transport?</span> <span id="s757">Who can you stay?</span> <span id="s758">Who is going to go?</span> <span id="s759">And, of course, the pressure on the people who made the lists were as well.</span> <span id="s760">Are you going to save your family?</span> <span id="s761">Who is going?</span> <span id="s762">Uh, my father's cousin came through who I was very fond of.</span> <span id="s763">I knew he was going.</span> <span id="s764">So you know, how do you - as a very young woman - how do you try to keep any kind of normalcy under these circumstances?</span> <span id="s765">Very diff... with very great difficulty.</span> <span id="s766">And somehow still stay uh a human being, feeling human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: You mentioned abortions.</span> <span id="s768">Did you assist him in any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yeah, I saw a couple of them.</span> <span id="s770">I didn't assist but I uh... I don't know if I assisted actually.</span> <span id="s771">I was there uh when uh when uh Hahn performed it, a couple of them in Hamburg Kaserne.</span> <span id="s772">Yeah, I saw them; but I don't know how much I assisted in it actually, at the time because I was total novice.</span> <span id="s773">He would have told me, "Give me this, uh that."</span> <span id="s774">I didn't, you had to take the dilator from the smallest to the biggest and then you have to stretch out.</span> <span id="s775">But I remember being there, and seeing it done.</span> <span id="s776">You know, they were very skillful doctors; very skillful doctors who did, under impossible situations, really wonders.</span> <span id="s777">And who tried to be very humane.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Is anything else you want to add about Theresienstadt ?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yeah, you know, the irony... Hans Schauffer (ph) was the doctor who was the head doctor in the children's hospital, where Bruno was.</span> <span id="s780">He was uh uh he was, he had a..</span> <span id="s781">.</span> <span id="s782">he was deathly afraid of typhus.</span> <span id="s783">Not typhoid.</span> <span id="s784">He worked with typhoid all the time.</span> <span id="s785">Typhus.</span> <span id="s786">Typhus...the difference is typhoid is abdominal typhoid, which is different.</span> <span id="s787">Typhus is transferred from person to person with the lice.</span> <span id="s788">You have to have lice to get typhus.</span> <span id="s789">He died with typhus later in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: He had like a premonition.</span> <span id="s792">He was always afraid he will die with typhus, and he did.</span> <span id="s793">He too went through a divorce and another marriage in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s794">I knew all about the intrigues from him, from his wife, and all of that.</span> <span id="s795">There was, you know... It was so intense every day.</span> <span id="s796">(Pause) Uh in September of '44, there were transports going and they were saying they are going to labor camps.</span> <span id="s797">They need labor in Poland.</span> <span id="s798">You know, the front was moving.</span> <span id="s799">They need labor.</span> <span id="s800">And they were equipping the groups with uh shovels, with spades.</span> <span id="s801">That sounds like that labor, you know?</span> <span id="s802">They had also shovels, you know.</span> <span id="s803">And uh so there were five transports of men.</span> <span id="s804">In the last transport, they allowed five hundred women.</span> <span id="s805">So I volunteered to go along.</span> <span id="s806">Well, of course, you would volunteer.</span> <span id="s807">What else was to do?</span> <span id="s808">So we packed our things; and miraculously we were in uh...not in a cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s809">We were in a regular wagon.</span> <span id="s810">And we were sitting on top of our luggages, crowded, everything.</span> <span id="s811">And we arrived in Auschwitz, it must have been early afternoon.</span> <span id="s812">Because you know it's not so far in mileage; so if we traveled all through the night and half of the morning, we would have been there.</span> <span id="s813">When we arrived in Auschwitz, we got out of the train and we were told, "Don't touch anything.</span> <span id="s814">Leave everything as is.</span> <span id="s815">Don't touch everything.</span> <span id="s816">Leave as it is."</span> <span id="s817">But we still carried some things.</span> <span id="s818">I came from Prague to Theresienstadt in ski pants and good boots and a winter coat.</span> <span id="s819">Because, which was fortunate, I had it through all these bad winters.</span> <span id="s820">And this is how I came to Auschwitz--with a beaver collar.</span> <span id="s821">And this is how I came.</span> <span id="s822">Again I kept it, you know, for the transport.</span> <span id="s823">And I was still not...you know, I was still pretty strong and everything--still more husky, because I'm big-boned looking.</span> <span id="s824">We were supposed to stand outside of the train, always to five.</span> <span id="s825">Always to five, because Germans can count easier that way.</span> <span id="s826">So uh women here and men there, as we got off the train.</span> <span id="s827">We are standing there; and uh there's a young man in camouflage uniform, a soldier.</span> <span id="s828">And all around were...us were camps with wires.</span> <span id="s829">And out of one of the camp, runs a woman.</span> <span id="s830">And she yells--I don't remember if it was German, Polish or Yiddish, either one of the languages--and she was yelling at us, "They will take away from you everything!</span> <span id="s831">What you have, throw it to me!"</span> <span id="s832">And one of the girls had a knapsack, and she took it and she threw it to her over the fence.</span> <span id="s833">Now, you have to see this scene.</span> <span id="s834">I have it so much in my memory.</span> <span id="s835">That this young guy was talking to us, and I see this woman running and she's like this to catch it.</span> <span id="s836">And in that moment, he took his gun and go "psht" and shoot her.</span> <span id="s837">That was our welcome.</span> <span id="s838">This young man, who friendly chatted with us in German, he just takes out his gun and goes "psht."</span> <span id="s839">So that's...that was our welcome.</span> <span id="s840">So we are standing to five, and I was in one of the first rows.</span> <span id="s841">And in front of it comes the man in SS uniform, and in a white glove.</span> <span id="s842">And this was Mengele.</span> <span id="s843">Of course, I didn't know at the time it was Mengele.</span> <span id="s844">But I knew there was something very ominous about him, because he was standing there like with his gloves and going like this.</span> <span id="s845">And as we came by, every person, and that's all what he did.</span> <span id="s846">With his finger, right and left.</span> <span id="s847">The men went first.</span> <span id="s848">And as my...as Bruno went by... Oh, excuse me--well, I'll tell you later.</span> <span id="s849">As Bruno went by, he was yelling at me, "I'm not going to see you again!</span> <span id="s850">I'm not going to see you again!"</span> <span id="s851">And I didn't want him to say that.</span> <span id="s852">I didn't want him to say that; but that what he was saying: "I'm not going to see you again!"</span> <span id="s853">And as they went by, Mengele shoved like on this side.</span> <span id="s854">And when the men was gone, we was started to go.</span> <span id="s855">And when we came here, he shoved me on the other side.</span> <span id="s856">So I step up, and I said to him...uh in German I said to him, "My...my...my husband went on this side.</span> <span id="s857">I want to go this, too."</span> <span id="s858">And he said, "March on the other side!"</span> <span id="s859">And here were soldiers with guns around us.</span> <span id="s860">I just saw this one shoved, so I went to the left.</span> <span id="s861">This was to gas, and this was to work.</span> <span id="s862">How did you know?</span> <span id="s863">Fate.</span> <span id="s864">Total fate.</span> <span id="s865">You know, then we were so na√Øve, we were so incredibly na√Øve--of course, depended (ph)--that when we got off the train, we saw the SS men or other older prisoners taking the carriages and the children off the train and putting them beside.</span> <span id="s866">We said, "Well, if they are not so bad.</span> <span id="s867">You see, they are helping."</span> <span id="s868">My foot!</span> <span id="s869">They were, of course, put to death.</span> <span id="s870">Uh, so that was our welcome.</span> <span id="s871">So that now by this time was getting dark.</span> <span id="s872">Now, remember this is end of October--no, end of September--in Poland.</span> <span id="s873">So they marched us first where we had to undress.</span> <span id="s874">Now I had a can of oil and a can of sardines in my pockets.</span> <span id="s875">And I had a good Swiss watch still.</span> <span id="s876">I..</span> <span id="s877">.</span> <span id="s878">there were women from the...you know, prisoner's women, but who already had short hair.</span> <span id="s879">And we had to undress.</span> <span id="s880">I thought I will be very smart.</span> <span id="s881">I go to one of them and I say, "Look, I put in the corner my watch and the can of sardines and the oil.</span> <span id="s882">Keep it for me when I come through."</span> <span id="s883">Of course.</span> <span id="s884">And I thought I would be smart, and I asked her, "What is your name?"</span> <span id="s885">And she said, "Hannah M√ºller."</span> <span id="s886">That was my maiden name.</span> <span id="s887">Of course, I never saw her, I never saw anything else.</span> <span id="s888">We were allowed...we were supposed to strip completely, except keep shoes.</span> <span id="s889">So I had my...still my good shoes.</span> <span id="s890">Uh, we come to the next building where there was a shower.</span> <span id="s891">There was a shower shower.</span> <span id="s892">That means it was cold shower.</span> <span id="s893">We didn't have anything, but we had the cold shower.</span> <span id="s894">And we were supposed to put the shoes around the room.</span> <span id="s895">I go for my shoes, and my shoes are gone.</span> <span id="s896">This is the first time I to...started to cry.</span> <span id="s897">The shoes were the last thing I already had.</span> <span id="s898">I skipped one step.</span> <span id="s899">As we came and we undressed, we had to go through a hallway, naked except in the shoes.</span> <span id="s900">And SS came by and looked at our breasts and looked at our bellies.</span> <span id="s901">If none of us...if some of us might be pregnant.</span> <span id="s902">If they saw anybody pregnant, they pulled them out.</span> <span id="s903">So you know, it was...so we were standing there naked; and they came and they looked at our breasts and our bellies.</span> <span id="s904">Then we went to a room where they shaved us.</span> <span id="s905">And I remember seeing sitting there one of the people I knew with long hair and at that point half of her hair was shaven and half was still long.</span> <span id="s906">And I looked at her.</span> <span id="s907">And I had few bobbie pins, and I kept the bobbie pins.</span> <span id="s908">I thought when my hair grow I will have the bobbie pins.</span> <span id="s909">And of course, when you all of a sudden see you bald- headed, completely shaven, you look like monkeys.</span> <span id="s910">Everybody looks like a monkey.</span> <span id="s911">And not only that, with one blade, hundreds people.</span> <span id="s912">And then, with that German thoroughness, they also shaved our pubic hair--about a hundred people with one blade, pubic hair.</span> <span id="s913">Uh, no cleanliness otherwise, but they shaved the pubic hair.</span> <span id="s914">And uh from there... So this was the bobbie pin I'm still holding, and we go to the shower, and my shoes are gone.</span> <span id="s915">We go into the next room, and uh there we were given some old rags.</span> <span id="s916">I was given an old summer dress, some pants and something.</span> <span id="s917">Now, this is cold weather.</span> <span id="s918">And we...and we were given wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s919">The wooden shoes were killers, absolute killers.</span> <span id="s920">In the mud of Auschwitz--uh, no socks in the cold--the wooden shoes were rubbing your feet.</span> <span id="s921">Also, they were sticking in the mud.</span> <span id="s922">You couldn't pull them out.</span> <span id="s923">And when you had a sore on your feet, it would never heal.</span> <span id="s924">The shoes were killers.</span> <span id="s925">Uh so we were marched into the barracks, and we saw the fire from the chimneys.</span> <span id="s926">We...we wouldn't believe what it is.</span> <span id="s927">For three days...I didn't eat for three days.</span> <span id="s928">I was in a state of shock.</span> <span id="s929">You didn't eat, because they were telling us this is from... How could you believe that a fire was from burning our families?</span> <span id="s930">I mean, it was incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s931">How could you believe what was happening?</span> <span id="s932">And then you were given one big pot; and this is like the last bit of humanity was taken away.</span> <span id="s933">Because in the pot they gave five scoops of soup, and the pot was circulated among people.</span> <span id="s934">And everybody slurped like an animal.</span> <span id="s935">You were being...being made to an animal by slurping the food.</span> <span id="s936">So at one point, I saw somebody dragging a bag... bag of spoons, and one was hanging out.</span> <span id="s937">So I pulled it out; so I was already more civilized.</span> <span id="s938">I had a spoon.</span> <span id="s939">I kept the spoon throughout.</span> <span id="s940">I gave it to the Museum, because anybody would say it's an old scarred spoon.</span> <span id="s941">But it's a special spoon.</span> <span id="s942">But it...it was part of becoming less than a human when you have to slurp like a dog.</span> <span id="s943">And in the beginning, we just couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s944">Uh...uh of course we slept five to a bunks, and we didn't have any any blankets and it was cold.</span> <span id="s945">We were warming each other.</span> <span id="s946">We were five friends who were staying together.</span> <span id="s947">But the dehumanization, when you went to the toilet.</span> <span id="s948">Of course, toilet: there were benches with holes in them.</span> <span id="s949">And you didn't want to even sit down; and if you didn't want to sit down, all of a sudden somebody came and pulled you down.</span> <span id="s950">Because the women who were in charge of those holes wanted them clean.</span> <span id="s951">So they just pulled you down very gently.</span> <span id="s952">Uh, periodically there was another cleanliness.</span> <span id="s953">I mean, this cleanliness business!</span> <span id="s954">You couldn't wash.</span> <span id="s955">You couldn't clean.</span> <span id="s956">But you had to wash the floor everyday in the barrack.</span> <span id="s957">Uh, we had to go through shower.</span> <span id="s958">Among us was one girl who had very heavy beard, and who was shaving.</span> <span id="s959">We never knew she had.</span> <span id="s960">Of course, she couldn't shave.</span> <span id="s961">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s962">We were just as we were born.</span> <span id="s963">And as we were standing there naked waiting for the shower... These were these portable showers, you know--again cold, no soap, no towel, nothing.</span> <span id="s964">We came there.</span> <span id="s965">These young soldiers, SS men, came and looked at us and said...one came to her very kindly and said, "One of us has to shave."</span> <span id="s966">Kindly.</span> <span id="s967">So we were taken, the laundry we had on, on that was poured disinfectant; and when we came out of the shower, we got somebody else's rags.</span> <span id="s968">If I may, so...at that time, this was the last time I had... was menstruating for many months; uh because, you know, we lost menstruation.</span> <span id="s969">And I very carefully washed out the pants, very carefully; but, of course, I couldn't hang them.</span> <span id="s970">I couldn't do anything with them, because they would be stolen immediately.</span> <span id="s971">So I carefully folded them and held them under my arm.</span> <span id="s972">Between my arms they would dry a little bit.</span> <span id="s973">And then I would fold them the other way and hold them for my...under my arm for about three days, hoping they would be clean and would be dry because my body warmth would dry them.</span> <span id="s974">Finally, I was able to wear them only to lose them and get somebody else's dirty pants.</span> <span id="s975">These were the kind of dehumanizing things, all the time.</span> <span id="s976">To be shaved again, uh with all the people walking around.</span> <span id="s977">And, of course, in between we heard shooting; because there were what they used to call "selection."</span> <span id="s978">The older people were selected and they were running around or shooting around while we were in the barracks.</span> <span id="s979">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s980">I happened to run, in our barrack, into two women who I knew from Prague before the war.</span> <span id="s981">One went to the same school I did.</span> <span id="s982">Was a..</span> <span id="s983">.</span> <span id="s984">She came to the religious classes from another school.</span> <span id="s985">[Hanka Narastrukova (ph)]--she is now a physician, lives in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s986">And Jera (ph), with whom I went to gym...gymnastics.</span> <span id="s987">Uh, she is in Prague now.</span> <span id="s988">She lived in Australia.</span> <span id="s989">I was in touch in with them.</span> <span id="s990">They were in the Litzmannstadt [NB: _√≥d_] ghetto.</span> <span id="s991">They came to us, and they happened to be in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s992">Uh it was awful there.</span> <span id="s993">It happens...it so happened that uh a woman in charge of our huge barrack was from Slovakia, and she learned that the...the man who is going to come and look for labor is a pretty good one.</span> <span id="s994">At that point, labor was needed; so various uh factory supervisors or directors used to come to Auschwitz to select labor.</span> <span id="s995">And we were told that this man had a pretty good set-up, so that...so they directed him to our barrack.</span> <span id="s996">And they took two hundred women--hundred twenty Slovaks and eighty Czechs.</span> <span id="s997">And I..</span> <span id="s998">.</span> <span id="s999">we...we were the five friends together; and he took four of us.</span> <span id="s1000">And one of the oldest he rejected, but she survived.</span> <span id="s1001">Uh she was related to Bruno, an aunt of Bruno.</span> <span id="s1002">And so we four were supposed to go.</span> <span id="s1003">So they took us from Birkenau where we were--we were in the familienlager.</span> <span id="s1004">We were in the Gypsy lager in the Birken...in Auschwitz; and they...in...in uh...in Auschwitz not but in Birkenau section.</span> <span id="s1005">And they took us into another transit lager.</span> <span id="s1006">There, we had another experience.</span> <span id="s1007">We were about a week there.</span> <span id="s1008">There were the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1009">They had long hair.</span> <span id="s1010">They had better dress.</span> <span id="s1011">We had, instead of toilet, there were two uh buckets.</span> <span id="s1012">And we stood in line to use the buckets; and, of course, a lot of people had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1013">But in when a Ukrainian came, she pushed us away and she went immediately; never mind the line.</span> <span id="s1014">The leader of that barrack was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1015">The Germans had a stack, this high stack of blankets.</span> <span id="s1016">But she wouldn't allow us to have them.</span> <span id="s1017">By this time, it's October.</span> <span id="s1018">The Ukrainians wouldn't allow us to have the blankets the Germans gave us.</span> <span id="s1019">Uh, there was a black triangle antisocial woman--prisoner, but in some sort of a uniform; and there were rats.</span> <span id="s1020">And she was shooting the rats in front of us.</span> <span id="s1021">Fun!</span> <span id="s1022">Uh another thing happened.</span> <span id="s1023">While we were in this barracks, one of the lower leaders--there were, you know, hierarchy of leaders-- one of the lower leaders, was a woman, her first name is Jana (ph).</span> <span id="s1024">I don't remember her other name.</span> <span id="s1025">And she came from the Ruthenia, the easternmost part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1026">And she lived in N√°chod and had a boyfriend there; but she was taken, and she was in Auschwitz for long, long time when they had to go and work and the dogs were barking at their feet and all of that.</span> <span id="s1027">And she survived.</span> <span id="s1028">And she was telling us about it one evening.</span> <span id="s1029">We were just listening to it, you know.</span> <span id="s1030">It was pretty awful.</span> <span id="s1031">After, the day after the liberation--we happened to be liberated in N√°chod--I walk on the street.</span> <span id="s1032">And, of course, everybody knew we were prisoners.</span> <span id="s1033">We had no hair.</span> <span id="s1034">And a man comes to me and says, "I know you just came back, I know it's a..</span> <span id="s1035">.</span> <span id="s1036">But did you happen to run into Jana?"</span> <span id="s1037">And I told him, "Your name is so and so."</span> <span id="s1038">I remembered him--the name, she gave it to us in October.</span> <span id="s1039">I just remembered it in May, and I told him.</span> <span id="s1040">It was him.</span> <span id="s1041">And I told him and we saw in October she survived; and she did survive, and she returned, and they married.</span> <span id="s1042">I mean, I just happened to remember that.</span> <span id="s1043">Uh, so then they took us and they gave each of us a piece of bread and something else, and we were loaded on trains.</span> <span id="s1044">These were the cattle trains now.</span> <span id="s1045">We just saw a little thing, and we were supposed to go to work.</span> <span id="s1046">They did give us some better clothes.</span> <span id="s1047">Well, they gave us some sort of a winter coat.</span> <span id="s1048">I had some big black winter coat.</span> <span id="s1049">Not a heavy winter coat, but some sort of a coat; and a sweater and a skirt.</span> <span id="s1050">And we...we were going on.</span> <span id="s1051">I took a piece of the lining and out of that I made a scarf, because if you have no hair it's very cold.</span> <span id="s1052">So I made a scarf out of that lining.</span> <span id="s1053">Uh somewhere I saw a big uh bag.</span> <span id="s1054">It was like uh being carried still in a..</span> <span id="s1055">.</span> <span id="s1056">in a..</span> <span id="s1057">.</span> <span id="s1058">When we were in... in uh Birkenau, and a sock was hanging out.</span> <span id="s1059">And I ran and got out the sock; and I don't know, maybe just one sock.</span> <span id="s1060">And we had to stand in five for hours in appell [Ger: "roll call"], it was so cold.</span> <span id="s1061">So we always, the five of us, we'll use one of the socks; and the one who has the sock would stand in front, because she is getting the coldest and she is sort of uh protecting the others.</span> <span id="s1062">So I had that one sock.</span> <span id="s1063">So later I cut it in half, and made two gloves out of it.</span> <span id="s1064">You know, just sewed it together and made two gloves out of it; 'cause otherwise we had to do only this, put it an inch....</span> <span id="s1065">Uh we had uh... So we got on this train, and we watched the stations, and then we stopped; and so we knew that there were also men on the train going westward, you know, from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1066">It was not only women, [or] only men.</span> <span id="s1067">Uh...oh, I know, I had a striped skirt and a sweater.</span> <span id="s1068">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s1069">And the men were in striped outfits, and...but they got hats.</span> <span id="s1070">They didn't give us caps.</span> <span id="s1071">And uh then we stopped for long, long time.</span> <span id="s1072">God, we were going for like 36, 48 hours.</span> <span id="s1073">And all of a sudden, we start looking out after we are standing, and to our absolute horror we realize we are going back again.</span> <span id="s1074">Now, we knew if we were going back, it's going back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1075">And we knew what it meant.</span> <span id="s1076">But then they realized they...they uncoupled some wagons; they didn't...and they moved us again, and we went back again in this direction.</span> <span id="s1077">East, we went westward.</span> <span id="s1078">Well, we arrived in Kudowa-Sackisch.</span> <span id="s1079">Kudowa-Sackisch.</span> <span id="s1080">When we came there they told us, "This is a spa, but not for you."</span> <span id="s1081">And we walked to these barracks.</span> <span id="s1082">The barracks, wooden barracks were there.</span> <span id="s1083">Uh we were a group of two hundred women.</span> <span id="s1084">There were already three hundred women there, mostly Poles and Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1085">And uh the Lager√§lteste, the German Lager√§lteste, first was a Sudet [NB: from Sudetenland] woman who was miserable.</span> <span id="s1086">And she had an unterscharf√ºhrer [Ger: a corporal], which [is] a non-com official.</span> <span id="s1087">And she had...when she angry with somebody, he had to beat the women.</span> <span id="s1088">But when, after...shortly she didn't allow people to peel the potatoes for our soup.</span> <span id="s1089">They had to be thrown in as it was.</span> <span id="s1090">But she was removed, and we got an older woman who had a great advantage.</span> <span id="s1091">She was in many ways much kinder.</span> <span id="s1092">She allowed the potatoes to be eaten.</span> <span id="s1093">And when an SS came for uh inspection, she always slept with them and they left us in peace.</span> <span id="s1094">So that was a great advantage.</span> <span id="s1095">Actually, she wasn't that bad; but she was hung after the war.</span> <span id="s1096">I know she was hung after the war.</span> <span id="s1097">Uh, we...we were...we were twenty women, all from...we knew each other from Theresienstadt, together in this one room--double uh deck, you know, double deck beds.</span> <span id="s1098">And uh that was from October '44 until May [1945], until liberation.</span> <span id="s1099">We walked into the factory.</span> <span id="s1100">There used to be big textile factories in that area.</span> <span id="s1101">And they were changed into ammunition factories.</span> <span id="s1102">Uh we particularly were making the part of airplanes in which the propeller sits.</span> <span id="s1103">And next door was another factory where Russian prisoners uh were working on the propellers.</span> <span id="s1104">It was a uh...a tower of Babel.</span> <span id="s1105">There were all groups in this factory.</span> <span id="s1106">There were German soldiers who went AWOL and were like prisoners under guard.</span> <span id="s1107">They were the one who moved around heavy machinery.</span> <span id="s1108">There were French.</span> <span id="s1109">There were Italians.</span> <span id="s1110">There were Danish.</span> <span id="s1111">There were Dutch.</span> <span id="s1112">Uh of course, there were the Poles.</span> <span id="s1113">And I started working on a big turning place [NB: a lathe].</span> <span id="s1114">I was taught by an Italian by the name Antonio Pezutto (ph), and he taught me how to do it.</span> <span id="s1115">Now, normally, I don't know if you turning places.</span> <span id="s1116">But when you work on a turning place, there's a very sharp knife that goes to the metal and cuts, the metal cuts what it needs to be cut.</span> <span id="s1117">But they didn't have enough material, so they put only the edge in the metal that was wedged in, which was very inferior to the .</span> <span id="s1118">So of course, we were breaking them and they were very angry with us.</span> <span id="s1119">Uh they...first they took us to a classroom and taught us how to use a micrometer.</span> <span id="s1120">I knew how to use a micrometer.</span> <span id="s1121">But we had to do that.</span> <span id="s1122">And they wanted to know if we know uh uh fractions, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1123">Uh the man who taught us was a German meister--you know, 4 Subcamp of Gross Rosen.</span> <span id="s1124">Located in Lower Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">a foreman--and uh we were in we were like in school benches.</span> <span id="s1126">And I--you know, we were curious.</span> <span id="s1127">I looked at the school bench, and in one of the school benches I found a core of an apple.</span> <span id="s1128">Somebody ate an apple and left the core.</span> <span id="s1129">I didn't care who ate the apple.</span> <span id="s1130">I ate the core.</span> <span id="s1131">I mean, my goodness!</span> <span id="s1132">That was fruit!</span> <span id="s1133">Uh one day--we were there only a few days--but one day the master said the five of us, "Look, if you would like to take a bath, I will let you take a shower."</span> <span id="s1134">Now, that was very dangerous for him to do that.</span> <span id="s1135">And he took five of us and he took us to the shower room and let us shower.</span> <span id="s1136">Now, mind you, we didn't have a towel.</span> <span id="s1137">We didn't have a soap.</span> <span id="s1138">We had to put the clothes on we had.</span> <span id="s1139">But just to be under water, and to be able to shower was such a relief.</span> <span id="s1140">So we went there.</span> <span id="s1141">It took years and years before I finally allowed myself to remember why he did it.</span> <span id="s1142">He stood in the corner and watched five young women naked taking a shower.</span> <span id="s1143">He got his jollies; but, you know, it took me years to allow myself to remember why he did it, because it was very dangerous for him.</span> <span id="s1144">Uh the Antonio Pezutto (ph), he sometimes brought me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1145">He was one of the Italians who fought in Italy with Badoglio, who turned against German.</span> <span id="s1146">And they came in as prisoners, but they were better off.</span> <span id="s1147">They could move around.</span> <span id="s1148">They got more food, etc.</span> <span id="s1149">And so once in a while, he brought me a roll or a piece of bread and he hid it somewhere and I could take it.</span> <span id="s1150">And some of the other women also got it from the meisters.</span> <span id="s1151">Uh we were...slowly we were running out of material.</span> <span id="s1152">Because the eastern front was coming in, the shipments were not coming.</span> <span id="s1153">And at the end they finally loaded all the material, all the fact...all the machinery on trucks and took them to Germany.</span> <span id="s1154">But they were bombed out on the way, which we were not sorry for.</span> <span id="s1155">But at that point, we were working.</span> <span id="s1156">I..</span> <span id="s1157">.</span> <span id="s1158">that was a time where for nights and we worked twelve hour shifts again, we walked in the snow and ice three kilometers to the factory--which to me today three kilometers isn't much, but at that time it was terrible--and three kilometers back.</span> <span id="s1159">And some of us had to carry the uh big metal containers with soup, which we had at midnight.</span> <span id="s1160">Uh the craziness was, for instance, when they thought... They didn't know we lost menstruation; but when they thought we had a menstruation, we didn't have to carry it.</span> <span id="s1161">I mean logic, never logic.</span> <span id="s1162">Uh I remember once my...those shoes, those terrible shoes, were sticking in the snow and I couldn't get them out.</span> <span id="s1163">And...and the last, and the women dragged me to the factory, absolutely dragged me.</span> <span id="s1164">And I was out of breathe for about a half hour before I could catch breathe.</span> <span id="s1165">I was totally out of it.</span> <span id="s1166">Uh we walked through the village; and was night, you know--seven, or seven to seven.</span> <span id="s1167">We never saw daylight.</span> <span id="s1168">And here there were lit windows, and at Christmas people had Christmas trees.</span> <span id="s1169">And there were people living behind there, living normal lives; and we were like animals, going back and forth, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">Uh the...uh uh uh when we ran out of material, I had to sweep.</span> <span id="s1171">I had to run one of these big brooms.</span> <span id="s1172">Horrible thing, to sweep for twelve hours.</span> <span id="s1173">The only thing is it gave me a possibility to move a little bit around the factory, and I made contact with a Czech guy.</span> <span id="s1174">At that time, we had some very sick people; and I asked him if he could get some pudding.</span> <span id="s1175">And he did get some pudding, and he hid it in some material.</span> <span id="s1176">And I went in and got the pudding and put it in my pocket, and brought it to this girl who was very sick.</span> <span id="s1177">Uh I sent him a letter after the war, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s1178">And his father answered that it was...he got the letter on his birthday; and he says, "That was the best letter I could get, to find out how well my son behaved."</span> <span id="s1179">Because, you see, these were Czechs.</span> <span id="s1180">Uh Hitler gave the year 1924 to Germany; and all the Czechs who were born in 1924 had to go and work as laborers in Germany.</span> <span id="s1181">But they were able to go and visit, etc.</span> <span id="s1182">And this is why I..</span> <span id="s1183">.</span> <span id="s1184">the people with whom I made contact.</span> <span id="s1185">Once, the Italian boys had a whole big can of soup that got sour.</span> <span id="s1186">They said, "Do you want it?"</span> <span id="s1187">Of course, we ate it.</span> <span id="s1188">We said, "Well, we will think it's a potato salad.</span> <span id="s1189">That's why it's sour."</span> <span id="s1190">And we ate it.</span> <span id="s1191">We get sick, so we can't get sick.</span> <span id="s1192">Uh uh it...it was...I..</span> <span id="s1193">.</span> <span id="s1194">I..</span> <span id="s1195">.</span> <span id="s1196">This was the time when I really cried.</span> <span id="s1197">I cried and cried in hours and hours, because with with the work, with everything, it was just foreign.</span> <span id="s1198">And I was getting more and more desperate.</span> <span id="s1199">And in uh December of that year, uh one of the girls of our group--Hannah, her name was also Hannah Klein; she was exactly the year I was in--became sick.</span> <span id="s1200">And I became convinced (we didn't have a doctor) that she had typhoid, because I worked so much with typhoid.</span> <span id="s1201">There was a certain smell about it, too.</span> <span id="s1202">So she was moved into one empty room and I volunteered to be with her.</span> <span id="s1203">And the girl thought...I thought really I was with so much typhoid, I'm immune.</span> <span id="s1204">Nothing can happen to me.</span> <span id="s1205">And which was not unrealistic, which was...I was pretty much immune.</span> <span id="s1206">And the girls didn't even thought I went a little crazy, you know; and I left her soup outside so the others could pick it up, the two girls I met in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1207">And uh she died on the 19th of December '44.</span> <span id="s1208">And that was a really low point for me.</span> <span id="s1209">That was a really low point for me.</span> <span id="s1210">Now, miraculously, this uh last Lager√§lteste allowed me to have a flashlight for her at night--which was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1211">And she did get a coffin, plain wooden coffin, for her.</span> <span id="s1212">And so I didn't have...I had washed her, and I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1213">So I put newspapers.</span> <span id="s1214">So they...I got some newspaper, and I dressed her in the newspapers and stuffed it in the coffin.</span> <span id="s1215">And it wasn't... And people asked, you know, "You are crazy!</span> <span id="s1216">Why are you doing it?"</span> <span id="s1217">You know.</span> <span id="s1218">"Nobody does that."</span> <span id="s1219">And I said, "That's the only piece of dignity I can give her, that I treat her.</span> <span id="s1220">If I washed her when she was sick, why shouldn't I wash her now?"</span> <span id="s1221">This is the only piece of dignity I could give her.</span> <span id="s1222">But it wasn't until years later when I realized that somewhere in the back of my head--way, way back--was that the...what was the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s1223">Visit the sick.</span> <span id="s1224">Wash the dead.</span> <span id="s1225">Comb them, clean them, dress them before they go.</span> <span id="s1226">But that was not conscious at all.</span> <span id="s1227">They thought I'm crazy.</span> <span id="s1228">Under these circumstances, I'm brushing her and dressing her in newspaper.</span> <span id="s1229">And she's buried there.</span> <span id="s1230">In that camp, between October '44 and May '45, thirteen girls died.</span> <span id="s1231">You might say that's not much--only thirteen.</span> <span id="s1232">But you have to remember, thirteen out of five hundred in less than...five, in six months...in six months, five...out of five hundred, thirteen people died.</span> <span id="s1233">And we were the women between eighteen and thirty-five.</span> <span id="s1234">So, then it's a lot.</span> <span id="s1235">Uh one girl uh had five children.</span> <span id="s1236">When she realized that uh they were all gone, she went crazy.</span> <span id="s1237">She went really crazy.</span> <span id="s1238">But it took her that long to really accept it.</span> <span id="s1239">Uh, miraculously that woman got coffins for these women.</span> <span id="s1240">It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s1241">Unheard of.</span> <span id="s1242">Once SS man came and asked us, "What is the thing you want the most?"</span> <span id="s1243">So we said things like a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s1244">You know, we were used to it.</span> <span id="s1245">You know, a toothbrush was so basic.</span> <span id="s1246">I had to repeated dreams, repeated dreams, about taking a bath and having a nice towel.</span> <span id="s1247">You know?</span> <span id="s1248">Which means, you know, necessities were for us.</span> <span id="s1249">And so he promised us toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s1250">Of course, we never got them.</span> <span id="s1251">But this was kind of teasing, total teasing.</span> <span id="s1252">Not being able to clean yourself.</span> <span id="s1253">I remember in that camp, our women--some were, there was a group of people who had to wash the laundry also for the SS.</span> <span id="s1254">And the SS had also lice.</span> <span id="s1255">They said they had lice even in their handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s1256">I, one day, I saved...I didn't eat the bread at all, and I saved it and I exchanged it in some sort of a contraption out of which I could make a bra.</span> <span id="s1257">I wanted a bra so badly.</span> <span id="s1258">For me, it was so basic I couldn't...so I just didn't eat the bread for a whole day so I would have a bra.</span> <span id="s1259">You know, the sort of left-overs of civilization.</span> <span id="s1260">And I remember sitting on the bed, and looking and finding my first louse.</span> <span id="s1261">Finding my first louse was another absolute downer.</span> <span id="s1262">This was like the last drop of civilization was gone.</span> <span id="s1263">So we had to look through for lice every day.</span> <span id="s1264">Uh we all had one needle together.</span> <span id="s1265">Needle got lost, which was a tragedy.</span> <span id="s1266">So what did we do again?</span> <span id="s1267">You know what we did?</span> <span id="s1268">We had uh uh...
