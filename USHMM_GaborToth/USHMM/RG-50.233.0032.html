id="s3">Abstract Bozenna Gilbride, née Urbonowicz, was born to Christian farming parents, Wictor and Janina (Janka), in Wolyn, near Tuczyn, Poland.</span> <span id="s4">Her father hid Jews in a shed on his farm early in World War II, and was arrested often.</span> <span id="s5">In late summer 1943, they barely escaped when their farm and village were burned to the ground by Ukrainians who “butchered” the villagers.</span> <span id="s6">Her family immigrated to Germany, unaware of what was happening there, Bozenna says.</span> <span id="s7">At Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau), Germany, eight-year-old Bozenna and her family worked in a factory making leather goods for German soldiers.</span> <span id="s8">An aunt gave birth to a baby.</span> <span id="s9">Germans drained its blood for German troops, and the baby died.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">The family was moved to a slave labor camp in Chemnitz, where her parents worked in a munitions factory.</span> <span id="s11">Bozenna contracted TB, and friends saved her from receiving a lethal shot by switching her medical papers.</span> <span id="s12">Her mother was suspected of being in the Polish underground, so German troops beat her and sent her to Ravensbruck, where she was sterilized.</span> <span id="s13">Her mother was sent eventually to Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Bozenna says the worst part of all her experience was being separated from her mother.</span> <span id="s15">The father and the four children remained together throughout the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">When the American front approached their camp, the Germans took the several hundred inmates to the nearest city, and dumped them on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s17">They walked for days.</span> <span id="s18">Germans gave them food they begged for, but would not allow them to sleep on their property.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Eventually, the family was in a DP camp in Leipzig from 1945 until the beginning of 1947, when they immigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s20">Bozenna was 12 and a half years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">After the war, the mother returned to Poland.</span> <span id="s22">She wrote to relatives in US, who said her family was in New York City.</span> <span id="s23">Denied a visa, the mother joined the Polish underground, and was imprisoned.</span> <span id="s24">Eventually freed, and finally granted a visa, she joined the family in NYC in 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Tape 1 Side A My father was a farmer.</span> <span id="s26">I think he was self-educated; he had schooling.</span> <span id="s27">He was in the Polish Army (AK), as were my uncles.</span> <span id="s28">My mother came from a farming family too.</span> <span id="s29">She came from a large family, as did my father.</span> <span id="s30">My mother’s family seemed to be very musically inclined.</span> <span id="s31">Everybody took to an instrument.</span> <span id="s32">Nobody sang, though.</span> <span id="s33">Grandmother, my father’s mother, left for America, I think, in 1938, and stayed in America.</span> <span id="s34">She never returned.</span> <span id="s35">And my father, the last son to marry, took over the farm and ran it for profit.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">And your mother, she helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">She worked side by side.</span> <span id="s38">There’s even a story that she had a baby in the field, wrapped it up and returned to work.</span> <span id="s39">I don’t know if it’s just as accurate as they tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">But you weren’t that baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">I wasn’t that baby, no.</span> <span id="s42">It was later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">What was religious life in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">As far as school goes, I remember being taught religion in our local school, we observed all holy days.</span> <span id="s45">Church, we had to walk.</span> <span id="s46">Sometimes we would use the wagon and go to church in Tuczyn.</span> <span id="s47">In Tuczyn, my father had a wonderful friend, Mr. Friedman.</span> <span id="s48">The reason they were such good friends is they dealt in the market together, selling vegetables and farm goods.</span> <span id="s49">I remember one time Friedman sent me a pair of white galoshes.</span> <span id="s50">I had never seen white galoshes in my life.</span> <span id="s51">I didn’t know what they were for.</span> <span id="s52">You put them over the shoes.</span> <span id="s53">I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">And what did you do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">I just wore them and flopped around in the galoshes in the house.</span> <span id="s56">I thought, gee what wonderful floppy shoes, you know, and they were white.</span> <span id="s57">I’d never seen white shoes before.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">What was the house like?</span> <span id="s59">I imagine it would be a farmstead?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Yes, we had three rooms, a very large living room, with many windows, kitchen, and one bedroom.</span> <span id="s61">I remember sleeping sometimes in the living room because it was warmer by the stove.</span> <span id="s62">In Poland, they had stoves that you would warm up in the kitchen, and the wall behind, sometimes three walls from the other sides would keep the other rooms warm, so it depended, I guess what the situation was, how many of us were in the same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">And I, being the oldest of four children, I was already responsible to go out with the cows into the meadow and stay there all day, which I didn’t like, I didn’t like getting up so early in the morning.</span> <span id="s64">It was barely daybreak, and I heard my father or mother calling me.</span> <span id="s65">Oh, how I hated that part.</span> <span id="s66">I didn’t want to come out of bed, but I did.</span> <span id="s67">I would go out to the fields, and I would cry almost the whole day that I had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">So walking the cows out -- was that your primary job?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">That was my primary thing, and I had to learn horseback riding, bareback.</span> <span id="s70">That was very hard because the horse that was mine, Mischka, (Myszka?)</span> <span id="s71">which means a “little mouse”, Mischka was very frisky and every time Mischka would bend down her head to graze, I would slide down.</span> <span id="s72">And I would cry, why would she do that to me, why didn’t she let me sit on top, because my father would get furious, ‘Can’t you catch on that if you go into the grass, the horse is going to bend down and graze and then you’ll slide right down’.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">And how long did it take for you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">I don’t remember, I don’t remember if I ever mastered, but I know that when we left Poland I thought about Mischka a lot.</span> <span id="s75">That was my horse, she was a very smart horse.</span> <span id="s76">When I fell down one time and she was walking, everyone said that she’s going to trample me.</span> <span id="s77">But Mischka, I don’t know how she did this.</span> <span id="s78">I fell down, I was in her path.</span> <span id="s79">She stepped over me.</span> <span id="s80">She knew that I was there, and she just kept going, but she stepped over me.</span> <span id="s81">I remember my father or mother screaming “’Bozenna, Bozenna, Bozenna’”.</span> <span id="s82">I was in the path of that horse.</span> <span id="s83">But Mischka didn’t hurt, she just stepped over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Now, you rode Myszka not as sport, this was not sport, this was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Sport, no this was for sport.</span> <span id="s86">I was learning, I was learning, but eventually I would have to master.</span> <span id="s87">Everybody had to learn these things.</span> <span id="s88">Skiing was something, was something you had to learn.</span> <span id="s89">There wasn’t much to do on a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">It was dull?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">We didn’t know it was dull, no.</span> <span id="s92">It wasn’t what our children have now.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Did you have electricity?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">No.</span> <span id="s95">I remember a wireless radio though.</span> <span id="s96">And when we left Poland, when we ran, I remember running and thinking, oh, my gosh, we left that wireless behind.</span> <span id="s97">I thought that was magic, my radio.</span> <span id="s98">It was forbidden to listen to, forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Under the Germans or under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Communists, Communists, yes.</span> <span id="s101">We kept it in the drawer in our bedroom, covered with cloth.</span> <span id="s102">And the only time they listened to the wireless was if you invited a neighbor or two.</span> <span id="s103">This way, they wouldn’t give you away.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Accomplices?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Right, right.</span> <span id="s106">But I remember my father talking about Hitler.</span> <span id="s107">I had no idea who Hitler was.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">What did your father say about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">I remember him saying, “‘Oh my God, what is he doing now.</span> <span id="s110">’” That’s about all I remember, “‘Look what he’s doing now,’” in shock, you know, “‘Look what he’s doing now.</span> <span id="s111">’” But I never knew what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">You didn’t even know he was a German or a Nazi or anything of that sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s114">Even in school at Christmas time when the Communist authorities would come to inspect the schools, our teachers would suddenly speak Russian.</span> <span id="s115">We were told that when authorities would come, that they will ask you, "‘And who gives you candy?’"</span> <span id="s116">We were supposed to shout, ‘Papa Stalin gives us candy!’</span> <span id="s117">And then they would throw candy at us, which they did.</span> <span id="s118">They would throw handfuls and handfuls of wrapped candy at us, and we would squeal with delight.</span> <span id="s119">We had no idea who Stalin was.</span> <span id="s120">We had no television, no regular papers, wireless was forbidden, how would you know anything, especially children?</span> <span id="s121">Nothing, children were protected all the time.</span> <span id="s122">You tell children nothing, that’s the best way.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Did your parents ever talk about these things to you?</span> <span id="s124">Did they coach you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">My only coaching came, there was one warm summer, my mother sent me to the River Bug [ph 78], which was in our front yard almost.</span> <span id="s126">We had a shed there, and my mother’s instructions were to take the bread and soup to these people and give it to them.</span> <span id="s127">But if you are stopped on the road, turn around, speak to no one, and come right back home.</span> <span id="s128">And I did this repeatedly, over and over, but I never saw people in the shed, just hands.</span> <span id="s129">I didn’t know if they were men or women or children.</span> <span id="s130">There was no way of knowing.</span> <span id="s131">And this would go on, and then they would stop, these visits to the shed.</span> <span id="s132">And then later, they would resume again.</span> <span id="s133">And my father, at that time, he was arrested frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">This would have been under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Still under Communism, yes.</span> <span id="s136">And I didn’t know why, I thought this had something to do with him being in the military.</span> <span id="s137">At this point my aunt, the wife of the Polish officer, moved in with us one night.</span> <span id="s138">In the middle of the night she came, and it was all very hush-hush, whispers.</span> <span id="s139">She was pregnant then, and had three little boys.</span> <span id="s140">But my uncle, her husband, was nowhere in sight that night.</span> <span id="s141">She didn’t stay long with us.</span> <span id="s142">The Communists came in the middle of the night, grabbed her, the three little children, and they were shipped to Siberia.</span> <span id="s143">At that time, we didn’t know where they took them.</span> <span id="s144">But after the war, we had the full story.</span> <span id="s145">She lost the little baby girl in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Do you know when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">My recollection is, it was less than a year before we left Poland, less.</span> <span id="s148">We left Poland in 1943, and it was before that, but not long.</span> <span id="s149">It wasn’t long before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">But under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s152">Now I know that those people that my father was giving the shed to, and hiding them, they were friends of friends, Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s153">I found out, when I got to America after the war, that that’s who these people were, I never knew who these people were, they were just people.</span> <span id="s154">The children were protected, don’t tell the children too much.</span> <span id="s155">Tell them nothing, it’s even better.</span> <span id="s156">So we never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Under the Russian occupation in 1939, did your father lose his farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">No, it became a collective farm.</span> <span id="s159">I remember that you couldn’t kill a pig.</span> <span id="s160">I remember that my father and neighbors did kill a pig together, slaughtered it and divided it.</span> <span id="s161">You couldn’t do it alone because you were afraid somebody would snitch, but of course, if you got your neighbors in on it, you could get away with it.</span> <span id="s162">Also, we had a bee farm, and a portion of the bees, the honey, had to be given back to the Communists.</span> <span id="s163">They would send someone who would collect the honey, and they would leave us a small portion.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Did this bee farm precede the time of the Soviet occupation?</span> <span id="s165">I mean was this something that …?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">It was already there, but that wasn’t our bee farm.</span> <span id="s167">It was rented by somebody else.</span> <span id="s168">He used our land for that.</span> <span id="s169">We also had nuts.</span> <span id="s170">We grew nuts, too.</span> <span id="s171">That too, a portion had to be given to the Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">What else did your parents grow on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Potatoes, wheat, those were the primary.</span> <span id="s174">Wheat and potatoes were the primary things.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Do you remember the outbreak of war in September 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">No, no.</span> <span id="s177">When parents listened to the wireless, they usually made sure you weren’t there.</span> <span id="s178">The children didn’t hear it or know that they’re listening because you were afraid.</span> <span id="s179">Children go to school; children talk on the streets, children tell each other.</span> <span id="s180">You didn’t let the children know these things.</span> <span id="s181">It was safer that way.</span> <span id="s182">That’s why, to me, that wireless was a magic box.</span> <span id="s183">I didn’t know how you can get a voice out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">You described going to school.</span> <span id="s185">You began going to school under the Soviets in the fall of 1939.</span> <span id="s186">Besides telling you where your candy was coming from, what else did they teach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">I don’t remember anything else.</span> <span id="s188">I remember portraits of Stalin being in the classrooms, that I remember.</span> <span id="s189">Oh, yes, I remember when the Communists would come into town, and they would be walking in the road in front of our house.</span> <span id="s190">We were given orders, I don’t know by whom, though.</span> <span id="s191">We had little red flags, and you had to put them every so often on the fence to welcome, the red flags were to welcome the Communists who visit the town, that I remember.</span> <span id="s192">And I remember my father saying something like, ‘Are they gone?’</span> <span id="s193">And he’d run out and pick up all the red flags, and hide them for the next time that we’re told to put out the red flags.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Did you see Soviet Army troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Marching, mm-hmm, in front of our house, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">And how did they behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">As if they were our saviors.</span> <span id="s198">As if they were – I never saw any -- they never terrorized us.</span> <span id="s199">There was nothing like that.</span> <span id="s200">They rode their horses, with their chins high.</span> <span id="s201">I was terrified of their boots and shoes because they were shiny.</span> <span id="s202">I never saw shiny shoes on a farm.</span> <span id="s203">We never saw shined shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Muddy would be the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Muddy, yeah.</span> <span id="s206">To this day, I still have a fear of boots, high shiny boots like policemen wear.</span> <span id="s207">I’m not alone, I know a lot of other survivors that are scared of high, shiny boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">For the sound that they make.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Click, click, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">How was your mother taking these changes?</span> <span id="s211">We talked a little bit about your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">You mean at that time, what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Yes, in 1938, 1939, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">My mother, I don’t remember her doing anything but working, working, working right alongside of my father.</span> <span id="s215">And then, of course, family matters.</span> <span id="s216">She was a very family oriented woman.</span> <span id="s217">We did have hired help.</span> <span id="s218">When a new baby would be born, my mother would get a lovely Ukrainian girl that was very friendly to us.</span> <span id="s219">She would come, take care of the baby so that my mother could work the fields with my father.</span> <span id="s220">And then she would disappear until the next baby’s born.</span> <span id="s221">And then the same girl would come back, and she was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s222">She was a very gentle lady, a young girl, she wasn’t a woman yet, she was a girl.</span> <span id="s223">But she was older then the rest of us, so to us she seemed like a lady.</span> <span id="s224">But I don’t remember a childhood really on the farm.</span> <span id="s225">I worked from the day I was born.</span> <span id="s226">I always felt like I was a mother, always, I don’t remember anything else.</span> <span id="s227">I was always taking care of somebody.</span> <span id="s228">I always had to be very grown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">So you were kind of a baby sitter since your mother was working on the farm much of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Would you call your mother strict?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Never, no, no.</span> <span id="s233">My father, yes.</span> <span id="s234">There’s a Polish expression that the man is the king of the house, but the woman is the crown, so she is above him.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">So she is above him.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">In a very nice way, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Uhm, did you have any pets other than your famous horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Yes, yes, we had dogs.</span> <span id="s239">As a matter of fact, when we ran from our farm, the dog had puppies.</span> <span id="s240">Oh, and I was so upset, what will become, because the whole village was burned.</span> <span id="s241">That means if she wasn’t smart enough to drag those puppies from under the shed, they would perish.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">When was your village burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Late summer of 1943.</span> <span id="s244">We had horses, cows, lots of cows, pigs, sheep.</span> <span id="s245">It was a regular farm.</span> <span id="s246">Now, from what I understand from relatives, our farm was a very thriving farm.</span> <span id="s247">My father was very knowledgeable about farming, and he really was very devoted to his land.</span> <span id="s248">That land in Wolyn, the soil is very black, it is a very rich soil, it’s a farmers dream to till such soil.</span> <span id="s249">And my father recognized that even then, that that is good, rich soil.</span> <span id="s250">We can live on land like that, and we did.</span> <span id="s251">We were not wealthy, but we were never hungry, ever.</span> <span id="s252">There was always some fruit, there were some nuts, there was honey.</span> <span id="s253">There was all kinds of ways of fixing potatoes.</span> <span id="s254">There were leftover scraps of meat.</span> <span id="s255">My mother would dream up these concoctions, and we thought it was heaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">So as far as you knew you were not missing out on anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Nothing, we were fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Were you old enough to have dreams, that is, dreams of what you would do when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">No, I never had dreams like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">When is the first time you saw Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Well, when we run from our village, from our farm, in 1943.</span> <span id="s262">The village was burned to the ground and butchered by the Ukrainians, who wanted, from what I understand now, the land that we were on.</span> <span id="s263">We were the minority in Wolyn.</span> <span id="s264">All summer long, we would sleep out on the fields, because we knew they were determined to kill us and burn the village.</span> <span id="s265">But this one summer night, we decided to sleep in our beds, and that’s the night that it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Our neighbor came to our window and quickly rapped on our bedroom window, waking us all.</span> <span id="s267">He said, ‘Wictor, Wictor, they are burning our village, this is the night.’</span> <span id="s268">We just jumped out of the bed.</span> <span id="s269">There was no time to find clothes.</span> <span id="s270">In the dark, you couldn’t put lights on, you couldn’t light a candle or anything.</span> <span id="s271">We ran out the door, and we could already look back and see the village burning.</span> <span id="s272">You could hear the crackle, the homes collapsing already in the fire.</span> <span id="s273">We ran through the wheat, through the forest, heading for Grandma’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">We thought that from that end of the village, maybe we could get to Grandma and Grandpa and everyone there, and warn them and run together.</span> <span id="s275">But it wasn’t like that.</span> <span id="s276">By the time we reached Grandma, that end of the village started to burn too.</span> <span id="s277">So we headed in another direction.</span> <span id="s278">While we were running, my father had the bright idea that he’d like to go back to the farm, and let all the animals out of the barns because he had visions that we’d return to the land again.</span> <span id="s279">So we didn’t know if he was safe, because he ran back.</span> <span id="s280">He told us to keep running towards the river.</span> <span id="s281">Then, as we were running towards the river and realized he’s not behind us, we didn’t know – continue or wait for him, what?</span> <span id="s282">My mother said, "‘Keep running, don’t stop.’"</span> <span id="s283">So we’re running and running and running, and behind us there’s a man following us.</span> <span id="s284">And my mother grabbed the youngest child who was almost three, and she told us, ‘Hold on to each other, don’t let go, and run as fast as you can’.</span> <span id="s285">As we were running, the man behind us is calling my mother’s name ‘Janka, Janka, Janka…’ My mother is so frightened, because many people knew us in the village, not just Poles, but Ukrainians knew us to.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Well, we were running as fast as we could, and it was my father.</span> <span id="s287">He caught up to us, but in the dark, in the moonlit night, you couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s288">Eventually, we reached the river, and we went to the forest near the river, and we spent the rest of the night hoping Grandma was okay.</span> <span id="s289">We were very close to her house.</span> <span id="s290">Morning came.</span> <span id="s291">We all decided that we have to move on.</span> <span id="s292">We can’t stay here, it’s daylight, because they’ll come looking for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">The Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Yes, they’ll come looking for us to finish us off.</span> <span id="s295">So we crossed the river, and in the river, as we were crossing, there was a teenage girl from the village, with a dog, a big German shepherd.</span> <span id="s296">And that dog barked and barked and barked.</span> <span id="s297">And she was still in the water, and she was begging us, "‘Please, please Mr. Urbonowicz, please take me with you.’"</span> <span id="s298">And there were lots of people.</span> <span id="s299">We weren’t alone.</span> <span id="s300">There were many other villagers with families.</span> <span id="s301">They had a conference, all the grown-ups there at the river, and they decided not to take her along.</span> <span id="s302">They asked her to leave the dog because he’ll give us away with that barking.</span> <span id="s303">She wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s304">She chose to stay with the dog.</span> <span id="s305">And we continued, and we crossed the river into the clearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">This was the Bug [ph245] River?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Bug [ph245] River, yeah.</span> <span id="s308">And when we crossed the river, heading for my aunt’s house, we stood up.</span> <span id="s309">And the field was open, no trees.</span> <span id="s310">The shots started to ring out.</span> <span id="s311">The Ukrainians or someone was waiting for us to stand up and show ourselves.</span> <span id="s312">So we all hit the dirt, and we crossed on all fours into the next patch of woods into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">There, we went to my aunt Leocadia’s house.</span> <span id="s314">The house was empty, no one was there.</span> <span id="s315">We got frightened, we started to walk away.</span> <span id="s316">Near her house was a pond, it was mud at this point.</span> <span id="s317">As we were walking out of her house by the pond, bodies stood up covered with mud.</span> <span id="s318">My God, we thought, this is it for us, all of us.</span> <span id="s319">We’re finished now.</span> <span id="s320">That was my aunt and my uncle and their children.</span> <span id="s321">They were hiding in the pond.</span> <span id="s322">When we knew they were okay, we went to another aunt’s house across the road to see if she’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">There, the chicken and geese were running over the house.</span> <span id="s324">The front gate was swinging.</span> <span id="s325">But they had children our age, so my mother thought she could get clothes for us and dresses, because we were only in our nightshirts and barefoot.</span> <span id="s326">My mother dressed us, and my father said he was going back to the farm to see.</span> <span id="s327">My father loved his land.</span> <span id="s328">He had to go back to see if it’s okay for us to return.</span> <span id="s329">And he was gone a long time.</span> <span id="s330">My mother got nervous.</span> <span id="s331">She decides to go find him.</span> <span id="s332">She leaves us lying on the cot there, and she goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">She told us that when she got to the farm, there was nothing standing.</span> <span id="s334">She didn’t see Wictor either.</span> <span id="s335">She didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s336">She knew we were hungry, so she grabbed a chicken by the head, and decided she’s going to take the chicken back to us, and we’ll have dinner.</span> <span id="s337">As she’s running with this chicken, holding the chicken by its neck, there’s a man running after her.</span> <span id="s338">She got so scared, she dropped the chicken and ran fast.</span> <span id="s339">But it was my father.</span> <span id="s340">He recognized her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Two cases of mistaken identity in one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">This is fright, this is fright you know.</span> <span id="s343">By then, my mother found some clothes for us, and we started to go deeper into Poland.</span> <span id="s344">We walked into Tuczyn that was where Mr. Friedman lived.</span> <span id="s345">We stopped at Friedman’s.</span> <span id="s346">We did that often at Friedman’s house, because he lived close to our church.</span> <span id="s347">So we often stopped and shook the sand from our shoes and continued to our church, which was just a stone’s throw away from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">In Friedman’s house, we were told to lie down and rest.</span> <span id="s349">Mr. and Mrs. Friedman took my mother and father to the kitchen, but they didn’t close the door.</span> <span id="s350">And I being the oldest, and I wasn’t that tired, I heard what they were saying.</span> <span id="s351">And my father was pleading with Mr. Friedman to leave the town and run.</span> <span id="s352">“’Don’t stay here.”</span> <span id="s353">And Friedman said, “’No, this is my home, this is my land, and I am staying.</span> <span id="s354">’” And we left them there in that house, standing in the doorway, and bidding us farewell.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">And Mr. Friedman was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">He was Jewish.</span> <span id="s357">They were friends that my father dealt with in the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">How had he managed to survive two years of German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">No, he did, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Not in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">The Ukrainians when they were burning your village, did they discriminate between Ukrainian and Polish homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">We didn’t see a difference.</span> <span id="s364">The whole village was burning.</span> <span id="s365">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s366">The whole village was down to the ground, nothing remained.</span> <span id="s367">When my father ran back to see if any of our livestock was returned to the barns, or anything, nothing was standing.</span> <span id="s368">The brick schoolhouse, my father said, remained standing.</span> <span id="s369">But everything else was leveled.</span> <span id="s370">Nothing.</span> <span id="s371">You wouldn’t recognize one house from another that stood there.</span> <span id="s372">You wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Would you know where they got their weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">No, most of the arms, they were knives, that kind – most.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">So they didn’t have firearms?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">We heard firearms, but I know for a fact that most of their arms – they were butchering people – that’s why we use that expression.</span> <span id="s377">They were butchering because that is exactly what they were doing.</span> <span id="s378">They would slit your throat or stab you.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">This was a very primitive operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Very primitive, yeah.</span> <span id="s381">But when we left Friedman, we decided to go deeper into Poland.</span> <span id="s382">There were throngs of us by then on the road, with nap sacks, pushing baby carriages, homeless people like us.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Fleeing the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">For two years you lived under German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Soviet, Soviet that part of, that part, not German yet, I was still… So this was still before 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">That’s right.</span> <span id="s388">Now in 1943, I was still under the Soviet occupation, that part of … we didn’t see anything different.</span> <span id="s389">There was no difference there.</span> <span id="s390">When we left the farm and ran, we ran right into the arms of the Nazis now.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">I’m saying that period between 1941 when the Nazis took over your area and then in 1943 when Soviets are returning, did you have any experience that’s…?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">No difference.</span> <span id="s393">No, we didn’t see the difference there.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">No difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">No!</span> <span id="s396">I didn’t see German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">No German soldiers, no atrocities?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">So the first atrocity that you experienced was at the hands of those Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">That was first, yes.</span> <span id="s401">That was first.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">In 1943, and this is what drives you deeper into Poland, and when you first run into Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">That’s right, and there were throngs of people with knapsacks, and we didn’t know which way to go.</span> <span id="s404">And we marched right into the arms of the Nazis in Poland.</span> <span id="s405">I didn’t know what city or what town this was in, but when we arrived, it was getting towards the evening and the Nazis had told us that they’ll put us up in this abandoned school building or something, or railroad station.</span> <span id="s406">It was just a building really, a big building.</span> <span id="s407">As a matter of fact, we couldn’t even get inside the building, there were too many people.</span> <span id="s408">We wound up sleeping on the outside.</span> <span id="s409">But the Germans told us that the Ukrainians, they frightened us really, now I see.</span> <span id="s410">They told us that they are “’going to come back tonight to finish you off.</span> <span id="s411">We will give you arms.</span> <span id="s412">You can defend yourselves.</span> <span id="s413">’” The Germans are going to help you to defend yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Against the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s415">This is what they told us the adults, yes.</span> <span id="s416">They are going to defend us.</span> <span id="s417">In the morning, they made us an offer, the Germans, we couldn’t refuse.</span> <span id="s418">They did come to attack us, by the way, all night long.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">The Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Oh, yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s421">There was shooting all night long, bullets whizzing past our ears, because we weren’t inside the building, we couldn’t get in, it was too crowded.</span> <span id="s422">In the morning, the Germans told us that we can go to Germany, that we’ll have a place to live, we’ll have a job, we’ll be warm, and we’ll have food.</span> <span id="s423">What else could we do?</span> <span id="s424">We couldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s425">We didn’t know what was really happening in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Wagons came very quickly; this was done very, very fast.</span> <span id="s427">The cattle cars arrived.</span> <span id="s428">I had never seen a train in my life.</span> <span id="s429">I thought cattle cars were the only way to travel.</span> <span id="s430">What did I know?</span> <span id="s431">No one ever showed me any other way.</span> <span id="s432">They rounded up the people and they very quickly pushed us into the wagons.</span> <span id="s433">There were too many people, so we ended up standing shoulder to shoulder.</span> <span id="s434">In a cattle car, there’s no windows, just slits on top, elongated kinds of slits.</span> <span id="s435">And you couldn’t breathe when there’re so many people.</span> <span id="s436">And there were no facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">We traveled, I think, two nights or two days a night, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s438">I was only about eight and a half.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t remember food or water being given, I’m sure there was some at some point.</span> <span id="s440">I know that mothers were crying because they had no room.</span> <span id="s441">They wanted to nurse their babies; they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s442">There was no room.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">When we arrived finally in Freiburg, Germany and the doors slid open, I knew we left people behind, but I didn’t know that they were dead.</span> <span id="s444">There were babies, there were old people.</span> <span id="s445">They just fell down when we started to file out from the wagons.</span> <span id="s446">They probably died standing up, because there wasn’t enough room to lie down.</span> <span id="s447">They quickly put us into an abandoned building in Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau), where my mother and father worked in a leather factory, making things for the Nazi troops.</span> <span id="s448">Children worked in a field.</span> <span id="s449">I can’t remember what we did in that field, though.</span> <span id="s450">Did we pick potatoes, plant potatoes?</span> <span id="s451">I can’t remember a thing.</span> <span id="s452">I just remember walking and being very, very cold, and picking up rocks from the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">This would have been late summer, fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Late summer, fall, yes, yes, as soon as we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">So it would be harvest time?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">We were doing something.</span> <span id="s457">I know now why I don’t remember, because I started to get sick with TB.</span> <span id="s458">And my mother begged one of the guards in the factory to get some medical attention for me.</span> <span id="s459">Now, we were still not in the normal type of slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s460">They were just keeping us there for factory work.</span> <span id="s461">Later, they started to divide us, and sending us wherever Germany needed slave labor.</span> <span id="s462">By the time the German guard offered to help me, I was very, very sick already.</span> <span id="s463">I was semi-conscious by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">He came in a little black car like a Volkswagen, and he took me to a hospital.</span> <span id="s465">I remember riding with him, and I saw a gray building that I thought would be a hospital, and I was impressed that I’m going to be in that beautiful, beautiful kind of a building.</span> <span id="s466">But that was not for people like me.</span> <span id="s467">That was a German hospital.</span> <span id="s468">Far away from that hospital, he told me later, that that was for Polish swine.</span> <span id="s469">And that’s where they kept people like me.</span> <span id="s470">I remember lying in that hospital.</span> <span id="s471">And my mother said years later that she came to visit me.</span> <span id="s472">But I didn’t know really that she snuck out from that place somehow and got to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">I remember that I was very sick and I thought I was dreaming that my mother was sitting next to me and stroking my hand and talking sweet, you know, like mothers do.</span> <span id="s474">But I thought I was dreaming, so I wouldn’t open my eyes.</span> <span id="s475">I thought if I open my eyes, the dream would stop.</span> <span id="s476">So I never opened my eyes, and my mother died never knowing that I knew that she was there.</span> <span id="s477">But I didn’t want to open my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">I was in the hospital, my mother said, three to four months.</span> <span id="s479">It was very cold, but it was drawing close to spring when another guard came to bring me back to my mother.</span> <span id="s480">But he didn’t come in a car this time, he came on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s481">And it was cold, and I was holding on to the handlebars.</span> <span id="s482">I was sitting on the handlebars, holding on.</span> <span id="s483">And I remember the road still having patches of snow.</span> <span id="s484">But it was thaw already, and it was mud, and the bicycle was constantly splashing mud all over my legs.</span> <span id="s485">When we got to the building where they kept us, I couldn’t get my hands off the handlebars.</span> <span id="s486">I thought they froze to the handlebars.</span> <span id="s487">He had to help me get my fingers straightened out.</span> <span id="s488">My mother begged them, if they’d only let me rest a little bit and they said no, I had to go back to the field with the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">At this point, my hair was already shaved, because I was infested with lice.</span> <span id="s490">All of us were.</span> <span id="s491">My hair was just growing back.</span> <span id="s492">I had to wear a beret.</span> <span id="s493">Somebody gave me a hat.</span> <span id="s494">But when I returned from the hospital, I had no shoes.</span> <span id="s495">My shoes were stolen, so I had to wrap rags around my feet.</span> <span id="s496">We slept with our shoes under our pillows, that’s how bad it was.</span> <span id="s497">No one had shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">What did they feed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">In this particular camp, they had the ugliest soup ever.</span> <span id="s500">It was soup made out of cherries.</span> <span id="s501">I hated that.</span> <span id="s502">It was sweet-sour.</span> <span id="s503">I didn’t remember anything but that soup, and there was vegetable that they gave us, like turnip.</span> <span id="s504">That was an over abundance.</span> <span id="s505">I don’t remember milk.</span> <span id="s506">Maybe we did get it.</span> <span id="s507">I don’t remember seeing milk there.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">How about sleeping conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Sleeping, we slept, this building, there were no beds.</span> <span id="s510">We slept on a floor.</span> <span id="s511">Whatever we brought with us, belongings, clothes for a pillow, or if you happened to have a blanket, you covered all your children with one blanket.</span> <span id="s512">That’s why we were so lice-infested there, because we were on top of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Was the family allowed to stay together?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Yes, at this point, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">So there was segregation based on gender?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Which kind people were in this camp?</span> <span id="s518">Were they all from your town, village?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">No, strangers, strangers at this point.</span> <span id="s520">But from what I remember, we were all Poles at this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">All Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">We all spoke Polish, I don’t remember hearing any other language there.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">No Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">No, I didn’t hear it, no.</span> <span id="s525">In the end of the spring, beginning of the summer, wagons came and trucks and all of us had to quickly get out, get into these trucks, and they drove us to a slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s526">We didn’t know what a slave labor camp was, in Chemnitz.</span> <span id="s527">This was a whole different story.</span> <span id="s528">Chemnitz had tall fence, it had a wire on the top, and it was located between the railroad tracks and a munitions factory, where my mother and father worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">My father’s job was loading torpedoes onto a truck that hauled them away to I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s530">My mother worked in that factory with a Ukrainian woman, and they became best of friends, these two women.</span> <span id="s531">Now, in this camp, it was all different.</span> <span id="s532">It was organized.</span> <span id="s533">We had other nationalities, we had French in there, we had Ukrainians, we had gypsies.</span> <span id="s534">And I never knew what a gypsy was.</span> <span id="s535">I thought gypsies only read tarot cards.</span> <span id="s536">They were nice people, you know, but I thought that’s all gypsies did.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Could they tell fortunes?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">No, no they were just like rest of us.</span> <span id="s539">But like I said.</span> <span id="s540">there were French, there were Russian women there, there were children, many, many children.</span> <span id="s541">We were forbidden to look towards the railroad tracks, but I was curious, and I did look.</span> <span id="s542">I thought I could see something that would look like human beings, but there were never any people at the train station.</span> <span id="s543">I never saw people.</span> <span id="s544">I knew trains stopped there, because I could hear the screech of the wheels coming to a stop.</span> <span id="s545">They picked up something or delivered something.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">In this camp, we stayed from sometime from 1944 summer, late spring, to the end of the war almost.</span> <span id="s547">My mother in Chemnitz somehow wrote a letter to her brother who was working as a slave laborer at a German farm.</span> <span id="s548">Now, how my mother managed this, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s549">She wrote a letter… How she managed to write the letter, how she managed to know that her brother was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Yes, how did she know?</span> <span id="s551">I never learned this from my mother.</span> <span id="s552">How did she know where to send this letter?</span> <span id="s553">She wrote a letter and put three leaves of tobacco, because he was a chain smoker.</span> <span id="s554">And don’t ask me where she got the tobacco.</span> <span id="s555">I don’t know how these people managed these things.</span> <span id="s556">They must barter somehow in the camp.</span> <span id="s557">Somebody must have had it.</span> <span id="s558">And in the letter, she said something to the effect that it won’t be long now when the children will be finished off first, because of the food, the lack of food.</span> <span id="s559">And the letter was thick.</span> <span id="s560">It was censored.</span> <span id="s561">They opened the letter, and they quickly arrested my father.</span> <span id="s562">My mother signed the letter with the initial “J” for Janina.</span> <span id="s563">And somehow, in their haste, they thought it was my father who wrote the letter.</span> <span id="s564">They came and arrested my father.</span> <span id="s565">They interrogated him all night, beat him something terrible, because he didn’t know anything, and they insisted he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">They showed my father in the morning the letter, and when he saw my mother’s initial without realizing he said, “’But that’s Janka’s letter.</span> <span id="s567">’” But he was so beaten at this point, he didn’t know what he was saying anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">So he incriminated your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Yeah, I’m sure… It’s interesting that a prisoner could be arrested, because in effect, he’s a prisoner already.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Yes, you were already a prisoner, right?</span> <span id="s571">But they came when they realized their mistake in the morning.</span> <span id="s572">They brought my father back, and they took my mother.</span> <span id="s573">And I remember my mother and my father passing each other, and my father said to her, “’Janka, we now have real trouble.</span> <span id="s574">’” And my mother whispered to me that she hid nine German marks, money, under the mattress.</span> <span id="s575">She said, “’If you need it, use it’”.</span> <span id="s576">You know, very thrifty woman, she salvaged nine marks, and hid them in a mattress, for some day.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">It seems the reason my mother was really in trouble, not only because of that letter, but the Ukrainian woman that she worked with made a suit for her boyfriend out of a gray blanket, and he escaped.</span> <span id="s578">That was a successful escape.</span> <span id="s579">There were other successful escapes.</span> <span id="s580">The Germans thought that there was a Polish or some underground working inside the camp.</span> <span id="s581">And my mother and this Ukrainian girl, they worked shoulder to shoulder, so they must know something.</span> <span id="s582">They’re probably part of it.</span> <span id="s583">That woman maybe was, but my mother definitely wasn’t.</span> <span id="s584">So, they arrested my mother and that woman too.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">My mother and she were terribly beaten to reveal names of others.</span> <span id="s586">There were no others to reveal, and the more they denied, the more they were beaten.</span> <span id="s587">Both women were then sent -- this is already pushing towards the end of 1944 -- both women eventually were sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp.</span> <span id="s588">My mother in the camp, she was sterilized so she would never have – they way they put it to her -- so there would be no more Polish bastards born in the world.</span> <span id="s589">That’s what they told her.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Tape 1 Side B Never, never, never discussed, she could be a Polish or a German Jew but it was something the women protected.</span> <span id="s591">They protected each other like that, they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Did your mother wear a uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">What kind of badge or emblem did she have on?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">She had her red triangle, red triangle with letter P.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Red triangle, political?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Red triangle with a “P”, with a “P”.</span> <span id="s598">I don’t know her number.</span> <span id="s599">The reason we found, tracing my mother’s number, her batch of numbers, could have been destroyed when Germans were destroying all records, when the front was approaching.</span> <span id="s600">We had found some other women who also lost, who were there with friends.</span> <span id="s601">Friends’ numbers survived, records, and some women you can’t find.</span> <span id="s602">This is something we found in Poland very often.</span> <span id="s603">We met three women.</span> <span id="s604">One was only listed, she said.</span> <span id="s605">We went through the camp together, the two other women, their records were destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">But going back to my mother, she did spent time in the hospital, Revier, in Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s607">She told us stories that you could only stay in the hospital three days.</span> <span id="s608">If you didn’t get better, you were administered a lethal shot.</span> <span id="s609">She said her friends had falsified her papers that hang over your bed.</span> <span id="s610">Someone had died, and they hung someone else’s papers, switching, because if her original papers that she had come in there with three days ago stayed there, and she didn’t get better and leave the bed, she would have received her lethal shot.</span> <span id="s611">So they switched papers somehow, so she could stay another day or two, when she could be stronger and walk out.</span> <span id="s612">My mother was always determined that she would not go “’through the chimney.</span> <span id="s613">’” That was a favorite expression.</span> <span id="s614">That’s what gave them hope.</span> <span id="s615">That was not the way she’s going to die, just as her friend was.</span> <span id="s616">They’re not going to go through the chimney.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Eventually, there was a German guard when my mother was in the solitary, there was a German guard who came one time to my mother with a little jar of vaseline.</span> <span id="s618">And, he said mater of factly to her, “’My wife feels sorry for you.</span> <span id="s619">She sent you this Vaseline.</span> <span id="s620">’” My mother said it was a blessing and a curse, because she couldn’t show the vaseline to any of her friends, her inmates, because they would fight for it and take it away from her.</span> <span id="s621">She couldn’t let anyone see it, because she’d be accused maybe of stealing it someplace.</span> <span id="s622">She slept with it under her armpit or between her legs.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">What did she do with it when she worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">I have no idea what she did.</span> <span id="s625">Did she have a pocket, did she have underwear, did she stick it someplace else?</span> <span id="s626">But she said this is what she had to do to make sure that they didn’t steal that little jar of vaseline.</span> <span id="s627">You couldn’t go to sleep with possessions like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Was she able to use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">She did, she did, while she was in solitary, she did.</span> <span id="s630">She was alone.</span> <span id="s631">But when she came out, she went out to the barrack.</span> <span id="s632">But eventually, they send her from Ravensbruck to Gross-Rosen, where she worked in the stone quarry.</span> <span id="s633">But we remained in Chemnitz, the family, until spring of 1945.</span> <span id="s634">There weren’t that many of us that survived.</span> <span id="s635">We were thinned out by then.</span> <span id="s636">We weren’t as crowded anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">What did you do, what was an average day like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">For children?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">There were German women who took charge of the children while the adults worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s641">They taught us the glories of the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s642">They taught us how to knit scarves.</span> <span id="s643">We thought the scarves were for us, because winter was approaching.</span> <span id="s644">They were for their own children for Christmas presents.</span> <span id="s645">They confiscated all these green little scarves, and took them home for Christmas presesents for their own families.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">I know at one point there, when my mother was gone, I lost all interest in my appearance, and it was very important to the Germans that we be very neat and clean, and our hair be combed.</span> <span id="s647">But when my mother was arrested, and I became the mother in the family, I lost interest in things.</span> <span id="s648">And one time I was sitting at a long bench with my brother and sisters, and I guess I wasn’t very clean, or my hair wasn’t combed, I don’t know, but she grabbed me and she slapped me because I was dirty.</span> <span id="s649">She called me a dirty Pole and I fell, I was so surprised, I fell, I lost my balance and fell down.</span> <span id="s650">And she even kicked me once so the children would know that it’s very important that we listen and that we stay neat and clean.</span> <span id="s651">I remember one time there was no food, and I went to the dump behind the kitchen there.</span> <span id="s652">There was a dump, and I found apple peels and potato peels.</span> <span id="s653">I was in heaven.</span> <span id="s654">I thought potato peels.</span> <span id="s655">I thought, I hadn’t seen a potato in so long.</span> <span id="s656">I brought the potatoes to the barrack, and the women were beside themselves with joy.</span> <span id="s657">How are we going to cook these?</span> <span id="s658">We want to have potatoes.</span> <span id="s659">We want to taste potatoes.</span> <span id="s660">And somehow they cooked the potatoes.</span> <span id="s661">I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s662">I remember eating them, and they were full of sand.</span> <span id="s663">I don’t think they washed them very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">But in 1944, in the spring, I suppose the front was approaching.</span> <span id="s665">The wagons came and trucks and they told us to take our belongings, and get into the wagons.</span> <span id="s666">They took us to the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s667">They dumped all of us on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s668">We still had several hundred people.</span> <span id="s669">And no one told us what this was all about.</span> <span id="s670">When we were all on the sidewalk, the German guards lined us up with guns, and told us to march and find the American front.</span> <span id="s671">We didn’t know which way to go.</span> <span id="s672">They told us not to turn back because they were going to shoot.</span> <span id="s673">We had too many belongings.</span> <span id="s674">We started to leave things on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s675">We started to walk in the direction they pointed, towards the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">As we started to wind our way through the city into the open field and head into the forest, some German people came out they whispered to us to stay on the road not to go into the fields because the fields are mined.</span> <span id="s677">We stayed on the road for days.</span> <span id="s678">We traveled for days.</span> <span id="s679">We slept in the forest.</span> <span id="s680">We slept in abandoned railroad cars.</span> <span id="s681">Sometimes, we would sneak into a German barn if it was dark, and we could do that without anyone noticing, if the dogs didn’t bark.</span> <span id="s682">At this point, people started breaking up into different units.</span> <span id="s683">Everybody had their own idea which way to find the American front.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">You had no escorts, no guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">No, nothing, they just let us go loose into the German population.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Was your father with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Yes, my mother was already in the Ravensbruck, there were four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">So your father was your guide, so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Yes, he was, but the German people were afraid of us they would ___ when we beg for food, they would ___, and then they would ask to spend the night in their shed or barn or something, they would say “’nay’” no, there were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">You were full of lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">We were dirty, you have to remember, we were the people that they were taught to hate.</span> <span id="s692">Eventually, we did find the American front.</span> <span id="s693">When we converged in this one place, the Americans didn’t know what to do with all of us.</span> <span id="s694">There were so many of us, every day a new group of people arriving.</span> <span id="s695">Where do you house all these people?</span> <span id="s696">Eventually, we wound up in an old abandoned schoolhouse, I think.</span> <span id="s697">The Americans sent us by mistake into German schools.</span> <span id="s698">We had lost a few years of schooling.</span> <span id="s699">The German children ridiculed us.</span> <span id="s700">They called us a Polish swine, and I remember someone called me a Polish bandit, a Polish bandit.</span> <span id="s701">I thought to myself, I have never done anything to be called a bandit.</span> <span id="s702">How did this happen?</span> <span id="s703">I’m a swine and a bandit.</span> <span id="s704">That was such a puzzlement to us.</span> <span id="s705">We couldn’t figure this out.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Did you even know what a bandit was?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">No, I knew it was something bad, “bandyta” in Polish, I know what that is.</span> <span id="s708">How did these children consider me a swine and a bandit?</span> <span id="s709">What did I ever do?</span> <span id="s710">They were dressed beautifully, these children.</span> <span id="s711">We were in rags.</span> <span id="s712">They made fun of our clothes.</span> <span id="s713">They had made fun of our names too, so when the Americans realized what was happening, they quickly took us out of these schools and they formed local schools within our group.</span> <span id="s714">There were teachers there.</span> <span id="s715">At one point, we even had a priest that survived.</span> <span id="s716">He was with us, a Polish priest.</span> <span id="s717">We stayed in this one building for few months, and then it got overcrowded, and by mistake, somehow, they shipped us to Buchenwald concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">The Americans shipped you to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">There were beds there.</span> <span id="s720">No one really knew how bad it was.</span> <span id="s721">I am sure no one knew.</span> <span id="s722">When we got to Buchenwald, and we saw what had happened in Buchenwald, they quickly took us out of there too.</span> <span id="s723">And they brought us to a place, a Displaced Person (DP) camp at this point.</span> <span id="s724">Then I learned a name for this place, a DP camp.</span> <span id="s725">There were hundreds and hundreds of us, and the American took care of us, there was an organization called UNRA, United Nations Relief Agency, I think, and they tried to send us back where we belonged.</span> <span id="s726">Where did we want to go?</span> <span id="s727">My father wouldn’t go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s728">He was afraid because he had a prison record there, and he was positive that that record still existed, and he wouldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s729">And he wouldn’t take us children back, even though we had thought my mother perished, and my mother thought we had perished, even though the slightest chance that my mother was alive; she might be in Poland.</span> <span id="s730">Even that wouldn’t make my father want to go back there.</span> <span id="s731">He was that afraid, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Now Poland meaning…?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Communist Poland, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Yeah, or worse.</span> <span id="s735">The Russian, the area that you had come from, was that still part of Poland at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">I don’t think so, not any more.</span> <span id="s737">But he wouldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s738">He had very bad memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Now his prison record, you say he had a prison record in Poland, this was not under the Polish government, was it?</span> <span id="s740">This was under the Communist government.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Communists, right.</span> <span id="s742">And later, he told u she was also afraid someone might snitch on him for other activities.</span> <span id="s743">We were hiding people by the river.</span> <span id="s744">We don’t know if anyone snitched ever on us.</span> <span id="s745">Did he spend time for some of that, too?</span> <span id="s746">I don’t think he should have, but we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">As a prisoner of the Germans, did he get to wear a prison uniform with a triangle?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">My father?</span> <span id="s749">No, not in a slave labor camp, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">And you continued to wear your usual rags?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Your own rags, yes.</span> <span id="s752">There were no uniforms for us in that camp, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Do you know where and when you were liberated by the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Spring of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">You don’t know the month or the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">And the town where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">I think we were in Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">And the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">That’s what I’m thinking of, the DP camp was in Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">But you were liberated somewhere else, not far from Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Not far, no, very close, because this was very fast moving, so we couldn’t have been very far from each place.</span> <span id="s763">But when, UNRA located relatives in New York, and told them that we survived the war, they sponsored us, and passports and birth certificates had to be made very quickly.</span> <span id="s764">And in that same DP camp, we were there till January 1947 in that DP camp, from 1945 till the beginning of 1947.</span> <span id="s765">We had our own little schools.</span> <span id="s766">They tried to teach children reading, writing, math.</span> <span id="s767">We even made holy communion.</span> <span id="s768">There was priest there who taught us religion after the war.</span> <span id="s769">Three of us, three out of the four children received holy communion.</span> <span id="s770">And we had Polish scouts, I remember.</span> <span id="s771">I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s772">I was already a teenager, 12 by then, 12 and a half I was.</span> <span id="s773">I was terribly impressed that Polish people even had scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">When was the last time you attended church?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Oh, my God, from 1943 to 1947, I had no regular church, no.</span> <span id="s776">We prayed, but no church.</span> <span id="s777">Holy communion, they made a make-shift church for us for holy communion in the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Your schooling at the DP camp, was that in English, German, or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Polish.</span> <span id="s780">It was still Polish.</span> <span id="s781">Yeah, but we all spoke German at this point already.</span> <span id="s782">Even when I came here, I was able to speak German.</span> <span id="s783">You just pick up these things.</span> <span id="s784">Children pick up very quickly.</span> <span id="s785">And my father and mother, they could speak Russian, German, Ukrainian, Polish.</span> <span id="s786">They could jump back and forth between these languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">When did you realize that your mother was alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">We came to America in early 1947, and my mother, when she was sent to Gross-Rosen, that is the rock quarry slave labor camp to work there.</span> <span id="s789">She with her Ukrainian best friend, again, when the front was approaching, they didn’t know it was.</span> <span id="s790">Something was changing at Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s791">My mother noticed that the guards were not beating the women, they were almost kind.</span> <span id="s792">So my mother said to her friend, “’I am going to run for it tonight when it gets dark.</span> <span id="s793">’” And the woman says, “’I’m going with you.</span> <span id="s794">’” So my mother sat until dark and they went for the gate.</span> <span id="s795">The gate opened when they pushed.</span> <span id="s796">There were no sirens, no dogs, no search lights.</span> <span id="s797">The two women froze for a second, and then took to their heels, and ran into the forest.</span> <span id="s798">They spent two to three days sleeping in the forest in dampness, until both were burning with a fever.</span> <span id="s799">So they decided that they’re going to enter the first house and ask for help.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">When they went to this one house, it was still dark.</span> <span id="s801">Lights were on inside, the door opened, and a man sees these two women in striped uniforms, with very short hair.</span> <span id="s802">He gets scared, he doesn’t know what to do, so he calls his wife.</span> <span id="s803">His wife comes in, and she sees the two women, and she pulls them in quickly, and closes the door so no neighbors would see them standing there.</span> <span id="s804">And she took pity on my mother and her friend, and she said, “’You could spend time up in the attic, but don’t walk, because the ceiling creeks.</span> <span id="s805">’” So my mother said they were there two, three days until the fever subsided.</span> <span id="s806">The woman fed them.</span> <span id="s807">She took a tremendous risk, and her neighbors could have reported her that she took in two prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">One day, my mother hears tanks approaching the house.</span> <span id="s809">The roar was getting louder and louder, and closer and closer they came.</span> <span id="s810">She thought that that was the end for both of them.</span> <span id="s811">As they got closer to the house, she recognized the language they were speaking, and it was Russian.</span> <span id="s812">They were being liberated by the Soviet troops.</span> <span id="s813">And of course, the two women ran down, and the Soviet troops opened their arms, and welcomed them.</span> <span id="s814">They were very happy to find two of them alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">They were taken after that, my mother said, to some holding camp, where in this camp they were told they can either go back to Poland or to Russia.</span> <span id="s816">My mother, hoping we would be in Poland, went to Poland.</span> <span id="s817">In Poland, my mother gets impatient to find us; are we dead or alive?</span> <span id="s818">So she pieced an address, part of an address, and wrote something to a relative in Detroit, who knew somebody in New York who knew us, who found us.</span> <span id="s819">This is by this point is 1949.</span> <span id="s820">They find us in New York.</span> <span id="s821">We start corresponding.</span> <span id="s822">My mother gets anxious to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s823">She applies for a visa.</span> <span id="s824">The visa is denied by the Communists because she is too young, she was then 39.</span> <span id="s825">They need young people to rebuild Poland.</span> <span id="s826">We’re corresponding furiously back and forth.</span> <span id="s827">My mother gets very impatient to come.</span> <span id="s828">She joins the Polish underground in Poland.</span> <span id="s829">She tries to cross the border, on the water somehow.</span> <span id="s830">They were picked up off the water, three men and two women, by a Russian trawler.</span> <span id="s831">And my mother winds up in prison again.</span> <span id="s832">While she’s sitting in prison, her visa does come up, but she doesn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">She told her sister when she joined the underground -- she didn’t tell her sister that she was joining the underground -- all she told her sister in Poland was, “’If I am in trouble, I will send you a post card and the stamp will be upside down.</span> <span id="s834">That means I am in trouble.</span> <span id="s835">’” That’s all she said, and she took off one night, without explaining anything.</span> <span id="s836">But when she finally came out of prison and reapplied for her visa from the Communists, they told her you can’t leave the country, because you have a prison record.</span> <span id="s837">And this is like 1950, 1951 already.</span> <span id="s838">She came in1957 to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">How did she pull that?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">The visa came through; they took pity on her, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">The Gomulka regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">The Gomulka regime, that’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s843">She came on August 15, 1957.</span> <span id="s844">I was a married lady, my sister was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">It’s a Holy Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">That’s right, you remembered, good boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Boy?</span> <span id="s848">(laughter) And we picked her up at.</span> <span id="s849">I remember picking her up at LaGuardia.</span> <span id="s850">I don’t know why LaGuardia sticks out in my head.</span> <span id="s851">But I only had like a week’s notice that she was coming.</span> <span id="s852">That’s how quickly.</span> <span id="s853">A telegram arrived, that’s it, “’Meet me at LaGuardia.</span> <span id="s854">’” I went there with my husband.</span> <span id="s855">I didn’t recognize her.</span> <span id="s856">I was looking for a different kind of woman, the woman that I remembered.</span> <span id="s857">This is more than 15 years later.</span> <span id="s858">It wasn’t anything what I expected, and I wasn’t what she expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Was your father still around?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">He was.</span> <span id="s861">He didn’t come to the airport with us.</span> <span id="s862">He couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s863">Emotionally, he just couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Where did your mother stay during these years in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">She knew her sister; this was Klodzko, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">So she did not return to her hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">No, not that way, no, the opposite almost, the opposite end of Poland, near the German border, the Czechoslovakian border, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">And when did you know that she was alive through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">In about 1949… So when she applied for the visa, she knew you were in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Oh yes, she knew.</span> <span id="s871">That’s way she applied for the visa then.</span> <span id="s872">Piecing little bits and pieces of the address that she remembered in her head.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">So all those years you thought that she was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Oh yeah, yeah… And when you had left her in…when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">That was in about the end of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">That is when she left you?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Yes, we were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">In Ravensbruck, that was the good bye… Yes, that was last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Did she get a chance to say goodbye to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">No, they were hustling her very fast.</span> <span id="s881">I’m sure no one thought it was a goodbye.</span> <span id="s882">I don’t think anyone thought that way at that time, mm mm.</span> <span id="s883">Sometimes people ask about our childhood.</span> <span id="s884">There was no childhood for people like us.</span> <span id="s885">There was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">So when did you reach adulthood, 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Probably, probably when everything -- I was the mother, definitely in the European tradition, the oldest child takes the place of the parent that’s not there.</span> <span id="s888">I was the mother.</span> <span id="s889">When my mother arrived in New York, I was married, my sister was married, my brother was courting seriously a young girl, Polish girl.</span> <span id="s890">My youngest sister, the baby, who was pushing 19 already, 18, 19, she was getting ready to leave and go to the convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">My mother found four adults, not children.</span> <span id="s892">She didn’t understand why we celebrated birthdays, not feast days, because in Poland at that time we celebrated the saints.</span> <span id="s893">She couldn’t understand why we do that.</span> <span id="s894">She couldn’t understand Thanksgiving, why would you celebrate a turkey.</span> <span id="s895">Didn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s896">We spoke English amongst ourselves.</span> <span id="s897">That hurt my mother, I know it did.</span> <span id="s898">A lot of things -- we never, really, really bounded after that.</span> <span id="s899">Now that I’m mother and a grandma, I understand.</span> <span id="s900">We never, never bonded after that.</span> <span id="s901">There was something torn, lost forever.</span> <span id="s902">That childhood bonding that occurs in normal average families never returned to us.</span> <span id="s903">It was different, and I’m sure my mother felt it until the day she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">She used to say, “’I welcome death, that’s okay, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s905">’” She was always disappointed that people did that to people, what she saw, people did it to people, and that bothered her always, that she had to witness.</span> <span id="s906">And I found out my mother would talk about her experience.</span> <span id="s907">That’s why I know so much more, because I asked, and I kept a journal of things she said.</span> <span id="s908">My father had nightmares till the day he died.</span> <span id="s909">He would not talk.</span> <span id="s910">If we talked about the Holocaust, he would hear the subject beginning in the room, and he would walk out of the room.</span> <span id="s911">He wouldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s912">He’d go and lie down, and for good measure, he would put the pillow over his head, turn towards the wall, and want nothing to do with us.</span> <span id="s913">And he had endured a lot.</span> <span id="s914">He could have told us the stories how he had to take care of four children.</span> <span id="s915">What were his thoughts, trying to shelter and keep these children alive?</span> <span id="s916">Never talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Whom do you think suffered the most, your mother, you, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">I think my mother.</span> <span id="s919">She was alone.</span> <span id="s920">We were together, four children and a father.</span> <span id="s921">We stayed together.</span> <span id="s922">But she was separated all by herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">As a prisoner in a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">The Ukrainian friend was no substitute.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Well, it’s good to have a friend, you know.</span> <span id="s927">She remained with that woman to the end.</span> <span id="s928">And then, when they were liberated, each went her own way.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Do you know when and where she was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Somewhere outside Gross-Rosen by Russian troops in the spring of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">What was the worst experience for you during these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">I think when I heard in Germany after the war that -- I heard that they burned people and that they put their ashes in jars and labeled the jars.</span> <span id="s935">I wanted to find a place like that with jars so that I could be convinced that she’s alive or she’s dead.</span> <span id="s936">It used to haunt me, that story that I heard about the jars of ashes, and that the Germans labeled them so meticulously.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">So the fear, the suspicion that your mother was dead, that was the worst?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">This was at the end, already.</span> <span id="s939">We were liberated, but in the camp itself, it wasn’t the lack of food that was hurting the most, it’s the separation from the mother.</span> <span id="s940">And then you know the father would be working all day in the factory, and I was never sure if he would come back home either.</span> <span id="s941">And you would be there all day without mother, without father.</span> <span id="s942">These German women making fun of you and teaching you things that you didn’t know why they were teaching you these things.</span> <span id="s943">What is our future?</span> <span id="s944">Why are you teaching me all these things, what for?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">How did you view the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">At that time, I was confused.</span> <span id="s947">I knew they were bad, but I didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s948">No one told us.</span> <span id="s949">See, I thought throughout the war, when I heard grownups talking, I thought that Hitler hated people, and he hated Poles.</span> <span id="s950">I didn’t know at that time yet anything about the fate of the Jews.</span> <span id="s951">That wasn’t discussed in front of us children, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Did you know any Jews when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">In the village, yes, but I didn’t know they were Jews.</span> <span id="s954">I found out later that these people -- I thought they were just Poles, because they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s955">No, I never knew the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">There were no Jewish collective farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">No, I didn’t see anything like that.</span> <span id="s958">When I came to America, I heard, when we lived in Brooklyn, our first place, adults talking at the kitchen table, and my father saying, “’My god, my god, I should have seen what they were doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s959">’” And I thought to myself, the Jews, and then I heard it again, “’to the Jews’”.</span> <span id="s960">I said to myself, how come no one says what they were doing to us, too?</span> <span id="s961">And that was my first experience that Hitler was out to destroy all the Jews.</span> <span id="s962">And I was already in America when I learned this.</span> <span id="s963">We were never told these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">And this was from your father…?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">From my father, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Who, really -- did he even see what Hitler was doing to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">He saw.</span> <span id="s968">I saw Hitler in a parade someplace when we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s969">He was in a sidecar of a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s970">I was very impressed with the way they were marching in this parade.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">You literally saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">This was when you were in… This was sometime in 1943.</span> <span id="s974">It wasn’t in 1943, it was sometime in 1944.</span> <span id="s975">We were being transported from this Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau) to another camp, and there was a parade going.</span> <span id="s976">And we had to stop because of throngs and throngs of people.</span> <span id="s977">We got off the wagons and we were standing, trying to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s978">My father lifted me, and my father said, “’You see that, that’s Hitler.</span> <span id="s979">’” I had no idea who Hitler was.</span> <span id="s980">All I remember is, he stood there and he was doing his “‘Heil Hitler!</span> <span id="s981">’” Who is that person?</span> <span id="s982">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s983">Years later, my father reminded me of that.</span> <span id="s984">I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">But this is Hitler on parade, not for killing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Parade – oh no, no, no on parade, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s987">This was people screaming and shouting.</span> <span id="s988">And I had no idea who this famous or infamous person was at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">No, I was referring to your father’s remark, “’You should have seen what they were doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s990">’” The fact is, he wasn’t even seeing the worst… Himself.</span> <span id="s991">He still, he felt sorry for what they were doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s992">That’s why he was saying, “’My god, my god, you should see what they were doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s993">’” But my father died peacefully.</span> <span id="s994">My mother died in her sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">You will never know what their most terrifying experience was.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">There were so many, my father story?</span> <span id="s997">I can only tell you what his nightmare.</span> <span id="s998">I can tell you to the day he died, he used to beat the wall with his fists and scream.</span> <span id="s999">And he was always dreaming that the Ukrainians were killing him; that they were successful; they butchering.</span> <span id="s1000">He told us this, this was from his lips.</span> <span id="s1001">That was his most horrible nightmare.</span> <span id="s1002">He was so afraid of being killed that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">And as it turned out, they took his farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">They took his farm.</span> <span id="s1005">They were happy, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1006">They took the farm, they got what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">And your most terrifying experience during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">I think bombs falling, probably.</span> <span id="s1009">When the sirens go off, you don’t know where to hide your head.</span> <span id="s1010">Usually, when the sirens would go off, because we were between the railroad tracks and the munitions factory, so the Allies were trying to bomb one or the other.</span> <span id="s1011">I didn’t know where to run.</span> <span id="s1012">We had no mother.</span> <span id="s1013">My father couldn’t come and grab us quick enough.</span> <span id="s1014">Where do four children run?</span> <span id="s1015">Where do we hide?</span> <span id="s1016">That was scary, when there was no one to look after us, no one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">And you didn’t know whose bombs they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">No we didn’t know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">And it probably would not have occurred to you that these were friendly bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">No.</span> <span id="s1021">I remember one time, planes came and leaflets were dropped.</span> <span id="s1022">The whole area was covered with some kind of leaflet.</span> <span id="s1023">I heard them talking later that the leaflets said something – that “’Hitler give up, you never win this war.</span> <span id="s1024">’” But who dropped these leaflets, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1025">No one ever told us.</span> <span id="s1026">So I don’t know where they came from.</span> <span id="s1027">Was it the British or -- I have no idea, no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">When did you, your father, since he was the brains of the family, at this point, realize that the end was in sight, that this will not go on forever, this prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">I think, when they threw us from the city.</span> <span id="s1030">They said go.</span> <span id="s1031">They didn’t know what to do with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">So very late?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Yes.</span> <span id="s1034">I’m sure everybody thought that we’re not going to make it, because they were systematically starving.</span> <span id="s1035">People who died, children would die.</span> <span id="s1036">I wouldn’t see actually dead children, but I knew there were children were missing, and I never questioned, where did they go?</span> <span id="s1037">Their parents are still there, where did they go?</span> <span id="s1038">There’s a child missing from this family, there’s a child from that.</span> <span id="s1039">And eventually they would replace; they would send new people for the work, for the labor, because that munitions factory was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">As a matter of fact, I went back to Germany last summer, and I went back to Chemnitz, and I stood where that camp was, and I recognized the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1041">And I said to my husband as I looked, I said, “’In back of me there should be a factory.</span> <span id="s1042">’” And he said, “’Turn around.</span> <span id="s1043">’” When I turned around, there’s the factory.</span> <span id="s1044">It’s all there.</span> <span id="s1045">When I asked the German woman in town about the camp, did she see it?</span> <span id="s1046">She says “’Yeah.</span> <span id="s1047">’” I said, “’Well, I was there.</span> <span id="s1048">’” And she says, “’That’s impossible, there were no children in there.</span> <span id="s1049">’” And I said, “’Madam, there were many children there.</span> <span id="s1050">’” She said, “’That’s impossible, we would have known.</span> <span id="s1051">’” I said, “’When you saw people in there, behind the wire, didn’t you wonder?</span> <span id="s1052">’” “’Oh no,’” she said, “’You’re not allowed to asked questions.</span> <span id="s1053">You don’t know who you are talking to.</span> <span id="s1054">They might report you, and you’ll go to a concentration camp, so you ask nothing.</span> <span id="s1055">’” You don’t even take a close look.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Well, she didn’t.</span> <span id="s1057">She didn’t know there where children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">And you weren’t children any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">No, no, we looked like children, though.</span> <span id="s1060">But she was convinced that there were no children there.</span> <span id="s1061">So many people, and she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1062">No one asked who were we, what were you doing there.</span> <span id="s1063">Nobody cared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">So this was the welcome that you got.</span> <span id="s1065">You were fleeing the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Yeah, always running from somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">And Germany turned out to be a prison camp for you.</span> <span id="s1068">Your crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Being Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Being Polish, being refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">No, we were their labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Your parents had not committed any sabotage, or rose up against the German regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1074">An aunt of mine who left Poland with us at the same time, she was pregnant, and gave birth to a baby in Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau).</span> <span id="s1075">They took the baby from her, and drained the blood for the German troops.</span> <span id="s1076">And eventually, in a few weeks, the baby died.</span> <span id="s1077">My grandmother worked for a German bower, a farm.</span> <span id="s1078">She was fed so poorly that she just died of starvation there, they were so cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">So family members perished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1081">It’s so hard to imagine things like that if you’ve lived in freedom all your life, like in America.</span> <span id="s1082">It’s so hard.</span> <span id="s1083">Sometimes children say to me, “’Why didn’t you protest?</span> <span id="s1084">’” Well, who, to whom, where?</span> <span id="s1085">Who was going to listen to you?</span> <span id="s1086">I think, in Poland, probably, it was a paradox.</span> <span id="s1087">We were victims, and yet some managed to be rescuers of others.</span> <span id="s1088">Some Poles were lucky enough to have saved some Jews.</span> <span id="s1089">It’s a paradox to me that they could have done that, and they did, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Your younger brothers and sisters all survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Yes, my youngest sister died of cancer about five, six years ago.</span> <span id="s1092">The rest are fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Do you have anything to add, additional reflections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">The older I get, the wiser I get, the less I understand.</span> <span id="s1095">Why?</span> <span id="s1096">Why?</span> <span id="s1097">Why?</span> <span id="s1098">I’m so disappointed in people, sometimes, that we do that to each other.</span> <span id="s1099">I don’t know why, what for?</span> <span id="s1100">We all look so much alike, feel the same way, hurt.</span> <span id="s1101">There’s so much more that binds us than divides us, and yet we take sometimes pride in dividing from others as if we’re different.</span> <span id="s1102">I’ve seen that in Europe, now with national pride coming in, and that worries me.</span> <span id="s1103">Human pride would have been so much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Will it ever end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">No more for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Thank you for your story.</span></p></body></html>
