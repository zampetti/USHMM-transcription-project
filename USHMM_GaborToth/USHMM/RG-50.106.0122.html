it was all Jewish – mostly Jewish education, going to service in the synagogue, studying in the evening, in the a – in the afternoon, whenever, Sundays.</span> <span id="s29">So, I really didn’t have too much fun to – to be with other kids who are playing ball or having fun.</span> <span id="s30">It was all studying Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you have any – did you live in a small town or in a big town?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: A big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s34">Were there lots of Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yes, we – we had a lot – lots of Jews, we had religious Jews, not – conservative and also the non-Conservative, whatever they call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Reform.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Reform, that’s right, and we had Yeshivas in our – in our – Jewish Yeshivas.</span> <span id="s38">It was a bi – nice, big city that it was – it was real nice to be socializing with – with your own people.</span> <span id="s39">I mean, you had everything you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Tell us about your education.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I went to school, to public school til 1943.</span> <span id="s42">In 1943, the – I was – a-as an individual Jew I was always beaten up by the kids in s – in the school, including the teacher.</span> <span id="s43">My history teacher, I remember in 1943, I came a little late to school, he was waiting for me outside the door at the – outside the class door and – and firmly pulled me in, in front of the kids, he went ahead and pu-punched me all over my face, in front of the kids.</span> <span id="s44">The kids were laughing, giggling, and I was – I was hurting and they were enjoying it.</span> <span id="s45">That was number one.</span> <span id="s46">Then on the way going home from school, four kids attacked me not far from my home.</span> <span id="s47">They – I fought back.</span> <span id="s48">I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s49">They punched me all over my face and kicked me.</span> <span id="s50">I fi – fought back hard, but I couldn't – I was outnumbered.</span> <span id="s51">I was bleeding, and not them.</span> <span id="s52">Then – that – that was the end of my schools, I couldn’t go any more to school because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: How was your Jewish – how would you describe your Jewish education?</span> <span id="s54">When did you go to cheder, or Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I went to cheder and to ser – to services til 1943, til things got really worse.</span> <span id="s56">In 1943 under the Nazis, things got miserable and it got worse all the time.</span> <span id="s57">As a Jew you weren’t allowed to go out, only during the day and certain hours, and you had to wear a yellow star and a yellow armband.</span> <span id="s58">I remember we went to evening service, evening service with my father once and the two SS, the Hungarian Nazis came in and beat up all the Jews in there and everybody was running in different directions, but most of them escaped and – and that was the end of the synagogues, we – we couldn’t go no more for services and there wasn’t servi – anyway, the end for my father and me.</span> <span id="s59">Th-They blocked off all the synagogues, we couldn’t in – all businesses and properties were taken away from Jews.</span> <span id="s60">There was just no place that you – you – you felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did you know that there was a war going on in Europe at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, we did, but we didn’t know too much about it because all we knew, we were – first of all we had no communication with the outside world.</span> <span id="s63">Wi – there wasn’t telephones like you have here, that you could call up somebody and r-right away you’d tell them – any place you moved, you had to have a pass and th-the police were patrolling everywhere, every di – so often you would drive down someplace or walk down, you had to have a pass with you.</span> <span id="s64">And if you sh – you were – you were Jewish, right away you had to have a Jewish pass and that you’re circumsi-cised, all that stuff had to be on it, on.</span> <span id="s65">So there – there wasn’t really too much we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: When did you notice – when did you realize that things were really getting bad?</span> <span id="s67">Was it in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: In 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Until then things were nice and pleasant?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: It was – it was pre – pretty pleasant.</span> <span id="s71">We could feel the tension from the SS.</span> <span id="s72">We could st – of the Nazis, we could feel the tension, but we were still in our own homes, we could still go out and do some shopping.</span> <span id="s73">You had to watch yourself because you were beaten up or taken away the – some of the Jews disappeared.</span> <span id="s74">But we –</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Did you know where they disappeared to?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No, no, probably got ‘em – ki-killed them.</span> <span id="s77">Probably killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s79">When did the Germans come to Chust?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Oh, I don’t remember exactly, but I – I know they were – they were there for quite awhile before 1943.</span> <span id="s81">And when they came in th-there were – it’s – things just – I can – I can remember not only they take away the business and properties, they trained some of the young boys, like myself, I was 13 at that time, they trained us just like being in the army.</span> <span id="s82">But th – we – I called this the torture training.</span> <span id="s83">What they did, they – we marched in step and if somebody ri – step – didn’t – wa-wasn’t going – marching the step, there’s one Nazi who I knew my father – I – I knew very well because he lived across the street, his father owned a bar there, he lived across the street from my uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s84">And his son was there, he was – he was in charge, he was called an SS, you know, Nazi.</span> <span id="s85">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Was he German, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No, Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: [indecipherable] Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Hungarian, yeah.</span> <span id="s90">And he, if somebody didn’t po – go one step, he would go ahead and kick him with his boot, and I’m te – the point on his boot, he had a piece of iron welded on, a pointed piece of iron, and when he kicked you, you – I remember, he kicked me several times because I wasn’t going in steps and I felt – when he kicked me I f – th-the pain was so miserable, so painful, I – for years I was suffering with it, I remember it.</span> <span id="s91">And I couldn’t do nothing because if I would have tried to hit him back or do something like that, I – I – probably would have been the end of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So it was around 1942 that things got really bad, or before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: It – it started, it started to get bad at that time, but it wasn’t really that bad, that – we could still go out shopping and – and do the things.</span> <span id="s94">We had to be very careful, but it’s just like we live today in this country, I’ll tell you, I b – you’re afraid to walk the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: And it’s not that the criminals and crooks are roaming the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: And the anti-Semitism increased when the –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: And before 1942 you did not experience –</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Oh, you did experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Oh yes, we had experience.</span> <span id="s103">There was a lot of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s104">Too many Jew ha – Jew haters.</span> <span id="s105">That – that was part of it that I don’t know, somehow th-the parents taught the children to hate Jews, that the Jews were Christ killers and the Jews have got everything.</span> <span id="s106">The Jews have got – are rich, which was not true, not all the Jews were rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did you come from a wealthy family?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So, you did not have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I had a – a few of them.</span> <span id="s111">I had a few who lived in my neighborhood, I – we lived in a – in a – in a neighborhood with – which was maybe 40 percent Jewish and 60 percent non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s112">But everybody lived in peace, we – my mother had a friend across the street, she was a Hungarian woman, she had two sons, and she would come on Saturdays, turn on the stove for us for Shabbat, because – and then she did a lot of things that we weren’t allowed to do.</span> <span id="s113">She was so nice, we would give her stuff for that, you know, in return.</span> <span id="s114">My mother used to be close friends with her, but when the time came, during the Nazi regime, they – they were afraid to ta – even talk to us.</span> <span id="s115">They were afraid to say anything because th – if you – if we comu – communicated with it – with – with them, with a non-Jew, we probably – they probably would lock them up too, because they were not allowed to do that no more.</span> <span id="s116">They were even – th-the goyim, the non-Jews were afraid to communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: So you came from a religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: From an Orthodox family.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: How old were you when – when the war broke?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: The br – war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Broke out, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: My God, I cannot go back.</span> <span id="s127">I don’t even know what – which year the bro – the war broke out because we didn’t feel it that much, we – we didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So it was really only in what, ’42, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: ’42 - ’43, something like that.</span> <span id="s130">Maybe – I think Hitler occupied Czechoslo – part of Czechoslovakia in 1941 and I don’t know the – when the next time he ch – occupied.</span> <span id="s131">But we had si – before the Nazis took it over, we had Ukraines took it over.</span> <span id="s132">There – there was two or three different groups, they took it over, we had to learn different languages.</span> <span id="s133">Then the Hungarian took it over and they were – they were really in charge because they were – they were working together with – with the Germans.</span> <span id="s134">I remember in – my father, who we – we got milk from an lo – next door neighbor for many years, and when, in 1943 we weren – we weren’t allowed to do that, but we did it anyway because we had to go just to the next door neighbor, who broo – took off a couple boards from our backyard fence and we went through.</span> <span id="s135">But we had, across the street there were two sisters and a brother who lived th – a-at – at – and they – they could see us from the second floor that we were getting milk from our next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s136">They reported my father to the police.</span> <span id="s137">They picked up my pro – the police picked up my father and they took him j – to jail.</span> <span id="s138">M-My mother was hoping that they’re not going to beat him u-up, you know, they’re just going to take him to jail.</span> <span id="s139">But after two weeks he came back, he came back with his black eyes, his whole face was just black.</span> <span id="s140">They beat him up all the time and – and his beard was chopped up to pieces.</span> <span id="s141">So that – that was one and it’s – it – it was so many – I mean, it’s hard to believe what was going on.</span> <span id="s142">These thing you could see, things are just coming to a point where people were afraid – we were, as a Jew was afraid if – they were afraid to go out on the street.</span> <span id="s143">Everyone taken, just grabbed from the street and taken away someplace, you disappeared or – nobody knew where you le – where – where – where you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: When were you required to wear a Jewish star?</span> <span id="s145">Was it during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, during that time.</span> <span id="s147">We – 1943, we had to wear a yellow star or yellow armband if we went out to the shopping, or – or go food shopping or go anyplace, we had to wear that star.</span> <span id="s148">Also, in – I think I’ve – I’ve mentioned about this trainer who trained Jewish boys, that Nazi would train Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s149">We – we had to – not only did he kick us for – when we – wh-when we went in – in steps, but he also wi – made us climb a ladder that was about three feet low from the top to get up on the – on top of a barn.</span> <span id="s150">We had to climb up there on top and we – in order to reach it, we had to go pull ourselves up.</span> <span id="s151">And order – if we came down, we didn’t catch the ladder, we would step on it and we would just go back down on our back and the ladder would fall on our back, on stones on the bottom and it was hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Was that in school, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No, that was on th – on – on a field – football field that we – we had that training.</span> <span id="s154">There was no school in there.</span> <span id="s155">That was away from everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How come you were part of that group?</span> <span id="s157">A: Because they ti – picked up all the th – they got orders, all the Jewish boys from a certain age, you’ve got – you gotta come to Leventher(ph) they called it.</span> <span id="s158">Leventher(ph), Leventher(ph) that – I don’t know that’s Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s161">And tha-that’s what they called the – they asked all the – those Jewish boys should meet at this and this place.</span> <span id="s162">So I met them.</span> <span id="s163">My brother was already in the la – at la – in the labor camp at that time.</span> <span id="s164">My father was also in the labor camp for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Tell us about – about your father and brother being sent to labor camp.</span> <span id="s166">When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: That also happened sometimes at the end of fo – 1943.</span> <span id="s168">My father was drafted first t-to the ar – to the labor army, labor camp, to – to labor work.</span> <span id="s169">Before that he served two or three years, he fought on the battlefields.</span> <span id="s170">He had guns and rifles with him, he – he fought like a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: For who?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: For – for the enemy, whoever the enemy was.</span> <span id="s173">I don’t know who they fought.</span> <span id="s174">I wasn’t maybe on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: On the – on the side of whom did you fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I don’t – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s177">I – tho-those days I don’t know.</span> <span id="s178">That wasn’t during the – during the Nazi occupation, no.</span> <span id="s179">But that was before sometimes he may have war – fought for – with the Russians or Ukrainians, I have got no idea, but I was too young to know about that.</span> <span id="s180">But what happened is, he fought before he would – he was – he was in the army.</span> <span id="s181">He got a rifle and ammunition, he fought like a soldier.</span> <span id="s182">Because he was Jewish, they put him to work cutting down – they gave him an axe and a saw and he was cutting down trees, chopping them up and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: That was in 1940 – end of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: And your brother, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: And my brother went also in 1944, the beginning of 1940 – he was drafted and we heard from him only once.</span> <span id="s187">My mother sent him some baked cookies and it was returned to – they couldn’t find him no more, he was gone.</span> <span id="s188">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: When was the last time you saw your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: The last time I’ve seen him – you mean bef – 1944?</span> <span id="s191">The – before, oh about four or five weeks before Pesach.</span> <span id="s192">And Pesach came – we – we had – first day of Pesach was April – April 1944.</span> <span id="s193">Table was set, everything was there except my brother Michael and all my whole family was together, except my brother Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: And your father was with you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: He was with me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Was he back from the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: He was back from the labor camp, and he – oh yeah, that – w-we – the table was set, we were [indecipherable] the best food was set up on the table.</span> <span id="s200">All the family was sitting, my two sisters, three brothers and my parents were all sitting at the table and when my father started to make kiddush, he cried.</span> <span id="s201">He said, he would cr – he – he – in the middle of the kiddush he broke down and cried.</span> <span id="s202">He said these words, he says, who knows whether we will be together again next year.</span> <span id="s203">We cried with him, as children, you know, and my – my older sister tried to c-calm us down, but we cried just like after a funeral.</span> <span id="s204">It was a very sad Pesach.</span> <span id="s205">The next day we were taken from – we – two SS – Hungarian s – Nazis came and gave us orders that we have to – we must be out of the house by – it was in two hours.</span> <span id="s206">That’s – something like that, or less.</span> <span id="s207">They were waiting outside.</span> <span id="s208">We packed up everything as soon as we could, you know, and my m – we wen – went – they took us at – at gunpoint, they took us to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: And was the ghetto in Chust?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, the ghetto was in Chust.</span> <span id="s211">They blocked off a few, two or three streets.</span> <span id="s212">We had a synagogue in there, we were blocked off, and a tomatorah(ph).</span> <span id="s213">And they packed in everybody as much as they could without food, water, or toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s214">I remember I was inside, there wasn’t even an-any room to sit.</span> <span id="s215">They selected a few – th-th-they selected two leaders, two well reputable Jewish leaders in the – in th – from the Jewish community to run the – the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Do you remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Ramel(ph) Moskov(ph), but I don’t remember the other one.</span> <span id="s218">Moskov(ph) was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: And they were in charge how to run the ghetto.</span> <span id="s221">We – they selected some running boys.</span> <span id="s222">They selected running boys for – to, you know, take messa – like for instance, mine – my job was, as a running boy, a few running boys, we got passes that we could go out 24 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So you were a messenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: A messenger, yeah.</span> <span id="s225">My – my job was, as a messenger, to take messages to the sergeant who was in charge.</span> <span id="s226">Anything that came in and it went out, he had to sign it.</span> <span id="s227">And every time I would – needed something to sign, I had to run to the – to two bars, wa – he was in one of the two bars.</span> <span id="s228">Sometimes so drunk he di – ji – didn't even look at a paper, he just signed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So in other words, the day after Passover, you had to pack your suitcases and move to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Whatever we could get, that’s right.</span> <span id="s231">Mo-Move at gunpoint, we got to go to ba – ghetto, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Could you tell us about the conditions in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s234">The conditions in the ghetto was, everybody was sitting with a little bundle, whatever they took along, on the floor.</span> <span id="s235">Leaning over next to one another, there wasn’t even any sitting room in the rooms.</span> <span id="s236">And with no water, no toilet facilities, only i – what the synagogue had and there was outside one only.</span> <span id="s237">Then the rest of it, the food, which was available, we, the messengers got okay from the sergeant that we can go to different Jewish homes and pick up all the good e – good stuff, like they had stuff in jars, you know, with the – for the – for the living.</span> <span id="s238">So we picked up all that stuff from home, brought it over to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s239">That’s only thing that we had to eat.</span> <span id="s240">Then also, some of the ink – all – all – people in the – in the ghetto, including my father, beca – sat down with me and they told me e – that I am – I can go out 24 hours a day, I’ve got the pass.</span> <span id="s241">N-Next – around the corner the – from the building, from the synagogue, there is a – a – there was a Jewish store by the go – non-Jew took it over.</span> <span id="s242">And it’s a grocery store and he gets some breads every day, I don’t know how many, 15 - 20 loaf, whatever.</span> <span id="s243">If – they asked me I should ask him if they co – would sell some bread f-for us and we’ll pay the price, there’s no problem for money.</span> <span id="s244">I talked to the – to owner, he okayed it.</span> <span id="s245">I used to get from him six, eight loaves of breads and I would put them under my jacket on both sides and wait for the – for the guards to turn their faces away.</span> <span id="s246">And some of us knew already – somebody knew that I’m gonna come there with the breads to the window and they saw me coming, they opened up the window fast, and I just threw it in one, two, three and I took off.</span> <span id="s247">We have been done – we have done that every single day.</span> <span id="s248">We had to – we had to gamble with our lives because that was part of survival.</span> <span id="s249">Whatever we could get in, the little babies and children could at least eat.</span> <span id="s250">And then I also –</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Did people work while they were living in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No,

id="s255">Q: How many people did they put in that ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh gosh, I would say there were several hundred in there.</span> <span id="s257">They would – they had different places, two ghettoes, you know.</span> <span id="s258">A little further up, oh about 10 - 15 blocks, they had another section you had some more ghetto – another ghetto.</span> <span id="s259">But that was small places, you know, they put them together in the th – independent on the neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s261">And how long did you stay in that ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Oh, stayed there for about three weeks, and in the meantime, while I was – while I was in th – in the – whi-while I had the 24 hours pass, I – I was taking food to two girls, and th-they were locked up in jail because they were – their parents were born in a – in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s263">They were Czechs – Czechs sa – citizens.</span> <span id="s264">The girls were born in Hungary, because the parents lived in Hungary for awhile, and that’s where those two 16 years old girl were born.</span> <span id="s265">They were locked up because they didn’t – they were not citizens of – of – of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s266">I do –</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Was it Czechoslovakia or Hungary at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: At tha – that time was Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: A Hungarian occupation, yeah, was occupied by Hungary.</span> <span id="s271">And I used to take them to the jail some food from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s272">There were times I had to wait, cause I ha – was sitting on a bench waiting for the guards to open up the ga – the – the – the jail.</span> <span id="s273">And one day while I was sitting on the bench, I saw two S – two Nazis brought in a young Jewish fellow with payos and – and black – a black robe and hat, and they marched him with their bayonets, they kept on poking him in the back to go upstairs to the second floor.</span> <span id="s274">It didn’t take more than 20 seconds, he was running in st – he jumped over th-the – the railing and he fell on the concrete floor right next to me.</span> <span id="s275">He sp – I got sprayed – I got sprayed with blood all over my clothes and face.</span> <span id="s276">I was – I found out the reason why he killed himself.</span> <span id="s277">They gave him the firing squad because he was not a citizen of Czechoslovakia, he was from Hungary.</span> <span id="s278">Munkash(ph).</span> <span id="s279">So the-then also –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: But it was under Hungarian rule at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yeah, but he was not a citizen, he was a Munkash(ph).</span> <span id="s282">I-It was – you see, a lot of them would escape from one place to another.</span> <span id="s283">Czechoslovakia was occupied so much, and then the hu – Hungary was o – wa – had the other part.</span> <span id="s284">But some of – later on the Hungarians just moved in, collaborated with visis – an – with the SS, with the Germans.</span> <span id="s285">But it was still part – was Hungary and part of was Czechoslovakia at that time.</span> <span id="s286">Then things changed again, Ukraines took it over.</span> <span id="s287">It was a mess, mess up.</span> <span id="s288">I also took some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: That was while you were in the ghetto when you took the food [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s291">Nobody could go out, only unless you had a pass.</span> <span id="s292">Then I also carried some food to a synagogue where some professionals were locked up.</span> <span id="s293">One day I came to – brought some food to them and I knocked on the door in the synagogue, to the wooden doors and two SS came out – I mean two Nazis came out to the door with their rifles and bayonets and pointing at me he says, go away, don’t come back any more.</span> <span id="s294">They says, no more food, no more food, don’t come back.</span> <span id="s295">While the door was open, I saw a string of bodies hanging upside down on their feet – from their feet from the ceiling.</span> <span id="s296">I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.</span> <span id="s297">That was the last time I went there.</span> <span id="s298">Then –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Were you with your family together at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s301">Yes, yes, my family was there together but I was – I was most of the time in and out because of messages and the – thing – things

weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Three weeks, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: After three weeks they killed the two ghetto leaders.</span> <span id="s314">We heard that two days before we were – that they killed the ghetto leaders, that we were going to be going to – to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s315">The reason why they killed them, so they don’t talk, because they knew what’s going to be next.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: And they marched out at gunpoint to the ghetto – I mean, from the ghetto to the railroad

were on each train, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I – we never counted it.</span> <span id="s344">I don’t even know how many cars were there.</span> <span id="s345">All I know is

stayed there til they repaired the railroad tracks, and we took off.</span> <span id="s357">After we got to – we came early in the morning to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Could you describe what happened when you arrived in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s360">When we arrived to Auschwitz it was dark, pitch dark, there was no lights.</span></p>

place we could – I could see big chimneys firing up, you could see spitting fire from the chimneys, real tall chimneys, heavy smoke, and the smell was awful.</span> <span id="s366">You could smell like burning flesh, but I – we never thought that – that would be Jewish flesh.</span> <span id="s367">And we waited there for awhile in the cars and all of a sudden the lights went on.</span> <span

right.</span> <span id="s402">He wanted to be with the family.</span> <span id="s403">He didn't want to –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So your mother, your father, your sisters and your brother went to one side?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: That’s correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And – mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s408">Then I – I w-went to

they gave us striped – blue striped, blue white striped uniforms, and a number.</span> <span id="s413">You’re gonna be – live – you – this is gon – you’re gonna live by that number.</span> <span id="s414">You have got no name, you have got no origin, all you have is a number.</span> <span id="s415">My number was 88959.</span> <span id="s416">And we – that number we – we lived –</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: But it was not tattooed on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, because they came in too many at one time in th-those transports, and they just had to ship them out, so wherever they could, they get – got them out.</span> <span id="s419">In the me – I-I guess they were losing the war, too, Germany, and the bombed – the bombed areas everywhere.</span> <span id="s420">They – they needed to clean up and it – to fix things.</span> <span id="s421">So they –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What happened to the stuff that you brought with you from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Th-They were t – it was all taken away at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s424">Every little thing they stripped you of, even – even your – everything, even your

someone told me she is there, I’ll tell you in a minute.</span> <span id="s431">So after we got – after we got the uniforms on, we were marched towards one of the barracks, not knowing where we were going.</span> <span id="s432">There was bunker, triple bunkers that we could – you could – you – you were there with – without a pillow, without a pillow and you were just i-in a sitting, half a dozen guys in one little corner and sticking out your head.</span> <span id="s433">While I was waiting there, someone told me from – who was from my city that my older sister was waving, she wants to say hello to me.</span> <span id="s434">I didn’t even know that she was up there.</span> <span id="s435">So I went – I went outside, and [indecipherable] going out and the prisoners are hollering at me, says don’t go to – with the [indecipherable] you – they are going to kill you, don’t go, don’t go.</span> <span id="s436">They kept on begging me don’t go.</span> <span id="s437">I just kept on going without thinking.</span> <span id="s438">I just kept on going.</span> <span id="s439">I came to the door and I open up the door, nobody’s out there and I see a – a young girl.</span> <span id="s440">There was a 10 foot tall electrified wire.</span> <span id="s441">And one of the girls, a young girl maybe about 12 - 14 years old was sitting in there, it was so – probably electrocuted – she was electrocuted, she was all t-tangled up like – like a – a snake.</span> <span id="s442">And I waved – I saw my sister in the big window, she was up on a hill.</span> <span id="s443">And I waved to her, she was off her – cut her hair off, she had nothing on, it was – looked terrible.</span> <span id="s444">I waved to her and she waved to me and all of a sudden I got hit with a lead pipe on the right side of my head.</span> <span id="s445">My skull was cracked in here.</span> <span id="s446">I got ou – I was bleeding like a to – you turn on a water faucet.</span> <span id="s447">And I da – da – I was – I staggered to th – my bunk, I turned around, I staggered to my bunk.</span> <span id="s448">And while I – I was going, I pushed in my end of my uniform from my – from my – that blue striped uniform, I pushed it in to stop the bleeding.</span> <span id="s449">I finally got to my bunk bed and I got in there.</span> <span id="s450">And I was lucky, the next day those people who were like me, they – they knocked off and they put them in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s451">They just didn’t – whatever they could get, they would kill people, no matter what – a lead pipe th-th – killed one, two, three people.</span> <span id="s452">So I came into the – I went to the barrack at – luckily, next day, or a couple days later, I was shipped to the Warsaw th – ghetto.</span> <span id="s453">The Warsaw bomb ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: So how long were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: In Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s456">A few days, a few

no.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Could you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yes, I’ll be glad to.</span> <span id="s471">We arrived to Auschwitz – I mean to, excuse me, we arrived to Warsaw and they had built cement block – cement blocks bara – barracks.</span> <span id="s472">The barracks had bunkers and we – we had one blanket to – for each prisoner.</span> <span id="s473">We used to pray whenever we could, in the evening especially after work, we would [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s474">And we – while we were praying, we had one or two of the boys, Jewish boys, watching in case the kapo, which was a killer, would – if – he hated – he would kill the prisoners or do harm to him no matter whether he – they did something or not – we did something wrong or not.</span> <span id="s475">One day we were standing the Amidah and all of us jumped in a bed, we kept on orlay(ph), orlay(ph), we’d – we’d t-tell him to r-run.</span> <span id="s476">This older man in there, maybe about 55, he was standing o-on the – on the – he was st – he was standing on the wall, and he was shockling(ph) – you know, he was – he was standing the Amidah.</span> <span id="s477">We told him to – to move, he wouldn’t move, because the Torah says you’re not allowed to move your feet when you stand the Amidah.</span> <span id="s478">So the kapo comes and puts in his brass knuckles and gets ahold on the man in the back while he was still standing the Amidah and turns him around and punches him in the face with the nu – brass knuckles.</span> <span id="s479">He threw him against the cement block and as he bounced – the head bounced back, he was punc – re-punching him again.</span> <span id="s480">Constantly his eyes were black, his face was chopped up like a hamburger, you couldn’t recognize the face.</span> <span id="s481">He just kept on beating him, he had big [indecipherable] he just kept on pounding him.</span> <span id="s482">He had a – his fa – that – that man had a 16 years old son, his son was watching how his father got killed like that.</span> <span id="s483">And there was nothing we could do, because the minute you made a move, you w – all of us were gone.</span> <span id="s484">They had – Jewish life would – didn’t mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Were there any people from Chust in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yes, yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s487">There were – there were quite a few of them in there.</span> <span id="s488">I don’t know how many survived.</span> <span id="s489">I knew one of them who lives – a Solomon(ph) who lives in New York, but he was an older man, maybe he’s – he’s in the ground by now.</span> <span id="s490">That’s why I’m trying to tell my testimony about my experience in ge – in the Holocaust, because the time is running out for me too.</span> <span id="s491">I don’t know how long I’m gonna be here and the world must know what wi – how six million died and how much suffering they – they endured.</span> <span id="s492">Well, while we worked – while we were i-in the Warsaw bomb ghetto, we – we –</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Did you know about the Warsaw uprising, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span> <span id="s495">No, we didn’t know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: But when you got there, did you find –</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: We found out, that’s correct, we found out what we are doing there because it’s – that si – the big sign said Warsaw whatever, I forgot the name, but it was a big sign, big sign, it said Warsaw ghetto, or whatever.</span> <span id="s498">Then we worked in there to clean up the ghetto and whatever usable items w-we found, we shipped it to Germany to be reused.</span> <span id="s499">We cleaned up the bricks from the bombed a-area and they sh-shipped it to Germany to u – to use it for s – b-building other ammunition factories, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: While we worked there we found pots and pans.</span> <span id="s502">We found dead – skeletons, older people and they’re with their beards still on.</span> <span id="s503">With the sheitel, some of the women with the sheitels were hanging next – were right next to them and they’re just like you – they just took it off.</span> <span id="s504">We – once we found six skeletons, young children huddled together.</span> <span id="s505">We – there – it was so unbelievable that they were – it could have been a family, although some of these children tried to survive, they held together for their – during the bombing or they just starved like that.</span> <span id="s506">They – they – I remember we used to take off their shinbones and – and we used to guess how old these children were.</span> <span id="s507">I’ve got now a grandson, and you know, ke-keep on looking at his shinbone here – about a year and a half old – and I keep on looking at the shinbones and I said, my God, th-that-that – that’s pretty close what I’ve seen when we – th-there must have been some – sometimes about a year or so, all those kids.</span> <span id="s508">And we used to – one day at work –</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What sort of work did you do apart from just cleaning the –</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Cleaning the bricks and – and moving dirt.</span> <span id="s511">Dump – pour – throwing it from one prisoner to another, to a – to a cart that the ge – Polish people came in and took it to the railroad.</span> <span id="s512">And we would throw it down from the top of – of a hill, like from the bombed parts, maybe make a – a chain and we throw it one – for one another, til it go-got to the cart, to – with the horse and buggy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Were you organized?</span> <span id="s514">Was there some kind of organization from the Jewish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: N-No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Nobody was a leader, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: You’re not – you wouldn’t allowed to have – be a leader, because the minute they heard you were a leader, you were dead.</span> <span id="s518">We did it between ourselves.</span> <span id="s519">We talked our language, sometimes Hebrew, the different words so they don’t understand, like orlay(ph).</span> <span id="s520">We – the – somebody – the kapo would come or – or some SS, we – it’s orlay(ph) orlay(ph) orlay(ph), that means keep on moving, moving, you know, or – or some other words we used to use, I forgot already.</span> <span id="s521">But we – on the way – one day –</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Can you describe a typical day in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: A typical day, yeah, what time did you get up in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Oh yeah, w-we got up in the m – in the morning we used to get up around 4:30.</span> <span id="s526">We have black coffee and a piece of bread, cornbread and we marched through the – most of the time we marched through the forest so nobody could see us.</span> <span id="s527">And we came – we came – it took us about a half an hour to get to march there, to – to the bomb ghetto.</span> <span id="s528">Once we were there, everybody was at sh – working in different th-things.</span> <span id="s529">There were so many things going on that – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: – that you would get up at four in the morning and he came into the workplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: That’s right, yeah.</span> <span id="s532">And once on the way going to work, we wo – sometimes, once or twice a week, we would see German trucks loaded with partisans.</span> <span id="s533">How we knew they were partisans, while we were marching si – the back cover opened up from the wind, it would just open up, I could see them.</span> <span id="s534">They were blindfolded with black rags, their eyes and tied up in the back.</span> <span id="s535">I remember seeing some of the faces, you know, turning; they heard the marching, you know, the noises from marching.</span> <span id="s536">They turned towards us, and I said to myself, God, I wish, oh, I wish I could help you.</span> <span id="s537">I don’t know – I – I – I – I felt so bad.</span> <span id="s538">I wish I could have gone over and just blown out the whole thing with them so th-they wouldn’t take them.</span> <span id="s539">And then they would take them to – to the – to a place which was right in our – on the ou-outside of the – from our camp where we – where w – and – and there was a slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s540">They put up a cement block outsi – you know, it’s – was outside, but a – a wall, four walls.</span> <span id="s541">And they would take in those prisoners, I mean, the partisans, shoot them out.</span> <span id="s542">In the evening you’d hear the machine guns going for 10 - 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s543">They – they wou – in fact, when we used to – sometimes when it rained and the ground was wet, and we walked in their direction, my wooden shoes had a line, like red – red ink – red – red – red paint, but it was blood.</span> <span id="s544">The blood was – was soaked over the ground in there, they used to kill so many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: And you were taken at four in the morning to work and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: We quit around f – when – later in the evening, about eight, 10 hours sometimes.</span> <span id="s547">It depends – I forgot already, but I know usually eight, 10 hours a day we [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s548">When it start to get dark, we w – took off, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Were you given some food at lunchtime?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No.</span> <span id="s551">No food.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Only breakfast?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No, only bre – wa – only thing you took along with you, if you had a piece of bread – I remember I used to take along a piece of bread in my pocket, sew it in because there was no pockets and save it.</span> <span id="s554">When I was ready to – to faint from hunger, I would take a little crumb and put it on my tongue and just keep on sucking on it to keep me alive.</span> <span id="s555">And you know, one day, there was one a – one interesting i-i-incident.</span> <span id="s556">I – I was walking, you know, I was like in an – in an area where I – I was digging up bricks to be cleaned up.</span> <span id="s557">And all of a sudden I got hit on my ankle with a piece of brick.</span> <span id="s558">And I turned around – that hurted – I turned around and I look around, I didn’t see nobody.</span> <span id="s559">I said oh, forget it, maybe somebody just in a joke did something.</span> <span id="s560">Then suddenly I see little pebbles flying around me and I got hit again in my foot, a little higher.</span> <span id="s561">I turned around, I said to myself, oh boy, that – I got to find out who that is.</span> <span id="s562">I turned around and I see somebody sticking – somebody was sticking out the – the head from under the rubble, just enough to see his head.</span> <span id="s563">He had black hair on and he was pointing with his finger to – to follow him, to ca – to go – to escape.</span> <span id="s564">Now, I made two steps and I suddenly jumped back, I said to myself, oh my God, I remember I got beaten up by a – the lead pipe.</span> <span id="s565">I cannot take that pain no more.</span> <span id="s566">I’m still hurting from it, I’m still in pain.</span> <span id="s567">And I didn – wouldn’t go, but he was trying to ma – make me escape.</span> <span id="s568">A lot of the prisoners escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: But tha – tha – they escape and probably they caught them, because they kept on killing them all the time.</span> <span id="s571">Yes, so then, from there I had the – the Russians started t-to – we – di – oh yeah, you used to get so many of the partisans, so many captured of the partisans that they decided to build a crematorium, a small one.</span> <span id="s572">First we thought it’s going to be a bakery.</span> <span id="s573">We were waiting and waiting, we were asking – I know the people who bou – built it were Katz(ph), they lived in my city.</span> <span id="s574">A young son and a fath – it’s a father and son.</span> <span id="s575">We’re waiting for it to be finished, and here – everybody’s talking a bakery, a bakery, what else could it be?</span> <span id="s576">He finally was finished and it was a – before we were supposed to be liquidating the camp, and w-we found out it was a small crematorium.</span> <span id="s577">It looked like a – a bakery.</span> <span id="s578">They killed the father and son first, they bur-burned them, they were the first ones to burn.</span> <span id="s579">We, at two – two days later the commanding officer told us that we’re going to go – we’re going to liquidate the camp, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Do you remember the name of the commander of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No, no, I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s582">My head were blank after that, I got hit with a lead pipe and I had – from hunger and thirst we were just – you couldn’t think straight.</span> <span id="s583">Okay, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Yeah, before you had to liquidate the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Oh yeah, before we – before we – yeah, he – the – th-the commanding officer told us that we’re going to liquidate the camp next day.</span> <span id="s586">The next day came, they asked all those prisoners who cannot walk will go by truck, about a hundred of them, moved out, they marched them straight to the slaughterhouse, and we – while we were standing in role call, they were – we could hear the machine guns going that killed them all.</span> <span id="s587">They hung six prisoners on wooden poles, and they’d sa – th-the commanding officer said, the reason why they’re – that we hung them is because they de – tried to escape yesterday.</span> <span id="s588">We found out this – this is go – going to be a – called Warsaw death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: What – when was the – I mean, how long –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: In aug –</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: – were you in the – in the – in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I-In August i – we started out in August sometimes, that i – one thing I – I will – somehow somebody told us that, one of the SS, what month it is in.</span> <span id="s593">August – sometimes beginning of August.</span> <span id="s594">It was boiling hot outside, the sun was baking us.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So [indecipherable] 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: 1944.</span> <span id="s597">That’s go –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: So you were there for how long?</span> <span id="s599">Two months?</span> <span id="s600">A: Abou – ab – yeah, about two, three –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Three – two, three months?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: – two, three months, because – that’s right.</span> <span id="s603">I cannot really tell the time because [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: We marched day and night without food or water.</span> <span id="s606">Our lips were black like coal from the hydra –</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: How many people were marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Oh, there was – must have been – when we got there from Auschwitz, we were about 1100.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t know how – after all the killings and so on, maybe about seven, eight hundred, we march –</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: That started marching towards [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yeah, marching, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s612">Without food or water, in the sun.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: And that was because the Russians were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yeah, the Russians were – started to move in, they were – they were shelling the area and they – they were gonna – they’re getting closer and they were – liquidated the camp.</span> <span id="s615">So we – we were marching day and night without food or water and some of the prisoners co – collapsed.</span> <span id="s616">They would pick them up, put them in carts and put them in – then on trucks and ship them to Dachau.</span> <span id="s617">Or we buried them off the road.</span> <span id="s618">I remember where I buried three bodies, three corpse, off the road near a bridge.</span> <span id="s619">We put them on top one another, we dug deep enough to – just to put in the bodies on top one another.</span> <span id="s620">One was still alive on top on – he was begging us, please [speaks foreign language here] he says [speaks foreign language].</span> <span id="s621">I’m still living.</span> <span id="s622">Why are you trying to kill me?</span> <span id="s623">Why are you two bur – why are you burying me alive?</span> <span id="s624">He was stretching out a hand to us, and the SS kept on hollering.</span> <span id="s625">He says, cover him up, cover him up.</span> <span id="s626">We covered him up, we had to take off.</span> <span id="s627">We marched again.</span> <span id="s628">They had – their fa – con – I mean, the – the – th-the-the prisoners are just falling like – it’s unbelievable, they’re just collapsing from – from hunger and thirst and dehydration.</span> <span id="s629">You can survive a lot longer from not eating food, but if you don’t have any water – try to go for water in the sun all day long, marching, without the hat, nothing, just in your uniform.</span> <span id="s630">We came to a place near – near a bridge in the – some of the prisoners tried to escape.</span> <span id="s631">They jumped over the bridge, tried to escape or to get – to get some water.</span> <span id="s632">They send in the German Shepherds after them, and they – after the germ – th-the shepherds found them, they went ahead and used the machine gun, boom, boom, boom, they killed them in there.</span> <span id="s633">Then we – we used to get – one day it was raining hard and we were told to go into a forest.</span> <span id="s634">We went into that forest and we slept on the ground without coverage, we didn’t have nothing, just our uniform.</span> <span id="s635">But, I mean it’s th-the – typhus developed and they were dying all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: How many days did you march, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Gosh, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s638">I don’t know, maybe four or five days, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s639">I’ve got no idea, just kept on – it was just – I was in another world, I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s640">When we stopped at that place, we were – some of the prisoners were digging with their spoons.</span> <span id="s641">We very seldom had spoons, we ate by the – our hands.</span> <span id="s642">I don’t know where they got the spoons, but they were digging the ground, where there’s – th-the ground, there wasn’t too far away from a lake.</span> <span id="s643">And we heard sometimes after midnight a huge roar, water, water, everybody’s running towards water, water, water.</span> <span id="s644">I came over to that place too, with the other prisoners and I see everybody’s grabbing handsful, it – from the ground it’s coming up water about – oh, about two, three feet, it’s jumping up, pop-popping up.</span> <span id="s645">I remember everybody was grabbing [indecipherable] the bottom had –</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: They were digging with their spoons to find water?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: To find water, yes, and they found it, came up enough.</span> <span id="s648">The-They – and suddenly everybody knew about it, the prisoners knew about it and they ran for water.</span> <span id="s649">Wi – I remember grabbing hands full of water with sand and stones and just shoving it into my throat, swallowing, choking myself on the stones.</span> <span id="s650">I couldn’t even – you know, it’s hard to believe that – that – we – we were crazy, we didn’t know, we were out of our minds.</span> <span id="s651">We didn’t know from life or death, we didn’t know what – who we are or where – what we are.</span> <span id="s652">We were just oh, completely out.</span> <span id="s653">We were – we were – something that it’s hard to believe that a human being can – can survive something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And you finally arrived in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, next day we took – marched again.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: We finally arrived to a place where we were waiting for a train.</span> <span id="s658">It was called Kutno.</span> <span id="s659">Kutno at the – at the German Polish border.</span> <span id="s660">German – Kutno at the German Polish border, yeah.</span> <span id="s661">And we were waiting there for a train to arrive to take us someplace.</span> <span id="s662">It was pouring, it was raining hard.</span> <span id="s663">First when we got there, we stripped all the bark from the trees.</span> <span id="s664">Anything that was available, branches, we just ate.</span> <span id="s665">Grass, whatever we can get ahold on, anything.</span> <span id="s666">We were starved, we didn’t have nothing to –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: How many days did you march to – to get to Kutno?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Oh, I have got no idea.</span> <span id="s669">Four or five days, I can’t – don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: And all that time without food?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Without food, without water, skeletons were walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Oh my –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Skeletons were walking.</span> <span id="s674">There was nothing – black lips, with – with dying there’s no breathe – you can’t hardly breathe, you’re so weak.</span> <span id="s675">And we – we waited in that forest, it was pouring and we were – were in the mud.</span> <span id="s676">We were trying to huddle together so we can get our body temperature warm from one another.</span> <span id="s677">That’s only heat we had and the prisoners were starting to die from typhus and all the temperature, they had high temperatures from being sick, and they were dying like f – by the dozens.</span> <span id="s678">We could not bury them fast enough.</span> <span id="s679">Finally, two days later a train arrived, a freight train arrived.</span> <span id="s680">They packed in in the boxcars a hundred or more people in one boxcar.</span> <span id="s681">I remember we were standing like this, in the upright position like sn – stacked herring.</span> <span id="s682">There was no air, no water, no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: No sanitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No sanitation.</span> <span id="s685">They boarded up the little windows from outside, what the freight gets.</span> <span id="s686">There was – it was choking inside.</span> <span id="s687">We were tearing our heads apart, we were trying to kill ourselves, but we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s688">We were tearing our eyes out, we were ki – pounding on our heads.</span> <span id="s689">We ti – we couldn’t – we wanted to die, but there was no way then there, we couldn’t even take a little step to get a – to do something, to – to kill ourselves.</span> <span id="s690">They just kept on falling and dying, from the weakness some of them collapsed, then the al – the smell was awful.</span> <span id="s691">And we started to get more room once some of them passed out or just – just couldn’t do any more, couldn’t get it – go on any more.</span> <span id="s692">We finally arrived to Dachau death camp.</span> <span id="s693">I remember seven of us were moved out – were – were – came out from that freight car.</span> <span id="s694">The rest of them were half dead or dead, from the 110.</span> <span id="s695">We gets – as we came down, there was six feet of a drop.</span> <span id="s696">The SS kept on sh – pulling us, you know, gra – grabbing us with the rifle butts, hitting us and he – come on, come on [indecipherable] you, and I remember they grabbed me from – they grabbed me fr – with one hand, and I fell on my left shoulder upside down, because the six foot drop.</span> <span id="s697">And I couldn’t move, I kept on crawling, they kept on pounding on my back with the rifle butts.</span> <span id="s698">And just [speaks foreign language].</span> <span id="s699">And th – I kept on running.</span> <span id="s700">I kept on getting up and kept on going up.</span> <span id="s701">I didn’t want to die ab – I always remember what my father told me at the Auschwitz, be strong, don’t give up, we will meet again.</span> <span id="s702">I just kept on going.</span> <span id="s703">We finally came into the – inside the Dachau entrance on the – it was cement floor.</span> <span id="s704">I remember seeing dozens of skeletons, their eyes in, you know, you could hardly see like eyeballs where goo – they were just sunk in.</span> <span id="s705">And these skeletons, all in black lips, all they were moaning and moaning and moan – I remember I ca – I fell o – I collapsed on my knees and I passed out, and there I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s706">When I woke up I suddenly remembered, oh I mi – I got to meet my father again, I better be – I got to be stronger, I got to keep on going.</span> <span id="s707">I got up and moved around a little bit, here and there, and I don’t know, I – all of a sudden, I dr – don’t remember any more to – what happened in Dachau, I wounded up in Landsberg lager s – lager seven, camp seven.</span> <span id="s708">And that is where I was put on on a night shift to work at Mühldorf, that night shift to – to build the ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s709">We’d [indecipherable] we – we set a foundation, the foundation there.</span> <span id="s710">We used to work 10 – 10 hours a day.</span> <span id="s711">It was hard work.</span> <span id="s712">I remember one day one of the prisoners collapsed on the ramp with his sack of cement.</span> <span id="s713">The SS ran over – two SS ran over and pounded on his head with his rifle butt.</span> <span id="s714">And then they – they asked for – for the prisoners to help him put on this sandbag.</span> <span id="s715">I went ose – I was one of them, too, I went over and helped to put it up, and he couldn’t get up, he couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s716">They went ahead and asked some of the prisoners to take him upstairs and put him in the cement mixer.</span> <span id="s717">They put in his head in the cement mixer, and then they took him out, took him back to the – to the camp, to Dachau.</span> <span id="s718">But they just – just told him to put him in in there to grind him around a little bit.</span> <span id="s719">Then wa – there was a German – there was a German who used – what do you call these big machines?</span> <span id="s720">The cranes.</span> <span id="s721">He was digging ground in there, and he used to bake potatoes inside that – they – they used to have coal in there, he used to bake potatoes.</span> <span id="s722">He would always have a full loaded oven with potatoes.</span> <span id="s723">And we – if we get a chance, we ran over to him, he would give us four or five potatoes.</span> <span id="s724">It was like a steak, it was great.</span> <span id="s725">Hot, it was just burning, it was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s726">He told me once, he says, if they catch me, I hope the SS don’t report me to – to the – the higher authority, otherwise I’m no – I’m going to be punished.</span> <span id="s727">But the – a lot of the SS knew about it, they saw us doing it, you know, they saw what we’re doing.</span> <span id="s728">There was a – on the also, ag – not far away was a – was a garden of vegetables and so on.</span> <span id="s729">I remember we ran over there, break through the wire and we stole that.</span> <span id="s730">We kept on eating it while we were there.</span> <span id="s731">The minute we brought it in to – to the other prisoners, it was gone.</span> <span id="s732">In a minute, it was – it was gone, they tore at you, they kill you for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s733">So then, from there I was very weak and I said to myself, I got to ta – I’m – I’m never going to survive.</span> <span id="s734">I’ve got no energy and I cannot carry that cement.</span> <span id="s735">And I see where also some of the weak guy – people, they bring them in from work, put them in a death barrack.</span> <span id="s736">Still alive.</span> <span id="s737">No doctors, no nothing, no medicines.</span> <span id="s738">You – you cannot work, or your – something happens to you, there’s the death barrack, that’s your medicine, death.</span> <span id="s739">Death.</span> <span id="s740">I decided –</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: They didn’t kill them there, they just let them die?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Let them die.</span> <span id="s743">Let them die.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: That’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s746">So one day I came home from – from work and one of my friends told me that a friend of mine I used to work with together, you know, we – some of the times we used to – he is – th-they put him in the death barrack.</span> <span id="s747">I was anxious to find out who he is.</span> <span id="s748">They took me there to him and he – I saw, oh maybe about 40 or 50 bodies.</span> <span id="s749">He was hanging with his head down and actually li – looking at us that he is still alive.</span> <span id="s750">He was – he was upside-down like this.</span> <span id="s751">We couldn’t go too close because it was typhus in there.</span> <span id="s752">Everywhere you went in was a dangers you would pick up something.</span> <span id="s753">But I went away brokenhearted and I said to myself, I – that could be me next.</span> <span id="s754">I was – I was ready to cry and then I said to myself, oh no I better don’t cry, I may be here tomorrow.</span> <span id="s755">I decided that I’m going to steal some potatoes.</span> <span id="s756">It wasn’t too far away from a bunker, because I ca – I didn’t want to die, I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s757">One morning I went to the bunker.</span> <span id="s758">I tied up my pajamas, my – my – my uniform on the bottom and I went in the bunker, I filled up my pants full of potatoes.</span> <span id="s759">Some other p-prisoners encouraged me to do it too because they were going to give me a piece of bread and they were going to buy some butter for that.</span> <span id="s760">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Oh, you were bartering the – bartering the food that you got?</span> <span id="s762">You would exchange the potatoes for some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Potatoes for something else, yeah, like a piece of bread, or – or piece of bread or butter, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s764">Sometimes they will bring in some smuggling, something from outside, a candy or whatever.</span> <span id="s765">A cigarette.</span> <span id="s766">And I filled it up and all of a sudden I hear hoo, hoo, the sirens are going.</span> <span id="s767">I said, oh my God, this is the second siren already, I didn’t hear the first one.</span> <span id="s768">I must have been busy du – doing business in there big – I was a big businessman trying to figure out how much – how much I’m going to sell th-the potatoes for bread.</span> <span id="s769">And su-suddenly I – I started to run towards my barrack.</span> <span id="s770">I said, oh my God, this is the second one.</span> <span id="s771">Here, I wouldn’t give up the potatoes, I’m – this is my life.</span> <span id="s772">I wouldn’t give it up in ci – to let go the potatoes, I k – I k – held them in my – in my pants.</span> <span id="s773">I ran towards my barrack and I hear the lager – th-the commander is asking to go back in the barracks all the – all the Lagerfuhrers, all the – should go back in the – in the barracks and find the prisoner, dead or alive.</span> <span id="s774">I knew they were talking about me, so I kept on running towards my barrack.</span> <span id="s775">While they went inside, I kept on running to my – towards my barrack.</span> <span id="s776">I came to my barrack all out of breath, and we – my feet are just co – loaded, you know, I cannot even run, but I’m – I’m robbing the potatoes, so I’m looking like this, loaded.</span> <span id="s777">And I se – run into the second row and I’m standing, you know, attention.</span> <span id="s778">Everybody came out, the commander officer a-asked, count the men again, in your barrack.</span> <span id="s779">They counted, everybody was there.</span> <span id="s780">The commanding officer says, who just came in?</span> <span id="s781">Was quiet.</span> <span id="s782">He started with again – who just came in?</span> <span id="s783">The prisoner next to me pointed a finger at me.</span> <span id="s784">Well, they – they saw my pants loaded, they got ahold of me, took me in into a small [indecipherable] they asked – the officer asked one of the kapos in there, Killer, who used to be good doing the punishment, torturing.</span> <span id="s785">They got ahold of me, took me into a small locker room, on a heavy piece of wood, put me on there, tied up my hands in a bracket o-over my head, and my knees to a bracket.</span> <span id="s786">[indecipherable] I remember he kept on pounding on me with some kind of a heavy piece of wood, or a two by four.</span> <span id="s787">I remember screaming.</span> <span id="s788">I remember screaming, and that’s about all.</span> <span id="s789">I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s790">I woke up – I woke up in a – in a doghouse.</span> <span id="s791">I was – I woke up in a doghouse.</span> <span id="s792">I was crammed in with two other prisoners, one was dead and one was moaning.</span> <span id="s793">I don’t know how many days I was in there, because I was out, passed out.</span> <span id="s794">And one of the officers was – was inspecting – one of the officers was inspecting th-th-the – the camp and he came – when he went by there, he heard the moaning, he asked, who is in there, to open up.</span> <span id="s795">He saw us in there, gave him one look with my eyes can hardly open up, he says, let the ma – let the prisoners loose.</span> <span id="s796">I don’t know, first time, you know, so that they carried me in.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t know wi – the other prisoners, what they did with them, but they carried me into my barrack.</span> <span id="s798">I couldn’t walk because my back was all messed up.</span> <span id="s799">And the reason why they did that, because the officer gave the orders.</span> <span id="s800">Otherwise so they would put me in the ba – in the death barrack.</span> <span id="s801">They took me into the barrack and they told me I’ve got two days to recuperate and I have to go to work.</span> <span id="s802">In the meantime I asked for – from the Lagerfuhrers – I mean, the camp l-leader for some food.</span> <span id="s803">He said, I’ll give you some food.</span> <span id="s804">Did you get your – your piece of bread every day, and you know, at night time soup?</span> <span id="s805">I said, no, I didn’t get nothing.</span> <span id="s806">I didn’t get since I was there.</span> <span id="s807">He says, you were there eight days and y-you didn’t get nothing?</span> <span id="s808">He says, go to the shl – Lagerschreiber.</span> <span id="s809">The Lagerschreiber was the accountant who let in – who ope – when you opened up the gate, he counted the people coming in and going out.</span> <span id="s810">He made sure that everybody – that’s whats the – the – the Schreiber, the Lagerschreiber.</span> <span id="s811">And he – he told me to ask – he gave me my – my bread, everything, I should go and ask him for it.</span> <span id="s812">I went over and asked him for it, he came downstairs from his – from his booth upstairs and he came over and I told him what my barrack leader said.</span> <span id="s813">He got ahold of me like this, gave me a bloody mouth.</span> <span id="s814">I came back with a bleeding mouth.</span> <span id="s815">I went back and told – I told th-the – the lead – the ba – barrack leader what – what I got.</span> <span id="s816">He says, well I don’t know what – what to tell you, but I’ll try to help you.</span> <span id="s817">I’ll give you some of the barrels to lick out after – they were wooden barrels of soup.</span> <span id="s818">After everybody has the soup, I’ll give you to lick out the barrels.</span> <span id="s819">So I remember for a couple of days I kept on licking out the barrels.</span> <span id="s820">Spin – spin of – some of the wood would come off, you know, splinters, and I would just eat it like bread, I – like food, I didn’t even – I just swallowed everything what came in.</span> <span id="s821">And I got –</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: How come you didn’t get your normal rationing?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Because he ate – he sold it for – for cigarettes, the guy up on th-the scharl – Lagerschreiber.</span> <span id="s824">He did something with it.</span> <span id="s825">He – be – maybe he ate it, he sold it for cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: So how long were you in –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Landsberg, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s830">From there I was – I was told that I have ki – if I cannot go to work, some of the prisoners told me, if I go on a pa – role call, to stand straight, because they’re – they’re expecting – a couple days later, that one of the days they’re expecting a health inspector.</span> <span id="s831">So, I was standing straight, but of – of course, I couldn’t move my arm, I was sideways.</span> <span id="s832">And I was worried that if they get – the inspector sees me, I’m going to – either he’s going to say I’m not – no more good to work, they’re going to put me into the death barrack.</span> <span id="s833">But luckily there was no inspection that day.</span> <span id="s834">But they asked for volunteers.</span> <span id="s835">They asked for volunteers and we went to dig trenches for – for the German SS in the forest.</span> <span id="s836">We fixed the streets and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: In Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: In la – in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s839">Then we – they asked – the next day they asked again for volunteers, something else.</span> <span id="s840">I always hope there’s going to be better days.</span> <span id="s841">If I volunteer maybe I’ll get a better treatment or more food.</span> <span id="s842">I always hope for better, but I – I always gambled, and I was never – never had any luck.</span> <span id="s843">This time we – they took a transport, oh about, I – I – two, three truckloads.</span> <span id="s844">And we – they took us to Landshut camp.</span> <span id="s845">Landshut camp was a – a German ammunition place, they storage ammunition.</span> <span id="s846">They emptied out a few of the blocks – a few of the barracks they emptied out and they put in some of the prisoners in air – he – in case the American bombs – bombers bombed that area, they blow up, we’re going to get blown up in it too.</span> <span id="s847">In the meantime, the SS were there with their ammunition and we were there working also.</span> <span id="s848">We were at there, or we were at work.</span> <span id="s849">So we were taking by truck to a railroad s-sta – we were taking by trucks, not knowing where we were gonna go.</span> <span id="s850">Here we’re traveling through the forest –</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: That was from Landsberg to –</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: To Landshut.</span> <span id="s853">It’s a Landshut camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s854">It wasn’t too far away, but it’s called Landshut camp.</span> <span id="s855">Then we went down to, by truck, two truckloads went down to – through the forest, we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s856">We asked the – the SS, where are we – where are you taking us?</span> <span id="s857">They didn’t say where, they said, it’s none of your business.</span> <span id="s858">So we just – we were quiet and we were – th-they didn't hear a whisper.</span> <span id="s859">We go through different dark places and here is – we were just shooking up, with – they’re probably going to kill us someplace.</span> <span id="s860">We came a little closer, we see smoke going up.</span> <span id="s861">Uh-oh, there is the chimneys and there’s – there is another place where they kill people.</span> <span id="s862">We finally came, after 45 minutes or so, we ca – finally came to a place where there was – you could see civilians, homes, displayed stores.</span> <span id="s863">My God, we felt the – already relieved, oh, they’re not going to kill us, we – there’s something different here, w-we – we see it – I haven’t seen a – a woman for – for over a year.</span> <span id="s864">And here is a – I am staring at them, it’s a ma – it’s a pleasure.</span> <span id="s865">Then suddenly we’re cross – crossing over railroad tracks and we are – as we crawled over railroad tracks we see smoke coming up.</span> <span id="s866">Right away we thought, well, th-this is something different.</span> <span id="s867">We’re probably going to work here because they bombed – th-the trains are all bombed all over, smashed up railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s868">As we walked – we got out from the trucks.</span> <span id="s869">We walked towards the direction of where that bombing was.</span> <span id="s870">We saw aftr – a freight car opened up, one of the boxcars, spilled out white powder.</span> <span id="s871">We didn’t know what it was at that time.</span> <span id="s872">But we walked in that direction, and it was smoldering, that white powder.</span> <span id="s873">Then suddenly one of the guys, some of the guys started to smell like – they said it – they said it’s burning sugar.</span> <span id="s874">Just like that, they se – they said burning sugar.</span> <span id="s875">And there all of us, all the prisoners just started to run on that direction.</span> <span id="s876">We were falling on our faces.</span> <span id="s877">We kept on running and running and running.</span> <span id="s878">And we got there and sure enough, it was sugar.</span> <span id="s879">We kept on grabbing in handfuls hot sugar.</span> <span id="s880">I remember grabbing hands, boiling sugar, we just kept on shoving it in.</span> <span id="s881">My mouth was burning and my hands were peeling off, I just kept on shoving it in, and the SS were pounding on our heads with their – their rifle butts because we were eating the sugar.</span> <span id="s882">This time at least –</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: What exactly happened?</span> <span id="s884">You were taken to Landshut camp to work, and there was a bombing –</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: – that bombed that train and –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: That’s right, they needed to clean up, they needed work.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: They needed to clean up that –</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: – that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: That’s where they always used us, for places where they needed work, slavery.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And that’s where you – you got the sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: That’s right, we got the sugar, it felt so great.</span> <span id="s896">Even so, the – the par – the SS were pounding on our heads.</span> <span id="s897">Th-Th-Th – most of the time they pe – beat us for nothing.</span> <span id="s898">This time they beat us, at least we enjoyed something.</span> <span id="s899">So it felt good, but then we worked there, you know, tur-turning over th-the railroad cars and cleaning up the mess.</span> <span id="s900">Then we went back there again, and we worked on the railroad tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And where did you sleep in – at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: At night we went back to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: To Landshut?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: To – to Landshut camp, yes, Landshut camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s906">How far was that from Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh, about an hour drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: An hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Ab-About an hour drive from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: So how long were you in Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: In Landsberg, about th-three, four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Three, four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: And in Landshut?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Landshut?</span> <span id="s916">Oh, I don’t know, the – Landshut, it was very short time, maybe about three weeks, because th-th – let me just ke – go back again –</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: – because that’s something interesting.</span> <span id="s919">One day while we were working, the sirens were going, the American bombers came.</span> <span id="s920">They ri – the SS told us to run and the soldier ran – ru-run into the forest.</span> <span id="s921">We ran into the forest, a few minutes later we see the American bombers diving.</span> <span id="s922">We could see the bombs falling and we are so happy we are gonna be free by the Americans.</span> <span id="s923">We didn’t even know who the Americans were, but we were – we were happy about it.</span> <span id="s924">Then there was another time we came out to work, this same thing happened, the American bombers are again there.</span> <span id="s925">This time they’re blowing up the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s926">Everywhere you go they’re blowing the – everything is on fire.</span> <span id="s927">You don’t see a soul no place.</span> <span id="s928">After it was first finished, it was quieted down, some of the prisoners started to walk around as, you know, walked around to see what’s happening.</span> <span id="s929">As we walked through – we came over a – we walked over a railroad bridge, and on the left hand side there was about 24 small planes.</span> <span id="s930">The American bombers – we still watched how the American bombers were using that 44 machine gun, I don’t know what they call it, but they were machine gunning the – th-the gas tanks and blowing up all the – all – all those planes.</span> <span id="s931">I would – kept on watching them, how they were blowing up like –</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Which planes, the German planes?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: The German planes, they were popping up like – like popcorn, they were just blown up right after one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: What time of year was it, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: It was sometimes in April?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yeah, ’45, April ’45.</span> <span id="s938">And then we went back to our truck, our truck was blown up to pieces.</span> <span id="s939">Our truck wasn’t there, so we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s940">A lot of the prisoners escaped.</span> <span id="s941">I was afraid to make the escape, I could have escaped too, but I was afraid.</span> <span id="s942">I was afraid because of being beaten and I couldn’t take no more pain, because I still felt the pain in my head from the lead pipe and beating all the time at work.</span> <span id="s943">So I was afraid, I didn’t want – want to gamble.</span> <span id="s944">We finally got a truck, we came back.</span> <span id="s945">Here we – we are going – the next day we went out to work to build agai – to dig again branches for the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s946">We are not getting any more food, it’s already three or four days, we’re not getting no food, we didn’t go to work no place.</span> <span id="s947">We see the Germans are removing out their ammunition, we watch – were watching them taking it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: So there was no supervision any more –</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: N-N – oh yes, the commanding officer wasn’t there, no, the commanding officer wasn’t there, but he was still in charge.</span> <span id="s950">When we went out – when we went out to – to dig the trenches, he would come out with his motorcycle to inspect.</span> <span id="s951">He would bring along a 15 foot white, long whip like you train animals and he would whip us from – from far away he would flip – whip us.</span> <span id="s952">But I – I – I remember I couldn’t work too much because of my shoulder and I kept on – the minute I saw the – the whip coming, I bent down and you know, I felt sorry for the taller prisoner who got hit.</span> <span id="s953">But he would just take it out on the prisoners because they were losing the war.</span> <span id="s954">After awhile – nek – it would – didn’t take too long, we see the bombs are flying, it di – it lights up the skies, artillery, it’s going crazy.</span> <span id="s955">It – suddenly, we were ordered next day to march to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s956">We came to the railroad station –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: The railroad station in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Y-Y-Yes, Landshut’s rail station.</span> <span id="s959">They loaded us in in – in boxcars.</span> <span id="s960">We didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s961">They closed up the doors.</span> <span id="s962">We are – as we made – we came – we dro – traveled about 25 minutes, the train stopped again to let go by a German train loaded with ammunition and – and artillery, everything is loaded.</span> <span id="s963">You could see their – their faces are sad, they – they – they know that s-something’s wrong and they don’t like to go the – those places.</span> <span id="s964">But the – one of the locomotive at that station went in to got some water.</span> <span id="s965">After he left, I was a may – maybe about a one of – and a half car away from – from that spout, and there was another sp – prisoner also with me.</span> <span id="s966">And I – I said to myself, boy it would be nice if I could go over and take a bath inside the tank, or just take a good drink of water.</span> <span id="s967">So after he left, I ran over and that other guy, the other prisoner ran over too, were holding up our ma – hands to the drip, the drips were coming in.</span> <span id="s968">And it felt so good to have a couple drops of water, it felt great.</span> <span id="s969">And the SS were chasing us back to our – to our freight car – to our cars.</span> <span id="s970">So I didn’t – but our guard was helpful.</span> <span id="s971">Then we took off again.</span> <span id="s972">We k-kept on going for maybe another 35 – 40 minutes on the train and suddenly we are sh – moved in, and the train made a sudden stop.</span> <span id="s973">We didn’t know what happened, whether it was a – just everybody was falling on top of another.</span> <span id="s974">Before it if – if – in a few seconds later we hear the bombers are diving in, bombing our train.</span> <span id="s975">The American bombed our train by mistake.</span> <span id="s976">They knocked out lik – locomotives, a lot of the pers – a lot of casualties were there.</span> <span id="s977">And after the first time, they came back the second time, some of the prisoners threw their stripe uniforms on top of the – of the – of the boxcars.</span> <span id="s978">When they came back they turned around and took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: But the – we found out that one of the trains, German trains that was chasing a German art-artillery train and he – they went by and they got us by mistake.</span> <span id="s981">That’s what we were told.</span> <span id="s982">But anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Did you try to run away during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Well, no, I didn’t, but maybe somebody else did.</span> <span id="s985">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s986">I was afraid because I wanted to come back alive, I – my father’s – I wanted to see my father again and I had also hope that some of my family would sur – survived.</span> <span id="s987">We took o – tha-that train was out of commission, we couldn’t go no place.</span> <span id="s988">Everything was a – had a – we were just waiting.</span> <span id="s989">The SS didn’t know what to do with – with us.</span> <span id="s990">The commanding officer is gone.</span> <span id="s991">We were just sitting in front of the freight cars and talking.</span> <span id="s992">It came later in the afternoon, the SS commander – officer comes to me, he says [indecipherable] boutonnière and with his [indecipherable] in his hand, and he said – oh, no, the SS hollered, oh, everybody I – in attention.</span> <span id="s993">Everybody th – is at – is at attention, and we’re shaking from fear because he would only come when – when there are bad times, when something – somebody did something wrong or he’s going to do something bad.</span> <span id="s994">He says, you are a-all liberated, you are free to do wherever you want.</span> <span id="s995">Oh my God, are you sure?</span> <span id="s996">You heed a – he-heard wa – you heard a you sure and everybody started to run over the railroad tracks, and wheat field, corn field.</span> <span id="s997">I remember running with a few other prisoners over the railroad tracks and we ran into wheat fields and cornfields and while we’re running, I see some other ama – prisoners who are running with me are falling down.</span> <span id="s998">I said run, run [indecipherable], but they – they didn’t get up, another fell, another one fell.</span> <span id="s999">And ga – they didn’t get up.</span> <span id="s1000">I just kept on running, I said to myself, maybe they’re weak, they cannot get up.</span> <span id="s1001">I kept on running.</span> <span id="s1002">I saw a sign while I was running, I saw a sign [indecipherable] and then I saw a big building in there.</span> <span id="s1003">I ran towards the direction.</span> <span id="s1004">I came in to – toward that building, there was a little delicatessen in there.</span> <span id="s1005">I ran in the side of delicatessen, the owner over the counter got ahold four slices of white bread and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1006">I squashed it together like a – like a piece of ball and I just shoved it down, I could hardly swallow it, but I – it went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: You were still with your prisoners uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Oh yes, prisoner’s uniform, yes a – my skin was coming off for – from dirt.</span> <span id="s1009">We never got a – took a shower or anything.</span> <span id="s1010">There wasn’t enough water to drink.</span> <span id="s1011">Lice crawling on – on our lower – black, everything was black.</span> <span id="s1012">So he – he – he gave me another tats – he turned around and gave me another one.</span> <span id="s1013">Two guys are sipping their coffee and talking and they’re looking at me like a – somebody – a wild animal walked in in here, th-th-th-they couldn’t see me –</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: They were German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s1016">So all of a sudden I hear ooh hoo, ooh hoo, the ger – th-th-the sou – the si-sirens are going.</span> <span id="s1017">So suddenly th-the he – the German over the counter says, laufen zie(ph) he says, run into the barn an-and cover yourself up with straw.</span> <span id="s1018">The two men got up from the – from the – who were sipping coffee and came outside and showed me which way to go, that was about 150 feet away.</span> <span id="s1019">I ran – and ran inside fast, cover myself up with hay.</span> <span id="s1020">It didn’t take more than a few seconds, I hear [speaks German] Come on out or I’ll kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: It was quiet.</span> <span id="s1023">He started over again [speaks German] and somebody sneezed.</span> <span id="s1024">There were – he asked for one of the SS to go over in that direction, pound with a hay fork, he telled, take that hay fork and go ahead, pound in that area.</span> <span id="s1025">They hit a – another prisoner with the hay fork.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Oh yeah, there were more than one people hiding there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: No, I didn’t know at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah, I didn’t know, it was just – there was – I was – I was there just because they told me to.</span> <span id="s1030">So they pounded in that area there and – and I heard a real loud scream.</span> <span id="s1031">And then I jumped up, and I saw another je – prisoner jumped up.</span> <span id="s1032">We went outside with a ho – handle – hi – hand up, the SS is right behind our back with their bayonets, and we marched out the door.</span> <span id="s1033">I see outside the door there’s a Jeep and the commanding officer motorcycle.</span> <span id="s1034">When we came out fro-from the barn, I saw a – the – th-the commander’s officer motorcycle was in th – in the driveway and a Jeep.</span> <span id="s1035">The commanding officer gave orders for the two SS to go back to their post, and while he was talking to them, the-the – one of the – the prisoner who was with me, helding his head up high, he started to run.</span> <span id="s1036">The SS officer grabbed his gun and shot him maybe about 10 feet away from – from him.</span> <span id="s1037">And then he – after the two SS left on a motorc – on – on – on their Jeep, he sat down on this motorcycle, took his gun in the left hand and he hollered at me, he says, run.</span> <span id="s1038">[speaks German].</span> <span id="s1039">He says, run.</span> <span id="s1040">If you cannot run I’m going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1041">I started to run and run – ran.</span> <span id="s1042">I was weak, I couldn’t run, I kept on beg – I kept on falling.</span> <span id="s1043">He coo – he would cock his gun, I ta – I begged him please, I have to meet my father again, I cannot die yet.</span> <span id="s1044">He s – kept on running, I ke – I kept on falling and getting up and he kept on cocking his gun.</span> <span id="s1045">I-I wouldn’t give up, I kept on fighting to stay alive, begging him while I was out a – with – without a breath.</span> <span id="s1046">I – I couldn’t keep up with his motorcycle, but he just kept on pushing me and – and then he stops and cocks his gun ready to fire at my head and I just kept get up and kept on going again.</span> <span id="s1047">We finally came to the same place where we had the liberation, that was the first – the place where we had – we got our freedom.</span> <span id="s1048">They had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: In other words, the place where that German officer originally told you – gave you your freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1051">The same tr – bombed train.</span> <span id="s1052">And a – he turned me over to two SS.</span> <span id="s1053">They kept on pounding in my back with bayonets and I just kept on going [indecipherable] End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: – two SS and you know, po-poking me in the back with their rifle – with their bayonets and wa – in the direction of the freight cars.</span> <span id="s1055">As I got closer I tried to get in – in some of the freight cars, but I was – it was too high up, six feet high, and I couldn’t reach it.</span> <span id="s1056">So I kept on going closer, where they were slaughtering the prisoners, they were clubbing them and – to death with their rifle butts and bayonets.</span> <span id="s1057">I remember I came close by to – to the area, I was climbing on top of the wo-wounded and – and dead prisoners and I finally got up on top, I got hit with – with the rifle butts several times and I got knocked out my jaw and my teeth were knocked out.</span> <span id="s1058">And I finally got in inside the car and once I got into the car I saw several si – prisoners in there laying with their bashed in eyes, their faces were all crushed, noses were all broken up.</span> <span id="s1059">Their head – some of them, the – the brains were – their brains were hanging out just like you’re squeezing out from an orange.</span> <span id="s1060">They were laying outside o-on the – on the fo – wooden floor in the – in the freight car.</span> <span id="s1061">I passed out there and I don’t know what ha – what happened after that.</span> <span id="s1062">I woke up in a Hitler youth hospital, and I was in a coma.</span> <span id="s1063">The Americans liberated me and I weighed 65 pounds.</span> <span id="s1064">I got –</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: You didn’t remember how you got to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1067">I don’t remember nothing.</span> <span id="s1068">After I got into the car, I just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: You passed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I got passed out wi –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: But when you go – woke up in the hospital, there were Americans around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: No, German.</span> <span id="s1073">There were German – German nurses took care of me, German doctors.</span> <span id="s1074">There was no Americans inside, the Americans –</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: But that was after the war was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: After it was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: After the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I – I didn’t know the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I didn’t even know the war was over.</span> <span id="s1081">I just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: You know approximately what time of year it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I – I guess it must have been sometimes in May.</span> <span id="s1084">We never knew the dates or time, we never were any use, we didn’t know nothing what going on in this world, we – we were all isolated.</span> <span id="s1085">All we knew is torture, slavery, that’s we – we – we – we knew how to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So when you woke up in the hospital, it was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: It wa – it was all over, I got – I was bandage up and my mouth was bandage up and I ha – I was under – I wa – I was fed with a tube er – what kind of feeding, you – how you – what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Intravenous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Intravenous feeding, and I don’t know how long I was up in there, but the story goes on, I have – there – I – on – I-I – all I – all I want to say at this time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: No, no, no, tell us what happened after you got better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: After I got better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: How long were you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Ah, I was in the hospital probably about three weeks and I am – my mouth was all bandaged up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: And afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: I – afterwards I – I got permission to go out, I couldn’t eat, I had to eat only the liquids, because I couldn’t eat anything, my mou – my jaws were broken and my teeth were knocked out.</span> <span id="s1096">And I – after about three weeks, I got permission to go out, to walk, to go out for – for the day and come back in the evening.</span> <span id="s1097">I – once I got from the – from the doctor – I asked do-doctor, how much longer am I gonna have to have on the – the bandage on my mouth.</span> <span id="s1098">He said it wouldn’t be long, but in the meantime he gave me s – to take along, he gave me a bottle of vitamins and he told me to take – to take it the next mo – br – morning, I should take it three times a day.</span> <span id="s1099">So came next morning I took a walk and I kept on tasting the vitamins that were – I didn’t know they were vitamins, I thought they were candy.</span> <span id="s1100">I just kept on popping them in, popping them in, they tasted so good and I started to get energy.</span> <span id="s1101">I finished them all in one time, all hundred I finished all at one time.</span> <span id="s1102">And I felt great, I mean, I felt good.</span> <span id="s1103">Came in the evening I went back to the – to the doc – to the nurse and I – she asked me how was your – how do you feel now?</span> <span id="s1104">I said, oh I feel a lot better after eating that candy, it was d – it was delicious, I would like to have some more.</span> <span id="s1105">She says, oh leiber(ph) God, she says, oh my God, she says, you shouldn’t have done that, they – you’re supposed to have – take only three a day.</span> <span id="s1106">[indecipherable] I thought it was candy, I didn’t know vi – nobody told me what a vitamin is, I didn’t know from that stuff.</span> <span id="s1107">So the next day the doctor saw me again, I a – I asked him for some more of the vitamins.</span> <span id="s1108">I told him I felt a lot better from it, and he says, oh we ran out of, we don’t have them no more.</span> <span id="s1109">And he says, we’ll take out the bandage tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1110">Well, we took out the bandage, then we walked around.</span> <span id="s1111">The first thing I did, I went to look for – for somebody in my family, if they survived.</span> <span id="s1112">I – all I knew, everybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Where did you go to look for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: I – I na – in – in – they – they had organizations like the UNRRA and Joint – what is the – the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Okay, what town was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: In Germany where – near [indecipherable] let’s see, that was in Feldamfing(ph), but we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Feldan –</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Feldamfing(ph).</span> <span id="s1119">Tha – where I was liberated, that was – that was a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: That was where the hospital was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: That’s where the hospital was, and that’s where th-the Americans took me and then we were – walked around, you know, we wen – went –</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: So in Felda – how do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Feldamfing(ph).</span> <span id="s1124">F – like feld, f-e-l-d.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: F-i-n-k.</span> <span id="s1127">A –</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: So, in Feldanfink(ph) there were – there were – there was UNRRA and other organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yi – no, there were – they were in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: In Munich, which it wa – wasn’t too far away.</span> <span id="s1132">But I started to ask around where – where I could get some – to find out if anybody of my family was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: And I knew that last time – a-all my family went except my older brother was still living and it – I didn’t know he was in the labor camp, and my sister I saw last at – when I waved to her and I got hit with a lead pipe in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1135">So I was hoping both these two had survived, but u-unfortunately no matter how much I tried, I did not – I did not find my sister, but I, after awhile, investigating and chasing around, I found out that my brother, my older brother was captured in the Russian prison, survived and he is waiting for me in Czechoslovakia, Chust.</span> <span id="s1136">So, when I told that to some my friends in there, they told me not to go because I’ll never come back again, because Russia wouldn’t let you out.</span> <span id="s1137">You’ll – you’ll be able to get in, but not to – you’ll not be able to get out.</span> <span id="s1138">I said to myself, I went through hell in the concentration camps, I was locked up, I wasn’t allowed to go, I was – no place, I was guarded every minute with – by the SS with rifles, and then I was starving.</span> <span id="s1139">Today, thanks God I am not starving and I had – I – I – I – I cannot do that, I got to meet my brother.</span> <span id="s1140">So I just went ahead and tried to make an [indecipherable] but the worst part of all was that we had to – we – the transportation was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: So we had to wait.</span> <span id="s1143">So I – when I started out, I finally got a pass with my picture that I can travel, or – to – to Russia.</span> <span id="s1144">And I traveled through fr – two freight trains and then – then other trains and they were loaded.</span> <span id="s1145">Some people were returning and soldiers from the army, they were all broken up too, and they were lonely, lost from the world.</span> <span id="s1146">I – I finally made it to – to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: You got back to Chust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: To Chust, I finally made it to Chust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Did you meet – did you find any members of your family there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: No.</span> <span id="s1151">I might – I was waiting for my brother, I was supposed to meet my brother, my brother ta – wrote – left me a message that he’s gonna be back in two days, he’s outta – he went – had to leave out of town, I guess for business already.</span> <span id="s1152">So he – I waited there.</span> <span id="s1153">In the meantime I went back to see our home.</span> <span id="s1154">The home was there, but all – I went back to the Jewish neighborhoods, there’s nobody there, everything – there’s no more minyan, there’s no more – nobody’s around no more, you don’t see any children laughing outside, everything is dead.</span> <span id="s1155">The sh – Jewish store there was once, it was all gone.</span> <span id="s1156">The je – the Jewish children, parents, mothers, fathers and – and grandparents who walked once to shul with their children in the kaftenshtramla(ph) with the – all dressed up on Shabbas, they’re no more.</span> <span id="s1157">You can’t find no more a minyan.</span> <span id="s1158">So then I decided – I used to work after school, I used to work for one of the spiritus(ph) store.</span> <span id="s1159">I used to fill bottles for – this was in alcohol, the rubbing alcohol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: And this one guy, was a heavy, tall-set guy and he – he – he was a Russian.</span> <span id="s1162">He had a Hungarian wife.</span> <span id="s1163">With him I could get along, he was pretty le – easy – easygoing.</span> <span id="s1164">His wife was a real anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1165">She was a Hungarian but she hated Jews.</span> <span id="s1166">I had nothing to do with her.</span> <span id="s1167">But I – I – I decided – I knew where he lived, I decided I’ll wait for him near a bridge.</span> <span id="s1168">He usually walked, because he never drove, he was too heavy to get into a car.</span> <span id="s1169">He never drove a car, never knew how to drive.</span> <span id="s1170">So I waited for him at a bridge, and I got closer to him as I’m coming, I’d smile [speaks foreign language] and he was an – he gar – grabs his – he was going with a cane, he grabs his cane and swung it at me.</span> <span id="s1171">He says, you dirty Jew, get away from here.</span> <span id="s1172">Well, he was ready to kill me, you could see that face, he was – you dirty Jew, get away from here.</span> <span id="s1173">I wa – I started to cry, I was – I couldn’t believe what this guy called me and how ma – how – how he changed overnight, how – what happened to this guy?</span> <span id="s1174">The hatred in him.</span> <span id="s1175">He had a friend, a teacher by the name Mandbattel(ph), he used to come over – he used to – he – he used to come over after school and spend time with him drinking what kind, having good times, laughing.</span> <span id="s1176">And I thought he’s – he’s a mensch, but it turned out to be that he tur – he changed unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1177">So I finally went – looked for a place where to sleep and someone told me where the survivors are meeting, so I went to that hotel and I was tra – hoping my brother is going to show up.</span> <span id="s1178">A couple days later I met some of the people in there, but most of them were s – from small towns.</span> <span id="s1179">There were two or three from my city, but most of them were from small towns who survived.</span> <span id="s1180">And finally my brother came a couple days later and we went – we decided – we heard that we must leave Czechoslovakia because the Russians are closing the borders.</span> <span id="s1181">So we had to hurry up and get out from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: What time of year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Oh, it was sometimes in – oh, maybe 1946 and di – probably –</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Oh, so it was quite like six months after you were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yeah, oh yeah, i-it was after that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: It was a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Sometimes in 1946.</span> <span id="s1188">It may have been in the fall.</span> <span id="s1189">I forgot already, I – I don’t know exactly, but it was in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1191">So where were you from 1945 from the time that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: In – in – in the Feldamfing(ph).</span> <span id="s1193">Feldamfing(ph), I-I’d say –</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Was that a – was that a displaced person camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Uh – uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes, it was for mentally disturbed people and sick ones who were – they just took – th-the Americans just brought them in and that’s where they be – they belonged til they recuperated, but I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: So you were there for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: I was there for a long time til I was – I got everything organized to go to – to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: To go back to – mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Coming back was a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: All right, so in 1946 you and your brother decided to leave Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Where did you from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: We – first my brother suggested we should try to sell our house, to see if somebody lived there and try to sell our house.</span> <span id="s1206">We went there with our little packages wrapped up, you know, couple bundles.</span> <span id="s1207">And he told me, he says, Irving, you wait outside, don’t come in.</span> <span id="s1208">I’ll – if everything is okay I’ll come up to you, but if not, is – you wait here.</span> <span id="s1209">He went in inside to see – there was sechukers(ph) they called them, Ukraines who moved in in our house, and he chased my brother with a bayonet.</span> <span id="s1210">He told him, if you ever come back I’m gonna wait for you next time with a bayonet, I’ll blow your head off.</span> <span id="s1211">He started to run, he said, Itzhak, run, run, run for your life.</span> <span id="s1212">I kept on running, running and I – when he told me that I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1213">I couldn’t believe it, I was crying and I was so bitter about it.</span> <span id="s1214">There is nothing we have got here, we gotta get out of here, this is the hateful place that I – that – that – th – if you – they found out I’m Jewish I survived, they’re going to kill me too.</span> <span id="s1215">So we ran to the small gas – to small – there we had two big stations, one a small one, one a big one.</span> <span id="s1216">From where – we’re cl – we were closer to the small station.</span> <span id="s1217">So we got back there and we were sitting waiting for a train, you never knew when a train is gonna come, two, three hours, four or five hours.</span> <span id="s1218">It was about one or two o’clock in the morning, we are waiting still.</span> <span id="s1219">There were some FBI agents, you know, like, they’re not FBI, th-they – they called them – what – what – what they call them, the – in Russia, the – I cannot recall them, but anyway, they – they – th-they were – NKVD they called them</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Yeah, they were watching everything and checking out outside and inside.</span> <span id="s1222">They came and checked out everybody who was waiting at the station there, their passports.</span> <span id="s1223">Everybody’s was fine, my brother’s was fine, he was liberated, he was a captured prisoner in Russia, that he had this paper that he was – he – that he was a ke – prisoner, he was free now.</span> <span id="s1224">But I was – I got papers from Germany, and I w-was born in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1225">The papers said I was born in Czechoslovakia, Chust.</span> <span id="s1226">They called me in inside and th-th-th-the little room in there, at that station and this one NKVD’er(ph) tells me, he says, you were born here, your papers said you were born in Chust, Czechoslovakia, this is where you belong.</span> <span id="s1227">You’re not leaving this place.</span> <span id="s1228">This is your country, your home.</span> <span id="s1229">I said to him, I have to meet my family if somebody survived in Germany, I have to go there.</span> <span id="s1230">Maybe later on I’ll come back after I’m finished.</span> <span id="s1231">He says no, you cannot go no place, you – I’m sorry, you gotta stay here, that’s your home.</span> <span id="s1232">Suddenly while were ti – I’m arguing with him and I’m ra – crying, he – suddenly we heard some shooting outside, fire – they were shooting, gunfire.</span> <span id="s1233">He started run out, I ran after him.</span> <span id="s1234">And the minute I ran after him I s-s-saw my brother, I said – I told my brother, run for your life, let’s go to the big station.</span> <span id="s1235">We took off, ran ou – toward the big station.</span> <span id="s1236">We tripped, we – maybe took us a half an hour, 45 minutes to get there.</span> <span id="s1237">We tripped all o-on – on railroad ties, we fell in chuckholes.</span> <span id="s1238">We – we came bloodied up to the big station with our knees, but we finally made it.</span> <span id="s1239">Here we’re waiting in there for th – for the train didn’t come yet and we are hoping that there’s going to be room on it because most of the time the trains were – came in so loaded, people are hanging onto the steps, they were standing on the steps, they couldn’t get on.</span> <span id="s1240">So I finally – we – finally the train came, we got in, we couldn’t get on.</span> <span id="s1241">So everybody was climbing on top of the roof, so we – I remember I – I ran from one place, it was dark, it was after midnight, two or three o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1242">I ran from one place to another and I finally saw some people are trying to help one another to get up.</span> <span id="s1243">I figured I’ll – I’ll get up too.</span> <span id="s1244">They helped me to get up to the top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1245">On top of the roof you were pretty safe, but when the Russians came up there to ask you for money or – or – or th-they’re gonna kill you for watches, you had to give – you – there was tsoris.</span> <span id="s1246">There were problems.</span> <span id="s1247">And I – a-anyway, the train started to move.</span> <span id="s1248">Every –</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: And where did it go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Everything was fine, we – we were on our way going back to – I was supposed to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1251">I said, I don’t have for a pass, I’m gone – the pa – I know my pass is gone, I don’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s1252">They – he too – th-the civilian took away my pass.</span> <span id="s1253">We are coming to the small station, the train starts out, and it’s going – my heart is feeling ba – faster and faster, I hear the train is going and I said to myself, boy if – if we stop at that station, the small one where – where we – we were waiting, we ran away from, and th – th-that civilian is waiting for me, the NKVD is waiting for me, I’ll be in trouble, they’re gonna take me off.</span> <span id="s1254">It is dark, but I wen – in – you know, you never know what those guys will do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Anyway, we got – we got – we g-got – came closer by and the train just flew – just went by, whistled loud and went by, didn’t stop because there was no room no place, every seat was taken.</span> <span id="s1257">I thank God, my God, I’m safe, I got – I fooled them, I’m out of – from Chust, I’m out of it.</span> <span id="s1258">So we finally, on the way going, the – y-you could see th-the – the – some of the p – some of the people would stand up and the electric wires, or telephone wire were – were across, and if you got up too high fro – on top of the roof, you were just picked up by the wire and you’re knocked off.</span> <span id="s1259">Next to us that happened to one of the guys.</span> <span id="s1260">He got up to change places with somebody else.</span> <span id="s1261">He didn’t lower his head en-enough, or he just came – he picked his head up and – he picked himself up just in time, when he came near the wire and he got blown off from the – from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: How long did the trip to Germany take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Oh, I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1264">We had to transfer to – several times to – Debrecen we stopped once, and then we had to travel another one and then we came to che – to Prague.</span> <span id="s1265">Then – then we – the – there – there was – it depends what kind of a train we took.</span> <span id="s1266">Sometimes we had to go on our circuits around, sometimes they went straight, they were going different directions.</span> <span id="s1267">Nobody [tape break] okay, we arrived, and my brother was supposed to be on – on that train, too.</span> <span id="s1268">And – from Debrecen to – to Prague.</span> <span id="s1269">Once I got to Prague I was looking for my brother and I couldn’t find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Oh, your brother was not on the train with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: No, he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1272">He – he – he – he was – I got on, I thought for sure he’s – was on on it too.</span> <span id="s1273">So I was waiting for him in Prague for days for him to come in, he didn't show up.</span> <span id="s1274">I was worried about him and I d – I – I didn’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1275">But I couldn’t do nothing about it because the time came that we had to leave with the border at Prague chur – i-in austr – Austria, Czechoslovakian Australia – Austria was going to be closed, so we had to rush out from there.</span> <span id="s1276">We had to – I didn’t have any papers and most of the papers were taken away anyway from all the – a-all the – you couldn’t go over legally crossing the border, you – you had to – you had to go out without sh – on the black market, smuggle through.</span> <span id="s1277">So it came one day they told me – they came – one of the messengers told me that I should wait in the room because we may move this afternoon, we’re going to ge – go across the border to Austria.</span> <span id="s1278">We got on on the train, it was maybe for about 25 - 30 minutes and we were across the German – I mean, the au – it were – the Czechoslovakian border in Germany.</span> <span id="s1279">It was the Russian – actually, at that time it was the Russian German border.</span> <span id="s1280">Russian Austria border.</span> <span id="s1281">And we – they put us in – into a barn and gave us meat, horsemeat we were eating, it smelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Was that the Russians who –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: N – that – no, that was the Austrians already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Austrians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: But tha – it was the Russian at the border, they belonged to them, but th-they were controlling the border.</span> <span id="s1286">They wouldn’t let us cross the border legally, so we had to smuggle through.</span> <span id="s1287">And we were eating the horsemeat, everybody was thro – threw it at the cook, you know, they said, is that what we deserve after surviving?</span> <span id="s1288">Some of them – you know, I was happy to eat no matter what it is, I was worried next day I’m – I’m gonna starve.</span> <span id="s1289">I didn’t argue about it.</span> <span id="s1290">And th-there was a young couple maybe about 18 years old, to – a girl and a boy who lived all – near a bridge, you know, it was just like a small bridge going over.</span> <span id="s1291">They – they lived under an umbrella, a poor – sh-sha – rain or shine, they were out there s-sleeping and living there.</span> <span id="s1292">These poor kids, I don’t know whether they were married or not, but th-th-they were survivors, they were skeletons.</span> <span id="s1293">The girl got pregnant and she was dehydrated from – from not eating good food, she didn't get any nutrition, the baby died a short time later, and she died then too.</span> <span id="s1294">Then a short time later the husband died.</span> <span id="s1295">He do –</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: How long were you went – how long were you with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: In – in the camp?</span> <span id="s1298">In –</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: There with those people that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: With those – those people in there?</span> <span id="s1301">They were living out there, oh I don’t know, th-the – maybe about five, six weeks.</span> <span id="s1302">They were – they were out there and th-they were just living there, they wouldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: And what was the name of the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Oh, th-that was in Austria, that’s a [indecipherable] Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1305">Lan – Linz Salzburg – there was another name to it.</span> <span id="s1306">I-In the town there was Salzburg, Lin – Linz.</span> <span id="s1307">Linz in Salzburg, something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: And from Linz and you went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: And – and yes, we were – we – we couldn’t go over – now we couldn’t smuggle through the Russian – the je – the Austrian border, because the Russian border to cross over to German border.</span> <span id="s1310">We had another problem there.</span> <span id="s1311">We could go over the Austria but Russia wouldn’t let you go through.</span> <span id="s1312">So we had to – we waited for weeks, starving in there, not eating properly and everybody’s bored, wasting time in there.</span> <span id="s1313">So we – finally they – we just – some of them th-the – the – some guys came in and told us that we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Well, you were a group – a group of survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: And your brother was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: No, he was still lost, he wasn’t there, I didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Okay, so how did you manage to get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Okay, fro-from Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Oh, I mean out of Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Austria.</span> <span id="s1324">Yeah, okay, th-that – we finally got a couple of the – two – two civilians came in one evening and they told us that if you wanted to be smuggle across the border, across the Russian border – not crush – Au-Austrian Russian border, you will have to pay so much money.</span> <span id="s1325">And you cannot take along nothing, you gotta leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s1326">Well [indecipherable] most of them didn't want to go, they didn’t want to get killed.</span> <span id="s1327">They said, if they find us, th-the – we cannot real – you know, risk – you’re going – it’s all on your own risk.</span> <span id="s1328">So we – I ca – it’s a little too much [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: For a lot of money they could smuggle you across.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yeah, and you gotta leave everything behind, you cannot take along nothing with you.</span> <span id="s1331">So some of them – and if you – whoever wants to go tomorrow night, two trucks will come here and we – we – whoever comes – comes, is gonna have to pay that price and we’re gonna take you across the border.</span> <span id="s1332">It’s risky.</span> <span id="s1333">Th-There is a risk you’re gonna get killed by the Russian border guard, but it’s up to you.</span> <span id="s1334">He came next night, a lot of them went out on the trucks and gave him the money.</span> <span id="s1335">I didn’t have any money, I started to collect money before – th-the – the night before because I didn’t have enough money what they ask for, and I still didn’t get enough when that – that evening came.</span> <span id="s1336">I begged the guy, please, that’s all I have, I ca – I’m leaving everything behind, but I – that’s all I have, I – I want to g-get out of here, I don’t want to be here no more.</span> <span id="s1337">I want to go over to Germany where I was liberated so I can start a new life.</span> <span id="s1338">He wouldn’t give in, no, nothing doing, nothing doing.</span> <span id="s1339">So I begged him again, I ran after him, he finally gave in, he says okay, get in on the truck.</span> <span id="s1340">We – it was late in the evening, it was dark already.</span> <span id="s1341">We took off, two farmers truck took off.</span> <span id="s1342">We were going with high speed over the farmland, yi – like a hundred miles per hour.</span> <span id="s1343">And suddenly we ca – we came to a stop near a little lake.</span> <span id="s1344">We – we had jumped off and they handed us a small tiny flashlight, you c – like a – like a little star you could see.</span> <span id="s1345">And we got off all of us, and he said, you follow all – all of you follow me with that little light, that little starlight.</span> <span id="s1346">We just kept on running and running and here the pebbles, I remember sliding down, the pebbles are – are – are sliding on it, you go right into the lake, because there are a lot of pebbles in here and the minute you stepped on it I kept on sliding down.</span> <span id="s1347">I thought I’ll never make it, I’ll just go right in, and so did a fe-few other ones.</span> <span id="s1348">But we kept on following him and running and running and running.</span> <span id="s1349">And he said qua – be quiet, don’t move, keep your heads down, keep your heads up.</span> <span id="s1350">We kept on running and running with the lights were hitting our heads in – in some of the trees.</span> <span id="s1351">We finally came out to an open space, about 20 minutes we were running like that.</span> <span id="s1352">At wit – and we came to a place where he said, you’re safe now.</span> <span id="s1353">A German boat, a small one came over across, one man boat, and he t-took us over, five, six at a time.</span> <span id="s1354">I remember we k – th-the – we

asked him for help.</span> <span id="s1438">The – I asked after sch – one day of school, I’ve told him – first I liked it there, I was among students, it felt so good.</span> <span id="s1439">And suddenly when he was teaching, I couldn’t understand what he was saying and nothing – I could nothing absorb.</span> <span id="s1440">My head was all knocked out, my li – from the lead pipe and all the misery, I couldn’t remember nothing.</span> <span id="s1441">You could – you could tell now for a minute something and not a minute even, 10 seconds it was gone, it just like you never said it.</span> <span id="s1442">I couldn’t remember nothing, period, zero.</span> <span id="s1443">So I got disgusted, I asked the teacher for help and he said, I’m sorry, I cannot give you any help, I’m busy.</span> <span id="s1444">I’ve – you – you have to do it on your own.</span> <span id="s1445">So I quit that school – and that’s the time, while I was going to that school, this one guy came over and th-the – the German, he would sa – behind the back he yells, are you a Jude?</span> <span id="s1446">And he handed me those pictures, you know, I-I sh – I showed you?</span></p> <p><span

ran in the other direction.</span> <span id="s1450">And then I quit.</span> <span id="s1451">Two – after two weeks I quit school, I couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s1452">I went back to the camp and I stayed there and I f-finally – they – they were asking for as – they were – some Israeli came and fr – to – from a kibbutz to join – he wanted to join Haganah.</span> <span id="s1453">So we should – he said train some people to go over and fight in Israel.</span> <span id="s1454">I was happy to do that, I went ahead, it was a six weeks course.</span> <span id="s1455">After the six weeks course, I couldn’t go – get no place anyway.</span> <span id="s1456">Then they organized – because they killed – one of the – the Germans in Wolfratshausen killed one of the butchers who brought in illegally meat in the camp, and they killed him, so that we – they went ahead, they’re – the other – the – the survivors in the camp ran down – went to that Wolfratshausen village and knocked out everything they could find.</span> <span id="s1457">Burned up and th-th-th-they ret-retaliated because they killed their butcher.</span> <span id="s1458">Then later on the – after th-the – because of the police – police and what they did, they wouldn’t come back no more to our camp, so we had to organ – they had to organize our own police force.</span> <span id="s1459">Because I had training six weeks, I became a member of the police force.</span> <span id="s1460">I was guarding with a – four other guys, one night we were guarding in – near a forest with s-some other per – survivors and we were un – in a bunker.</span> <span id="s1461">All we had is rifles, bayonets, but no bullets, no bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: But you didn’t have to defend – to defend yourself against anybody, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Well, th-th-the whole problem was the – we – you see killings like that.</span> <span id="s1464">They killed th-the German –</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Why did they kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Because he smuggled in meat.</span> <span id="s1467">He smuggled in meat, he wasn’t supposed to.</span> <span id="s1468">He brought in pulholka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: So, who killed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: The German police.</span> <span id="s1471">German policemen on two motorcycles.</span> <span id="s1472">They were patrolling the area, and he just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Did a lot of people go to Israel from that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Oh

were killing – they were sinking all the ships at that time and they mo – automatically, when I got trained to – to the Haganah, I was supposed to go to Israel to fight.</span> <span id="s1478">But the-then – then they stopped everything because they were – they were – we told – they told us they were sinking – th-the Arabs are sinking all the ships that are arrive in Israel.</span> <span id="s1479">So that stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: So, who long did you stay there?</span> <span id="s1481">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: How long I stayed, til my f – my father had some uncles in Israel – I mean, in the United States, so I wrote some – I – I met one of the guys from u – from the UNRRA, and I told him about it, that my father had some brothers in – in the United State, if he could do something to find out.</span> <span id="s1483">Well, he put it in the Jewish news, and somebody in the fa – i-in – in – in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of the – my cousin’s husband saw that ad and he showed it to my uncles.</span> <span id="s1484">Sure enough, I was part o – part of them.</span> <span id="s1485">But unfortunately, before I got to the United State, everything – they were all dead.</span> <span id="s1486">But going back a little bit, before I came to the United State, I got pa-papers from my cousin, the – it – to come to the United

came to the – for a few days we were on the waters and we came to the Atlantic Ocean and all of a sudden the water started to get wild, we ran into a typhoon.</span> <span id="s1492">And the boat just kept on going up like this and going down.</span> <span id="s1493">Everything is falling down, I was on the lower level, everything is crashing inside.</span> <span id="s1494">I see a big bu – a big [indecipherable] just flying from one emmet to another.</span> <span id="s1495">And – and we – suddenly the water is gushing in, I see shooting in water from inside.</span> <span id="s1496">And the water is just tumbling over from all sides.</span> <span id="s1497">I s – I was – there was – next to me was a woman in there, her – one of the poles from the downstairs fell on top of her si – hip in there on the side, and she was in agony and she’s taking in water.</span> <span id="s1498">I’m standing in there paralyzed, I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1499">I’m – I’m deep in my water in my knees, but I’m standing paralyzed and I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1500">One of the air – one of the what’s his name jumped over and he grabbed me.</span> <span id="s1501">One of

id="s1506">I ca – I – I don’t remember a word, I woke up.</span> <span id="s1507">I wounded up in – at the New York per – harbor, and I was on – on the top deck in there.</span> <span id="s1508">I don’t know what happened to the boat, of wa – how – whether we got on another boat.</span> <span id="s1509">I was just out completely, my memory was lost, I couldn’t remember nothing.</span></p>

the – so much damage to the world than it did to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1527">The world did not lift a finger to help for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1528">The United State did not want to bomb Auschwitz for a reason.</span> <span id="s1529">They were around, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1530">There was wide open spaces, they could just go ahead that little place and bomb it and they could have saved millions of Jews, but they didn’t care, they didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1531">Roosevelt didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1532">They p – a lot of people asked him.</span> <span id="s1533">There was one a-ambassador, a Polish went to him and he told them, he says, they’re killing Jews, innocent people, he showed him what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1534">He says, we’re busy fighting a war, we have got no time for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Did you ever talk about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Oh

<span id="s1542">In fact, I was talking to you, I’m – I was jumping from one camp to another, the killing, the shooting, th-the – some of the – of the prisoners are collapsing and I see them ba – b-being hit.</span> <span id="s1543">I see every – everything s-still is in my head, I – it keeps on going 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1544">Even I’m driving the car I see sometimes a motorcycle, I see that SS who was sh – who was holding the gun at me, he – he was chasing me with a gu – at gunpoint to – back to the – to the slaughter e – where they were slaughtering the prisoners, where the bombed train was.</span> <span id="s1545">I see in front of me sometimes, I – I wander around the ghetto of the street, I come back all mixed up, I’d wa – I’m afraid I’m gonna hit somebody.</span> <span id="s1546">I just want to get out, but there are times I cannot get no place, I slow down.</span> <span id="s1547">But I cas – live with it every day.</span> <span id="s1548">I’m talking – I’m – I walked around in here everywhere.</span> <span id="s1549">I ran though the – when I went through the museum I didn’t even look too much, I just ran through, I came out to the other end, I waited for my wife in the other end.</span> <span id="s1550">I cannot look at it because I know I – I have lived with it and I know what it is all about.</span> <span id="s1551">But I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: What did you tell your children about the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Well, they – I have told my children about it, but I don’t get too much of an answer, they’re just somehow heartbroken about it too, but they don’t talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s1554">They don’t say nothing about it so I can’t – I cannot go and ask them how they feel because I know they’re hurt.</span> <span id="s1555">I mean, they lost grandparents, they don’t have anybody in family, we’re – I’m all – the only one left from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: When did you find out about your parents and your sisters, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: They’re gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Well, I was ho – had hope all along that maybe a miracle happened, they got out from the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1560">But unfortunately none of them came back and I knew all along they were dead, but in my mind I op – kept on thinking they’re alive.</span> <span id="s1561">They’re someplace among the stars in heaven and they’re waiting for me to join them someplace.</span> <span id="s1562">I never gave up o-on that, but I, unfortunately I cannot –</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Well, is there anything else that you would like to tell us –</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: – that you may have forgotten now – forgotten while we were talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: I-I – I would like to end with the American – God bless the United State soldiers wherever they may be, whether the ones who are alive or dead.</span> <span id="s1567">Without them I wouldn’t be here to tell you the story what I went through.</span> <span id="s1568">I probably would have been someplace burned or buried.</span> <span id="s1569">And God bless America, it’s a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s1570">We – the people in – in this country don’t appreciate the freedom that much like the people who suffered and – all their lives and they come here to a country that they can kiss the earth, there’s – there’s justice, freedom and peace for everybody.</span> <span id="s1571">I thank you for asking me, Mrs. Houten(ph) to give this interview, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Well, thank you very much for this interview, Mr. Schaffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: If – if you need any more – any help to this, please call me.</span> <span id="s1574">I’ll be very happy to help you out, because the world must know of the tragedies, what happened to the six million.</span> <span id="s1575">It was actually eight – 18 million.</span> <span id="s1576">Six – wait a minute, six – five – 11 million all together.</span> <span id="s1577">Five million non-Jews were – were also killed in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1578">But I’ll – we – we must remember the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1579">We must never forget it because the holocausts are going on today.</span> <span id="s1580">We must be sensitive to danger signals and try to cope with them, so that tragedies like that never happened again.</span> <span id="s1581">Thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Well, thank you again, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span
