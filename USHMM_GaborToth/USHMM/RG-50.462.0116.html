side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">NL: Now, Cantor Mandel, would you be good enough to tell us a little about when and where you were born and a little about your family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">YM: Dr. Levin, I was born in a small town in Hungary called Csepe.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">NL: Can you spell that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">YM: Yes, I will.</span> <span id="s6">C-S-E-P-E.</span> <span id="s7">Ugocsa Comidat.</span> <span id="s8">That's U-G-O-C-S-A Comidat.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">NL: That's the district?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">YM: The district.</span> <span id="s11">On March the 3rd, 1904.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">NL: So this was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">YM: This was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s14">It was in the part of Hungary which was the so-called "religious" Jewish part, where we spoke Yiddish and, eh, automatically we learned two, and some of us even three languages when we were small children.</span> <span id="s15">Yiddish was spoken inside as soon as we closed the door.</span> <span id="s16">From the inside we spoke Yiddish only.</span> <span id="s17">As soon as we were on the outside, the language was Hungarian and in some cases the Russian, Maloruski, the Ukrainian language.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NL: May I ask, why Russian?</span> <span id="s19">What was the Russian influence there?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">YM: Because there, at that part of Hungary, were many, many Ukrainians who spoke Russian, and the pressure was so big, even 50 and 100 years ago, to tear away from mainly Austro-Hungary because they felt that they can't live as nationals.</span> <span id="s21">Their culture, their education, their music, their everything, is oppressed by the Austrian government.</span> <span id="s22">Therefore, they, in their own homes, just as we Jews spoke Yiddish, so they spoke Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">NL: Ukrainian, yes, interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">YM: This, then, shows that that was even in many, many years ago a very highly-explosive part of Hungary.</span> <span id="s25">If they could have, probably, they would have torn away the part of Hungary from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in those days.</span> <span id="s26">This brought another interesting fact.</span> <span id="s27">They were completely influenced by the Church.</span> <span id="s28">Some of them were Catholics; most of them (the non-Jewish part, we're talking about) were Greek Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">NL: Greek Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">YM: Greek Orthodox.</span> <span id="s31">In both cases, the Church had an immense...eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s32">NL: Influence?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">YM: ...power and influence over them, and even when I was a small child, I started to go to heder at the age of three-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s34">When I was four and five, I knew very well what it means to be attacked by the non-Jewish students.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NL: You already were...</span></p> <p><span id="s36">YM: They waited for us with sticks and all kinds of things, and we learned to a degree how to fight them as well.</span> <span id="s37">This is maybe an interesting point from a point of view when we ask ourselves, how did the things get to the point where they started in 1938 or '39 in Hungary?</span> <span id="s38">But they really and actually started in 1917 and '18 on a big scale when Horthy and his, eh, people, came and killed plenty of Jews in Hungary proper, and whoever could take advantage of Jews, did.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">NL: Yes, we want to come to that, because that's an extremely important chapter.</span> <span id="s40">This was part of the reaction against the Béla Kun Communist regime, I believe.</span> <span id="s41">Now, can you say a little more about your childhood, because this would be so interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">YM: I, eh, was born in an extremely Orthodox religious family.</span> <span id="s43">My upbringing was the old type of Yiddish upbringing.</span> <span id="s44">Eh, and I was four-and-a-half years old, probably, surely not five yet, I started to learn Chumesh [Pentateuch], Chumesh Midrasheh [Post-Talmudic literature], eh, it wasn't a question of, do I want it?</span> <span id="s45">There were no considerations as far as psychological questions.</span> <span id="s46">This was it, and this is the way we grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NL: Can you tell me, eh, excuse me, par-, I think I interrupted you</span></p> <p><span id="s48">YM: We were seven children at home,</span></p> <p><span id="s49">NL: Yes, yes,</span></p> <p><span id="s50">YM: Three sisters and four brothers, of whom by today only one is alive, who came here in 1913, probably the last boat which reached the United...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">NL: 19-</span></p> <p><span id="s52">YM: '13</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NL: '13.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">YM: That's my oldest sister who lives in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NL: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">YM: Her name is Mrs. Helen Borish, B-O-R-I-S-H.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">NL: And can you give me the names of the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">YM: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s59">The sister who followed her was Esther.</span> <span id="s60">She was married to Yaakov Deutsch.</span> <span id="s61">One sister, the youngest sister, died.</span> <span id="s62">She was never married.</span> <span id="s63">She got what was prevalent in those days in that part of the world, galoppierende Tuberkulose [consumption] and died before the age of 20.</span> <span id="s64">Her name was Rivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">NL: Rivka.</span> <span id="s66">And the names of the brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">YM: My brothers, the younger brother, is Yoel, Yoel.</span> <span id="s68">The one following him is Yisrael Dov, or Srulbear, as we called him, and the youngest brother was David.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">NL: David.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">YM: Now, my sister's children.</span> <span id="s71">Did I give you the name of Esther?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">YM: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s74">Esther had three children.</span> <span id="s75">These children are, all three of them, in Israel, are settled there, and there they live.</span> <span id="s76">Yoel, of course, Rivka had no children, Yoel was the first Associate Chief Cantor of the congregation in Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">YM: He was professor of Hebrew Studies.</span> <span id="s79">The younger brother was also a cantor; they were both my pupils.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">YM: In Chazanut [studies of religious chants], I mean.</span> <span id="s82">We all went to Yeshivot, and the youngest brother, David, David Mandel, died in Israel in 1949.</span> <span id="s83">His, he already got his doctoral degree from the university in Budapest, with a yellow star on his lapel.</span> <span id="s84">He was a graduate of the seminary in Budapest, and, was a graduate of the university in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NL: What a distinguished family!</span></p> <p><span id="s86">YM: Interesting, maybe--he was a graduate of the, Hebrew gymnasium in Munkács, and maybe one distinction which does not apply, maybe, to too many people, is that after he went from Budapest because we were so very active in Zionist works--I wasn't home--he was engaged to a young lady by the name Hava Eisdorfer.</span> <span id="s87">Their wedding was supposed to take place in June in my Temple in Budapest.</span> <span id="s88">I wasn't home, of course, I was in labor camp already in 1940-1944, and it never took place, the wedding never took place, of course, but he went with a Kasztner group...</span></p> <p><span id="s89">NL: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">YM: ...to, eh, Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NL: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">YM: Not only that, because of my activity in Budapest, while I was there for ten years, my family was called upon to take them along in my absence...</span></p> <p><span id="s93">NL: Mmm</span></p> <p><span id="s94">YM: ...and that was, that was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">NL: Oh yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">YM: These people who you read in this...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">NL: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s98">YM: ...Yuri Brown story, they thought of it, because my brother was just as active.</span> <span id="s99">And my brother came to Israel after Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s100">And after all this, and taught for awhile in Gymnasium HaRaeali in Haifa and had an appointment to teach at the university in Yerushalaim [Jerusalem] of all things, Hebrew literature.</span> <span id="s101">And, he never reached that day, because he died in Israel in April of 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">NL: Now, let's go back a bit.</span> <span id="s103">I'd like to know a little about your parents.</span> <span id="s104">Can you tell me about father and mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">YM: Father grew up, probably, the same way as I did.</span> <span id="s106">He probably started heder [chuckles] when he was the age of three.</span> <span id="s107">He was a real Talmud chochem [scholar of Talmud].</span> <span id="s108">Very knowledgeable Jew.</span> <span id="s109">He also spoke these languages, I have mentioned before, perfectly.</span> <span id="s110">He had, quite a bit of knowledge in, in not only Sifrut [oral law] and, Talmud and Chumash and so on, but he was a Talmud chochem.</span> <span id="s111">As a matter of fact, he was not, though he was an ordained rabbi by his own rabbonim who gave him Hatorath Torah, and Hatorat rabbanot, he never acted, never was, a professional rabbi, but he pasket shayles [decided questions] as they said there, and took care of the Yeshuvim [settlements] all around us, and Avrohom Mandel was, eh, quite a bekovedigger [honorable Jew].</span> <span id="s112">My mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">NL: Did he, eh, make a living out of teaching, or did he have a separate occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">YM: No, no, he had fields and was in the, he was a farmer...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">NL: A farmer...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">YM: And I, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">NL: Were Jews able to own land at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s119">In those days, yes.</span> <span id="s120">My father, who was born in '77, I think, 1877.</span> <span id="s121">That was really the golden period of Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">YM: Because then, it was after '48, after the French Revolution and so on.</span> <span id="s124">And all these countries copied to a degree the French freedom, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">YM: And that expressed itself in the fact as well for Jews not to have any restrictions.</span> <span id="s127">Jews, as a matter of fact, were allowed to marry non-Jews, for which before they would have been burned on the, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">NL: Stake, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">YM: But in those days there was freedom.</span> <span id="s130">So, you could buy a house.</span> <span id="s131">You could get into business, you could, you could own fields and farms and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">NL: And so, you grew up on the land.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">YM: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s135">And was the family fairly comfortable, economically...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">YM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">NL: ...or did you have hardships?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">YM: You have to know, I mean, if I should go into this, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">YM: That in, in that part of Hungary in those days, let's say my days, after 1904, when I grew up to be at least to understand what's going on, 1910, '11, '12, and '13, '14, and even to '16, there is a river which was never controlled and never, never, put into shape, so to say, which every year brought floods and floods and floods.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">YM: My father became a poor man, I think, between 1910 and 1916.</span> <span id="s143">Poor.</span> <span id="s144">They made out somehow, but they weren't comfortable at the time anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NL: But, eh, the land...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">YM: The land...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NL: ...was still his, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s148">YM: ...belonged...</span></p> <p><span id="s149">NL: ...and was he able to recover?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">YM: Yes, some of it, and whatever could be done with it was done.</span> <span id="s151">But comfortable, he was not.</span> <span id="s152">Before his time, and, of course, my recollection doesn't go back to that, all these land, belonged to my mother's father.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">YM: Eh, and presumably he made a very, very comfortable living.</span> <span id="s155">So that shows that there must have come some kind of natural causes which made it impossible for them to be comfortable anymore.</span> <span id="s156">My mother, it may be worthwhile to mention, is the daughter of a man who was a teacher in 1830.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">NL: Oh my.</span> <span id="s158">A teacher in a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">YM: There was no school.</span> <span id="s160">He probably was a teacher...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">NL: Tutoring...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">YM: ...in a heder...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">NL: Oh, in a heder.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">YM: Where, I don't know.</span> <span id="s165">In a bigger village, 15, 20, 25, youngsters got together and he taught them the same things.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NL: So she was an educated woman, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">YM: Ya, she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NL: About how many Jews lived in your community, Cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">YM: 36.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">YM: 36 families, and maybe it's worthwhile to mention that the little community of Csepa had at one time close to 30 yeshivah bachurim in different yeshivot.</span> <span id="s172">30.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">NL: Extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">YM: And this is what pushed us.</span> <span id="s175">We wanted to be, to know a little more, and if Chaim knew this much, and got let's say Haftorat Torah, Moishe wanted to have the same thing, and this is...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">NL: You were high achievers.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">YM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">NL: What were your relations generally with the non-Jewish community?</span> <span id="s179">You've told us about the antisemitism of the children, but, let's say, father's relations with his non-Jewish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">YM: Very respectful.</span> <span id="s181">Very respectful.</span> <span id="s182">Because first of all they depended on him to a degree.</span> <span id="s183">They worked for him to a degree.</span> <span id="s184">But let me talk about two particular cases, and I think this would be reflective on what we are talking, and in answer to your question.</span> <span id="s185">On one side of our house, because we lived in a house, a tremendous house, the family who lived alongside of us was the Greek Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s186">They had sons and daughters living in the same place, but I'm talking about the original family.</span> <span id="s187">On the other side they were so-called "Reformed"...</span></p> <p><span id="s188">NL: Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">YM: Christians.</span> <span id="s190">We both, we were in the best of...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">NL: Terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">YM: ...terms.</span> <span id="s193">They both, my mother spoke to the old lady on one side in Russian or Hungarian.</span> <span id="s194">They spoke to each other, they exchanged views, but we knew that inside, deep, there is a certain hatred because they were extremely devout Catholics, Greek Catholic Christians, and they were immensely under the influence of their clergy.</span> <span id="s195">At the time, which I can't remember, at home, we felt that the Reformed Christians, whatever denomination the Reformed movement may belong to, they were a little more lenient.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">NL: Yes, more modern.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">YM: More modern.</span> <span id="s198">We played together with these boys, with the children all together.</span> <span id="s199">We sang their songs, we went to the same school...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NL: So, it was a relatively benign situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">YM: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">NL: There were no antisemitic episodes of violence?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">YM: No, and if they are thinking of acts like this sort, let's say, pogroms and so on...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">YM: ...they were very, very far from our, from our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s207">And what large town were you close to?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">YM: We were close to two towns.</span> <span id="s209">One is Anagy Szo'llo's, that's spelled A-N-A-G-Y, second word, S-Z-O-'-L-L-O'-S, and our district capital, let's say, was Halmi, H-A-L-M-I.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">NL: And did you go into these towns from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">YM: Oh, yes, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">NL: Many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">YM: As a matter of fact, after 1918, when our part of the, our part of Hungary, became Czechoslovakia, I studied in Anagy Szo'llo's.</span> <span id="s214">As a matter of fact, my first yeshivah was Anagy Szo'llo's.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">YM: I studied with a great man, a great tzaddik [very pious man], a great man, eh, Yosef Nehemiah Kormitzer.</span> <span id="s217">He was my first rebbe in yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">NL: And you spoke about your going to school with the non-Jewish children.</span> <span id="s219">Did you then go to the heder and to a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">YM: When I hear parents--and I had the privilege of teaching here in Beth Judah of Logan when I was the cantor for about 18 years--and I hear parents consulting, constantly consulting, how to make Johnny to want to go to school, and to want to do things, I'm always reminded of this, of this episode of my life.</span> <span id="s221">We got up at 6 o'clock in the morning, took care of ourselves, even if we were five years old, now took the koss in die hent and gevashen die finger [took the glass in hand, washed the fingers] and gezukt Modeh Ani [and said the morning prayer], and we went to heder.</span> <span id="s222">And I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s223">And in my profession, many many times it came back, the way we started, to study in the morning, either any one of the Neviim [Prophets], [sings] "wai be mo--eh--ah--" That niggun [melody], that was beautiful, it was nice, and this was the way we studied, and it was no question that the child will be nervous if I get him up at 6 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s224">That was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">NL: This was expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">YM: Right.</span> <span id="s227">Eh, we, we stayed there, and davened [prayed], had the morning service.</span> <span id="s228">Until 7:30.</span> <span id="s229">Whenever we got there, 7:30.</span> <span id="s230">At 7:30 we went home to have breakfast.</span> <span id="s231">Because no one had breakfast before davening, of course.</span> <span id="s232">And we had our breakfast and went to the school, that means, the elementary school, the regular elementary school, where we remained until eleven o'clock.</span> <span id="s233">At eleven o'clock we rushed back to our heder and were in the heder until 12:00.</span> <span id="s234">Then we studied chumash, that was the chumash period.</span> <span id="s235">Then we went back home, had the dinner used to be in Europe, you know, in mid-day.</span> <span id="s236">We had, eh, Mittagmahl [mid-day meal], you know, and at two o'clock we were back in the public school.</span> <span id="s237">We stayed in the public school until 4:00, sometimes 4:15, and as soon as we were dismissed there, we ran back to the heder...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">YM: ...and repeated Neviim and studied chumash.</span> <span id="s240">Whoever was ready for it studied Mishnaios, or Gemura.</span> <span id="s241">Or whatever.</span> <span id="s242">And we stayed there till about 6:00.</span> <span id="s243">So this way of learning, and this way of, of doing things is maybe not modern, but I think it was extremely helpful in our Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">NL: Extraordinary.</span> <span id="s245">Such discipline that you must have...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">YM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">NL: ...lived by.</span> <span id="s248">And the play time was Sunday, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">YM: Play time was Sunday or whenever we could find the time for it.</span> <span id="s250">Play was not, all work and no play was no problem there.</span> <span id="s251">Whenever you could do it, you did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">NL: Squeezed it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">YM: Squeezed it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">NL: Were you musical as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s256">Musical, not musically educated.</span> <span id="s257">I was never musically educated, because I didn't have the chance.</span> <span id="s258">There were no teachers.</span> <span id="s259">I had a very sweet child's voice as a child.</span> <span id="s260">I knew, of course, how to daven.</span> <span id="s261">And I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s262">I was maybe eight or nine years old when I davened in my, in our own congregation at home in Csepa, maariv [evening prayer], on eh, Pesach, Shavuos, Succot, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s263">And eh, and there were, there were those additional prayers, those inserts, we call them marouvis [evening prayers], lel shamurim [prayers at Pesach night], and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s264">And I did very well, I, I knew it was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">NL: Eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">YM: When I hear people prepare for the Bar Mitzvah a year or two earlier, I'm just angry, because if we were called and we were eight, nine years old, for a maftir [last reading of the Torah], it was no problem.</span> <span id="s267">I mean, it was, as a matter of fact the children were called as a rule, because that was the only kibbud [honor] a boy could get in those days, to be called for a maftir [one who reads concluding verses of the Torah portion], because another aliyah he couldn't get; the shevah korim [seven readers] had to be adults.</span> <span id="s268">So, we were the additional, an achron [the last], or a maftir, we could be called too.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">NL: This was all very natural in the cycle of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">YM: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">NL: And so your childhood was passed quite happily.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">YM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">NL: And, do you have some memories of the war years?</span> <span id="s274">Did your family have to move out?</span> <span id="s275">Were any, were there any deprivations?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">YM: No.</span> <span id="s277">In 1914 when the war broke out, as you well know now, I was ten years old.</span> <span id="s278">This is just a side line.</span> <span id="s279">I remember exactly the spot where I read the first announcement of Franz Josef [emperor of Austria/Hungary], who said, "I have thought it through very carefully.</span> <span id="s280">I have given it all the consideration, and we must step in..." and so on and so forth, "the war".</span> <span id="s281">The war years I remember very well because there was terrible pressure on all of us.</span> <span id="s282">Because you have to know that we lived right underneath the Carpathian Mountains.</span> <span id="s283">And the first lines maybe were about 100 km, which is about 60-65 miles away from us.</span> <span id="s284">But I remember particularly during the war two years, when people who lived at the very end of the Galician part of Austro-Hungary, had to evac-, be evacuated and evacuated, and came to us before Pesach.</span> <span id="s285">What part of the war that was, I don't remember any more, but these people, about 60 families, came into our little community before Pesach, and I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s286">Everyone was put up.</span> <span id="s287">At families, my father, zichronah l'bracha [of blessed memory], gave a special, gave special permits to use on that Pesach kitniyot [forbidden food].</span> <span id="s288">He consulted with his rabbi, and they gave permission not only for matzoh or potatoes or what, but kitniyot.</span> <span id="s289">In other words, vegetables...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">NL: Baked beans</span></p> <p><span id="s291">YM: Beans which you wouldn't eat normally.</span> <span id="s292">So, all these families were put up.</span> <span id="s293">I think this was repeated in '15, '16, '15 and '16, because as the war went on, either the Russians pushed the Austro-Hungarians back, or the Austro-Hungarians pushed the Russians back, but the war went on in that part of the world, very close to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">NL: Very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">YM: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">NL: But you weren't involved in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s297">YM: We were never evacuated.</span> <span id="s298">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">NL: ...war actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">YM: We had, of course, my mother's brother in particular, you may even know about him, Dr. Moishe Bolgar...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">NL: The, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s302">YM: Braun, original name.</span> <span id="s303">His original name was Moishe Braun.</span> <span id="s304">He was a lawyer by profession, and a first rate Hebrew novelist and writer and translator and, so he was at the battlefield all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">NL: A soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">YM: A soldier.</span> <span id="s307">And we were under his, under this pressure that we were terribly scared for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">NL: For him.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">YM: He was like more than an uncle to us.</span> <span id="s310">And we constantly were scared.</span> <span id="s311">He was then, later on during the war he was the, the man responsible for a military newspaper called Manilova, where he was still in great danger all the time, but at least he didn't have to stay in the first line and shoot at someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">NL: Yes, and, the end of the war meant changes for your community.</span> <span id="s313">The peace treaty.</span> <span id="s314">What were the territorial changes that involved your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">YM: No, first of all, before it came to the very end and before it was decided that our part of the world should belong to Czechoslovakia, or that Czechoslovakia should be called into being at all, there were the--you know that the war in Hungary, especially where we belonged to, that part of Hungary came to an end by the White Revolution, White Flower Revolution, I don't know how that Flower is called, but the Socialist movement became stronger, later on the Communist and here Kun Béla comes in--the one we mentioned before--the Hungary became Communistic.</span> <span id="s316">If it was one or the other, especially if it was Communistic, some people suffered from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">NL: And you were in what sector?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">YM: We were in, you mean as a party?</span> <span id="s319">The sector of the land?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">YM: We were in the sector which was occupied once in awhile for shorter or longer periods by the Communist powers, I wouldn't even call it regime, because it was no regime, or when others came who were stronger, so we were occupied by the White, they called them at the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s322">NL: The anti-Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">YM: Ya.</span> <span id="s324">By the Red; by the Rumanians; by the Czechs; by the, you name it, we were occupied by these powers.</span> <span id="s325">And this, of course, went on in the end of 1917, '18, up to '19.</span> <span id="s326">I became bar mitzvah, as you can see it, in about '19.</span> <span id="s327">After my bar mitzvah, I went to study in this Natsalutsch1 [phonetic] yeshivah.</span> <span id="s328">At the time when I went in 1919...</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s330">NL: Now you were saying that your area was in the hands of a whole variety of occupation forces.</span> <span id="s331">Do you have some impressions of any of those particular periods?</span> <span id="s332">Did you suffer especially under any particular occupation, Cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">YM: I myself as a child, of course, knew very little what's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">YM: Because finally in 1917 I was still only 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">YM: However, what I remember and, these, I don't know if those are interesting observations or not, I remember, for instance, that we had a dog, and the Rumanians came and shot the dog.</span> <span id="s338">My brothers and sisters, they buried the dog and cried for the dog.</span> <span id="s339">This made a very deep impression on me.</span> <span id="s340">I know that the dog was laying around there dead [chuckling] and they didn't bury him, they wanted me to be home to, to bury him, too [chuckling].</span> <span id="s341">So this kind of childish, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">NL: Was this part of the anti-Jewish feeling on the part of the Rumanians, do you suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">YM: No, it was rather to make the people feel that they are in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">YM: Now they went from house to house and picked up from flour, from sugar, from chickens, from soap, you name it, and they took it away from the family.</span> <span id="s346">So this kind of thing, and this, and they were, it wasn't limited, this kind of activity was not limited to the Rumanians only, to any one who came, with the exception of the Czechs.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">NL: Ah yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">YM: They came well provided.</span> <span id="s349">When they came, they came orderly, in an orderly fashion.</span> <span id="s350">You know, of course, that the Czechs, many of them, were administrators of the Austro-Hungarian Empire already, and they knew very well how to handle people, most of them did.</span> <span id="s351">Of course, in the moment they took over, things started to quiet down, and people knew that if they have a chicken, the soldiers won't come to take it away from them, or, if they had, let's say, geese, fat, or lard, or whatever, not like the Rumanians or the others, they won't take it away from them.</span> <span id="s352">Stores started to open up again.</span> <span id="s353">Materials in the stores started to appear.</span> <span id="s354">Shoes were available.</span> <span id="s355">For years no shoes were available in our vicinity.</span> <span id="s356">You couldn't get a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s357">I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s358">When I went to Nagyhalasz [phonetic] Yeshiva, I still had those little slats made out of wood.</span> <span id="s359">This is the way shoes were manufactured instead of soles.</span> <span id="s360">So, this, these are my impressions.</span> <span id="s361">Of course, what can a thirteen-year-old know...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">NL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">YM: ...in this kind of a boiling world.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">NL: Yes, did your parents ever talk to you or to the children about the Bolshevik period of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">YM: In my parents' mind, and I have to say this quite honestly, rightly or wrongly, Bolsheviks, because we were born, grew up, and lived in a different society, whatever was Red, whatever was Bolshevik, was poison.</span> <span id="s366">They just couldn't, they couldn't even get to the point, I'm afraid, to consider it.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">NL: But this was how most Jews felt, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">YM: I would say so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">NL: Yes, there was a lot to fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">YM: Yes, a lot to fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">NL: A lot to fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">YM: A.</span> <span id="s373">The financial standings of everyone were in danger, and second, the religion...</span></p> <p><span id="s374">NL: Anti-religious...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">YM: ...which was their life...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">YM: ...which was their, their mainstay, was constantly in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">YM: And we heard that after, I don't know, we knew about all the troubles, let's say the, the Russian Czar and his family and his generals gave to the Jewish population of Russia, we knew about all that, and we were sorry that they were killed.</span> <span id="s380">But Fonya-ganef [Russian thief], as we called him in those days, and as he was called by the people who came to us, eh, we knew very well what happened to them, and we couldn't really, so to say, say kaddish after them.</span> <span id="s381">We were sorry as human beings that they were killed, but we knew that religion is out, and no more heder, and no more Mishnah, and no more, no more, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s382">NL: No more property, no more private property.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">YM: Right, yes, no more private property.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">NL: A lot to fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">YM: So from this you will see what our emotions and even logical considerations were.</span> <span id="s386">Now my father, or mother, never sat down with us to have a political...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">NL: Discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">YM: Political discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">NL: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s390">YM: I mean in those days.</span> <span id="s391">Among the boys I was the oldest, but my oldest sister wasn't even there.</span> <span id="s392">She left Europe in 1913.</span> <span id="s393">My younger sister got married and she didn't live in the same place where we lived.</span> <span id="s394">I really did not attend too many, and didn't even have a chance, to get the feeling--just what I heard superficially--and, of course, if Reb Moishe or Reb Chaim said that this is terrible, I had to think it is terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">NL: And, and it was.</span> <span id="s396">It was.</span> <span id="s397">Uh, now in 1918, 1919, what was the political setup that affected your town, Cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">YM: In 1918 and 1919, as I said, our part of the land changed owners, so to say, many many times, but in '19 I went to Nagyhalasz, to my first yeshiva.</span> <span id="s399">Nagyhalasz at the time, already, was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s400">And there was a great relaxation.</span> <span id="s401">Our village was divided by the, rather, about four kilometers from our village we had a river called Tisza, which comes from the high, up in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">NL: Carpathian.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">YM: Carpathian mountains.</span> <span id="s404">And, eh, flew through, close by to our river, to our village.</span> <span id="s405">When I used to come home in the first z'man--z'man is a semester, six months, you know--when I used to come home, in '19 or maybe '20, from Nagyhalasz, for a Shabbes to be home with my parents, we didn't need anything else, but a permit from the, Czechoslovakian police, let's say, or Gendarmerie, or whatever it was, that we are citizens or...</span></p> <p><span id="s406">NL: Residents.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">YM: ...residents of this and this village.</span> <span id="s408">And even if we were stopped, we could pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">NL: But your parents were technically within Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">YM: Technically, they were within Hungary, yes.</span> <span id="s411">Because it wasn't decided that this wouldn't be Hungary any more at the time.</span> <span id="s412">When then this other side of the Tisza was, eh, adopted to be also Czechoslovakia up to a certain point, then things relaxed in our village as well.</span> <span id="s413">But in Nagyhalasz, really we didn't have this when I got there anymore, because Nagyhalasz, as such, because it was on the right hand side of this river, immediately was decided that this will be part of Podkarpatska Rus, yes, but it will belong as such, eh, to the Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">YM: Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s416">Now you know that Czechoslovakia consisted of Podkarpatska Rus, Slovakia, Moravia, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">NL: Bohemia.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">YM: Bohemia and so on.</span> <span id="s419">So, therefore, this was just a part of it.</span> <span id="s420">Where we lived was part of Podkarpatska Rus, all of it belongs, now, of course, to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: To Russia, yes.</span> <span id="s422">And did you live with a private family, or did you live in the yeshiva?</span> <span id="s423">Was there a dormitory?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">YM: This again is a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s425">Ich hab gegessen cost-teg ["to support learning" families provided meals for Yeshiva students on different days], if you know what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">NL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">YM: I eat a..</span> <span id="s428">.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">NL: Eating days.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">YM: Right.</span> <span id="s431">Every day at a different place.</span> <span id="s432">I was just extremely lucky that my father, as a, a, as the owner of some...</span></p> <p><span id="s433">NL: Land.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">YM: ...land and so on had cattle to sell, and had sheep to sell, and had to buy things from, eh, materials for the farm and so on, so he had these friends, and I, just by coincidence, used to have my cost-teg at these families.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">YM: As a matter of fact, my sister-in-law, Chava, who lives in Israel, her father was an associate in some way of my father, and I had a cost-tug [singular], a day, to get my lunch or dinner, whatever in their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">NL: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">YM: So that I knew Chava Eizdorfer even before she was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">NL: [Laughs].</span> <span id="s440">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s441">And this was a large yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">YM: It wasn't a large yeshiva; it was a much bigger town than ours.</span> <span id="s443">As I say it was the capital of this district, Ungvar, and, eh, I will say in Nagyhalasz, at the time probably have lived 350 Jewish, 400 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s444">So that was already a big town.</span> <span id="s445">Nagyhalasz had a beautiful, big synagogue, of course Orthodox, two, three betai medrushim [class-rooms], and it was a nice, nice town.</span> <span id="s446">The yeshiva as such was never big, and was never, there was never a yeshiva in Nagyhalasz in spite of the fact that the great Shmelcha Klein was the, the Rov in Nagyhalasz, it was never a yeshiva town until Yosef Nehemiah Kornitz, zichron l'bracha, came and organized this yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">YM: Which consisted always of about 30, 35, less than 40 bocherim [young men].</span> <span id="s449">And mainly youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">NL: Youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">YM: Young people, 14, 15, I myself studied in Nagyhalasz for two-and-a-half years; after that I already went to Ungvar, which was the capital city of Podkarpatska Rus, Uzhgorod, today it's called Uzhgorod.</span> <span id="s452">Eh, and the Rov was the chief rabbi of Podkarpatska Rus, Erbavram Yosef Greenwald, he was a haver of my father in his father's yeshiva in Ust.</span> <span id="s453">So, I went to this yeshiva to study.</span> <span id="s454">After that, in other words, we didn't spend, I don't know, the time in Nagyhalasz until we became ready for, for anything like hora'ah [teaching], or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s455">We studied and got a good basic education there.</span> <span id="s456">I myself was there, I think, for five z'man [semesters], that means two-and-a-half years.</span> <span id="s457">After that I went to--started to study in Ungvar.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">NL: Oh my.</span> <span id="s459">And, were there any secular studies involved, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">YM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">NL: ...did you have a tutor for

than the fourth, maximum the sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">NL: Grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">YM: Eh, so that when I came to Nagyhalasz and my uncle--this uncle which I mentioned before, was a great influence--to get some secular knowledge as well, I studied privately.</span> <span id="s467">At the end of the season we took our exams in a private way.</span> <span id="s468">Let me mention something very interesting.</span> <span id="s469">I never in my life had any exercises, any kind of painting or drawing; that was just strange to me.</span> <span id="s470">Farbrenggen di tzait oif a solcha narishkaiten [to spend time on such nonsense], who did it?</span> <span id="s471">So, at the end, when I was prepared, ya, in Nagyhalasz, there was the middle shule, and the [unclear] it was called, where you could get above the elementary school four grades, four years.</span> <span id="s472">So, I wanted to have at least get that what I could.</span> <span id="s473">I don't know if my father ever discussed this question with, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">NL: Your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">YM: No, my uncle he did, but with my rebbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">YM: Yes, you know, that was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">YM: Hachutzoniyot [outside studies] wasn't simple to study.</span> <span id="s480">I don't know if he did or if he didn't, but he advised me, probably at the influence of my uncle, to go to A, B, C, D teachers, prepare with them, and at the end they gave us then, we went to school, that was a day assigned for...</span></p> <p><span id="s481">NL: Examinations.</span></p> <p><span

Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">YM: But among other things it is, eh issur veheter, [prohibition permitted] you know, kashres [dietary laws], and Shabbes and yom tov [holiday] and so on, so, under his guidance, his son, who died here already, in Brooklyn, who was his successor later on, I studied with him, Yehoshua Greenwald, and together we were ordained, if I may call it that, to be rabbonim, and to, that was not yet haturis rabbonis [ordination], it was just to paskan and to paskan shailles in issur veheter.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">NL: Mmm Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">YM: Up to simankěfiyot.</span> <span id="s524">That was the way it went.</span> <span id="s525">And that's the way, the way it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">NL: That was the cycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">YM: The cycle, yes.</span> <span id="s528">That was the highest.</span> <span id="s529">That was the most, eh, progress, the highest grade, let's say, achieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">YM: So this is what I finished in Ungvar.</span> <span id="s532">From Ungvar I was, at the age of 19 and older, probably, drafted into the Czech army.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">YM: I think we should stop here and now and we could probably, ya, and we will...</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NL: We'll continue, all right, thank you very much, eh.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">NL: We are continuing the interview with Cantor Mandel, March 3rd, 1982, Nora Levin interviewing.</span> <span id="s537">Cantor Mandel, would you now tell us the circumstances under which you, went into the Czech army, and your experiences in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">YM: I see, eh...[tape turns off briefly]</span></p> <p><span id="s539">YM: I'm sorry for this interruption.</span> <span id="s540">You asked me to tell you how I got into the Czech army?</span> <span id="s541">Of course I was drafted and, like anybody else, at the time [phone rings; pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s542">NL: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">YM: Is this O.K.?</span> <span id="s544">The draft into the Czech army went like everywhere else.</span> <span id="s545">You had to register, and, the draft board saw you in March, for what I had to come home especially from my yeshiva, and I was found, eh, able to, to serve.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">NL: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">YM: That was in 1924.</span> <span id="s548">1924.</span> <span id="s549">I then, when I was drafted, I went back to yeshiva for my last exams which I had to go through, and with that I started to look, maybe for a position for the High Holy Days, because draftees had to report October the 1st, and on October the 1st, was I think erev or Rosh Hashanah, I tried out in a few places.</span> <span id="s550">Finally I, performed the services, I davened, and served in Ruzomberok [phonetic], that's called Russaveit [phonetic] eh, where, eh, a high military official who was a physician who had a sanatorium in Detatra [phonetic] told me I shouldn't be concerned, he will give me proper documentation that I got sick on the way to Olmütz where I had to, mail some letter that I had to report, and this would be accepted.</span> <span id="s551">The only thing what will happen is that I will have to serve a few days, and in this case it was ten days, after I am finished with my year-and-a-half of service.</span> <span id="s552">It happened that way in 1926 I got out of this early Czech military service.</span> <span id="s553">A very interesting thing and maybe worthwhile to mention just for one reason, how the Czech, who--how liberal and wonderful they were.</span> <span id="s554">In the Czech army, any candidate for the priesthood, the rabbinate, or such, had the right to, after basic training, which everyone had to go through, and that was ten weeks, he had the right to report or to request or was even asked if he wants to go to a school, school for military administration was one way, the second possibility was a school in different hospitals to learn and study and become a male nurse.</span> <span id="s555">I chose the hospitals, the military nursing, and went through all kinds of courses, and finally I was placed in Olmütz, which is a town, Olomoudz3, spelled A-L-O-M-O-U-D-Z, where I served in their basheli, in, in the hospital there, Nahradisko, and Novy Svet [all phonetic].</span> <span id="s556">Those were the two places where I served.</span> <span id="s557">The patients, the soldiers, came in the morning, with this kind, that kind, the other kind of illnesses, and we always had two doctors.</span> <span id="s558">It happened that the commandant of the school, who was a, eh, colonel, a Jew, Dr. Galner, I will never forget his name, he was the head of these departments where I served.</span> <span id="s559">So, I served there, and from there I was discharged from the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">NL: That would be 1927?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">YM: 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">NL: 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">YM: '24 I was taken, '26 I got out.</span> <span id="s564">The military service at the time was a year-and-a-half, eighteen months.</span> <span id="s565">From there, I went home and, eh, as every Jewish father, my father saw my future very well-established and wanted me to get married and so on.</span> <span id="s566">I, however, as I have mentioned before, got infected with music.</span> <span id="s567">It happened partially that when I came in, as a, as a, into the military, one day a lieutenant came out to the exercises and asked who could help him out.</span> <span id="s568">He was studying a new operetta for the, to be performed on the celebration of Masaryk's birthday, and he would like some people who could sing to help him, and so on.</span> <span id="s569">So my friends, who knew me from yeshiva, they heard me daven there and all that, said, "He has a nice voice."</span> <span id="s570">So, this man arranged with my commanding officer to see him.</span> <span id="s571">I didn't know one musical note at the time, not at all.</span> <span id="s572">And this wonderful human being was patient with me and taught me Prodanánevěsta, the, the, ten, the Bride, whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s573">NL: Bartered Bride?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">YM: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">NL: Smetana.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">YM: Smetana.</span> <span id="s577">He taught it to me.</span> <span id="s578">Of course I didn't know, I was never in a theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">NL: Uhm hmn.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">YM: So, I didn't know when to go out and when to come in, but he pushed me in and pulled me out, just like, but I knew the music very well, because music, a musical ear I had.</span> <span id="s581">I learned everything by ear.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">NL: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">YM: Later on, then, when I sang many other occasions, I used to speak--there were many Hungarian speaking people who didn't even learn Czech--so I used to be their, eh, to, I used to speak to them at celebrations and so on.</span> <span id="s584">But when I came home, we had to make a deal with my father.</span> <span id="s585">I am not going to get married.</span> <span id="s586">I wanted to go straight back, whatever it will take, but study music.</span> <span id="s587">One more thing, maybe is interesting to characterize how the Czechs handled things.</span> <span id="s588">This very superintendent of performances in Olomouc told me that if I want to, the military division, that division of my, of my military, of the military...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">NL: Experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">YM: Ya.</span> <span id="s591">Would pay all the expenses to train me for the opera.</span> <span id="s592">He felt I had good enough a voice for that.</span> <span id="s593">However, the only thing I have to be, I have to sign for, is four years study is a minimum, and then I have to sign that wherever I will be assigned into a chorus or to parts in an opera or operetta or so on in the state theaters, I will have to do that.</span> <span id="s594">I will have to sing, or to perform, whatever.</span> <span id="s595">I thought it was a tremendous idea.</span> <span id="s596">I had an uncle in, who was a little more liberal than my parents, who was a lawyer by profession, so I wrote to him and told him about the great thing what I'm looking forward to.</span> <span id="s597">He understood and went over to my village from a place where he lived was about 40km.</span> <span id="s598">He went over on Sunday and sat with my parents, with my father mainly, for hours, and tried to explain to him what great future is before me.</span> <span id="s599">My father had one answer, and he told my mother, this is the way my uncle told it back to me, my mother's name was Rezel.</span> <span id="s600">"Rezel, we"--Moishe was my uncle's name--"Moishe is here for a very special purpose, to tell us what he told us, and you heard what he said.</span> <span id="s601">If this comes through, then we had four sons.</span> <span id="s602">We will be left with three."</span> <span id="s603">It was a terrible shock to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">YM: And even to my uncle.</span> <span id="s606">But when he wrote to me about it.</span> <span id="s607">I just didn't have the, the discipline was so immense, was so unbreakable, that I just couldn't see my myself to, to do anything else but to accept his decision.</span> <span id="s608">So, we made the deal with my father.</span> <span id="s609">When I came back after I was done with my military service, we spoke about this, and he told me he will never agree I should be a dingle dangle singer or be an operetta singer, whatever.</span> <span id="s610">Anyway, we made a deal, not to get married, what he wanted, and not to join the Academy of Music in Brünn or Prague, as the Superintendent of Music suggested.</span> <span id="s611">So, I went back to yeshiva.</span> <span id="s612">And I studied for two years in Pressburg, where I stood again before the va-adat [board of Rabbis] and I am the musmacht [ordained Rabbi] today of Pressburg yeshiva.</span> <span id="s613">Maybe this is the only good thing which comes from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">NL: Were you contented in that experience, Cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">YM: In Pressburg, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">YM: I was, because I made myself available to many, of course you know that the congregations in Europe were organized, there was one community, one kehillah, but there were many small synagogues.</span> <span id="s618">And I was always invited to daven here, to daven there, and I was paid for it.</span> <span id="s619">And this money which I made there, I could continue my musical studies right in Pressburg proper, and eventually travel to Vienna and pay for my lessons, which I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">NL: These were vocal lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">YM: Vocal lessons, musical lessons.</span> <span id="s622">I didn't know, I had no musical training.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">NL: Did you go to a conservatory, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s624">YM: Later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">NL: Later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">YM: In Vienna.</span> <span id="s627">In 1926 I finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s629">NL: This is a continuation of our interview with Cantor Mandel, tape two, side one.</span> <span id="s630">Yes, you were saying about your musical education?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">YM: I got my musical education from 1926, '27, '28, when I already used to go to Vienna and had lessons in Pressburg.</span> <span id="s632">In 1928, finally, I went over to Vienna and settled there.</span> <span id="s633">The way to settle there for me was one way.</span> <span id="s634">I became the cantor of a small congregation which was supposed to have been built later on, a beautiful temple and so on, but when I came there, the name of it was Montef-Temple Montefiore, Tabelstrasse achtunddreissig [38].</span> <span id="s635">That's where I functioned as a cantor and got a salary which was very small, but I taught a lot.</span> <span id="s636">I had children to prepare for bar mitzvahs and gave lessons in Talmud and other Hebrew lessons.</span> <span id="s637">And this is the way I maintained myself in Vienna while I was studying, was the cantor of this little congregation, and did other work, and studied.</span> <span id="s638">Now there I was already a student in Neues Wiener Konservatorium.</span> <span id="s639">That was the place where I studied music and voice and piano and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">NL: You had the best of both worlds.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">YM: Ya, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">NL: So, tell me a little about your impressions of the Jewish community as you experienced it.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">YM: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">NL: In Vienna, yes.</span> <span id="s645">And whether there were any ominous signs of antisemitism or the coming of the Nazi movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">YM: If I will tell you that at the time when I was in Vienna, or a little before that, a school was organized there for the training of Bet Sefer L'hazanim Vemorim [school for cantors and teachers].</span> <span id="s647">However, in order to understand how it could be organized, you have to know that at the time I was fortunate to meet and the school was lucky, I think, to have been organized at the time when the chief rabbi of Austria in Vienna, of course, was Rav Chajes.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">NL: How is that spelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">YM: C-H-A-J-E-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">NL: Oh, very well-known.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">YM: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">NL: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">YM: A person who was not only the great lamdan [scholar], was not only the, the, extremely well educated person in every field, but he loved, he was never married, and he always told us that we are his family.</span> <span id="s654">He used to come into school.</span> <span id="s655">I will never forget it and I consider it as a great, eh, as an extraordinary occurrence in my life.</span> <span id="s656">Rav Chajes came in to school and at the time he prepared something, either it was Yom Kippur katan service or something or minha for weekdays, and he looked at me and came over to me and got a hold of my cheeks and said, "Solche bokerim darfen mir haben hier [We need such young men here!]</span> <span id="s657">."</span></p> <p><span id="s658">NL: [Chuckles] Oh, how beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">YM: Eh, he heard about me, about my background, and so on.</span> <span id="s660">But maybe there is another thing.</span> <span id="s661">After I studied for about two years or something like that in Vienna, in the meantime I went to Bet Sefer L'hazanim Vemorim, went, had these teachings, was the cantor of this small congregation, something happened in Vienna.</span> <span id="s662">The 20th District of Vienna looked for a hazan at the time.</span> <span id="s663">And this is again interesting maybe for people to know.</span> <span id="s664">It's history.</span> <span id="s665">The Vienna congregation, even for its smallest district, like Florence, or it was the name of the 20th District, was looking for a cantor, so they, in those days there was no Cantor's Assembly and there was no placement commission, so they put an announcement in the newspapers that this-and-this age, and this-and-this quality and so on and so forth is needed, and whoever felt like applying, applied.</span> <span id="s666">One hundred and eighteen people applied in 1928, young people, all talented, all very fine young upcoming people, and out of this amount of people, about 12 were chosen, not for an audition, but für eine Vorprobe [pre-audition].</span> <span id="s667">That means before they were given permission to perform in synagogue, the board, the rabbis, the music educators, the conductors in the different temples, the cantors of the different temples, came together in no other place but the Seitenstetten Temple.</span> <span id="s668">And there they listened to him, and each in his department posed questions to the candidate.</span> <span id="s669">If the young man passed, then he got permission to give an audition.</span> <span id="s670">I had one of my teachers, who was the last chief cantor of the Seitenstetten Temple in Vienna, Heinrich Fischer, was the chief cantor of Vienna because he was Sulzer's successor.</span> <span id="s671">And he arranged for someone from Nuesatz Ujvidék, Novi Sad, in Yugoslavia, where the congregation was also seeking a cantor.</span> <span id="s672">He arranged for a man by the name of Mr. Gross to be able to attend and listen to the people, to the twelve or whatever who will hear there.</span> <span id="s673">He had to have special permission for it, but he got it for him.</span> <span id="s674">This Mr. Gross came from Germany, from the Fair, went home, on his way back to Yugoslavia he stayed in Vienna, I don't know what, and came to this eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">NL: Examination?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">YM: Examination, yes.</span> <span id="s677">He heard me and told my teacher he likes what he heard and he would like me to come down to Yugoslavia--Novi Sad--for an audition.</span> <span id="s678">At the same time in my family there was a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s679">One of my sisters who was the immediate child after me, had galoppierende Tuberkulose [consumption].</span> <span id="s680">And my parents weren't in good financial standings, and I was just sick all the time to help her, to try to get her to the doctor or somewhere, where we thought at least she would get some help.</span> <span id="s681">So I knew I had to get a bigger position, more money, and to help.</span> <span id="s682">My sister, unfortunately, died.</span> <span id="s683">All my efforts didn't help her.</span> <span id="s684">And, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">NL: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">YM: Rivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">NL: That was Rivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">YM: Rivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">YM: Eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">NL: Were you able to go to Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s693">I spoke to my teacher, Chais Fischer, Hazan Fischer, and he arranged for me at a certain date to go to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s694">At the meantime, one of the rabbis, Dr. Bach in Vienna who heard me there, said his son-in-law is the rabbi in Groningen, Holland, and he thinks I am the ideal candidate for his congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">NL: Well well.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">YM: So, I went to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s697">I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s698">I think it was the 19th of April, 1928.</span> <span id="s699">And I gave an audition.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">NL: It was in Novi Sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">YM: In Novi Sad.</span> <span id="s702">N-O-V-I, next word is capital S-A-D, Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s703">I say this because I will come back to another point in the same place later.</span> <span id="s704">So I went down there and I davened...</span></p> <p><span id="s705">NL: Excuse me, before we go there, eh, Cantor, did you detect any signs of growing Nazi activity in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">YM: In Vienna?</span> <span id="s707">Yes, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">NL: Can you talk about that a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s710">I used to spend a lot of time in the house of Oberkantor Fischer.</span> <span id="s711">And he had a son, Alex, who at the time was a student at the university.</span> <span id="s712">And one day I--it's very clear in my mind--he came home and told his parents in Hungarian, because they came from Hungary and they still spoke it, "Please, please, whatever the great position of the- eh, to be Sulzer's successor, whatever money you make here, Father, whatever comfort you have here, please don't remain here, because this thing will just fall apart.</span> <span id="s713">It is impossible.</span> <span id="s714">Today in this department of the university there were fights, and Jewish people were beaten up and weren't let go to listen to the lectures, and so on."</span> <span id="s715">But you could see it even sometimes in the streets and, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">NL: For example?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">YM: For example, eh, men fighting outside and a hundred people around.</span> <span id="s718">No one knew what it's all about, so someone said, "Yes, this man called the other man, 'You dirty Jew.'</span> <span id="s719">And this one couldn't take it and started a fight."</span> <span id="s720">Another thing, people used to sit in the coffee houses when people used to walk by--and I experienced this myself--and they made just remarks, "This is stable, the Jewish stable, where they sit around and they do nothing, they just live on our money and our land, and so on and so forth."</span> <span id="s721">It was not as organized as it became later, but it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s722">NL: It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">YM: Brewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">NL: And discernible.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s726">Yes.</span> <span id="s727">Definitely yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">NL: Was there a Nazi movement yet that you recall?</span> <span id="s729">An Austrian Nazi movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">YM: I was told that in Oberstreig at the time, around Graz and Linz, there were already people communicating with German Nazis and, you have to know, and you know it just as well as I do, that in the middle 20's, already '23, '24, Hitler was already arrested, was already in jail, and was already writing his eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s731">NL: Mein Kampf.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">YM: Mein Kampf and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s733">And that influenced many people.</span> <span id="s734">When I see for instance that with, The Sound of Music, I see the same thing what I really experienced.</span> <span id="s735">How many times did it happen that we wanted to go in Austria especially is eh famous that people bought for Ausflüge, eh... [excursions]</span></p> <p><span id="s736">NL: Outings?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">YM: Outings.</span> <span id="s738">And how many times were we told, "Don't go there."</span> <span id="s739">I don't know where, this place, that place, "'Cause there there is something preparing for this and this day, and if a group of young Jews will be seen somewhere," though we didn't look like Jews but, "eh, there will be some trouble.</span> <span id="s740">So you better don't make that trip."</span> <span id="s741">You could see it officially.</span> <span id="s742">I know that I, for instance, needed working papers, and this small congregation didn't have too much influence, but they tried very hard to get it for me.</span> <span id="s743">They couldn't, and I could stay in Vienna only illegally as a cantor, and legally as a student.</span> <span id="s744">Because as a student I was allowed to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">NL: So Austrian citizenship was out of the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">YM: Oh, it was out of the question, sure.</span> <span id="s747">It was out of the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">NL: Did you have any knowledge of Mayor Luger, was he in office at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">YM: He was before my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">NL: He was before your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">YM: He was

different in Yugoslavia at Novi Sad?</span> <span id="s755">Was it more benign with respect to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">YM: Maybe it's worth it--yes, it definitely was, because the Serb people who took over really this part of former Hungary were depressed themselves for many many hundreds of years, and they knew what it is to live under an oppressive government, and they were very nice and pleasant, and the Slav people as a rule, I mean if you are talking about Serbs, about Ruthenians, until they are poisoned...</span></p> <p><span id="s757">NL: Instigated...</span></p>

when you have for instance a priest who will tell them nothing else but that the Jews killed Christ and this and that and the Jews, be careful before Passover, because they need your children's blood for the Passover matzah, then of course, a fire starts.</span> <span id="s762">It's terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">NL: How large a Jewish community was in Novi Sad?</span></p> <p><span

before the exams are over, so we left in June.</span> <span id="s792">By the time--the end of June.</span> <span id="s793">By the time we got to Budapest where she had an uncle, this uncle was already at the station, and we wanted to go to Vienna, giving us a telegram from my uncle who, I told you before, who went to talk, speak up for me, to intercede.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">NL: Who tried to intercede?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">YM: "Don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s796">Come straight over."</span> <span id="s797">And the reason for it was that my father died.</span> <span id="s798">We were in Budapest on a certain Sunday, and it was the thirtieth or whatever it was, the first of July, and my father died Friday before, was buried on the same day, because, of course, my uncle wouldn't have done anything else.</span> <span id="s799">So I was never at my father's funeral.</span> <span id="s800">So when I went home, I sat shiva and [unclear].</span> <span id="s801">So, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s802">NL: Did you return to Novi Sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">YM: No, I went to Vienna and [unclear].</span> <span id="s804">However, my appointment in, with Obergeneralstabsrat Bieck, who was the president of the congregation, was for the first or second of July.</span> <span id="s805">And after the shiva it was already the 10th or 8th of July.</span> <span id="s806">By the time I got to Vienna it was the 12th of July.</span> <span id="s807">And the secretary, Dr. Löwenherz of the main congregation in Vienna, my--you asked me before about the citizenship in Austria--told me when I told him that one of my conditions to come to Vienna is if the congregation, the community, guarantees me to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s808">So he said--I was very young, and he was a middle-aged person, very well-educated--so he told me, "Mein liebes Kind, die Staatsbürgerschaft können wir nicht garantieren.</span> <span id="s809">Das ist die Sache der Regierung.</span> <span id="s810">Wir können Ihren alles Andere geben.</span> <span id="s811">"4 So I--my wife was a teacher in Yugoslavia at this date, and I had this beautiful position, and we went back.</span> <span id="s812">However, we stayed in the Marienbad Hotel, I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s813">And I looked out at the quay and tears were dripping out of my

id="s823">I sang concerts in the Academy of Music in Budapest, here, there, I sang on the radio.</span> <span id="s824">I started in 1930 the cantorial music programs on the Yugoslav radio.</span> <span id="s825">You may even have found something in those notes which I left with you, where there are letters and notes from the radio station in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">NL: Yes, I want you to identify those if we have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">YM: Yes, I will, I will.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">NL: Because we made copies and I think I have your original.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">YM: I will.</span> <span id="s830">I will.</span> <span id="s831">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s832">NL: It was a rich life.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">YM: It was a very rich life.</span> <span id="s834">Here, the following happened, probably in 1933, fall, after the holiday, in the fall, the Chevrah Kadisha [burial society] in Novi Sad which was at the time 200 years old, because they started with Jews who came from Phoenicia and all the Middle Eastern countries...</span></p> <p><span id="s835">NL: Turkey...</span></p> <p><span id="s836">YM: Traveled through Turkey and all the other countries, and settled in Yugoslavia, and among other places, Novi Sad, so that Chevrah Kaddisha started to be active in that part of the world, 200 years ago at the time.</span> <span id="s837">So, they, eh, this was a very big celebration, where the king, King Alexander, was represented by one of his generals, and the chief rabbi, Alkali, Dr. Alkali from Belgrade, came down and there was a tremendous banquet in the evening, but in the morning it started, the whole thing started with a celebration in the temple to have a service.</span> <span id="s838">The details are not important, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s839">NL: But it was a momentous time.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s841">But what is important is that a man by the name of Dr. Braun, who was at the time--a German fellow--who was at the time the director of the radio station, the national radio station, that is, the radio station was run by the government there, you know, so, he was the director of that, and when he heard us with the choir and how beautiful it was, and all that, he came over to me after the service and said, "Could we come over once to pick up your service on Friday evening, or Shabbes Saturday morning, and broadcast it?"</span> <span id="s842">I said, "I couldn't tell you that.</span> <span id="s843">You would have to talk to the rabbi, and the religious committee, and so on."</span> <span id="s844">I spoke to the rabbi and saw right away that he will not agree.</span> <span id="s845">He was an extremely jealous person, and didn't want to give koved [show respect] to...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">NL: Be showered on like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">YM: Yes.</span> <span id="s848">So anyway, eh, finally this got back and forth.</span> <span id="s849">Finally we decided with this Dr. Braun that if he can't take the whole service from the temple, I should come and give concerts in Belgrade, and so I went every three, four, five weeks [unclear] Belgrade and gave concerts and so on.</span> <span id="s850">One day I get a letter from a man in Kovno, of all places.</span> <span id="s851">He writes to me in Yiddish, "My dear friend, Hazan Mandel, I heard you on the radio on this and this date, and I liked what I heard, and I would like you to come down to Kovno to give a few concerts.</span> <span id="s852">Concerning this, don't worry about money," he said, "it's my responsibility.</span> <span id="s853">But in order to make it legal, in a few days you will receive suggestions, a plan, plus an agreement from a concert bureau, Klavahoff [phonetic]."</span></p> <p><span id="s854">NL: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s855">YM: Klavahoff [phonetic], was the name of the concert bureau.</span> <span id="s856">I remember!</span> <span id="s857">In a few days I really received, I think it was around January or something, now, of 1934.</span> <span id="s858">This went on for three months in 1933 and so on.</span> <span id="s859">But it took us a long time.</span> <span id="s860">I get this, and I thought, one more thing is important, that my family, the family of my wife, was, all lived in Novi Sad, and my father-in-law, who was the rabbi of this congregation once upon a time, because he never learned the Serb language which became the official language of the community, he wasn't the rabbi or the associate rabbi but became the secretary general of the congregation.</span> <span id="s861">So I spoke to him, I spoke to the family and so on, and they, my mother-in-law, may she rest in peace, she said, "My dear child, you live in the same house where we are.</span> <span id="s862">What are you missing?</span> <span id="s863">Why do you want to go away?</span> <span

answer.</span> <span id="s868">But I answered, "I will come."</span> <span id="s869">And we corresponded back and forth, and in February of 1934 I went down to Kovno to the house of this wonderful person who arranged for me in his--he lived in a mansion--a wing of his house, with a car, with everything, whatever I wanted to go, at my disposal and so on, and I sang, I davened in Kovno, in the Dobi Shakorshul [phonetic] first Shabbes, then I sang a benefit concert for the, for a yeshiva, and then the next week we had a concert with the Lithuanian National Orchestra, rather in the Academy of Music there, and it was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">NL: A concert of Jewish...?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">YM: A concert, no, no,</span></p> <p><span id="s872">NL: Secular.</span></p>

for a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">YM: It was just overwhelming.</span> <span id="s886">And I was there for two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s887">I sent telegrams to extend my vacation, because I had vacation for two weeks, and suddenly one weekend, one Shabbes, I think the third Shabbes or something, a gentleman is at the table with us, and this man, I think his name was Mr. Barkin, in whose house I stayed, introduces a man by the name Mr., eh, I can't remember his name now.</span> <span id="s888">Anyway, introduces him, "This is the president of the Grosse Chor Synagoge in Riga.</span> <span id="s889">It's my brother-in-law, Mr. Becker."</span></p> <p><span id="s890">NL: Your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">YM: His brother-in-law, Mr. Becker.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">NL: Barkin's brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">YM: Ya.</span> <span id="s894">This man was the brother-in-law of this Mr. Becker.</span> <span id="s895">And Mr. Becker came to shul, heard me daven, and Sunday he tells me, "You know, we are seeking a hazan for eighteen or nineteen months already, Hazan Rabitz davened Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s896">Our hazan until now was Herman Yadlovger [phonetic], who was Rigenzer himself, but he isn't there any more.</span> <span id="s897">And we had many, many candidates, this one, that one.</span> <span id="s898">I think you should try out for this position."</span> <span id="s899">So I didn't dare to stay any longer.</span> <span id="s900">I went home, and about two, three, maybe four weeks later I went back to Riga, and then my family was all in tears, why do I go?</span> <span id="s901">And I davened in Riga, and among three, we were down, they were down, the congregation was down to three people.</span> <span id="s902">That was Herman Yadlovger [phonetic], Hazan Alter, Yisruel Alter, and myself.</span> <span id="s903">And I will, consider this again it was a great and beautiful shining point in my career.</span> <span id="s904">Rogachover Gaon at the time, who lived in Dvinsk, but came for treatment to Riga, and I had a chance to speak with him, and

reason why I want to go, because really I had, we had, all we needed for sharing kavod [respect], and nachat [gratification] and live in the same town with the parents; it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s923">But why be in Riga--the Grosse Chor Synagoge was first of all the official temple of the Jewry of Lettland.</span> <span id="s924">[Latvia].</span> <span id="s925">Second of all, my predecessor, not the immediate one, the immediate one was Herman Yadlovger [phonetic], as I said before, my predecessor there was Baruch Leib Rosowsky, Hazan Rosowsky, which by the way was the father of the Rosowsky who worked so much on the M'nigunei Hatam, Ta'amag Hanigunim and so on...7</span></p> <p><span id="s926">NL: Ah, I see...</span></p> <p><span id="s927">YM: It's his father.</span>

that, and I didn't have the time to stay there for so long, so I went home to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s934">I told my family the reasons I will go to Riga are as follows: I know I have a lifetime

kindergarten on, up to university, schools and high schools where the teaching language was Hebrew.</span> <span id="s939">When our son was born, I will never forget it, we had a very dear friend Dr. Gurvich, a lawyer, and his wife was a physician, their children came up to my wife to visit her in the sanatorium where she gave birth, and with a bunch of Hebrew names, what kind of names, written in Hebrew, they gave to her.</span> <span id="s940">This is the kind of, no, the fact that in the temple there was a bet hamidrash [Talmudic school] where 150 people were sitting every morning and every

Yisroeil Tkatch was the immediate predecessor of mine.</span> <span id="s1066">Beside that, Budapest was the best and most strongly organized Jewish community of the world.</span></p> <p><span

congregation, and I know it because there state and church was not separated; there you paid dues or rather taxes to the community; if you were Jewish you paid to the Jewish community, if you were Catholic, to the Catholic community, and so on.</span> <span id="s1077">I know that our organization, our community, had 200,000 people registered and had over 125,000, as we called it there, Kultussteuer zahlende Mitglieder, people who paid dues, or rather taxes, to the congregation.</span> <span id="s1078">So I was born in Hungary, I spoke the language perfectly.</span> <span

music, as being the successor of Baruch Leib Rosowsky, who, I don't have to tell you was a great man, and I was very happy there, and I left a lifetime position in Yugoslavia to go there.</span> <span id="s1081">But here, I came home, besides, and this is the emotional part, maybe, my wife's parents and the whole family lived in Yugoslavia, now, formerly Hungary, but it was only about two hours ride.</span> <span id="s1082">So it was happiness to everybody.</span> <span id="s1083">I came there in June to prepare for the High Holy Day services.</span> <span id="s1084">I had all my rehearsals, the choir, and so on.</span> <span id="s1085">Our belongings, our furniture and everything else, was packed in Riga, and on the way home, my wife went with the child to her parents to Neusatz [German

before Rosh Hashanah in 194-, 1936.</span> <span id="s1087">So, we may say probably August, September, October, everything was just magnificent.</span> <span id="s1088">And the people loved it.</span> <span id="s1089">I started to write Hungarian articles about hazanut in the Hungarian--in the Jewish publications, and so on.</span> <span id="s1090">I had organized courses for Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1091">I got very busy in the Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s1092">We started making plans for the future.</span> <span id="s1093">Suddenly I became the secretary of the Kultusgemeinde,

Podkarpatska Rus, going through all what I told you before, and now, suddenly to reach to this point, to be the chief cantor of, of one of the main temples in the world, in Budapest community.</span> <span id="s1096">I performed services and was very well-liked, I say it myself, very well-received.</span> <span id="s1097">We settled, we had a home close to the temple, because I didn't travel on Shabbas, and yomim tovim [holidays], and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s1098">The High Holy days went over beautifully, beautifully, and everyone was talking.</span> <span id="s1099">Now, we had a Secretary General who was in charge of the administration.</span> <span id="s1100">He used to say, "No one was yet the chief cantor of the Budapest community in the main temple at age 32.</span> <span id="s1101">Besides," he said, "there was never any one to have this position of Hungarian descent," so to say.</span> <span id="s1102">You know the Hungarian Jews were very patriotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">NL: Assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">YM: So, it was very good.</span> <span id="s1105">But, at the end--this went on in 1936, '37, and in '37 of the yamim noraim [ten days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur] in 1937, during the yamim noraim, nothing happened, but at Shemini Atzeret, or Simchat Torah, I don't remember what date, I already got a message from this very Secretary General not to go home for lunch after the services because the Fremdenpolizei [alien police], means the, I don't know what you would call it here, you know, had to do with giving permits, not giving permits to people, because I was a Czechoslovakian citizen.</span> <span id="s1106">And later on...</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">NL: Police for aliens.</span></p> <p><span

for a, for a hazan for so many months and months and months, finally everything is settled, so he tried to get them from, through me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">NL: Excuse me, but the fact that you were born in Hungary did not mean anything, inasmuch as you were a Czech citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">YM: Right.</span> <span id="s1120">Did not mean anything, and I don't know even if I would have been a Hungarian citizen, if they couldn't have done something to me because they made up stories...</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">NL: They were looking for a pretext.</span></p>

on, bribes which were given to the different functionaries, I functioned.</span> <span id="s1131">But in 19- by the end of 1937, I felt it is very bad.</span> <span id="s1132">And I wrote to a teacher of mine, Oberkantor Fischer, who was the successor of Sulzer in, in, eh, in [unclear] Stadttemple who was a teacher of mine.</span> <span id="s1133">And I loved him and I think he had a lot of, a lot

way too while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">YM: Harassed they were already at this time.</span> <span id="s1147">It came to the point that by the end of 1938, thousands of Jews were transported to Galicia, to be specific, to Kamenets-Podolsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">NL: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">YM: Where they were killed, and when I was in Kamenets-Podolsk, as a laborer, laborer in the labor camp, because I speak the language, I spoke to an old peasant who led me to the place where thousands or many, many were killed and buried, and said, "You see this mountain, that's a mountain of people.</span> <span id="s1150">Jews were killed and buried there and this hill, this mountain covers them.</span> <span id="s1151">This is their grave."</span></p>

these people are not Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s1154">They came, they escaped from Galicia in 1916, '17, '18 during the First World War, they stayed there through bribes, and they gave bribes to this one and that one, but now we are national Hungarian government and we will eradicate all this nonsense.</span> <span id="s1155">And whoever doesn't belong here we'll just take them out.</span> <span id="s1156">So they took them out, children, parents, grandparents, sick, wealthy, well people, and took them to Kamenets-Podolsk.</span> <span id="s1157">I don't have to tell you the story of Kamenets-Podolsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">NL: Did this attitude affect Hungarian Jews generally, in other words, the native or citizen groups, were they being also discriminated against in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">YM: To a degree they were, because the parliament already discussed the first Jewish--the first law against Jews at the end of 1937.</span> <span

introduced to the Chief Rabbi and the Bet Din [Rabbinical Court] was sitting with me for all morning, and I went through the, the eh, tests which they give there, because there, they, if you are

better and well-versed than I was.</span> <span id="s1424">I was at the time a Czechoslovakian citizen, a Czechoslovakian citizen.</span> <span id="s1425">As a Czechoslo-, the Czechoslovakian, the Hungarian quota, the Rumanian quota was filled with a waiting list for the United States to, to get in for years and years.</span> <span id="s1426">But the Czechoslovakian quota, for reasons of

four years of relatively calm life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">YM: Ya.</span> <span id="s1437">This is what kept me there, and kept everyone there.</span> <span id="s1438">They told the joke that, I don't know, an aunt or mother or grandmother is the--sacrificed herself for a piece of furniture, because she couldn't leave that.</span> <span id="s1439">Or the dining room, or the this.</span> <span id="s1440">And this was all true.</span> <span id="s1441">And I, I'm taking the examples of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">NL: This is, I'm afraid, human nature, not just Jewish.</span></p>

of the Hungarian army, as a Jew, Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s1446">After this, when everyone else was demoted, I was demoted myself.</span> <span id="s1447">The only distinction we had was this cap that you see on that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">NL: Picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">YM: Ya, picture.</span> <span id="s1450">And we worked as laborers.</span> <span

...Galicia, not in Russia.</span> <span id="s1454">In 1944, March the 19th, the Germans occupied Hungary.</span> <span id="s1455">And then, of course, the screws were tightened and tightened.</span> <span id="s1456">The Jewish Committee was established, and this and that, and later on, as you, as you have seen probably from the Joel Brand10 book and so on, the details I won't go in, because this is public knowledge.</span> <span id="s1457">In June, a group finally--the way it went and how, is very well described, I think in Joel's book.</span> <span id="s1458">A group of about 1700 Jews, the outstanding, leading Jews of Hungary, were gathered together, and with German permission, left Hungary to go to Palestine, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1459">The motivation were the trucks, of course, which he expected to get, and all that, but this is history, so I won't go into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">NL: Could we go back a little,</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">YM: Sure.</span></p>

that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">YM: The authorities respected it because the command came from higher up place given to this lower command, and I went up.</span> <span id="s1480">Eh, in the labor camp itself, I had many, many people who knew me from home, but I tried, and I did, not take anything to be different for me than for anybody else.</span> <span id="s1481">If the wheel barrow had to be carried, I carried it like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1482">I was strong.</span> <span id="s1483">There was nothing wrong with me.</span> <span id="s1484">I was a healthy, strong, comparatively young person, so I worked on with everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">NL: What kinds of work did the battalions do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">YM: We built so-called, eh,

<span id="s1505">Eh, the Hungarian military was in charge.</span> <span id="s1506">In each company there were two-hundred-and either sixteen or twenty-six Jews who had no worth [?]</span> <span

one, for instance, who was an official in a bank.</span> <span id="s1518">So I used to deal with that bank and I knew him from before.</span> <span id="s1519">So I had some influence on him.</span> <span id="s1520">However, if there was one like we had in this place, Bilka, who wanted us to run eh, for six, eight miles, and people were just fainting, he could do that.</span> <span id="s1521">He

position probably in the community, employed as or rather assigned to be--because I had this training, I think I mentioned to you, from the Czechoslovakian army yet, that I took the courses for male

family was, besides our own son, the son, my brother's, eh, my bro-, my brother's brother-in-law's child, who came up because his mother was caught on the street and, she was in Auschwitz, taken to Auschwitz immediately, so this poor child knew that when there was anything, they went up to Ellami, near to Aunt Ella, so this child wandered up to our apartment, and so when it was decided that my family will be taken, my wife said, "This child must be taken too.</span> <span id="s1865">I can't leave him here."</span> <span id="s1866">So she took him along.</span> <span id="s1867">So I wanted

back now, he did not want from anyone to give the information to anyone so that it shouldn't be publicized that someone spoke to him and given the exact information, because everyone else will be around with the same question.</span> <span id="s1879">So, somehow I could, I can see it in that view, in, in, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">NL: Retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">YM:

or 13 lorries.</span> <span id="s2567">We were transported to, in the direction, to Spezia.</span> <span id="s2568">We finally arrived there, and we saw epes strangely that the Italian police is around us.</span> <span id="s2569">We didn't know what happened with the Italian police.</span> <span id="s2570">So, none of us, and the Haganah people, who were among us, of course, knew very well what's going on because they, they, they didn't have to give them the whole hand, they knew from one finger.</span> <span id="s2571">And they told us quietly that this and this is happening.</span> <span id="s2572">And probably the English, who occupied that part of the country, told the Italians to arrest us.</span> <span id="s2573">We were arrested, first we were told we will be taken into...</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">NL: Custody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">YM: Spezia.</span> <span id="s2576">Custody.</span> <span id="s2577">But then, somehow or other, they succeeded, the

what, how long, for how long before Pesach.</span> <span id="s2587">The, the, what organization was it now who sent us food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">NL: JDC?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">YM: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2590">Sent us matzah, and on the molo [pier, dock], on the, on that eh tongue which leads to the, into the ocean where the, what's that called in English, I don't

standing.</span> <span id="s2594">There, and on the boat with little lamps and candles and whatnot, I made the seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">YM: For that, in 1946, I remember the date, and we had a..</span> <span id="s2597">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">NL: My, what a moment.</span> <span id="s2599">What a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">YM: We had a seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">NL: Were there British soldiers standing by?</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">YM: No, Italians.</span> <span id="s2603">The British were probably two kilometers or a half a kilometer away, and the British Commando definitely was responsible for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">YM: So, we were there, I don't remember for how long, but finally we saw nothing happens, red dahin, red daher [talk here, talk there], nothing happened.</span> <span id="s2606">So, I was one of the people who, who was considered to be on the command.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">NL: The leadership.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">YM: The leadership.</span> <span id="s2609">So, I spoke Hungarian, there were many, many Hungarians, so I had to translate whatever was said.</span> <span id="s2610">And, em, we tried to keep the spirit up of the people.</span> <span id="s2611">Then I wrote this [unclear] Spezia, and the eleven hundred and eighteen people were on that, I mean, including children, of course...</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">YM: ...decided to have a hunger strike.</span> <span id="s2614">And we had a hunger strike for 119 hours.</span> <span id="s2615">In the meantime, the English became a little concerned, because in those days, you know, it wasn't as bad as it is today, you know, there was still some shame in them, and they sent down the Minister of Labor, Morrison, a Jew.</span> <span id="s2616">At the time, he came down, and I sat in on a five-man committee.</span> <span id="s2617">I didn't speak a word of English at the time, but the final upshot was he should give us--and when I saw, just this week, I think, Exodus was on television.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">YM: That's exactly our story.</span> <span id="s2620">It was just transposed into the children camp because it's more...</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">NL: Dramatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">YM: ...effective, more, more, more dramatic, more, ya.</span> <span id="s2623">But that's our story.</span> <span id="s2624">And, eh, he said we should give up the hunger strike, and he will go back and will talk to the government and this and that.</span> <span id="s2625">After, I think, a certain amount of time, a few hours, because the whole hunger strike kept on for about 118 hours, so he probably was there the 80th hour or something like that.</span> <span id="s2626">And we agreed to one thing, that we won't commit, we won't start the suicides until we don't hear him.</span> <span id="s2627">But the hunger strike will go on.</span> <span id="s2628">I will never forget it, in this tragic story maybe this is a little light, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">NL: Touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">YM: ...point, touch, too.</span> <span id="s2631">A German boy was there with us.</span> <span id="s2632">And while, at one of the mifgash [meeting], the whole group was singing, lo yatzul, tzarroayim [wouldn't have been saved in the afternoon], and this boy at one point or another, fainted.</span> <span id="s2633">The doctor came, gave him an injection, brought him back, and his first, when he came to, his first word, first words were, "Aber ich werde nicht essen!"</span> <span

this, this is a light touch to our tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">NL: But such spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">YM: Ya.</span> <span id="s2644">So, we went on, finally we heard from Morrison that eleven hundred and eighteen certificates were granted to the Spezia people.</span> <span id="s2645">Eh, however, we cannot leave yet.</span> <span id="s2646">The English are extremely concerned about us, and how could we ever make it on this five hundred and some eh, ton, little boat?</span> <span id="s2647">The Jewish Agency had to buy another boat, to divide us into two groups, and then they will give out the certificates.</span> <span id="s2648">So we gave up the hunger strikes and we divid-, the people were divided, and these two boats got into Israel under the name, eh, in May, 1946, under the name Eliahu Golomb and Dov Hoz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">NL: Oh.</span> <span id="s2650">Oh.</span> <span id="s2651">Dov?</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">YM: Dov Hoz, the

vav, zayin ∍&amp;%.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">NL: I don't know that name.</span> <span id="s2658">But Golomb, of course, I, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">YM: Eliahu Golomb.</span></p>

one of the boats, and I remember we had an unfortunate thing.</span> <span id="s2664">We had our doctor on the boat, didn't know--we had many doctors--they didn't know exactly if this is typhus, typh-, typhus fever, or, or something else.</span> <span id="s2665">So one of our men, this again may be a light moment in the great tragedy, one of the men who was so very sick with a very high temperature, had to be taken off in Greece to be taken into a hospital, to the epidemic department there, and of course the Haganah people came with us, but I was the one who signed the documents.</span> <span id="s2666">You know, [chuckles] this is meshugas [craziness], you know but it is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">NL: You were the spokesman, the official.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">YM: Because, ya.</span> <span id="s2669">And one more, more, finally we arrived in Haifa.</span> <span id="s2670">Probably it was about 14th or 15th or 12th, something, beginning of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">NL: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">YM: ...May.</span> <span id="s2673">Why do I say that?</span> <span id="s2674">Because the 18th I remember, was Shavuot.</span> <span id="s2675">We arrive in Haifa.</span> <span id="s2676">My wife was with the two children in Kibbutz Shar Hamakkim.</span> <span id="s2677">The kibbutz people gave, sent someone in a car to pick me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">YM: And because I was the commander of one of the boats, I couldn't leave before...</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">NL: Everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">YM: ...all documents are signed, and everyone is off the boat!</span> <span id="s2682">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">NL: Oh, ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">YM: My wife was waiting two hours after everyone was out, and I didn't come down, and she went back to the kibbutz, I again did not arrive, because she was waiting for the previous transport also.</span> <span id="s2685">But I didn't arrive.</span> <span id="s2686">So, anyway, I had one English pound in my pocket.</span> <span

id="s2723">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">YM: Three days or four days later, ya, I stayed in the kibbutz for a day or two, maybe because Shar Hamakkim was such a well-organized kibbutz.</span> <span id="s2725">It was a Hashomer Hatza'ir kibbutz, as you well know.</span> <span id="s2726">And, for me it was very far, but no other kibbutz has given the opportunity to the children which Shar Hamakkim granted them.</span> <span id="s2727">Ella became their immediate teacher, and they tried to educate her, she should become a teacher in Israel and so on, and she didn't want it.</span> <span

id="s2735">YM: And that was, the people were just carrying her on their hands, because the food became entirely different after her perfect, wonderful cook.</span> <span id="s2736">I came there and saw that Shar Hamakkim kibbutz, for whatever reason, I'm not going into details, is not for me.</span> <span id="s2737">I saw that right away.</span> <span id="s2738">Though I was born and grew up in a village, and my father, he had a, I knew how to drive horses and all that, but I knew this was not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">NL: You were a city man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">YM:

are talking about '46, so at the time I was 42 years old, and I thought, no, I don't have the right to come here and take all what these people starved for, for, for decades and decades, one.</span> <span id="s2748">Secondly, I didn't feel that the spiritual atmosphere is mine.</span> <span id="s2749">Third, they wanted to, to have me, even if I will just teach music in their schools.</span> <span id="s2750">I just didn't feel like doing it.</span> <span id="s2751">So three days later, and with this I will close, three days later, I davened, I got, first of all, a suit lent to me, given to me by my, by Ella's schoolmate with whom she went to school from first grade to the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">NL: Also in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">YM: In

cantor of Budapest came here, you know, this is our mishugas [crazy], and, here in Yerushalayim, in Israel, in Palestine, I should become a melamed [teacher]?</span> <span id="s2772">I didn't accept it, because they didn't want to at least lend me money, but a man by the name Friedman, was in Yeshurun when I davened in Yeshurun, this again shows me, "Eyn adam nokef etsba' milematah."</span> <span

my wife to leave the kibbutz but she did, and we lived in Haifa, and then I thought, you know, you come to the United States, bring a few bags, and fill them with dollars, and then you go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s2777">It didn't happen like that, because the milchemet hashichrur [war of Liberation] broke out, and I couldn't go back, and couldn't stay here, I had to take a position.</span> <span id="s2778">I took a position in New York, 1948, March or April, where I became the, yes, and I needed papers to get in here, non-quota, and I couldn't get it any other way, but in those days cantors couldn't come here non-quota, only rabbis, or priests, or ministers.</span> <span id="s2779">So, because I am qualified, I became the associate rabbi to a rabbi, and I want to mention his name, Rav Chaim Porille, zichron livrachah [may his name be for a blessing], who is the rabbi of the Rumanische Shul in New York, a tremendous orthodox shul, and...</span></p> <p><span

Cantor Yehudah Mandel, formerly of Logan, Philadelphia, Israel, various camps in war-torn Europe, Hungary and Czechoslovakia sat with me to recall their lives in this period.</span> <span

<span id="s2817">However, his father, who was in a work camp, was not part of the group.</span> <span id="s2818">And his mother has passed away.</span> <span id="s2819">So what we have is a child's memories.</span> <span id="s2820">It is interesting that the strongest memory was of the "cold" German train and the "warm" Swiss train.</span> <span id="s2821">That transfer evoked the most dramatic response in our conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">I do not believe that the bit of information which has been secured has added at all to the body of knowledge on this subject.</span> <span id="s2823">Still, it was an important task to further document those terrible times.</span> <span id="s2824">I am grateful for having had this opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Testimony obtained from Emanuel Mandel,</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">June 6, 1980, concerning the transfer of Jews from Hungary in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">On April 19, 1944 the Nazis occupied Budapest.</span> <span id="s2828">It was the day after Passover.</span> <span id="s2829">Emanuel Mandel's father, a Cantor, was permitted to return from a work camp in order to daven services.</span> <span id="s2830">Cantor Mandel, who was present for this interview, indicated that the Kehillah had great power and was actually able to "force the Germans to allow him to come home.</span> <span id="s2831">[This was the Congregation of Pest].</span> <span id="s2832">The Kehillah had over 1,040 employees involved with hospitals, hold age homes and every facet of Jewish life."</span> <span id="s2833">Cantor Mandel was a Czechoslovak citizen who came to Hungary in 1936.</span> <span id="s2834">The Czechs and Hungarians hated each other, but they hated the Jews even more.</span> <span id="s2835">The Cantor had working papers for four years.</span> <span id="s2836">He went to serve as a chaplain and remained a chaplain even when he was sent to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s2837">This allowed him to have special privileges.</span> <span id="s2838">That is how the Cantor was able to bring supplies back to the congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A.THE TRIP: How were people chosen for the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">1.</span> <span id="s2841">"Money, gold, diamonds, cash boullion 2.</span> <span id="s2842">Active in the underground 3.</span>

push"</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">B.What was Emanuel Mandel's connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">He had an uncle in Ha Shomer Hatzair who organized a Zionist underground network who organized brecha, escape through mountains and with Aliyah Bet via ships.</span> <span id="s2850">Emanuel Mandel was not allowed in his grandmother's room--there was a printing press there to print illegal papers.</span> <span id="s2851">From time to time it was moved from place to place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">C.What were the arrangements with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">The Jews were to be taken to one of three ports.</span> <span id="s2854">All were to claim to be displaced persons--claiming Palestinian citizenship.</span> <span id="s2855">This allowed the Germans to legitimize the whole procedure and account for the movement of 1,617 people.</span> <span id="s2856">The ports were to be in Turkey, Spain or the Baltic.</span> <span id="s2857">But the cattle cars (boxcars) went Northwest.</span> <span id="s2858">They camped at night.</span> <span id="s2859">Emanuel believes that three days (?)</span> <span id="s2860">later they stopped for "rest" at or near Hamburg near the Hanover railroad, 18 miles or so from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2861">They were taken to Bergen-Belsen, a huge detention center, supposedly for three days to one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Emanuel indicates that this was a transit center.</span> <span id="s2863">Their luck was the Red Cross knew of their whereabouts and movement.</span> <span

the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Negotiations continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">D.What was the timing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">In June, 1944, Normandy Invasion.</span> <span id="s2870">The Luftwaffe was knocked out of commission.</span> <span id="s2871">Hungary was liberated in January, 1945.</span> <span id="s2872">War was winding down.</span> <span id="s2873">The group stayed three months in Bergen-Belsen until September.</span> <span id="s2874">Then about 300 people, 1/4 of the group, were taken to Switzerland for additional dollars--money to be paid on tracing of the group to its destination.</span> <span id="s2875">The Jews had money in Swiss accounts (some of the Jews) and released these additional funds to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2876">Emanuel's mother had a 4kt diamond in a cake of soap.</span> <span id="s2877">The cake of soap was lost on the first night after they left Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Emanuel Mandel got out in March, 1945.</span> <span id="s2879">The war ended in May.</span> <span id="s2880">In March, 1945, Emanuel was taken to German Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2881">He recounts the following story.</span> <span id="s2882">"German trains cannot run on Swiss tracks, so the train or tracks had to be switched.</span> <span id="s2883">The train on the Swiss tracks was warm inside."</span> <span id="s2884">He was taken and fumigated and put on the Swiss train.</span> <span id="s2885">From March to May the area was run by the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2886">About 20-40 of the Hungarian kids were sent to school at Swaingallen [phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Emanuel Mandel was eight years of age in 1944.</span> <span id="s2888">His mother, who accompanied him on the trip, has since passed away.</span> <span id="s2889">His father, Cantor Yehudah Mandel, has a separate escape story.</span> <span id="s2890">Cantor Mandel suggests that Kasztner organized the trip on which his son escaped.</span> <span id="s2891">"In regard to the eligibility process it was only natural in those times that some would be saved and others would not."</span> <span id="s2892">The Cantor did not fault Kasztner for being burdened with these decisions.</span> <span id="s2893">"Everyone who could grabbed at freedom."</span></p></body></html>
