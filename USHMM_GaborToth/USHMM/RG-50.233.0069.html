am Anthony Di Iorio.</span> <span id="s5">I am at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and today is July 9, 1992.</span> <span id="s6">I am about to interview Mrs. Emmi Lehner of Miami, Florida about her recollections of life in Austria before the war and about the story of her sister, Helene Lebel.</span> <span id="s7">Okay, Emmi, could you begin by telling us something about yourself and where you grew up and--.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Emmi Lehner: I grew up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s9">In the third district.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Interviewer: Third district.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Emmi Lehner: In the Vorderezollamtstrasse.</span> <span id="s12">This is a very nice section there because the Kriegsministerium is there and one arm of the Danube, a canal which is very pretty, very nice.</span> <span id="s13">I got married when I was very young to the owner of the Imperial Hotel, the son of the owner of the Imperial Hotel and lived there for three and a half years until '38 when Hitler marched in.</span> <span id="s14">I was at the hotel and Hitler was already in the Furstner Apartment, we called that on the second floor where always the royalty would stay.</span> <span id="s15">It is a--was a royalty hotel.</span> <span id="s16">They asked us to leave, you know.</span> <span id="s17">When I was standing outside, they asked me to--Mr. Hitler would come on the balcony and we should sing the Horst Wessel song which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s18">I didn't know anything about Hitler too much because in Vienna, we didn't know so much about it.</span> <span id="s19">Then they didn't let us go there.</span> <span id="s20">There was an SS man next to each person who stood in front of the Imperial Hotel.</span> <span id="s21">It took approximately an hour and a half and then we left.</span> <span id="s22">I could not get in because they took the whole hotel over.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Interviewer: This was in March, 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Emmi Lehner: 1938, yes.</span> <span id="s25">On the 13th of March, 1938.</span> <span id="s26">No, I think it was the 11th, correct.</span> <span id="s27">The 11th of March.</span> <span id="s28">When I was married, my sister was out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s29">She was six months in the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus at the Potzel Clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Interviewer: Six months, she was in which --?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Emmi Lehner: In the Allgemeinen.</span> <span id="s32">It is the biggest--.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Interviewer: General Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Emmi Lehner: General Hospital, yes.</span> <span id="s35">She was there six months, first under Wagner Jauregg, then Wagner died, during the time Helli was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s36">Wagner Jauregg is one--was one of the biggest psychiatrists in the world.</span> <span id="s37">Then Professor Potzel took over and Helene was there maybe three more months and then she was released.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Interviewer: This was in 1934?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Emmi Lehner: In 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Interviewer: 1934.</span> <span id="s41">Was that the first time she was in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Emmi Lehner: That was the first time she was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s43">As a matter of fact, it was actually before that because Helli and I, we went every Sunday to the old Danube to swim.</span> <span id="s44">That particular Sunday, Helli acted very strange.</span> <span id="s45">She said, you know, I hear constantly voices.</span> <span id="s46">She says, I'm going home.</span> <span id="s47">I said, I just came here.</span> <span id="s48">I don't want to go home If you want to go home, go alone home.</span> <span id="s49">When I came home, that night, there was a letter on the dining room table and it was addressed to my mother.</span> <span id="s50">I couldn't open it; I waited until my mother came home.</span> <span id="s51">That letter she was not home.</span> <span id="s52">In that letter she said, I'm very much afraid you will be killed and I'm going to take a train.</span> <span id="s53">But she didn't say exactly where she's going.</span> <span id="s54">But around 12 o'clock at night, she came back.</span> <span id="s55">She was very restless and very strange.</span> <span id="s56">My mother called her sister and her sister was very friendly with a doctor who worked at the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus.</span> <span id="s57">She called and said what should I do?</span> <span id="s58">She said bring her in immediately.</span> <span id="s59">That was like a crisis center here.</span> <span id="s60">Where you take people---like a--where you take people when they are, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Interviewer: Do you know when this was, this first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Emmi Lehner: Helene was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Interviewer: Nineteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Emmi Lehner: Born in '11.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Interviewer: 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Emmi Lehner: Yes, that's what it was.</span> <span id="s67">I was already with my husband, I wasn't married yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Interviewer: You had a fiancee.</span> <span id="s69">Then?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Emmi Lehner: Helli went in and was six months in the hospital.</span> <span id="s71">After the six months, she came out and we decided to get married and Helli was at the wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Interviewer: So there was a four-year period from this first --?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Emmi Lehner: Yes, she went to Graz to my grandmother and went to the university.</span> <span id="s74">In Vienna, she went to the university and then she got a job during the time she went to the university she got a job in a lawyer's office.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Interviewer: This is in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Emmi Lehner: In Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Interviewer: So she went to Graz with your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Emmi Lehner: With grandmother and stayed there.</span> <span id="s79">I was already married.</span> <span id="s80">She was at the wedding.</span> <span id="s81">We had a very, very large wedding, 400 guests.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Interviewer: She was there for a long time, in Graz?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Emmi Lehner: In Graz, well she was there, I would say seven or eight months.</span> <span id="s84">She came back and came to my house and smoked a lot.</span> <span id="s85">At that time, I didn't know anything about smoking.</span> <span id="s86">Helli smoked and Helli said to me, I'm going home now and bring you all your books, the schoolbooks.</span> <span id="s87">I said, no; don't bring me that because I don't want them here at the hotel.</span> <span id="s88">I lived at the hotel, the Imperial Hotel.</span> <span id="s89">I said no, no, don't bring it.</span> <span id="s90">She left.</span> <span id="s91">Then in the evening, my mother called and said Helli was taken to Steinhof.</span> <span id="s92">There she was maybe--.</span> <span id="s93">In 1938, we decided to leave.</span> <span id="s94">We decided actually already in January to leave but we didn't leave and didn't leave, and then Hitler marched in.</span> <span id="s95">We left at that night when he marched in.</span> <span id="s96">We wanted to go to Hungary where we had very good friends but they did not let us go in there.</span> <span id="s97">The Hungarians made it plain; we can't go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s98">It was very exciting because there was the SS and the SA.</span> <span id="s99">We were very lucky.</span> <span id="s100">One of the men, who belonged to the SS, my husband didn't know, was an employee of the hotel.</span> <span id="s101">He recognized my husband and he made a cordon and said: It's Mr. Walter Lehner, its okay, let him go out.</span> <span id="s102">He didn't ask us where we wanted to go, we wanted to--.</span> <span id="s103">My mother was with us and we said we are going on vacation to Hungary, to Budapest.</span> <span id="s104">That man didn't think anything, was one of our detectives from the hotel, that he was already a Nazi.</span> <span id="s105">So we went back and my husband immediately tried to get out because my husband was of the military age.</span> <span id="s106">Twenty-six or something like that.</span> <span id="s107">We heard already that the Germans would start a war and he would be called up.</span> <span id="s108">They wanted to take the Austrians first so he tried and went before I left.</span> <span id="s109">A month or so before I left, he went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s110">We had--the daughter of the hotel was owned by a friend of his father He went, left; and I, on the 14th or 15th of July, I went to see Helli, my sister for the last time.</span> <span id="s111">I went to the Steinhof and didn't say goodbye to her because I didn't want her to know that I'm leaving for good.</span> <span id="s112">But she had some kind of premonition.</span> <span id="s113">She was not bad; she was very good-behaved, very well and looked very good.</span> <span id="s114">I said goodbye and she said, well, when do you think I see you again?</span> <span id="s115">I didn't answer that very much; I said very soon and left.</span> <span id="s116">It was the last time I saw her.</span> <span id="s117">It was in '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Interviewer: July of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Emmi Lehner: July of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Interviewer: How long had she been in Steinhof?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Emmi Lehner: She was there for about--she came out in Christmas when I was already married.</span> <span id="s122">Just a second, can you hold that--- (interruption) Interviewer: Yes, I will.</span> <span id="s123">We were talking about you leaving in July, 1938 and you visited--.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Emmi Lehner: On the 15th, on the 11th, 13th or so.</span> <span id="s125">I went to see her, to see Helli to say goodbye--in my own mind, but not to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Interviewer: Right, right.</span> <span id="s127">And you said she looked good and she was well-behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Emmi Lehner: Yes, she was very well-behaved.</span> <span id="s129">I don't know if you are familiar- all mental hospitals have pavilions.</span> <span id="s130">In this pavilion, the people move around.</span> <span id="s131">For instance, if you are very bad, you go to another pavilion.</span> <span id="s132">When you are very good, you can go in a pavilion where they have typewriters, sewing machines, whatever you want to do, you can do there.</span> <span id="s133">They have their occupy the patients quite a bit, you know.</span> <span id="s134">Only if they're good.</span> <span id="s135">So Helen was at that time--number one is very bad and number--up to numbers--she was in number nine which is a very good one.</span> <span id="s136">But there were many times when I was there when she was not, when she was in number two.</span> <span id="s137">But this time she was in nine and I felt very good, that she looked good, her hair is nicely done and she looked good.</span> <span id="s138">Then I--.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Interviewer: How long--the question I had asked when the doorbell rang, was how long had she been at Steinhof?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Emmi Lehner: Well, from--when she was nineteen, it started.</span> <span id="s141">She went first to the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus for six months.</span> <span id="s142">Then she came out and the next time she did not go to the Allgemeinen Krankenhausi she went directly to Steinhof.</span> <span id="s143">My mother took her but I was with her.</span> <span id="s144">We had the hotel car and we took her.</span> <span id="s145">She was very disturbed.</span> <span id="s146">She was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Interviewer: When would that have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Emmi Lehner: That was in, I would say, '34.</span> <span id="s149">I was married already a year.</span> <span id="s150">In, '35.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Interviewer: '35.</span> <span id="s152">so that's the first time she went to Steinhof?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Emmi Lehner: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Interviewer: Before that, it was the Allgemeine?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Emmi Lehner: Allgemeinen Krankenhaus, yes.</span> <span id="s156">Potzel Clinic.</span> <span id="s157">It's called the Potzel Clinic which is the psychiatric department.</span> <span id="s158">Then Helli came out the same year for Christmas but she couldn't stay.</span> <span id="s159">She said take me back.</span> <span id="s160">I can’t stand the noise and I can’t stand the lights, I can't stand the furniture.</span> <span id="s161">She did not want to stay and that was the last time she was out.</span> <span id="s162">We had to take her back to Steinhof and then we visited her.</span> <span id="s163">We had to restrict our visiting times.</span> <span id="s164">I went three times; my mother went three times, to see her sometimes four times.</span> <span id="s165">Then' 38 came along.</span> <span id="s166">That was a very tragic thing and I didn't think that anything would happen to Helli because she was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s167">When--the moment the war broke out, I had no more opportunity.</span> <span id="s168">As long as there was no war, I was in England for two years, you know, we could not immigrate to the United States right away.</span> <span id="s169">We were waiting for a quota number.</span> <span id="s170">We stayed in England with friends.</span> <span id="s171">I had always letter from Mother and Helli put always little notes in saying, hello Emmi, how is it?</span> <span id="s172">Like it in England?</span> <span id="s173">And I'm fine.</span> <span id="s174">Things like--.</span> <span id="s175">Very short notes.</span> <span id="s176">Then when the war broke out, there was no communication until I went to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s177">They were only very short note and all of a sudden I didn't hear anything from my parents, or from my sister, or anything.</span> <span id="s178">That went apparently into ' 40 when they started to empty out the Steinhof, took all mental patients out and killed them.</span> <span id="s179">But I didn't--my mother never wrote me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Interviewer: She was in--.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Emmi Lehner: The letter which I gave you.</span> <span id="s182">I found in my mother's desk, after my mother's death.</span> <span id="s183">She had never sent me that letter, nor did she tell me anything.</span> <span id="s184">She said I cannot visit Helli, it is so far away.</span> <span id="s185">My mother was at that time in Poznan.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Interviewer: Poznan, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Emmi Lehner: She had no opportunity to go and visit Helli.</span> <span id="s188">But it happened very fast because in '40 when the war broke out, they took them all away because they needed the Allgemeine, the Steinhof for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s189">That's what my mother told me when she came to visit me the first time in America.</span> <span id="s190">She never elaborated on Helli's death.</span> <span id="s191">You know, I was very much anti-German, always.</span> <span id="s192">Because I knew what Germany wanted from us.</span> <span id="s193">My mother knew that and she didn’t' want to elaborate what these Germans all did.</span> <span id="s194">My father had a position in a German hospital in Poznan.</span> <span id="s195">She never elaborated on that.</span> <span id="s196">She never said, I guess that Helli is still alive, did you hear from Helli?</span> <span id="s197">Until that letter came, that letter she never mentioned to me.</span> <span id="s198">I found it in her desk when I came the first time to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Interviewer: So Helli was in Steinhof from early 1936 until she was transferred to Germany?</span> <span id="s200">She was never released again?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Emmi Lehner: Never released again.</span> <span id="s202">Apparently she had gotten worse.</span> <span id="s203">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s204">My mother never talked about it very much but she knew how much 1--.</span> <span id="s205">Helene and I were very, very close.</span> <span id="s206">We were just like twins.</span> <span id="s207">She knew everything she would tell me which is negative, she would know that it would hurt me very much.</span> <span id="s208">So I didn't hear it until when I went in 1971, I went to Vienna because my mother was very sick.</span> <span id="s209">Four weeks later she died.</span> <span id="s210">Then I cleared out the apartment and I found the letter.</span> <span id="s211">The particulars what she had from Helli, her birth certificate and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Interviewer: Now, I've seen one photograph of Helli and she's holding--?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Emmi Lehner: Lydi, our dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Interviewer: Liddy?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Emmi Lehner: Lydi was our dog.</span> <span id="s216">L-y-d-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Interviewer: L-y-d-i.</span> <span id="s218">And it looks like a terrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Emmi Lehner: Yes, she's a fox terrier.</span> <span id="s220">My father had a kennel.</span> <span id="s221">We had quite a bit of them and my father sold them.</span> <span id="s222">She was our dog.</span> <span id="s223">Helli's and my dog.</span> <span id="s224">She came from England, a female.</span> <span id="s225">She came from England, from one of my cousins and we loved her to death.</span> <span id="s226">Till she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Interviewer: Yeah, so that was--?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Emmi Lehner: Helli and I, we were every summer in Grimmenstein.</span> <span id="s229">This is a very famous lung sanatorium.</span> <span id="s230">My father was a business with the pol--, like a director.</span> <span id="s231">He had, himself, lung trouble and was not supposed to be in vienna.</span> <span id="s232">So we went every summer for two months there.</span> <span id="s233">All the time we were off school.</span> <span id="s234">Helli and I we had a wonderful time there.</span> <span id="s235">There was no sign that she would be mentally ill.</span> <span id="s236">That was when we were maybe, I ten, and Helene, eleven.</span> <span id="s237">We were sixteen months apart.</span> <span id="s238">From that time on until I married, I was always in Grimmenstein with her.</span> <span id="s239">Then when she was nineteen, she got sick.</span> <span id="s240">That was the first time she got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Interviewer: Did you just spend the summers there or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Emmi Lehner: We spent the whole summer there.</span> <span id="s243">We could not stay in the lung sanatorium.</span> <span id="s244">We had to be in a separate house with a Fraulein, you know.</span> <span id="s245">We had wonderful times; there was no sign that she could ever be sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Interviewer: The first sign was that --?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Her birthday's in September.</span> <span id="s248">They said summer we were on the old Danube.</span> <span id="s249">Before we were supposed to go to Grimmenstein.</span> <span id="s250">But it started when she was 19 years old, September 15, she was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Interviewer: So Lydi was your dog and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Emmi Lehner: Was our dog, Helli and my dog.</span> <span id="s253">I loved--we loved--Helli too, loved the dog so much.</span> <span id="s254">She was in Grimmenstein many times because, excuse me sir, leave me that form there please.</span> <span id="s255">I cannot sign it right now.</span> <span id="s256">Just a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Interviewer: And we were talking about Lydi was your dog and I was going to ask you, how long did you have--when did you first get Lydi and how long did you have her?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Emmi Lehner: When I was married one year, I married in '34.</span> <span id="s259">In '35 I told Helli when I visited her that Lydi is now in Grimmenstein because she had an eczema which went all over her body.</span> <span id="s260">She was ten years old at that time.</span> <span id="s261">I was married already a year and I said to my husband, I'd like to go to Grimmenstein one more time and say goodbye to Lydi because we heard about all the things which were happening that maybe Germany will get into Austria, you know.</span> <span id="s262">I went up; I wanted to see her one more time.</span> <span id="s263">She was very sick at that time and, I think, a few months later she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Interviewer: Lydi died?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Emmi Lehner: Not in our house, not in my mother's house, but in Grimmenstein.</span> <span id="s266">My father had a kennel there which had a man and woman took care of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Interviewer: The reason why I was asking that, was Helli especially attached to Lydi?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Emmi Lehner: Yeah.</span> <span id="s269">Helli always walked her.</span> <span id="s270">One day, this were the signs which come to my mind now, that when Helli started--.</span> <span id="s271">You see, this type of sickness Helli had starts usually in puberty from girl--.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Interviewer: Thirteen years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Emmi Lehner: Yes, no, it didn't start that way.</span> <span id="s274">It started, I think, around when I was sixteen and Helli was seventeen and a half.</span> <span id="s275">There were signs.</span> <span id="s276">Signs like she took Lydi for a walk to the inner city of Vienna which is very crowded always.</span> <span id="s277">Lydi had to wear a muzzle because in Austria it was the rule; all dogs had to wear muzzles.</span> <span id="s278">She took him and then she went into a department store and left the dog outside.</span> <span id="s279">She was very well-trained.</span> <span id="s280">You didn't have to have her on a leash, you know.</span> <span id="s281">She was always walking next to you.</span> <span id="s282">My father knew dogs very well and she was very well-trained.</span> <span id="s283">Helli went out another side and forgot the dog.</span> <span id="s284">We were besides ourselves.</span> <span id="s285">I was already married at that time.</span> <span id="s286">But the dog came home and you know this is maybe half an hour walk from the inner city to the address where we lived.</span> <span id="s287">She came by herself and the muzzle was on the side.</span> <span id="s288">Was not on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Interviewer: She hadn't been arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Emmi Lehner: No, she was not arrested.</span> <span id="s291">She walked by herself home.</span> <span id="s292">Helli was naturally very happy that she came.</span> <span id="s293">But Helli was always with the dog.</span> <span id="s294">I got married and I had my own dog.</span> <span id="s295">I bought my own dog, another wire-haired fox terrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Interviewer: Yes.</span> <span id="s297">I was going to ask if there was any connection between Helli's worsening situation in '35 and the death of the dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Emmi Lehner: Well, it was not really connected because she had the eczema, she had this very bad skin rash because she was plucked all the time.</span> <span id="s299">We trimmed her all the time, what she should look like.</span> <span id="s300">She was a very beautiful dog.</span> <span id="s301">I don't think it had any connection with Helene, no.</span> <span id="s302">Helene started with like forgetting the dog.</span> <span id="s303">This is -you can do this but as a rule, you don't.</span> <span id="s304">Very little signs which started.</span> <span id="s305">When she was at this lawyer's, when she took this job at the lawyer's office as part secretary and went to the university, we had a--each of us had a ring from our father, a black pearl ring.</span> <span id="s306">Helli came home and called me.</span> <span id="s307">I was at the hotel and she called me for a moment and said, you know, I was so sad today, there was a lady washing the floor in the university.</span> <span id="s308">She's there, I gave her my ring.</span> <span id="s309">I nearly dropped dead because this ring was the only thing we had from our father, our real father.</span> <span id="s310">I went to call my mother right away and said~ what happened?</span> <span id="s311">She said Helli is so strange.</span> <span id="s312">She goes out in the middle of the night, around one 0' clock, two 0' clock, all of a sudden I hear the door go and Helli's gone.</span> <span id="s313">My mother was very concerned.</span> <span id="s314">Young girls don't go out at night, you know.</span> <span id="s315">She took her clothes; she looked around; she couldn't find her.</span> <span id="s316">Around two o'clock, she would come back.</span> <span id="s317">Then she walked at night.</span> <span id="s318">She went out--we had a very large hallway from the entrance to the living room.</span> <span id="s319">Helli would walk up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s320">That's when my mother called her sister who had a friend in the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus, a doctor.</span> <span id="s321">And she said you have to bring her in, we would like to test her and see her.</span> <span id="s322">From that time on, she got worse and worse,.</span> <span id="s323">Then came that Sunday, when we were at the Danube and she disappeared and she said I hear such voices.</span> <span id="s324">What are these voices around me?</span> <span id="s325">It was the beginning of her sickness.</span> <span id="s326">When we talked to all the doctors, they thought it was schizophrenia.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Interviewer: From that time on, schizophrenia?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Emmi Lehner: At that time, let me tell you, knowing so much about mental hospitals because Peter had--that really had no connections with Peter.</span> <span id="s329">Peter had a brain-damage when he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Interviewer: You're talking about your Peter?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Emmi Lehner: My son, yes.</span> <span id="s332">Because many people think because Helli had that, that this is inherited; it is not.</span> <span id="s333">It has nothing to do with Peter.</span> <span id="s334">We found out, my mother found out that when she was a year and a half old, she had a very--we went on a Danube trip on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s335">You know with a ship on the Danube.</span> <span id="s336">Helli got a high fever, a very high fever and was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s337">The doctors at that time knew very little about mental illness.</span> <span id="s338">They know Freud and they know Wagner Jaurich studying the sicknesses in the mental patients.</span> <span id="s339">But they know not really as much as they do now, that there is some balance in the situation in the brain, you know.</span> <span id="s340">They know so much more now than they did when Helli was sick.</span> <span id="s341">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s342">They treated them very nice in the hospital, I have to say that.</span> <span id="s343">Because Helli was always very clean, very neat.</span> <span id="s344">You could not go in the room where they slept.</span> <span id="s345">They had many people, there.</span> <span id="s346">There were no single rooms or two-bed rooms like you have here.</span> <span id="s347">It was more like 10 or 12 people in a hall, they call it a hall, you know.</span> <span id="s348">When we went there, Helli would come out.</span> <span id="s349">You'd never go to the bedroom; you never saw her bed or anything like that.</span> <span id="s350">She came out and then there were little rooms where people were allowed to go with the patients, the patients who are behaving well.</span> <span id="s351">You know, there were patients there who attacked their mothers and fathers and visitors.</span> <span id="s352">I was attacked once by a patient who was just let out from the sleeping area.</span> <span id="s353">I wore a hat and she tore my hat off.</span> <span id="s354">I was scared to death but then Helli came and Helli was always very good.</span> <span id="s355">She behaved very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Interviewer: She would only be with female patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Emmi Lehner: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s358">There were only--male and female were separated- separate pavilions.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Interviewer: I thought we'd go back a little bit to the beginning.</span> <span id="s360">Mention that Helli was born in September, 1911 and you were sixteen months younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Emmi Lehner: Thirteen, 7th of March 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Interviewer: March 7, 1913 and you were the only two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Emmi Lehner: Only two children, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Interviewer: Were you at that time, living in the third district or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Emmi Lehner: Yes, no.</span> <span id="s366">We lived at our grandmother.</span> <span id="s367">My mother became a widow when she was 21, when my father went to war and was shot in Russia.</span> <span id="s368">We lost our father.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Interviewer: That was in 1914?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Emmi Lehner: No, my father was--didn't go to war.</span> <span id="s371">My mother hided him.</span> <span id="s372">He didn't want to go to war.</span> <span id="s373">He never wanted to shoot or do anything like this.</span> <span id="s374">He had no training in it.</span> <span id="s375">His father was a--had a most beautiful store in Vienna of antique pictures like Van Gogh's and very, very famous painters.</span> <span id="s376">My father was supposed to go to America to deliver a Van Gogh, I think it was, to the Vanderbilt’s in America.</span> <span id="s377">He was a gambler.</span> <span id="s378">My father was, unfortunately, not on good terms with his father because he was a gambler quite a bit, roulette, you know, casinos in France He lost that picture and came back.</span> <span id="s379">The war broke out and my mother did hide him for two years.</span> <span id="s380">In '14 the war broke out, in '16, they got him--they sent him on the Russian front; and one month later he died, he was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Interviewer: So he was killed in 1916?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Emmi Lehner: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">We were very young and my mother became a Red Cross nurse.</span> <span id="s384">During the war, everybody had to do something.</span> <span id="s385">She became a Red Cross nurse and met my stepfather as a patient.</span> <span id="s386">He was shot in the shoulder and lost a lot of blood.</span> <span id="s387">My mother was one of his nurses there.</span> <span id="s388">They fell in love and married when they were very young because my mother was around 21.</span> <span id="s389">She was 16 when she got my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Interviewer: Your stepfather was a patient in her hospital?</span> <span id="s391">He was a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Emmi Lehner: He was a soldier, a regular soldier.</span> <span id="s393">Even so he had Matura, had very good schooling and should have been an officer.</span> <span id="s394">But because he didn't answer the call of his duty right away, they made him as a regular soldier.</span> <span id="s395">One month later he was dead.</span> <span id="s396">So that was the beginning of a very hard time for us but we were very lucky because my stepfather was wonderful.</span> <span id="s397">He was a very, very--he loved us; he was very good to us.</span> <span id="s398">I would say he preferred me more than Helli.</span> <span id="s399">Helli always criticized him, you know, you're not my father, don't tell me this.</span> <span id="s400">You're not my real father, things like that Helli would say.</span> <span id="s401">But he was very good to us, all his life until he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Interviewer: When did he marry your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Emmi Lehner: He married my mother in 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Interviewer: His name was--?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Emmi Lehner: Artur Celebrini.</span> <span id="s406">Like A-B, C-e-l-e-b-r-i-n-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Interviewer: That's an Italian name.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Emmi Lehner: Yes.</span> <span id="s409">His father was from Fiume I think, and his mother was from Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Interviewer: Your mother, her name was also Emma.</span> <span id="s411">So you were named after your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Emmi Lehner: Emma?</span> <span id="s413">Helli and I, we had one godmother and her name was Melani.</span> <span id="s414">We have both our middle names are Melani.</span> <span id="s415">Helli was Melani Lebel, L-e-b-e-l and Emma-- Interviewer: Melani, can you spell that please?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Emmi Lehner: M-e-l-a-n-i.</span> <span id="s417">Melani.</span> <span id="s418">The girl like in Gone With the Wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Interviewer: So Helene Melani Lebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Emmi Lehner: Helli, that's H-e-l-e-n-e.</span> <span id="s421">She was probably in when she was in the hospital under Lebel.</span> <span id="s422">You know there's an accent sign on the last "e".</span> <span id="s423">That's why we say Lebel, and not Lebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Interviewer: Yes, so there's an accent on the last ‘e’?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Emmi Lehner: The last e, an accent sign on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Interviewer: French style?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Emmi Lehner: Yeah, well he came from French descent.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Interviewer: Now what religion were--?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Emmi Lehner: We were always Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Interviewer: Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Emmi Lehner: Always.</span> <span id="s432">When I married, I married-in the, what you call it, not in the Church because my husband's father was Jewish, his mother was a Christian.</span> <span id="s433">I did not want to become Jewish or anything like that.</span> <span id="s434">I was seven years in a convent and they were--in Vienna.</span> <span id="s435">I just didn't want to change my religion.</span> <span id="s436">I wasn't a religious person but I didn't want to change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Interviewer: You were baptized in the Catholic religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Emmi Lehner: Yes, I was baptized.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Interviewer: Both you and Helli were raised as Catholics?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Emmi Lehner: Yes, as Catholics, we were in the convent together.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Interviewer: Your mother was also Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Emmi Lehner: Yes, Catholic, my stepfather was Catholic too.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Interviewer: Your stepfather was Catholic.</span> <span id="s444">What about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Emmi Lehner: My father was considered--in his birth certificate which I found in my mother's desk.</span> <span id="s446">He was “confessionslos” (without religion) since he was sixteen.</span> <span id="s447">He was from Jewish parents but confessionslos.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Interviewer: So he was of Jewish ancestry?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Emmi Lehner: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Interviewer: This is Alfred now.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Emmi Lehner: Yes, Alfred.</span> <span id="s452">I never met his mother.</span> <span id="s453">My grandmother I never met because they were divorced, my grandfather and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s454">She went to Germany and I never met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Interviewer: Would Lebel have been considered a Jewish name?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Emmi Lehner: I think it would be, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Interviewer: So the people at the hospital would have known?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Emmi Lehner: They would have known but I tell you frankly.</span> <span id="s459">I have a friend who was half-Jewish, half-Gentile and nothing happened to them in Austria.</span> <span id="s460">I don't think they did anything to Helli because she was Jewish, I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Interviewer: Even after the Nazis came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Emmi Lehner: The Nazis decided all mental patients should be killed.</span> <span id="s463">They had not enough food, not enough shelter for them.</span> <span id="s464">Didn't want to use the hospitals for mentally sick people.</span> <span id="s465">You see that the bad part was that she was a lengthy there.</span> <span id="s466">There was no interruptions, that she was better, she could come out or things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s467">She was constantly there and decided probably that she was really mentally ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Interviewer: I remember although I don't know if it was from you or from Trudy, that she was supposed to be released?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Emmi Lehner: That I don't know.</span> <span id="s470">Trudy knows more--.</span> <span id="s471">I'll tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s472">Trudy knows more about my parents during the war because she was in Italy and my father, when he finally got out of jail, he was arrested by the Russians and was a year in jail when my mother got him out.</span> <span id="s473">He went to Italy--he spoke fluent Italian and he went to Trudy, stayed with Trudy.</span> <span id="s474">Then my mother came from Austria to him.</span> <span id="s475">This period is very dark with me because there was a war on you know and we had--there was no possibility to talk lengthy with them, or see them or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Interviewer: Yes.</span> <span id="s477">The news that I heard was that they were told that she was better and that she would be released soon.</span> <span id="s478">Instead of being released, she was--the notice was that she was transferred to another hospital in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Emmi Lehner: Yes and my mother really thought it was a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Interviewer: In fact the name of the hospital was Niedernhart, which I think is in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Emmi Lehner: My mother said it was very far from where she was when they were in Poznan.</span> <span id="s482">She said there is no chance for me to travel there.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Interviewer: Although they really sent her to Brandenburg which is near Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Emmi Lehner: Yes, that is what I heard.</span> <span id="s485">In one of my letters from the Red Cross that Helli is in Brandenburg.</span> <span id="s486">That's what my mother wrote.</span> <span id="s487">But I thought it was a hospital.</span> <span id="s488">I didn't know Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Interviewer: The reason I was asking, those questions about your father was that in July, 1940, the Nazis ordered that all Jewish patients in mental hospitals, and in wards and in clinics and so forth, be removed and sent to be killed.</span> <span id="s490">That included Mischlinge.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Emmi Lehner: I guess that's probably so.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Interviewer: Yeah and I would think that they would have known-- Emmi Lehner: I tell you frankly when my husband decided right away to leave because he had a Jewish father and he was brought up in the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s493">In the end when we left, we were remarried in a very little church in Grinzing somewhere.</span> <span id="s494">I really can't remember where that was because when he decided, he does not know yet, he goes to England or he goes to Australia.</span> <span id="s495">His sister went to Australia, my husband's sister.</span> <span id="s496">To Australia, you could not come in as a Jew; you had to be a Catholic.</span> <span id="s497">-- Lily, who was Jewish too and married- had a Jewish husband; they decided to become Catholics.</span> <span id="s498">My husband became a Catholic too but the reason before, he was a devout Jew actually, but the reason he became Catholic was only for getting into some place.</span> <span id="s499">Then we decided to go to England.</span> <span id="s500">We had friends in England which we had no money so we had to depend on our friends.</span> <span id="s501">But it is possible that what they said before and what they do afterwards is entirely different, you know, and they probably did know that Helene was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Interviewer: The name, yeah.</span> <span id="s503">They didn't pay attention to religion.</span> <span id="s504">They looked at it as heredity, race--.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Emmi Lehner: Probably and if I would have stayed, because in the beginning we wanted Walter to go by himself, and then I come when he sees what he is going to do, if he is going to stay in England, or if he can go to America or things like that.</span> <span id="s506">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s507">We were very lucky, we had a very good friend here in America who gave us the affidavit but you couldn't.</span> <span id="s508">You see the difference now here and now everybody can come to America.</span> <span id="s509">I don't understand it.</span> <span id="s510">We had to wait two and a half years before our quota came through.</span> <span id="s511">In these two and a half years, we had no money; we were solely supported by friends.</span> <span id="s512">Selling whatever jewelry I had to wait for the affidavit to come to America.</span> <span id="s513">Actually, you know, in America, my husband really got a job maybe after six weeks being in the United States.</span> <span id="s514">He got a job in New Jersey but we wanted to go to Florida because my husband is a hotel man, you know, was a hotel man.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Interviewer: When did you come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Emmi Lehner: In 1940, April, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Interviewer: So right in the middle of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Emmi Lehner: Yes, we were escorted by U-boats and planes on top and secret service which we didn't know the name of the boat or anything.</span> <span id="s519">We were sent to Manchester.</span> <span id="s520">We went from London to Manchester and from Manchester we were with secret police to the boat.</span> <span id="s521">It was very exciting, we were 14 days on the--we went from there to zigzag to Greenland.</span> <span id="s522">In Greenland we went back, it was a long, long trip.</span> <span id="s523">The reason for that was because the English sent all their pictures from the galleries and the gold in that particular boat.</span> <span id="s524">We were not escorted because we were Jewish immigrants.</span> <span id="s525">We were escorted because of the jewels and the gold and the pictures which were in the same boat where we were.</span> <span id="s526">Very bad trip, we had to have gas masks, the whole thing all the time because we were chased by German U-boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Interviewer: What could you say about growing up?</span> <span id="s528">Little girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Emmi Lehner: Growing up in Austria--you see, I'm here now 51 years in the United States.</span> <span id="s530">I came in April '40.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Interviewer: Fifty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Emmi Lehner: Practically 52 years, yes.</span> <span id="s533">I can tell you I have been never so happy as being here in the United States.</span> <span id="s534">I love this country, I think Austria is a great and beautiful country to travel through but I couldn’t--.</span> <span id="s535">When I was back, I was back every second year to see my mother, you know, after the war, when my mother came back, when Peter was born.</span> <span id="s536">But for some reason, I felt always as a stranger there.</span> <span id="s537">I can't understand Trudy.</span> <span id="s538">I cannot understand it--that she would prefer to stay there.</span> <span id="s539">I think Trudy would prefer to stay there because I can't imagine going twice a year to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Interviewer: Well the latest word is that she's lonely and homesick.</span> <span id="s541">And wants to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Emmi Lehner: I can't believe this.</span> <span id="s543">Well, you know what she's homesick for?</span> <span id="s544">Trudy loves New York and she loves the opera.</span> <span id="s545">Really this is her biggest thing.</span> <span id="s546">She goes to it two or three times to the opera.</span> <span id="s547">I don't know what it is in Austria, what she sees there.</span> <span id="s548">I mean here in America where you have freedom and where you have everything.</span> <span id="s549">You know Austria is a very small country and very -- I didn't feel at home.</span> <span id="s550">I was there three times after I left.</span> <span id="s551">I tell you frankly.</span> <span id="s552">I was always so glad to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Interviewer: Well you and your sister, you grew up--it must have been difficult because your father died and then it was a war going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Emmi Lehner: Yes.</span> <span id="s555">We were really supported by the Americans after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Interviewer: This is after World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Emmi Lehner: After World War I, the Americans gave us food.</span> <span id="s558">Without these packages which my mother picked up every week, we wouldn't survive.</span> <span id="s559">It was so bad.</span> <span id="s560">My mother had to go with Trudy's mother and another sister to the country and give them their rings and whatever they had.</span> <span id="s561">The farmers had eggs and chickens and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Interviewer: Who took care of you and Helli when you were little girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Emmi Lehner: Well, you know we had a pension, Helene and I had a pension after our father was killed in the war.</span> <span id="s564">We had a small pension which my mother really lived on until my father got a job in Grimmenstein where he was a Verwalter.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Interviewer: He was your stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Emmi Lehner: My stepfather.</span> <span id="s567">Then things were much better.</span> <span id="s568">We had a very beautiful home which was my grandfather's home and we lived in a very good neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Interviewer: Grandfather Celebrini or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Emmi Lehner: Grandfather Lebel.</span> <span id="s571">We had a very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s572">We had my mother's--I don't know how she did it--I tell you frankly I thought it over what she had to do to survive.</span> <span id="s573">But when my father got a job, he had to stay away from Vienna.</span> <span id="s574">You know the cobblestone tiles where we had to walk horses and things, the concrete splintered off.</span> <span id="s575">It was very bad for people with lung trouble.</span> <span id="s576">He had only one lung.</span> <span id="s577">One lung was taken out and he was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s578">When I was seven or eight and Helene was nine or ten, my father was maybe seven months in the hospital.</span> <span id="s579">He nearly died there of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s580">Then he was sent to Grimmenstein, to a sanatorium there and there he got his job.</span> <span id="s581">His uncle was a doctor too.</span> <span id="s582">His father was a doctor and he had very many friends in the medical center.</span> <span id="s583">We survived.</span> <span id="s584">When I was 14, things were more normal.</span> <span id="s585">Since we lived in a very good neighborhood, we went to a good school.</span> <span id="s586">I went to Ursulinen, the Catholic school--.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Interviewer: You went to a Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Emmi Lehner: I went to a Catholic school.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Interviewer: And Helli?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Emmi Lehner: Helli too.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Interviewer: Catholic grade school?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Emmi Lehner: Grade school.</span> <span id="s593">I was there until I was in the--what you would call--</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Interviewer: Junior high?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Emmi Lehner: Junior high.</span> <span id="s596">Junior high I went to the center of the city, to a public school but a very good public school.</span> <span id="s597">Because, you know, in Vienna things are very divided.</span> <span id="s598">For instance, working-class people live in the tenth district and white-collar workers in the first and second, third districts.</span> <span id="s599">Second district is completely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Interviewer: Yes, the Leopold Stadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Emmi Lehner: Yes, the Leopold Stadt.</span> <span id="s602">Completely Jewish.</span> <span id="s603">It was still rather segregated there.</span> <span id="s604">The reason for that was mostly that many of the girls--these girls married Jewish men.</span> <span id="s605">These Jewish men came either from Poland or Russia, there was a--</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Interviewer: Or Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Emmi Lehner: Hungary or Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s608">There were so many mixed marriages here.</span> <span id="s609">The Jewish people had, I don't know, made more money, I always thought they had more money than the other people.</span> <span id="s610">We did not have anything--I belonged to a club.</span> <span id="s611">I played land hockey when I was 14.</span> <span id="s612">In that club, were I don't know what, were regular people, I never asked a person what religion are you.</span> <span id="s613">You know, that was not--we never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s614">I was not prepared in religion when I was 14 so I was seven years in a convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Interviewer: A convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Emmi Lehner: I hated that, going to church on Sunday.</span> <span id="s617">My mother never forced me to.</span> <span id="s618">So when Helli and I, we were both from religion, had many Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s619">From the club where I belonged to and they are saying that all these people, I heard they left Vienna after Hitler came.</span> <span id="s620">But they were all probably Jewish or part-Jewish or whatever.</span> <span id="s621">We never really talked about this very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Interviewer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s623">Did you have any--?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Emmi Lehner: We found after Hitler that maybe 50% were for the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s625">I tell you frankly, my father would say to me look if things will be much better when we are annexed to Germany.</span> <span id="s626">In our time, schools, first grade schools, junior high, you were always anti-German, why, I don't know.</span> <span id="s627">I wasn't politically informed enough to know why Austria was so against Germany.</span> <span id="s628">I loved Vienna naturally and I didn't want to get together with Germany.</span> <span id="s629">The Germans are really very different than we are.</span> <span id="s630">We speak maybe the same language; also I cannot understand the Berliner.</span> <span id="s631">They speak a different German.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Interviewer: But you and Helli attended grade school and junior high Catholic?</span> <span id="s633">And then afterwards--?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Emmi Lehner: After that, we went to public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Interviewer: The gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Emmi Lehner: Yes, we went to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s637">I went only three years and then I switched to a--I was very good in drawing--I went to Kunstgewerbeschule.</span> <span id="s638">This is where you learn drawing and things like--and anything to do with painting and handcrafts and things like that-.</span> <span id="s639">I went there and then I went to the hotel school.</span> <span id="s640">One year at the hotel school; there's where I met my husband.</span> <span id="s641">Her father was the--.</span> <span id="s642">He was the -----.</span> <span id="s643">When I married, I was the --.</span> <span id="s644">His father thought I should do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Side B Interviewer: I just want to ask a little bit more about Helli's studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Emmi Lehner: Well, Helli was an especially bright person.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Interviewer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Emmi Lehner: Very, very bright.</span> <span id="s649">She was not good in school, but she was very good in geography, whatever I wanted to know about homework and I didn't know what to do, I was not a good student, I went--I asked Helli and Helli always knew.</span> <span id="s650">Helli was another one who went to the opera all the time.</span> <span id="s651">She loved opera.</span> <span id="s652">Naturally we could only afford stehplatz like Trudy did when she was a young girl.</span> <span id="s653">But we were very close to Trudy and Otto, very close because we were (the children of) the two youngest sisters and they were always together.</span> <span id="s654">We went to Sommerfrische, vacation, outside of Vienna.</span> <span id="s655">Tante Melli was very well-off.</span> <span id="s656">She married a very rich man, had a very good business.</span> <span id="s657">We were always together.</span> <span id="s658">We had one Fraulein together, we were always together.</span> <span id="s659">Sometimes when we were little, we spent--.</span> <span id="s660">Trudy left, Trudy left for Italy.</span> <span id="s661">I think it was the year before.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Interviewer: ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Emmi Lehner: '37, yes.</span> <span id="s664">Then naturally everything broke apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Interviewer: Now did Helli want to be anything in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Emmi Lehner: She wanted to be a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Interviewer: A lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Emmi Lehner: That's why she was in a law office and went to the university to study law.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Interviewer: So she finished gymnasium and then she attended the university.</span> <span id="s670">You said in Graz and in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Emmi Lehner: In Vienna.</span> <span id="s672">In Graz, I understood that when she went with my step grandmother, she went to the university for lectures and things like that.</span> <span id="s673">She was always intellectual, I have to say that.</span> <span id="s674">But then, you know, after I married and she started--she became sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Interviewer: So she was a student until '35?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Emmi Lehner: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Interviewer: And she was a part-time legal secretary?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Emmi Lehner: A legal secretary and she started there--the lawyer called my mother and said you know there's something wrong with Helli.</span> <span id="s679">She sits all the time on the window and talks to the people outside.</span> <span id="s680">She would go to the window and call people who walked by.</span> <span id="s681">He said if she doesn't change that very much, I don't think I can keep her.</span> <span id="s682">I think Helene came home and it really started with her.</span> <span id="s683">Because the day my mother took her when we were told to take her to the Allgemeine in the car from the hotel and I took my mother and Helli and Tante Melli to the hospital, to the Allgemeinen Krankenhaus.</span> <span id="s684">There she was six months, very bad.</span> <span id="s685">Very bad then--now this was really very bad.</span> <span id="s686">For Christmas we came with Christmas tree and presents and all that and she threw it out.</span> <span id="s687">She had a bad spell and she was very bad--had to put her in restraints.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Interviewer: This was after you had married?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Emmi Lehner: I was already married.</span> <span id="s690">Everything was bad.</span> <span id="s691">Broke my heart because--.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Interviewer: There was little you could do?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Emmi Lehner: Very little I could do but one day I--really a few months before we decided to leave, I went there and it was summer and Helli said, let me have your hat and gloves and bag.</span> <span id="s694">And she had a dress on; they allowed her to when she went out.</span> <span id="s695">She was outside the perimeter of the place where she lived.</span> <span id="s696">They allowed her to go into the park.</span> <span id="s697">They had a park and in the park there were always two nurses who walked together and watched people who were on the outside.</span> <span id="s698">You couldn't walk away because there was a gate.</span> <span id="s699">At the gate, you had to have a pass to get into the park and get out.</span> <span id="s700">Helli said all of a sudden, don't I look nice.</span> <span id="s701">She looked beautiful.</span> <span id="s702">Had a hat on, gloves on, and my bag and she took my arm and said let's go out now.</span> <span id="s703">As we approached that gate, and the gate, two nurses were walking around right there.</span> <span id="s704">She screamed and then she was very bad for a while, for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s705">But she wanted to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Interviewer: She never paid any attention to politics, did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Emmi Lehner: Unfortunately, we all didn't.</span> <span id="s708">We should have but we didn't have television yet.</span> <span id="s709">We didn't read the newspapers.</span> <span id="s710">Young people were not interested.</span> <span id="s711">Those at the university did.</span> <span id="s712">The university students, as a rule, did.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Interviewer: Yeah, that's why I asked, because she was a law student.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Emmi Lehner: She was not.</span> <span id="s715">Helli was not political, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Interviewer: Was she engaged at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Emmi Lehner: Yes, she was.</span> <span id="s718">She was engaged when she was 16 to a man who loved her very much but she had somebody else in mind.</span> <span id="s719">This man was a drug addict and was killed on his motorcycle.</span> <span id="s720">This other man always wanted to visit her but my mother didn't want it to continue.</span> <span id="s721">She liked men very much, very fond of boys.</span> <span id="s722">She always warned me, you know.</span> <span id="s723">We were very close and she would always say, Emmi, never go with any man, never do anything until you get married.</span> <span id="s724">Very religious in her way.</span> <span id="s725">When she was in the hospital, she became very religious.</span> <span id="s726">But she wasn't when she was normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Interviewer: So she became religious in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Emmi Lehner: In the hospital.</span> <span id="s729">It was always stages, three weeks of this, three weeks of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Interviewer: This would be Catholic religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Emmi Lehner: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Interviewer: Even though the hospital was not Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Emmi Lehner: The hospital was not but it was a county hospital.</span> <span id="s734">I don't know what they were but they had a chapel in there.</span> <span id="s735">You had to have a chapel.</span> <span id="s736">You know, like the Allgemeine, there's a chapel in the compound but it doesn't need it.</span> <span id="s737">They ask you when you--whatever.</span> <span id="s738">But they do the same here.</span> <span id="s739">You know that here all the time, you have to give your religion; they ask you what religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Interviewer: And hers was given as Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Emmi Lehner: Catholic, yes.</span> <span id="s742">You see when my mother remarried and he was a Catholic, there was no other way.</span> <span id="s743">We were not brought up—my father was “confessionslos,” he did not want to be any denomination, you know.</span> <span id="s744">I mean, I can remember, I was little, I was so small when he died but --.</span> <span id="s745">I was glad that I have this Catholic religion, very good religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Interviewer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Emmi Lehner: But that's the story.</span> <span id="s748">I think you're right when they find out she is partly Jewish, officially they--.</span> <span id="s749">I don't know what happened to her officially.</span> <span id="s750">Officially in Vienna, that I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s751">Trudy was away and her mother was married to a Jew.</span> <span id="s752">So she wouldn't go back, it was March.</span> <span id="s753">She wouldn't go back for anyone because she did not know what happened.</span> <span id="s754">She was too, she was Evangelisch.</span> <span id="s755">Trudy was not Jewish she was Evangelisch because her stepmother was Evangelisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Interviewer: Yes, she said that her father was Jewish, her mother was Catholic and they were brought up as Protestants.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Emmi Lehner: As Protestants, yes, I know about Trudy and Otto.</span> <span id="s758">That was already so crazy in Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s759">Once here, I'm living--, I don't know if you know Miami--.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Interviewer: Never been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Emmi Lehner: Well, you know if you would be here, there is--people are religious in this country, far more than we were, ever, even now.</span> <span id="s762">They are going to church on Sunday, I don't but I--people around me, all around me neighbors and all that.</span> <span id="s763">They are going to church and the Jewish people are going to the temple.</span> <span id="s764">You know when my husband was here, I go--went with him once a month to the temple.</span> <span id="s765">I don't know nothing about Jewish religion but I mean I--my husband wanted to do this for his father.</span> <span id="s766">You know, very fond of his father.</span> <span id="s767">He went every month to the temple.</span> <span id="s768">Had a very beautiful temple here, Second Place in Miami.</span> <span id="s769">My husband always went there.</span> <span id="s770">There were- but here people are very religious, far, far more religious than anybody I knew in Austria.</span> <span id="s771">Austria, you don't go to church much.</span> <span id="s772">Because there are so many Mischlinge there, an enormous amount.</span> <span id="s773">You know I understand now probably Trudy will tell you that Vienna is overrun with foreigners.</span> <span id="s774">You could have Romania, Hungary, Poland.</span> <span id="s775">Everything is good in Vienna.</span> <span id="s776">It is in one way good because business is very good.</span> <span id="s777">The hotels are all sold out.</span> <span id="s778">This is apparently good.</span> <span id="s779">The dollar is very low and I'm very happy about that.</span> <span id="s780">As soon as I get my pension from them.</span> <span id="s781">I found my husband had a pension from Vienna, through his father.</span> <span id="s782">I don't know what happened now that I am--I don't think the churches are overrun in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Interviewer: No, no, only by tourists.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Emmi Lehner: Only by tourists and they only want to look at it because they are old and they are beautiful.</span> <span id="s785">Vienna is beautiful, there's nothing to say about it but I have no feeling toward it, not to--.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Interviewer: And the other cities aren't bad.</span> <span id="s787">Graz.</span> <span id="s788">Salzburg-- Emmi Lehner: Salzburg is beautiful, beautiful.</span> <span id="s789">You know, the first time after 25 years, after I was away for 25 years, and I came to Vienna.</span> <span id="s790">My parents stayed in Graz because my mother's mother died there and she left the apartment to them.</span> <span id="s791">I was there with the children and I tell you I was impressed.</span> <span id="s792">I had never seen Graz before.</span> <span id="s793">Very impressed, very nice.</span> <span id="s794">Salzburg is special nice but it's a tourist town.</span> <span id="s795">Graz is not a tourist town.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Interviewer: No, which is one reason why I like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Emmi Lehner: Yes, have you been in Graz?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Interviewer: Yes.</span> <span id="s799">I've been to --.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Emmi Lehner: How come you didn't go to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Interviewer: I've been to Vienna.</span> <span id="s802">Oh, yeah, I've been to Vienna several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Emmi Lehner: Did you see the Imperial Hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Interviewer: I can't say I've been inside, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Emmi Lehner: You should have seen it inside because the staircase goes up and the pictures there--.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Interviewer: I went to the Hofburg and the Schronbrunn and the Belvedere but-- Emmi Lehner: Yes, very nice.</span> <span id="s807">I lived out there.</span> <span id="s808">We lived with my grandmother when I was very small, right after my father was killed, we lived there.</span> <span id="s809">My mother went back home and we lived and every day I was- I loved animals, I used to go there every day when I was little at my grandmother's.</span> <span id="s810">I loved it, it's really beautiful there.</span> <span id="s811">I have to say the outskirts of Vienna and all that, it's very beautiful.</span> <span id="s812">But it is not now because of this--you know, there's a lot of foreigners walk around there, speak different languages.</span> <span id="s813">Hard to- can't stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Interviewer: Well, in that way, it's a lot like New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Emmi Lehner: But New York is still America.</span> <span id="s816">You know, it's--I don't know.</span> <span id="s817">I love New York myself.</span> <span id="s818">I lived there six months and I loved it but I wouldn't like to live there.</span> <span id="s819">I prefer to live here.</span> <span id="s820">You should come one day to Miami and I take you around.</span> <span id="s821">It's beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Interviewer: My brother lived there for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s823">He went to med school in Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Emmi Lehner: Yes, well I think it is very nice.</span> <span id="s825">It's very bad everywhere, you know, because of the crime and all that.</span> <span id="s826">I go to the big hospital where I have--Peter in now.</span> <span id="s827">I'm so scared to drive there, I can't tell you because there are--when you cross northwest, northeast to northwest, all black and when they are going like you see on television, one of our anchorwoman, with a gentleman, was attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Interviewer: I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Emmi Lehner: They broke the window and they were cut.</span> <span id="s830">They were in the middle and there were cars right, left back and front.</span> <span id="s831">They broke that window and hit them, hit her in the eye.</span> <span id="s832">She was very lucky that she saved her eye but they took the purse.</span> <span id="s833">You see, people leave their purse on the other side.</span> <span id="s834">My car doesn't have air-conditioning, I have to have it prepared.</span> <span id="s835">I have to have windows open, very little but it is so hot here in Miami; yesterday 96, I thought that I would die.</span> <span id="s836">The weather has changed greatly.</span> <span id="s837">We had so much rain before but apparently the pollution and all that is affecting the air right now.</span> <span id="s838">It is really hot here, not the way to come here.</span> <span id="s839">Trudy was only here two days, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s840">I can't wait until she comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Interviewer: Well, in two weeks, three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Emmi Lehner: We talk on the phone a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Interviewer: I just want to check now that I have the right spelling.</span> <span id="s844">Helli, H e-l-e-n-e and then Melani, the middle name, Me-l-a-n-i and then Lebel; there's an accent --- Emmi Lehner: L-e-b- and the last e-l-- Interviewer: Accent grave, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Emmi Lehner: People say always Lebel, you know.</span> <span id="s846">It is Lebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Interviewer: Then Hellie is H-e-l-l-y.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Emmi Lehner: No, no "y".</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Interviewer: No, no "y"?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Emmi Lehner: H-e-l-e-n.</span> <span id="s851">Her name is Helen.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Interviewer: No, I'm talking Hellie.</span> <span id="s853">When-- Emmi Lehner: Oh, we call her--my nickname was Emmi and my real name is Emma.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Interviewer: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Emmi Lehner: Helli was Helen like your name here, Helen.</span> <span id="s856">Same name but we Called her Helli.</span> <span id="s857">Called her H-e-l-l-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Interviewer: "i"?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Emmi Lehner: "i", not "y".</span> <span id="s860">Just like my Emmi is "i".</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Interviewer: Okay.</span> <span id="s862">Cause I had an envelope here and it said Helly Angelegenheit and it had a "y" on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Emmi Lehner: Yeah, then she misspelled it.</span> <span id="s864">Her birth certificate is Helene.</span> <span id="s865">Melani, we both have the same middle name.</span> <span id="s866">Trudy's mother was called that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Interviewer: Yes, and then, let's see.</span> <span id="s868">Photos, I have, as I said, we have the copy of Helli with Lydi.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Emmi Lehner: Yes, I have the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Interviewer: That's the photo that we'll use on the ID card.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Emmi Lehner: The only other picture I have of Helli is at my wedding.</span> <span id="s872">She was at the wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Interviewer: A group shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Emmi Lehner: A group shot.</span> <span id="s875">Helli is on there.</span> <span id="s876">She was just out six months when it
