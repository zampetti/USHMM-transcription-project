2...</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: No.</span> <span id="s19">Your name.</span> <span id="s20">Just tell me your name.</span> <span id="s21">A: Meier.</span> <span id="s22">Hans Meier.</span> <span id="s23">H-A-N-S M-E-I-E-R.</span> <span id="s24">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s25">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I was born in Zurich in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s27">Q: And when?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: 1902 on the 9th of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Uh...Tell me about your...your family.</span> <span id="s30">Where...where did your parents come from?</span> <span id="s31">My father came from a very poor farmer's family in...outside Zurich.</span> <span id="s32">And they died from tuberculosis without nourishment.</span> <span id="s33">And he was able to make a training as...came as mechanic with his uncle in Zurich, the town of Zurich.</span> <span id="s34">And then he got an employment, with the federal railways for locomotives.</span> <span id="s35">And he became a..</span> <span id="s36">.</span> <span id="s37">a fireman and locomotive driver.</span> <span id="s38">And he therefore he was a bit better off than his family.</span> <span id="s39">And he wished to...to put me higher even, and he gave me the opportunity to study electrical engineering at the University of Zurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s41">Let's...let's...before we go into college and university, tell me what it was like growing up.</span> <span id="s42">Did you have brothers and sisters as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I had one brother, Fritz, and no...no other sisters or brothers.</span> <span id="s44">And...uh...we both...we were two years apart.</span> <span id="s45">He was born 1904.</span> <span id="s46">And I remember my first memory was sitting in the little carriage seeing a house.</span> <span id="s47">That's all.</span> <span id="s48">And then later, we went very often on a bridge which crossed the railway tracks near the station in Zurich.</span> <span id="s49">And we tried to spit into the chimneys of the locomotives which was passing underneath the road.</span> <span id="s50">And very often it happened that at that moment, the locomotive flew back our wet spital and into our own faces.</span> <span id="s51">(Laughing) And my father knew that I was on that bridge and he fetched me and had to wash me first before he could take me home.</span> <span id="s52">That was my...my childhood memories.</span> <span id="s53">And then I..</span> <span id="s54">.</span> <span id="s55">we were living in the workers' quarters of Zurich, not in a..</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">not in the rich quarters, near the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">And I..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">I know my father got better food than I and my...my mother was looking and she came from a poor family in also...but from a cobbler's family.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Cobbler...cobblers.</span> <span id="s63">And...uh...I spent all the holidays there and...uh...but he let me study to see that....</span> <span id="s64">I went 8 years into the public school and then 4 and a half years in to the high school and then for l year I was in a..</span> <span id="s65">.</span> <span id="s66">in a repair shop of locomotives to learn auto mechanics and so on.</span> <span id="s67">And then I studied for 4 and a half years electrical engineering and then I tried to get employment with the federal railways.</span> <span id="s68">They just changed at that time from steam to electric.</span> <span id="s69">That was just after the war.</span> <span id="s70">But I have to say first what I experienced during the war.</span> <span id="s71">Uh...I..</span> <span id="s72">.</span> <span id="s73">when the war broke out, I was 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Now, this is the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: The first World War.</span> <span id="s76">Yeah.</span> <span id="s77">And my father was a socialist.</span> <span id="s78">That means at that time it meant...uh...idealism for peace and for justice.</span> <span id="s79">That was socialism.</span> <span id="s80">And he was a delegate at the International Socialist Peace meeting in Basel, 1912, and he returned from Basel, and told me, "Boy, from now on, no more war because when the government declare war, we socialist internationally strike.</span> <span id="s81">We don't...don't go.</span> <span id="s82">We strike.”</span> <span id="s83">And 2 years all went...the German Socialists went and killed the French Socialist and the English Socialist and the American, and in addition we experienced that the CHristian churches did the same.</span> <span id="s84">They sent their people in the name of Christ to kill many of them.</span> <span id="s85">From Germany, from France, Italy, Austria, England, American.</span> <span id="s86">And we say this man, Christ, must be a murderer because in his name they sent the young people to murder one another.</span> <span id="s87">That was what we thought in our youth.</span> <span id="s88">And then Switzerland...and now we experienced in Switzerland the exchange of prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s89">Cripples from between France and Germany for instance, crippled prisoners of war who were no more able to go to war.</span> <span id="s90">And we saw in this way thousand of people, young people like we are who had been sent to war to kill one another coming crippled back into the fatherland after having been sent by the churches to kill one another.</span> <span id="s91">And Switzerland, what did they do?</span> <span id="s92">They made ammunition for both sides and made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s93">I say do it safely, making help on both sides.</span> <span id="s94">So that even a man in Switzerland, the very famous writer suggested that in the propaganda for Swiss produce, they should put out the ammunition which they made for the Poles and the photographs of its victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What were you doing during all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: And we were protesting against the whole injustice.</span> <span id="s97">We were youths and...uh...you experienced here in the 68s...how the youth protest against the hypocracy of the old generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: How did you protest?</span> <span id="s99">What form did you protest?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: We...we protested.</span> <span id="s101">We heard for instance that the Christian czars in Russia exploited their country.</span> <span id="s102">We heard that the Russian czars were saying they were Christians, tried to compel youth...Jews to become Christians.</span> <span id="s103">When they came to the army, they baptized them and kept them under water because they protested so that they drowned.</span> <span id="s104">And we said, is that Christian?</span> <span id="s105">This Christ who says that must be a murderer.</span> <span id="s106">We say that in the youth.</span> <span id="s107">And we red ting on the side that we stand for that and we had heated discussions about this in the school.</span> <span id="s108">And in addition, I visited because my father was a Socialist, I visited the so-called Socialist Sunday School.</span> <span id="s109">And we heard there .</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">They were refugees in Switzerland and they were sent in 1918 by the German government in the same railway wagon from Switzerland to Helsinki to make revolution against Kirinski who tried to continue the war while Lenin promised to stop the war if he should come to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s113">We need to bring this back to your story, to Hans' story.</span> <span id="s114">Did you tell me...did you hear Lenin speak?</span> <span id="s115">I heard Lenin speak, but I heard more Trotski speak than Lenin because Lenin couldn't speak very much German.</span> <span id="s116">Troski could speak much more German.</span> <span id="s117">And I mean I only have it in mind that I saw Lenin in the Sunday School.</span> <span id="s118">That's about 80 years ago.</span> <span id="s119">(Laughing) 70 to 80 years ago.</span> <span id="s120">But I have...I must have seen him all the Russian refugees in Zurich...you know.</span> <span id="s121">Lenin, Troski, Applovolof, and so on and so.</span> <span id="s122">I have seen them all because they came all to visit us in the Socialist Sunday School.</span> <span id="s123">So we were as a youth We were really challenged.</span> <span id="s124">We were seeking truth and this was not the truth.</span> <span id="s125">What the churches represented not the truth, but the fatherland represent not the truth.</span> <span id="s126">What the Socialist represented was not the truth because .</span> <span id="s127">You know, so we were left by everything.</span> <span id="s128">And they were seeking independently the truth.</span> <span id="s129">And we were seeking as on a human basis...on the idealistic basis.</span> <span id="s130">Yeah?</span> <span id="s131">Not on the faith basis or Jewish or Christian faith basis...on idealistic basis, we were seeking simply the truth.</span> <span id="s132">And in seeking that I felt I can't do military service in Switzerland because military service I would learn to kill and not to keep alive people.</span> <span id="s133">And this brought my father to a great anger.</span> <span id="s134">He said, "How do you do that.</span> <span id="s135">I have given you the money to study and now you don't and you lose every possibility of a career.</span> <span id="s136">And so he asked...uh...a friend of his who was a Freemason and a colonel in the army to speak with me.</span> <span id="s137">And this man called me and said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s138">Would you like to kill your father with your rejection of military service because this would mean they can caput the whole career...destroy the whole career as a electrical engineer?"</span> <span id="s139">I was at that time assistant professor of the University in Zurich for electrical engineering.</span> <span id="s140">And as such, we were often invited by the physics...physics...uh...professors in their symposiums with Einstein and Boler.</span> <span id="s141">So I got to know them as well (Laughing) as a..</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">as a assistant of the professor.</span> <span id="s144">And here he said, "Would you like to make that all...destroy all the things by refusing to do military service.”</span> <span id="s145">"I offer you," he said, "to...to go to the medical...to where they don't have to kill.”</span> <span id="s146">And you...and so I accepted that also reluctantly.</span> <span id="s147">And I did 3...I did boot camp in Basel, and then three repetition courses.</span> <span id="s148">In Switzerland you do when you are 20...20 to 30 weeks boot camp, and then until you are 35, every year repetition course of 2 weeks to 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s149">I did that three times after boot camp in Basel, but I made always people...uh...laugh at me because I..</span> <span id="s150">.</span> <span id="s151">I made...I spoke out quite clearly what I thought about the military and...uh...they said, "But you are quite right, but you are...you serve in the military, so you are a hypocrite.”</span> <span id="s152">(Laughing) You speak against the military, but yourself are in the military.</span> <span id="s153">And so after 3 years I also refused to do that.</span> <span id="s154">And I was accused of refusing to do a good work for the people in the military because I could not help any wounded soldier.</span> <span id="s155">I said, "I'll help the wounded soldiers but not because you order...not because you order me to do that.</span> <span id="s156">Out of my free will!</span> <span id="s157">I do not wish to be only the last wagon on the train which is built for killing.”</span> <span id="s158">And so they said I..</span> <span id="s159">.</span> <span id="s160">we would like to give you 2 months prison, but because you are academic we give you 3 months prison.</span> <span id="s161">You give a very bad example.</span> <span id="s162">So I was for 3 months in solitary prison in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s163">And in this 3 months I got the old testament edition of the old testament I got to read.</span> <span id="s164">Because a friend of mine gave it to me to read.</span> <span id="s165">I read it as history of the Jewish people and...uh...it didn't make a great impression on me, but...uh...I still have it in mine.</span> <span id="s166">And then when I came out, I had no possibility of any employment in Switzerland because when in Switzerland when you are prison, especially I was told that I should not expect any employment in Switzerland after I had refused the most...uh...best service you can do to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s167">So I had to go out of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s168">And my idea was first to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s169">I learned Russian.</span> <span id="s170">I still know a few words.</span> <span id="s171">Uh...I learned Russia and because Switzerland had no diplomatic relationship with Russia, I had to go to Berlin to get the visa for Russia.</span> <span id="s172">On the way to Berlin which I went on...on bike, all on bike because I had no money to travel by train.</span> <span id="s173">So I visited a quite few free communities on the way.</span> <span id="s174">For instance, at Bruderhof, I was invited and...uh...but the Bruderhof, I was 3 weeks in all, but there were two Christian for me (Laughing) after what I experiences in Christian churches.</span> <span id="s175">And then I met...uh...in Holland, I met a , who according to the bible had given away his whole property.</span> <span id="s176">He was a rich man and he had given away all the property to the poor, but he said, "To whom should I give it?</span> <span id="s177">If I give it away to the poor, I'll make the poor rich.</span> <span id="s178">So what's the difference?"</span> <span id="s179">And therefore he gave it back to the workers, who had worked for the riches, and they did not accept it.</span> <span id="s180">They made a foundation from the man which they gave back to help poor people, poor children, poor .</span> <span id="s181">And he said, "But now, it's not sufficient only to give away property.</span> <span id="s182">I have to work.”</span> <span id="s183">Therefore, they started to live in community because community...uh...made it clear that everybody gives what he has and everybody receives what he needs.</span> <span id="s184">That is community.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: What did they call this community?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: .</span> <span id="s187">But this community had disappeared after 4 or 5 years because they couldn't get united as I tell later.</span> <span id="s188">Then...uh...I went to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What year is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: That was 1928.</span> <span id="s191">And...uh...I wished to go to Russia to find out what happened there, because we didn't have any clear...clear news about Russia what happened there.</span> <span id="s192">As had just died and was not yet completely the dictator he became later on.</span> <span id="s193">So I wished to go to Russia to find out myself.</span> <span id="s194">And when I arrived in the Russian Embassy in Berlin, they said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s195">We need electrical engineers very urgently for the building up of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">But.</span> <span id="s197">(coughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you want to stop and take some water?</span> <span id="s199">There's plenty of time.</span> <span id="s200">A: It's not the water.</span> <span id="s201">I..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: There's kleenex and there's water.</span> <span id="s205">Take your time.</span> <span id="s206">You okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: (Coughing) Yeah.</span> <span id="s208">They say they need electrical engineers very urgently, but we do not have...wish to have any conscientious objector in Berlin, so I didn't the visa for Russia.</span> <span id="s209">So I had to leave to work...to seek work in Germany.</span> <span id="s210">In Switzerland, I didn't get any work.</span> <span id="s211">And in Germany, there was still the Weimer Republic, which had been forbidden by Warsaw to have an army.</span> <span id="s212">There were only 100,000 people...soldiers for police.</span> <span id="s213">And so I..</span> <span id="s214">.</span> <span id="s215">when I had to report...reply for the police for...uh...for...uh... education in Germany, they asked me, "Have you been in prison?"</span> <span id="s216">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s217">"For what?"</span> <span id="s218">"For military purposes.”</span> <span id="s219">"Oh, that doesn't bother us," they said, "because we have no such question.”</span> <span id="s220">So I got in Germany permission to radicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: To what?</span> <span id="s222">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s223">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Permission to radicate...to...to settle.</span> <span id="s226">And...uh...then ...uh...I got work by the seaman .</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Seamen's is the biggest General Electric Company in Germany.</span> <span id="s228">(cough) And what did I have to do?</span> <span id="s229">I had to improve technically the productivity of the individual worker.</span> <span id="s230">And I made hundreds of people unemployed by this.</span> <span id="s231">You know, if I..</span> <span id="s232">.</span> <span id="s233">I show you why I have example...I was in...uh...busy in a spinning mill.</span> <span id="s234">In the spinning mill, they had...was a big factory, and they...uh...made spin...spun thread.</span> <span id="s235">And the thread is then put on the spool.</span> <span id="s236">And the...the...the speed of the spool going around depends how speeds how big the speed is of the stick.</span> <span id="s237">Well, when the spool got thicker, how the spool get the same revolution, then the thread gets quicker, therefore it gets thinner and breaks more often.</span> <span id="s238">Therefore, they had too, for each spinning stole, they have to two girls to observe the spool.</span> <span id="s239">And if...uh...uh...thread broke, they had stop the machine and put the threat together again, let the machine run.</span> <span id="s240">We made a technically the thing so that the speed of the speeding was always the same.</span> <span id="s241">That means that when the spool could double the size, the speed of the turning was half.</span> <span id="s242">And we put electric motors on it which varied its speeds according to the size of the spool.</span> <span id="s243">And then they had much less breaks and the...and the quality of the thread was better.</span> <span id="s244">But they only needed l girl per stool.</span> <span id="s245">They had 200 stools in the factory.</span> <span id="s246">They got 5...200 girls got unemployed.</span> <span id="s247">And I was invited as an electrical engineer by the director of the factory for many times, and I asked him there what do you do with these 200 women back unemployed.</span> <span id="s248">He said, "That's not my business.”</span> <span id="s249">That's their business.</span> <span id="s250">So I made 200 girls unemployed.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">When they asked him what should they do now, and he said they have to seek their own income.</span> <span id="s252">And if they're....you're nice girl, they can find their income through prostitution.</span> <span id="s253">But he saved me, so I was in a dilemma.</span> <span id="s254">I was as a electrical engineer, I was improving the productivity of the individual worker and made with that lots of people unemployed.</span> <span id="s255">And my wife and I we were considered what should we do?</span> <span id="s256">What should we do now?</span> <span id="s257">In Switzerland, we don't get any work.</span> <span id="s258">In Russian, they don't wish us.</span> <span id="s259">In Germany, you make so many people unemployed?</span> <span id="s260">What do we do?</span> <span id="s261">My wife was same youth movement and she had the same question, and so we were working with the Socialist Youth Movement in Germany, but we saw no results.</span> <span id="s262">It was not better.</span> <span id="s263">And I know at that time when the talk came on Hitler, people everywhere laughed.</span> <span id="s264">Hitler impossible.</span> <span id="s265">Hitler is not even a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">He's an Austrian.</span> <span id="s267">He is an illegit and a chld.</span> <span id="s268">He's only...he's not a studied man...he's only a house painter.</span> <span id="s269">And he has a grandfather...illegitimate grandfather who is a Jew.</span> <span id="s270">Do you that he ever gets to the power in Germany?</span> <span id="s271">No.</span> <span id="s272">Everybody laughed.</span> <span id="s273">And 5 years later he was there in democratic fashion, because according to democratic rules, he...he became chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Let's...let's stay with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Not... and knowing...the people knew exactly what he represented.</span> <span id="s276">In any case, we stopped the work and after 2 years in...in Germany, and we started ourselves a community in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s277">And because we said how is it possible that people...the whole humanity can become socially just and in peace.</span> <span id="s278">We have to do it ourself before we can expect from the others.</span> <span id="s279">We have to experience it ourselves whether it's possible.</span> <span id="s280">And...and secondly if we represent that people can only believe us if we do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s281">So the question is always that we don't expect from the others to do things, but we do it ourselves first of things.</span> <span id="s282">And so therefore this reason we started to live in community, idealistic community like the kibbutz from idealism and peace and justice that we represented that we lived that.</span> <span id="s283">(clearing throat) But then we made experience that there were as many ideas as there were idealists, and we couldn't come to common unity as community expresses, and we were looking around.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Where is that unity that we found?</span> <span id="s285">And we found it only in the will of God.</span> <span id="s286">Only if we all do the will of God, then we become united.</span> <span id="s287">And so we after 3 years, we joined the Bruderhof in Germany who represented that.</span> <span id="s288">Christ...Christ for us...Christ is not the founder of the Christian churches.</span> <span id="s289">The Christian churches do exactly the opposite of what Christ said.</span> <span id="s290">(Clearing throat) For instance...</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: No.</span> <span id="s292">Please.</span> <span id="s293">Stop for a moment.</span> <span id="s294">Take some water.</span> <span id="s295">Take some kleenex.</span> <span id="s296">Take your time.</span> <span id="s297">Q: How long...you...you joined the Hutterian Brotherhood.</span> <span id="s298">Was it called that at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: It was so.</span> <span id="s300">1930 we started in Switzerland to live in community, (clearing throat) and there right in the beginning a pastor came to us with a family of four children.</span> <span id="s301">And he said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s302">Can I join you?</span> <span id="s303">Because I preach but I don't do.</span> <span id="s304">I don't live really a brotherly life.</span> <span id="s305">I have a nice house as a pastor and I have nice (coughing) income.</span> <span id="s306">Can I join you?"</span> <span id="s307">And one of our...we were three families, three couples who started...who came from the same youth movement.</span> <span id="s308">And...uh...one family was more Christian than we.</span> <span id="s309">And they said, "Look, go to the Bruderhof and learn there how to live in community.</span> <span id="s310">And then come back and teach us.”</span> <span id="s311">And they went and stayed...1930.</span> <span id="s312">And then the Bruderhof was always concerned because they felt very much that we were seeking that unity, fighting for it....uh...struggling for it, but didn't find.</span> <span id="s313">And therefore when the second family wished to go away...the second...another family who was one of the founders of our community...they wished to go off the same.</span> <span id="s314">We don't find unity.</span> <span id="s315">It's finished.</span> <span id="s316">And they were given the advice also to go to the Bruderhof first.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: The Bruderhof?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The Bruderhof had already 10 years or 12 years proven that they have...could fight through to unity the whole time.</span> <span id="s319">And so they went.</span> <span id="s320">And they also remained in the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s321">And so then they Bruderhof came more and more interested in our community, and tried to help us.</span> <span id="s322">And then they sent a letter to us...1933 in January, challenging us.</span> <span id="s323">And on this my wife said, "That's the thing which we need.”</span> <span id="s324">I said, "I'm...I'm not quite sure about that.”</span> <span id="s325">And I for the first time in my life was asking God... start to say, "What do you think?</span> <span id="s326">What should I do?"</span> <span id="s327">And I got somehow a confirmation that I should go at least to find out what is on the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s328">And so I come with my wife and a son.</span> <span id="s329">We had Klaus, who was at that time 10 minutes old.</span> <span id="s330">And then...in the Bruderhof I sat, so to say, in the corner and looked through like an you know what...what's the matter here?</span> <span id="s331">And then I found out that the true Christ is different from the Christ of the churches.</span> <span id="s332">That the true Christ fulfilled really what the Tennah said.</span> <span id="s333">It's not so that he was against the Tennah , but he but the CHristians prosecuted the Jews.</span> <span id="s334">That's a contradiction.</span> <span id="s335">So on the Bruderhof, I found the true Christ, not the Christ of the churches and a community, and therefore I joined.</span> <span id="s336">Now at this moment, Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s337">And Everett Arnold who had been...had been judgment of the war had also been led to live in the community, he told us the following.</span> <span id="s338">Look here.</span> <span id="s339">Hitler came out of power, and here he comes in at the Holocaust because the Hitler prepared the Holocaust so to say.</span> <span id="s340">And he said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s341">This Hitler is preparing murder, deaths.</span> <span id="s342">We have to give a witness.</span> <span id="s343">We have to give a witness of life.</span> <span id="s344">Everybody that may cross our lives if we give that...everybody who does not wish to give his life should disappear.</span> <span id="s345">And those who wish to give their lives for the truth should stay on the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s346">And we stayed.</span> <span id="s347">A few left, and a few stayed.</span> <span id="s348">About 120 stayed on the Bruderhof when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s349">And then we had ...soon had the raids of six police by the Nazis but they couldn't...they...they...couldn't still distinguish between Christian Socialism and Christian communism and political communism, because we are accused of being communists, you know like today.</span> <span id="s350">(Laughing) You know, the finest accusation.</span> <span id="s351">And...uh...because we were living community, we were communists.</span> <span id="s352">And we were told that if the communists come to power, we will be the first to be hanged on the trees outside the Bruderhof.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: The communists told?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: The Communists that if they would come to power, they would...we will be the first to have...be hanged, because we represented another communism which is not...uh...uh... political communism.</span> <span id="s355">The Christian communism...you know ...you know, the first Christians in Jerusalem were all Jews, and they lived in community.</span> <span id="s356">They shared everything they had when the spirit came.</span> <span id="s357">(Laughing) So we say the spirit made them live in community, not they themselves.</span> <span id="s358">Not their ideas, but the spirit of God made them live in community as brothers.</span> <span id="s359">And so therefore, we represented that.</span> <span id="s360">We said also we have only one leader.</span> <span id="s361">That's Christ, and not Hitler, because Hitler was calling himself the leader.</span> <span id="s362">We didn't say Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s363">And we refused all the persecution of the Jews and everything and we wrote that to Hitler.</span> <span id="s364">We wrote a personal letter to Hitler and challenged him to not to shed innocent blood.</span> <span id="s365">And in the end we said, "Look here, Hitler, what we wish you from our hearts is that you become of a..</span> <span id="s366">.</span> <span id="s367">tool of the life of God...a tool of the life of God.”</span> <span id="s368">And we never got an answer to that letter.</span> <span id="s369">But we heard later that Hitler was asking when he was at the headquarters of a maneuvering nearby whether we live up there on that place.</span> <span id="s370">So he knew something about us.</span> <span id="s371">And we read...we sent also letters to the Gestapo to...to the Governor, to the Hinderburg, to Hitler, to...oh...to everybody in the thing, saying quite clearly where we stand.</span> <span id="s372">And then... uh...came the which Klaus already spoke in which Hitler asked the people in Germany whether they agree with his politics.</span> <span id="s373">He had just left that League of Nations and...uh...we did not say neither yes nor...nor no, but we said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s374">We have to go a different way, and we challenge you.</span> <span id="s375">We have to go a different way.</span> <span id="s376">The different way is to the way of Christ and not the way of...uh.</span> <span id="s377">.</span> <span id="s378">what you suggest.”</span> <span id="s379">And on this 5 days later or 4 days later, we had 150 men with revolvers storming the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s380">Hundred fifty SA, SS and people storming the Bruderhof, and we greeted them...said, "Good Morning.</span> <span id="s381">How are you?"</span> <span id="s382">(Laughing) And they couldn't understand that.</span> <span id="s383">They found it...uh...uh...cheeky.</span> <span id="s384">They couldn't understand it, and they did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s385">And because they expected resistance, I asked them, "Why do you come?"</span> <span id="s386">They said, "We were...we were called up to raid communist nests, and now we found no resistance.”</span> <span id="s387">And so they...in the end of the day, they took all the books with red covers from the library as proof that you were communists (Laughing) and they left and said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s388">We forbid you to...uh...” No, I asked one of the Gestapo, "Look here, why do you come here?"</span> <span id="s389">He said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s390">You represent community and we represent community, but you represent community in another spirit than we.</span> <span id="s391">Therefore, it's impossible for you and we forbid that you take any guests in.”</span> <span id="s392">We were forbidden by the Gestapo to take any guests.</span> <span id="s393">And...uh...so then...uh...but we didn't...we didn't obey.</span> <span id="s394">(Laughing) We just...any guests we warned from that point, we say, "Look here.”</span> <span id="s395">If a guest came, we say, "Look here.</span> <span id="s396">If you are here, staying here, you are commit a danger because in Germany, you say, caught with us if you are caught with us, you will be hanged with us.</span> <span id="s397">And so those who were fearful left, but those who meant it seriously stayed.</span> <span id="s398">And then secondly, they tested the children that they found that the children had no national socialist education, and they said, "We wish to educate your children nationalist socialist," and we said, "No.</span> <span id="s399">We can't do that.</span> <span id="s400">We don't let you the children go.”</span> <span id="s401">And then we had adopted a lot of children of people in poverty or who...who father or mother has died, and they tried to...wish to take them away from us.</span> <span id="s402">And we did everything to keep them.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">And...uh...for this reason, I was sent to Switzerland, to find a place for...for the children because the children couldn't stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s404">And in Switzerland I knew from the time we lived there in community and other community in French Switzerland community, the , and I went there to ask them and they first wished to educate the children themselves.</span> <span id="s405">And I said, "No, we educate our children ourselves.”</span> <span id="s406">And then in the end, they agreed but said that they'd only take our children if the government is in agreement.</span> <span id="s407">And so I went with one of their members next day early to the government in Lausanne and in Lausanne they said, "Oh, that's not our business.</span> <span id="s408">That's the business of the federal government.”</span> <span id="s409">And so we went to them and they asked, "Why do the children wish to leave Germany.”</span> <span id="s410">And we...I tried to explain to them quite clearly what it meant.</span> <span id="s411">And they were...they said, "Look, why can't the children obey the government, the Swiss government?"</span> <span id="s412">And then he said, "Who are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">You speak Swiss-German.</span> <span id="s414">You are a Swiss?</span> <span id="s415">Who are you?</span> <span id="s416">And when they found out that I was a conscious objector, they said, "Of these of your children we wish to have no nothing.”</span> <span id="s417">It's illegal for your children to come to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s418">And then I went to Prague...uh...to find out whether there's a possibility for...in all Bruderhofs of the 16th century go in case we are no more tolerated in Germany.</span> <span id="s419">But...uh...I have the recommendation letter to Masserick, Tomas Masserick, the President of that time.</span> <span id="s420">A very good recommendation or letter from Switzerland from a friend of his, but he was sick and...and his secretary...press secretary helped me very much.</span> <span id="s421">And they found out that all the old places were under the protection of the...law which protected history.</span> <span id="s422">And but they offered us lands.</span> <span id="s423">Luckily, we never had to accept that.</span> <span id="s424">I went back to Switzerland and I had no news for a fort night and I didn't know whether the Bruderhof still existed.</span> <span id="s425">So I went first to the Umslatz and I tried to find out and nobody could tell whether the Bruderhof still existed.</span> <span id="s426">And so in the night I sneaked up the Bruderhof to find out that the Bruderhof still is there.</span> <span id="s427">And it was still there.</span> <span id="s428">(Laughing) And I told my experiences, and on this a teacher...this left the children for Switzerland illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: You went back to Germany to see whether it was still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s431">Yeah.</span> <span id="s432">And find out that they're still there.</span> <span id="s433">And then we were sent to Swiss, to Berlin, to find out what the Gestapo has in mind.</span> <span id="s434">We went to the...to the top...uh...directors of the Gestapo in Berlin and they...they found out that the cheeky, cheeky, to tried to find out of the Gestapo what they have in mind.</span> <span id="s435">And the man who had the whole thing in his hands, he read the minutes which he...which they took...uh...while they were waiting the Bruderhof, they took the minutes with them, and I brought the other minutes to Switzerland by the way to bring them to safety not...the Gestapo asked for.</span> <span id="s436">And there he read to us, "Look here.</span> <span id="s437">You represent publicly that the present state of Hitler shows most clearly the character of every state as the beast for the .</span> <span id="s438">"If you still think we are the beast and we are this and represent that, I close you down immediately," said the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s439">But I cannot only close you down if the government is in agreement.</span> <span id="s440">And the government was not in agreement.</span> <span id="s441">You know why?</span> <span id="s442">We found only out after the war...after the war.</span> <span id="s443">They tried to find out...no one of our members in North America married the daughter of an employee of the State Department here, in Washington...uh...Nelson.</span> <span id="s444">And he visited us and I asked him, "Can't you find the archive of Hitler, at that time about this?"</span> <span id="s445">"Why.”</span> <span id="s446">He said he gave us the address and telephone number and I inquired here in Washington, and they didn't have anything, and they referred us to .</span> <span id="s447">But they didn't find anything in communist country.</span> <span id="s448">It's in east Germany.</span> <span id="s449">Now we heard after the war, the following.</span> <span id="s450">That a man in East German, a pastor, a methodist pastor, made the doctorate in churches to me.</span> <span id="s451">And he wishes to make a about the three churches to Hitler in the time of Hitler time.</span> <span id="s452">And for this reason he got the permission from the communist government to go through the archives of Hitler which are in .</span> <span id="s453">As he went through the archives of Hitler, not knowing about us anything, and he found there correspondence between the Gestapo and the government a thing about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">And he found there a..</span> <span id="s455">.</span> <span id="s456">he got so to know that we existed there for the first time and on this he got in contact with us.</span> <span id="s457">And through him we found the following.</span> <span id="s458">That the government...the government said, No.</span> <span id="s459">No.</span> <span id="s460">We can't...we can't dissolve the Bruderhof because they have a lot of friends in North America.</span> <span id="s461">And when we dissolve them, they can spread the rumor in North America that we...Hitler, persecute Christians.</span> <span id="s462">We can't have that.</span> <span id="s463">We must find another reason.</span> <span id="s464">So the Gestapo found the following reason.</span> <span id="s465">Because we did not resist them when they visited us with the 150 armed men, we must have taken cocaine.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Must have taken what?</span> <span id="s467">A: Cocaine.</span> <span id="s468">Cocaine.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: They said you have must have taken cocaine because you didn't resist them?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s471">Yeah.</span> <span id="s472">Because we were friendly to them, whatever...for refusing.</span> <span id="s473">And so you must be drug addicts on which the governor says everybody knows this is a swindle.</span> <span id="s474">We can't do that.</span> <span id="s475">We have to find another reason.</span> <span id="s476">And the other reason which the governor suggested was to...to take over all our houses and lands for military purposes because the Americans do the same.</span> <span id="s477">They can't say we are persecuting Christians.</span> <span id="s478">You understand?</span> <span id="s479">And they...Hitler at that time did not wish to have a bad impression of Germany in America.</span> <span id="s480">He wished to have a good impression.</span> <span id="s481">Not that he persecutes Christians.</span> <span id="s482">And therefore it went forward and backward between Gestapo, them...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: What were you doing during all this period?</span> <span id="s484">A: What?</span> <span id="s485">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: What were you doing while all this was going on.</span> <span id="s487">This is what?</span> <span id="s488">1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: We're building up.</span> <span id="s490">Building up.</span> <span id="s491">And we had to build up in Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s492">Oh, yes, in Lichenstein, we found the children couldn't stay in Switzerland any longer, so we had...</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I need to stop a minute if I can.</span> <span id="s494">Let's pause.</span> <span id="s495">I need to know what Hans was doing?</span> <span id="s496">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s497">You had gone back to Germany.</span> <span id="s498">You visited the Brotherhood.</span> <span id="s499">Now what?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I visited there.</span> <span id="s501">I visited Berlin, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s502">At the same time we visited also the founder of the Confessional Church in Germany, but the and the leading...uh... leading man from the Mennonites, .</span> <span id="s503">And both said, "We have nothing to do.</span> <span id="s504">You are not obedient to the government because you refused to do military service."</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Why were you doing all of these travels?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Because we wished to make as a witness against...against Hitler, to give a witness of what the CHristmas are because we said I represent positive Christianity.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Did you get support as you traveled?</span> <span id="s508">A: Only from very...very...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: And who this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Very....practically nobody.</span> <span id="s511">Not even the Jews.</span> <span id="s512">We have two Jewish family among us, and we brought them to the...uh...Lichenstein to be out of the country that they were not persecuted.</span> <span id="s513">And...uh...and the question was this.</span> <span id="s514">We represented that, but nobody was listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: When you went to Pasteur Neumueller, what did he tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: And he told us, "Look here.</span> <span id="s517">You I can't you together.</span> <span id="s518">I can't give that witness what you give because you are disobedient to the government because you don't want to do military service for them.”</span> <span id="s519">I would do military service if the government ask me to do it.</span> <span id="s520">But I would not be obedient if the government would try to hinder me to...to</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Move your hand away.</span> <span id="s522">I can't hear you.</span> <span id="s523">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: If the government would hinder me to sermon...to do a sermon on the pure word of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">And we told him, "Look here.</span> <span id="s526">The pure word of God doesn't exist here, only of , but of .</span> <span id="s527">And the means that you should love your enemy; that the revenge is in God's hands and not in our hands as the prophets say.</span> <span id="s528">The prophets say the whole time again and again, "People don't revenge yourself.</span> <span id="s529">Leave the revenge to me.”</span> <span id="s530">Yeah.</span> <span id="s531">The Prophets say that the whole time.</span> <span id="s532">And we say we represent that.</span> <span id="s533">And they said, "No, we have to obey the government.”</span> <span id="s534">And then you know, he was...he had that sermon in Berlin against the persecution of the Jews and he was accused.</span> <span id="s535">And then the church had no law against that and let him go free.</span> <span id="s536">When Hitler heard that, he put him into concentration camp as his personal prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Pasteur Neumoller's story is very familiar.</span> <span id="s538">I need Hans' story.</span> <span id="s539">I need your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s541">And then...then...my story is the following.</span> <span id="s542">Uh...At the same time as we were put into prison later, 1937, he was put into concentration camp because he refused to preach for...against the Jews.</span> <span id="s543">And he was for 8 years in concentration camp and the prison wardens tried to tease him the whole time by executing prisoners before his window.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Let us...</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: And then he said each time these criminals, these swine and really saw one man who said, "Forgive them.</span> <span id="s546">They don't know what they do?"</span> <span id="s547">And then he changed his attitude.</span> <span id="s548">And from that moment on, nobody listened what That was the fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Let us come back to you.</span> <span id="s550">You had been doing all these travels.</span> <span id="s551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: That was 1933, 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: At the end of these travels, you had been going to see these people trying to get help.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Uh...When...when you got finished traveling, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Oh, I worked in the garden.</span> <span id="s557">Q: You...you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: I came back and worked in the garden or in the cow stall or where it was necessary.</span> <span id="s559">We are ready to do any work which helps the whole community.</span> <span id="s560">For instance...</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: What were you...I need to ask.</span> <span id="s562">What was life like for you...uh...in the in let's say 34, 35, 36.</span> <span id="s563">What was your life like?</span> <span id="s564">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Poor.</span> <span id="s566">Very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Because we had to build up a Lichenstein Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s569">In 1936, we had to build up a English Bruderhof because you have heard what Klaus said?</span> <span id="s570">No?</span> <span id="s571">You haven't heard.</span> <span id="s572">What Klaus said...</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: We need your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: In the meantime, I always worked in the garden or in the cow stall or where it was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">And I was also making journeys to Holland and...uh...selling drinks and books to get some money in...and then we got...uh...a letter from the Burgenmeiser of Berlin .</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s577">Just summarize it.</span> <span id="s578">Just tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: The letter he said the Bruderhof protests against that we have forbidden them to sell their books.</span> <span id="s580">I have the following reasons.</span> <span id="s581">Their propaganda in all their books is against Hitler.</span> <span id="s582">It's dangerous to the state, enemy to the state.</span> <span id="s583">They have brought all their military people to Lichenstein where they were called up.</span> <span id="s584">You know, the young chaps who were called up military service, they brought to Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s585">They have tried to save them from military service.</span> <span id="s586">You have refused to persecute the Jews.</span> <span id="s587">You have refused to contribute to the community...community of the people as they say in Germany.</span> <span id="s588">You have worked against it.</span> <span id="s589">Altogether, you ever...you never used the greeting Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s590">You publicly declared that you never become national socialist and I can only say all the books and all what the brotherhood does is against the state of Hitler.</span> <span id="s591">Therefore I forbid them to sell their books, sell their produce.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s593">At this point, we're going to stop and pause and change tapes.</span> <span id="s594">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So the...the tape has started.</span> <span id="s598">We're back on tape.</span> <span id="s599">The Bergermeister had sent this letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Uh...You weren't allowed to sell your books.</span> <span id="s601">Uh...What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: We never sent our books.</span> <span id="s603">I went myself on bikes full of books, and you know what the experience on the way.</span> <span id="s604">We couldn't go to people who knew that the police was persecuting us.</span> <span id="s605">So we could only go to nice people who would not denounce us with the police.</span> <span id="s606">And then we knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s607">The door opened and the people said, "Oh Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s608">Oh, you are coming from the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s609">Please excuse us.</span> <span id="s610">If we don't say Heil Hitler, our children are despised in school.</span> <span id="s611">We lose our house.</span> <span id="s612">We lose our job.</span> <span id="s613">Forgive us that we say Heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s614">And we told them each time, "Look here.</span> <span id="s615">The...the saying give Heil Hitler, you give the devil the small finger which soon has your whole hand.”</span> <span id="s616">(Laughing) That's what we said.</span> <span id="s617">We...we sold our books in spite of the.</span> <span id="s618">.</span> <span id="s619">the permission.</span> <span id="s620">(Laughing) And then it was so...I was sent to Switzerland to sell the books.</span> <span id="s621">And on a Saturday afternoon in 1935, in Basel, I was just walking across the marketplace and I suddenly saw in a..</span> <span id="s622">.</span> <span id="s623">in a big window, a handwritten, big announcement that Hitler just had introduced military service for the whole of Germany.</span> <span id="s624">On this I phoned immediately the Bruderhof to inform him, and Everett Arnold came on the phone.</span> <span id="s625">And he could not speak on the phone openly.</span> <span id="s626">We had to speak in code.</span> <span id="s627">And we spoke of the weather.</span> <span id="s628">And he asked if...how the weather is in Switzerland, and I said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s629">The weather in Switzerland is good, but in...in...uh...in north...north," I said, "the weather is brewing together to a storm.”</span> <span id="s630">And our friends from Berlin have invited our young people to come to Berlin.</span> <span id="s631">And he immediately knew what it meant because he had been forewarned by people in Kassel about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s632">And then they had that Brother...brotherhood.</span> <span id="s633">No...and he...he told me, "Look here.</span> <span id="s634">Try to come home tonight and bring some money because we have to...he didn't say that, but I could...uh...imagine it, we need some money to send all these 15 brothers to the .</span> <span id="s635">And so I..</span> <span id="s636">.</span> <span id="s637">uh...I the same night, there were two things.</span> <span id="s638">One thing was the brotherhood in...in Germany in which they decided that they would not...uh...put the life of the young brothers into concentration camp but rather for the building up of the Bruderhof in Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s639">And said because if they refuse to go they would put...put into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s640">And so they...they left the same night and there because we have not enough money to give them all, had to go just blind all arrived in the Bruderhof.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: And they fled over the border into Lichenstein?</span> <span id="s642">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s644">What did you do during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I..</span> <span id="s646">.</span> <span id="s647">I went...I..</span> <span id="s648">.</span> <span id="s649">I asked friends for the youth movement in Basel to come together the same evening, and asked them for help.</span> <span id="s650">And they...I..</span> <span id="s651">.</span> <span id="s652">they gave me altogether about 500 francs help, and with the 500 francs in my pocket I went back to the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s653">And I arrived the next morning and the 50 brothers were no more there.</span> <span id="s654">The 50 young brothers.</span> <span id="s655">And then they had two .</span> <span id="s656">When the Germany without the children and we got the 15 guineas...Germans, only Swiss and Danish.</span> <span id="s657">Others were there, and so it was a very division.</span> <span id="s658">And then...then the Brotherhood, then I went back to...to Germany and worked there again the garden and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">.</span> <span id="s660">And then I take because many had to go to the other Broderhof, Lichenstein, I had to take over the stewardship, the many business of the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s661">And I..</span> <span id="s662">.</span> <span id="s663">there was now the following.</span> <span id="s664">We had bought three dilapidated farms which supported perhaps 20 people altogether.</span> <span id="s665">And we built it up to for 150 people with school house, laundry, bake house... uh...farm houses necessary for cattle...more cattle, and all the things which and I put into the barn sheeps.</span> <span id="s666">You know, the barn sheep.</span> <span id="s667">I put all the cattle in which you put in.</span> <span id="s668">We also improved like agriculture with lime.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: I need to interrupt enough to ask...we need to move it up, move it a little faster.</span> <span id="s670">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Can you tell me what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Then happened the following.</span> <span id="s673">The...the young chaps went to Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s674">And then the Lichenstein government told us in confidence, "Look here.</span> <span id="s675">Hitler has already asked for these chaps.</span> <span id="s676">Go.</span> <span id="s677">.</span> <span id="s678">go that we...because we are too small a country to resist Hitler and take away the young chaps.</span> <span id="s679">And so had to found the Bruderhof in England community.</span> <span id="s680">And we had to send them there.</span> <span id="s681">And I..</span> <span id="s682">.</span> <span id="s683">now it happened the following.</span> <span id="s684">At the same at just at that moment, France closed its frontier for all Germans because Hitler with his illegal army had illegally occupied the Rhineland, and France in its anger closed all of France, and so how should we get...get the young chaps from Lichenstein to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The borders not through France, not through Germany.</span> <span id="s687">In Germany, they would have take...be taken immediately to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s688">And so they sent me with three which were most danger to find our way to England.</span> <span id="s689">And the stewart there gave me 120 francs and said, "Here.</span> <span id="s690">That's all what we can give" what I have in my pocket...my person.</span> <span id="s691">Look how you get there England without...and then we went to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s693">I need...I need to stop this.</span> <span id="s694">Hold it.</span> <span id="s695">Can we stop the tape please?</span> <span id="s696">I'm getting a cross feed on here.</span> <span id="s697">I can't...I can't keep anything in my ear and it's too loud.</span> <span id="s698">Can you stop the tape?</span> <span id="s699">Okay.</span> <span id="s700">Alright.</span> <span id="s701">We're back on.</span> <span id="s702">Uh...How did you get the brethren to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: I mean we went to Italy because there we did not need any visas.</span> <span id="s704">And we tried to get the ship from Geneva, but there was no ship to England from Geneva because the League of Nations had put an embargo on Italy because of the attack on Abssinia.</span> <span id="s705">And therefore we had to sneak across the frontier.</span> <span id="s706">And we went along the Riviera to .</span> <span id="s707">and the weather was very nice because there was...uh...mist all over the Alps and we thought we can sneak over.</span> <span id="s708">And we were caught by the police, by the Italian police, as spies.</span> <span id="s709">And we were threatened to be transported back to Geneva as spies and to be delivered up to Germany.</span> <span id="s710">And I asked this man...this police...Italian policeman, "Look here.</span> <span id="s711">You know that you have no spies.”</span> <span id="s712">And they said suddenly, "Who are you?</span> <span id="s713">Are you a Franciscan?"</span> <span id="s714">And I..</span> <span id="s715">.</span> <span id="s716">because I tried in my Italian to explain to him how we missed...and I told him in my poor Italian how we missed the community, and he said in the end, "Look here.</span> <span id="s717">I believe you that you are no spies, but I can't cross both eyes.</span> <span id="s718">I..</span> <span id="s719">.</span> <span id="s720">but I close one eye, and push you over the frontier."</span> <span id="s721">(Laughing) Just what we wished.</span> <span id="s722">And he paid even a stranger to the frontier and then they pushed us over the Italian frontier into the France.</span> <span id="s723">And then they put their stamps all on the last pages of our passport, and when we arrived at the French frontier the man was only looking for the Italian stamps and didn't see that there were German passports and let us go.</span> <span id="s724">And then he accompanied us to the police and said you have to announce to the police and the police neither discovered that they were German passports.</span> <span id="s725">Let us go through!</span> <span id="s726">Then we arrived by...the last minute we gave to the express train to Paris...Paris.</span> <span id="s727">And we went through from...uh...Nice to Paris where we ride express train and arrived in Paris without money, without visa.</span> <span id="s728">And then we phoned to England and they sent us some money telegraphically that we could travel on.</span> <span id="s729">When we arrived in , the man French man said that look here.</span> <span id="s730">How can I put the leave taking stamp in your passports when you have no entry stamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">What should I do?</span> <span id="s732">I can only deliver you to...to Germany?"</span> <span id="s733">And I begged him and said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s734">We just leave now France.</span> <span id="s735">Have a bit of patience.”</span> <span id="s736">And in the end, he put the entry stamp before his out stamp in the passports and let us go.</span> <span id="s737">And then we arrived in England and the English man said, "Do you wish to come in by the back door when you have been thrown out by the front door?"</span> <span id="s738">Because one of the three with whom I traveled had been by air to London and refused entry into England because he was not fetched and counted by an English brethren , and he didn't know any word of English.</span> <span id="s739">And so he...and the end one of our brothers who fetched us in...in...uh...in Liverpool...in South Hampton, could convince the English man that we are innocent and he gave us 2 months of...of ... uh...stay in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: What did you do while you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: And then we arrived on the place which was later the Bruderhof, and they were just collecting the last money for the down payment and they just arrived 2 days later with all the money what down payment that we could start the Bruderhof.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Could start what?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: The , the English Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s744">And then I went back to Germany there...from there.</span> <span id="s745">And then we were more and more poor.</span> <span id="s746">I mean because we had deported some people to England, some to Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s747">And we were concerning what there should we do?</span> <span id="s748">And then on the...in 1937...then we got this letter from the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: You had...you had gone to England before the letter from the Gestapo came?</span> <span id="s750">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s752">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: And then returned to Germany.</span> <span id="s754">And...uh...I took over the stewardship there and was...uh...and I put in...in the... in the...uh.</span> <span id="s755">.</span> <span id="s756">in that bookkeeping the capital which we invested in the Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s757">In 1937, the Gestapo was stronger than the government, and they dissolved us against the government.</span> <span id="s758">And...uh...they confiscated everything.</span> <span id="s759">And I asked them....they came with 150 men armed.</span> <span id="s760">I asked them, "Why do you come?"</span> <span id="s761">They said, "We come to dissolve you.</span> <span id="s762">Everybody goes home and the Germans come to do military service.”</span> <span id="s763">And we said, "No, we don't do that.</span> <span id="s764">We just left home to live in community and our mili...our Germans don't do military service.”</span> <span id="s765">So they were flabbergasted and then they discovered that two Americans were there, just by chance...so called chance.</span> <span id="s766">And they said, "These Americans can't go back to North America and say that Hitler persecutes Christians.</span> <span id="s767">That they can't have.</span> <span id="s768">Therefore, they have to find...they have to find another reason.</span> <span id="s769">And they found the following reason.</span> <span id="s770">They said, "Pay your debts.”</span> <span id="s771">And I told them, "Look here.</span> <span id="s772">After you confiscated everything, with what should I pay my debts?</span> <span id="s773">If you give back what...what they have taken away, we can pay it.”</span> <span id="s774">Then they said, "No.</span> <span id="s775">We don't do it.”</span> <span id="s776">And they went to creditor, and he signed under their pressure a letter which he accused us of swindle because didn't pay.</span> <span id="s777">.</span> <span id="s778">pay him the debts.</span> <span id="s779">Although I have told the Gestapo I have to recuperate that they gave back, what they have...and shortly before we got the...the visit of a ...of a group of people, experts.</span> <span id="s780">They looked at the houses and the land.</span> <span id="s781">They said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s782">We buy all this and pay you the whole price and you have that for military purposes.”</span> <span id="s783">And so I had in my hand...I had the promise that they would get the money for all.</span> <span id="s784">.</span> <span id="s785">for all my debts.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: And then they said, "You committed falsification of the balance sheet because you put in...uh...much higher value than the balance sheet for what is there than what it was.”</span> <span id="s788">And the thing was the following.</span> <span id="s789">The Gestapo confiscated everything and then put it on auction.</span> <span id="s790">The whole...all the things.</span> <span id="s791">And he was only offered say 40,000 marcs instead of 180,000 marcs.</span> <span id="s792">And so they said because they are offered only 40,000 marcs...only valued 40,000 marcs, you put a wrong number into your balance sheet.</span> <span id="s793">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Is it clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: It's quite clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Under this...and now the thing was the following.</span> <span id="s798">They...they asked us...the...the commission or the directive commission...or they forced them, the directive commission of their association official, they asked us to come to the governor and to consider what are they going to do now.</span> <span id="s799">And we said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s800">If you throw us out, we would like to go to our communities in Lichenstein in England and all of our military people can go there.</span> <span id="s801">And they had to agree to with that because they knew two Americans were there observing them the whole time and therefore they arranged that...that the the Americans had to promise to pay to journey in case we would not pay the journey.</span> <span id="s802">And so they advanced the money for the journey to England and to Lichenstein for our people.</span> <span id="s803">And then when the whole thing was ended six policeman showed up and took us into custody of security.</span> <span id="s804">Not...not because we are falsified...uh...they accused of...lot later...because we had falsified balance sheet, but for our own security.</span> <span id="s805">You know, the security...and put us into prison and only after a fortnight, the judge accepted the accusation of false... false...uh...balance sheet, swindled balance sheet.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: What happened to you?</span> <span id="s807">What...where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: And then we were...we were taken to prison.</span> <span id="s809">And then the prison was changed from security prison into criminal prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: You were charged quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: We were charged with that, and then the judge had to trans...to investigate that this was true or not.</span> <span id="s812">And then the Gestapo took our fingerprints and photographs and everything and we protested.</span> <span id="s813">We said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s814">The whole thing is a big swindle.</span> <span id="s815">Uh...It's not true because the whole thing is much more value than what you think...uh...people offer.</span> <span id="s816">And...uh...you know, that's all a swindle.”</span> <span id="s817">They laughed.</span> <span id="s818">They laughed.</span> <span id="s819">They said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s820">You are enemies of the state.</span> <span id="s821">In case the church lets you go, we fetch you to concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s822">And so we sat 3 months in prison with the promise of the Gestapo to fetch us to concentration camp any day.</span> <span id="s823">And the judge let us go.</span> <span id="s824">And the judge must have had some...some...uh... qualms in his heart because he let us go 2 days before the Gestapo knew about it so that we had 2 days advance.</span> <span id="s825">And the judge the week before, our German member...we were two Swiss and one German, our German member was called into military service.</span> <span id="s826">And we said, "No.”</span> <span id="s827">And as the commanding officer to whom we wrote that letter was not present, they said, "Go back to prison where he can't escape us.</span> <span id="s828">We'll fetch you next week from prison where you can't escape us, and to go to military service.”</span> <span id="s829">And just the same Saturday, the judge let us go.</span> <span id="s830">And he told our lawyer and our lawyer told a friend of us with his car to fetch us from prison and he took us away from prison as quickly as possible, as far as possible.</span> <span id="s831">And then they came...I had no passport because the Gestapo had my passport.</span> <span id="s832">How do you get out of Germany?</span> <span id="s833">You could get anywhere, but not without passport.</span> <span id="s834">So I went to the Swiss Consulate in Frankfort and asked him...uh...to give me passport.</span> <span id="s835">And they gave me a passport without any papers.</span> <span id="s836">Nothing.</span> <span id="s837">Just because they knew me that I was conscious objector.</span> <span id="s838">And.</span> <span id="s839">.</span> <span id="s840">uh...and then I..</span> <span id="s841">.</span> <span id="s842">we sneaked...we had to sneak across the Dutch frontier because the...the Germans...the Germans could only go...leave Germany with the permission of the military, which you can't...couldn't get at that moment after you had been called up to military service.</span> <span id="s843">And therefore we had to sneak and I with my new passport was sent across the frontier immediately to prepare that the Dutch people wouldn't reject a German.</span> <span id="s844">And the two went into the woods to cross the frontier and missed the way.</span> <span id="s845">Came out on the German side again and only at midnight started again on the foot path to the woods to cross the frontier, and then they were caught by the border police, the German border police.</span> <span id="s846">And they looked round whether they saw any officer.</span> <span id="s847">And when they didn't see any officer, they showed our brothers the way to Holland.</span> <span id="s848">German border guard.</span> <span id="s849">And told him to where should they go in Holland to find a taxi to go to to meet me.</span> <span id="s850">You can say...I mean God led the way all...all the time.</span> <span id="s851">(Laughing) Q; What about you.</span> <span id="s852">Where were you at this point?</span> <span id="s853">A: I was in Nijmegen.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s855">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Where were you at this point?</span> <span id="s858">While you were waiting for your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: In Nijmegen, in Holland.</span> <span id="s860">And then we came to...to Rotterdam and there we were taken in by a family...a Dutch family that they have about four sons.</span> <span id="s861">And I visited them after the war, and one of the sons was shot on the spot by the police because they tried to help Jews not to come into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s862">And they...and they...the police searched all the youths who tried to help the Jews for weapons.</span> <span id="s863">And those who had no weapons they let go.</span> <span id="s864">But those who had the revolver or a knife, they shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s865">And he had a revolver in his pocket.</span> <span id="s866">Was shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s867">So I mean we had to...we had always contact with the Jews on the whole way.</span> <span id="s868">We tried to help and we tried, but...uh...it was...I mean many Jews didn't believe that Hitler would act this way.</span> <span id="s869">They trusted Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: What about you now?</span> <span id="s871">You are in Holland.</span> <span id="s872">What did you try to do next?</span> <span id="s873">A: I mean we tried to help to find a way which God has given.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: And I..</span> <span id="s876">.</span> <span id="s877">I think I am contact with the...you know, we are... we are in contact with the Jews since Monty Bouver.</span> <span id="s878">We knew Monty Bouver personally.</span> <span id="s879">I knew him personally.</span> <span id="s880">And he gave us into German as a gift.</span> <span id="s881">and in his translation, he says the 10 commandments of the St. Sinai are not lost but in case not...you should not kill, you will not kill, then you love God.</span> <span id="s882">That's...that's the 10 commandments.</span> <span id="s883">You will not do that if you love God.</span> <span id="s884">And so we can only say how we can only challenge all people to the will of God and then there is peace and justice.</span> <span id="s885">But how can we challenge people if we don't do it ourselves?</span> <span id="s886">Therefore, we have to do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s887">Therefore, we try to live and therefore we try to seek with everybody, with Jews with non-Jews, with everybody, we try to find the way of truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: How did you try to help Jews?</span> <span id="s889">You said you had tried to help them?</span> <span id="s890">What kinds of things did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: You know, there were Jews coming to us to find refuge.</span> <span id="s892">And we told them we'd take them in, but we have to warn you in case we are hanged, you will be hanged with us.</span> <span id="s893">You are caught with us together.</span> <span id="s894">If you have courage, you can stay.</span> <span id="s895">If you don't have the courage, go.</span> <span id="s896">We have to say the same to the...the...we can't invite people to come and share with us if they're not prepared to give their life for that.</span> <span id="s897">Understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Did people stay?</span> <span id="s899">Did Jews stay with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: And there are people who stay and people who go.</span> <span id="s901">Q: How did you hide the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: How did you hide the Jews among you?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Oh, we didn't hide them.</span> <span id="s905">We just...either we sent...uh... the one Jew we sent to Lichenstein or to England.</span> <span id="s906">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s907">And the family...his parents who never joined but we had them in the community gave them...gave them a house to live in...in England, and they later came to the States.</span> <span id="s908">They have, by the way, a son...uh...what was his name?</span> <span id="s909">Hans...uh... .</span> <span id="s910">He was...he was a famous ...uh...man in the theatre in</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s912">What...uh...how long did you stay in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Oh, I didn't stay in Holland long time, only just l day.</span> <span id="s914">But my family was thrown out German when I was in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s916">Where was your family sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: My family had to leave the second day after while I was in prison.</span> <span id="s918">Q: Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: They went first to Holland on the way to England.</span> <span id="s920">But they couldn't go straight to England, because England asked for a guarantee of security and we...until we had that, they had to stay in Holland, but they were looked after by Mennonites in Holland.</span> <span id="s921">How long were they in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: How long were they in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: They were there for about 2 months in Holland.</span> <span id="s924">Q: And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: And then the proceeded to England, to the community in England.</span> <span id="s926">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: And my son, Klaus, they found the first time in Holland radio because we had no radio.</span> <span id="s928">And there was a radio box...</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: I'm going to...excuse me.</span> <span id="s930">I'm going to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s931">And I need to bring you back to you.</span> <span id="s932">I need your story.</span> <span id="s933">Not Klaus's.</span> <span id="s934">Okay.</span> <span id="s935">Uh...You came to Holland.</span> <span id="s936">You were there very briefly.</span> <span id="s937">Then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Then we went to England to join the community there.</span> <span id="s939">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: And then I was sent back to...to...from there I was working again in the garden and then no...especially in England, we have no electric power.</span> <span id="s941">I installed as an electrical engineer electric power in England in the whole community...uh...our own power, generator and power, DC.</span> <span id="s942">And...uh...so I did do that there.</span> <span id="s943">And then I also went to Lichenstein where we had to dissolve.</span> <span id="s944">We had to give up Lichenstein and bring all the people over to England, 1938 when Hitler occupied Austria.</span> <span id="s945">So I had to bring them over.</span> <span id="s946">And I..</span> <span id="s947">.</span> <span id="s948">I had to pay all of that in...in Lichenstein with a..</span> <span id="s949">.</span> <span id="s950">uh...with...uh...my inheritance which I got in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s951">.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s953">So you brought the Lichenstein Brethren over to England.</span> <span id="s954">A: Over to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: If the year is 1938... A: 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s957">How did you live?</span> <span id="s958">What happened to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: And then I was working under for the power station for the Bruderhof for the community and then 1930...39, the war was declared.</span> <span id="s960">And then happened this...I heard Klaus say it this morning, they threatened to burn down the Bruderhof immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Who threatened to burn down?</span> <span id="s962">A: The population.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: In England?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: In England.</span> <span id="s965">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: You tell what you remember, because Klaus was really telling it secondhand.</span> <span id="s967">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Tell me what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: A Quaker came to us on the way to Paris, where he was going to visit the...the , the King from .</span> <span id="s970">And he spent...uh...took a cup of tea and coffee in I think , village nearest to us.</span> <span id="s971">And there he heard that the people were going the same down to burn down the Bruderhof.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Because we were Germans.</span> <span id="s974">Half of them Germans and half of them were the objectors of military service, defense of England.</span> <span id="s975">And there were Germans and we always lived together in peace.</span> <span id="s976">That was really suspicious to the English.</span> <span id="s977">And I experienced for instance before the war that the declaration, when I went to the village I was invited everywhere for a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s978">From that moment on, the doors were closed because the people were fearful to give us hospitality.</span> <span id="s979">From that moment on!</span> <span id="s980">And we were accused of all I think every things.</span> <span id="s981">For instance, we were accused of...uh....disturbing the blackout and giving signals to the German bombers because you know we had the other blackout and sometime a child, pull...pulled...put away the curtain and then a light came out and then we were accused that we gave signals to the German bombers to how...how to fly.</span> <span id="s982">And secondly, an English girl married a German brother.</span> <span id="s983">In this time, and we were all classified since...since the war as...uh....neutral aliens and, of course, the English were...were not classified.</span> <span id="s984">And the moment he's married...the German, he was classified as an enemy alien and was put into internment camp right there.</span> <span id="s985">.</span> <span id="s986">Exactly the same.</span> <span id="s987">It was a real psychosis in the whole population against everything which was not pure English.</span> <span id="s988">(Laughing) And then the home guard came and said put six brothers on the wall and put the guns against them as if they were shooting them.</span> <span id="s989">And we protested all the things, but then the government they didn't tell us, but it was so that we...the government had to put all the Germans into internment camps to save them, save their lives.</span> <span id="s990">The government was much more liberal than the people.</span> <span id="s991">And...uh...and this case, they...we had the fear that all the Germans were put into internment camp and we suggested to the government, "Can't we immigrate?</span> <span id="s992">It's before we are...before we are separated?"</span> <span id="s993">And the government said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s994">You can take everything with you during the war time.</span> <span id="s995">Money and everything if you need.”</span> <span id="s996">And then we were looking for where could we go?</span> <span id="s997">And there we came to...I was sent with a Jewish boy who we...oh yes.</span> <span id="s998">In the time, we had Jewish people (coughing)...you know, and...and that quick...tried to help us.</span> <span id="s999">And he opened an office to help Jews in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1000">And they asked us to help him.</span> <span id="s1001">And we took in about a dozen Jewish families who came from Vienna, Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1002">And they were living with us until they found a place where to go.</span> <span id="s1003">And they sent also about 10 to 12 young...young children to us whose parents had been put into concentration camp, and so we had...uh...this group of children with us.</span> <span id="s1004">And then one of those children remained and came with us to Paraguay and she is now mother of a family.</span> <span id="s1005">She married not a Jew, but...uh...but we have no...no difficult with marrying Jews and that's because we don't see a difference there.</span> <span id="s1006">And...uh...and then another boy, his parents suddenly turned up.</span> <span id="s1007">They could escape from the Gestapo and went by Rome, France to Venezuela and they suddenly wrote to us and said look here.</span> <span id="s1008">They would like to have their boy.</span> <span id="s1009">How do you send a 6 year old boy in the wartime from England to Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1010">And so we offered that we would accompany him in the hope that to accompany him that we have so much time in North America to prepare the immigration for us here.</span> <span id="s1011">And I got all the papers from the Jewish committee in London for Al Fisher was his name...all the papers to accompany him.</span> <span id="s1012">And when we arrived in New York, the man...the immigration officer said, "Are you a Jew?"</span> <span id="s1013">I said, "No, I am not a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1014">"How does it come that you accompany a Jewish boy?"</span> <span id="s1015">Something suspicious there.</span> <span id="s1016">And so he...he put us into a room on the ship, let us not the ship until the Jewish community New York integrate...investigated the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1017">And the man came from the Jewish committee in New York, on the ship and looked all my papers through and he found everything in order.</span> <span id="s1018">He said, "I can't accuse you of anything, but we take the boy from you and bring him ourselves to Venezuela.”</span> <span id="s1019">And they put him on Ellis Island and we visited him where was supplied very well and nicely.</span> <span id="s1020">A 6 year old, 7 year old boy.</span> <span id="s1021">And then he was accompanied by a Jewish nurse to Venezuela to where we got the news from his parents that he arrives safe.</span> <span id="s1022">And we were 3 months free in North America to help try to put our immigrations.</span> <span id="s1023">And there I think you know that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Tell us...tell us briefly what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: And then...then the thing was this.</span> <span id="s1026">I was...we were two...two there, we were accompanied by Fisher.</span> <span id="s1027">And they were taken from us in .</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s1029">I'm confused.</span> <span id="s1030">You was taken from you where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: From us?</span> <span id="s1032">From our...our guardianship and the Jewish Committee from New York let him accompany to Venezuela by a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1034">No.</span> <span id="s1035">Let me...let me rephrase the question.</span> <span id="s1036">You had now left the boy.</span> <span id="s1037">He is on Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: The 3 months you lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1040">A: No.</span> <span id="s1041">We lived here in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: In Washington.</span> <span id="s1043">You came to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: We...we try to foster our immigration this time.</span> <span id="s1045">And we came to...we first came...we had only enough money to go to Lancaster where we knew the MCC, the Mennonites Central Committee.</span> <span id="s1046">And that's again a story behind it.</span> <span id="s1047">You know 1936...</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1049">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1050">We don't have time for the stories behind it unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: At any case...at any case, through him we got the contact with the Quakers in Philadelphia and they brought us into contact with the State Department here in Washington.</span> <span id="s1052">And with their international student home, I think, New Hampshire Avenue where they offered us to stay for $l dollar a night, a breakfast.</span> <span id="s1053">(Laughing) You know, from the Quakers.</span> <span id="s1054">And then we tried first to get immigrations through our from , the Assistant Attorney General of Roosevelt ...uh...because he was a relative of the Arnolds.</span> <span id="s1055">He was .</span> <span id="s1056">Perhaps you have heard his name.</span> <span id="s1057">He was a lawyer here in Washington, and he was a Attorney General...</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Assistant Attorney General in Roosevelt's...uh...government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1060">So you went to various people to get help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Then we...he said, "I have nothing to do with you because my Department of Justice is a Department of conformity and you are nonconformists.</span> <span id="s1062">I have nothing to do," and put the telephone down.</span> <span id="s1063">And after 2 months or a month and a half, he phoned us up and they interrupted the student home and said, "Come quickly to me.”</span> <span id="s1064">And we visited him in the Justice Department...to pay for the taxi 25 cents at that time, 1940.</span> <span id="s1065">And then we went to his room by the FBI accompanied, and he got up and said, "I'm glad that you didn't come barefoot (laughing) cause my FBI told me you are non-conservatists.”</span> <span id="s1066">And we had a good talk with him and he said, "Are you Amish...Amish Mennonites.”</span> <span id="s1067">I said, "No, we are not Amish, but...uh...we have certain roots together in the...in the 16th Century and then I told him about our attitude in Germany.</span> <span id="s1068">He said, "I'm proud of my relatives here.</span> <span id="s1069">I will try that they get immigration in the United States as soon as possible.”</span> <span id="s1070">And he took one phone after the other and said, "I am personally interested in the...in the immigration of these people.”</span> <span id="s1071">But nothing came.</span> <span id="s1072">And then we came to Pendle HIll.</span> <span id="s1073">Do you know Pendle Hill.</span> <span id="s1074">Uh...The Quaker Center.</span> <span id="s1075">And he...this Clarence Speaker told us that he had been suggested by Roosevelt who was his friend to go as Ambassador to Berlin because Hitler would only listen to a Quaker and to nobody else.</span> <span id="s1076">And he's ready to...he doesn't feel to be a diplomat, but he's ready to if he can serve peace, he serves peace, but he never was called to do that.</span> <span id="s1077">At any case, he arranged a meeting with Eleanor Roosevelt and I had with her breakfast in New York, in her hideout on the 42th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Tell us about that breakfast</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: It was very nice.</span> <span id="s1080">She was there...uh...with me, was Sky Johnson, a English man and...uh...she was there with her secretary, Thompson.</span> <span id="s1081">And...uh...he was very nice, very informal, and she said at the end after we told our story, "I'm very much in favor of your immigration because here in North America, we have not proper democracy.</span> <span id="s1082">We look down on the black people and we need people like you who represent a different attitude.</span> <span id="s1083">And so I am for it very much," and she...in my day, on that day she recommended our immigration publicly.</span> <span id="s1084">And then in the...when they took leave, I said, "Greet your husband and my colleague nearly fell down the stairs and said, "My God, you don't say your husband.</span> <span id="s1085">You say Mr. President.”</span> <span id="s1086">(Laughing) But she took it very, very, very good.</span> <span id="s1087">Very good.</span> <span id="s1088">But she said at the end, "Look here.</span> <span id="s1089">I'm not the President myself.</span> <span id="s1090">I have not the power to declare it, your immigration.”</span> <span id="s1091">And then we were told by confidence...confidential that they would have postponed our immigration until next year because that was the year of the third...third re-election campaign of Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1092">1940!</span> <span id="s1093">And they did...couldn't let in 300 pacifists at that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">This would disturb the re-election campaign of the democrats and therefore they would have to postpone it.</span> <span id="s1095">The thing was the following.</span> <span id="s1096">Our brothers in South Dakota gave an affidavit of support which was not accepted because that they said it's a collective of and association can form tonight and decide affidavit and dissolve the next morning so there it's not possible.</span> <span id="s1097">On that the...the Senator for South Dakota, Muntz, he said, "I'll bring in a private...who knows, I know the brothers.</span> <span id="s1098">I know that they keep it, and I bring in a private bill to recognize that affidavit.”</span> <span id="s1099">But then it was said that we can only bring the Bill after a certain...after re-election of Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1100">And so...and now in England, they couldn't postpone until next year, so we had to leave.</span> <span id="s1101">And here the Mennonites come in again.</span> <span id="s1102">They offered us immediately to go to Paraguay because and we visited Paraguay Ambassador in Washington, and he said, "If you wish to go to Paraguay, I have tomorrow the permission to go.</span> <span id="s1103">I ring up my father-in-law, who's President of Paraguay, said the Ambassador here, and you have the permission to go to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1104">And so we got the permission for Paraguay immediately.</span> <span id="s1105">And for this we needed trans...transits permission by Argentina because Paraguay is land locked.</span> <span id="s1106">It's in the middle of South America and doesn't...have no harbor.</span> <span id="s1107">So we have to go through Argentina or Brazil to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1108">And Brazil, Argentina asked for $7,000 deposit as guarantee that nobody stays in Argentina.</span> <span id="s1109">And they asked here in Washington...the Quaker, whether he could give us the money, and he said, "I give you money immediately if I have the safety that the money is paid back.</span> <span id="s1110">And I go to ask him...ask the Ambassador...we went together with the Ambassador here in Washington, and the Ambassador was angry that somebody doubted that he...that his money...that he would pay back the $7,000.</span> <span id="s1111">And so he...he said, "I'm not sure," and he didn't wish to give the $7,000, so we had to look somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: So where did you get the money from finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: We got...I don't know, because I had to go immediately to South America to prepare the first group and the , I think he got it from the brothers in South America, South Dakota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: So you then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: And we got the money back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1117">You now went to Paraguay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Then I went to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1119">But for this I went first on the Good Friendship...uh...of thirty three thousand tons which was between New York and Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span id="s1120">And I learned on the way Spanish because that Spanish was official language in Paraguay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">(Clearing throat) I had to find out how to get to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1122">And I went to the Pan American Union here to inquire and we found the Paraguay agent...we found the timetables and all the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s1124">I need to cut this short a little for the tape, because I think we could go on for a long time.</span> <span id="s1125">You've been through a lot.</span> <span id="s1126">How long did you live...how many years did you...did you live in Paraguay finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Well, we lived for 20 years in Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1128">You had...you built up a whole community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1130">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1131">Three communities in Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1132">One in Ascunion, and one in Uruguay.</span> <span id="s1133">And then there came an inner weakening.</span> <span id="s1134">You, as Klaus declared.</span> <span id="s1135">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1136">Uh...We compare the community with a lantern.</span> <span id="s1137">And the lantern has a shell and a light.</span> <span id="s1138">Yeah?</span> <span id="s1139">If the light is not burning, what is the shell lantern?</span> <span id="s1140">The lantern has only value with the light.</span> <span id="s1141">Yeah?</span> <span id="s1142">And we had a shell, but no more the light.</span> <span id="s1143">That means the shalom, no more the unity.</span> <span id="s1144">Unbrokenness.</span> <span id="s1145">Shalom means unbrokenness.</span> <span id="s1146">And we didn't have anything more of that.</span> <span id="s1147">Therefore, the whole community went to pot, like the kibbutz today.</span> <span id="s1148">Like the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1149">It's the same question of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1150">And the question is the following.</span> <span id="s1151">I put that thing to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1152">I said...I wrote to them...we don't wish to tell them what they should do because they ask us, "Why are you able to live in community?</span> <span id="s1153">What is the secret behind it?"</span> <span id="s1154">Because we need it because the community with us falls fast.</span> <span id="s1155">And so I answered them, "Look here.</span> <span id="s1156">We don't...we can't tell you what you should do.</span> <span id="s1157">We can only tell you what we experienced, and you may learn from that.</span> <span id="s1158">And the question is that when the Christians tried to christianize the states, it was not so that they were able to Christianize the state, but the state corrupted them.</span> <span id="s1159">And you have to be careful that it doesn't happen with you the same way.”</span> <span id="s1160">And then...then...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: When did you...when did you come to this country finally.</span> <span id="s1162">With all of this happening, when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1164">.</span> <span id="s1165">you know the thing was this.</span> <span id="s1166">When this whole spiritual battles started, I needed to...to take a distance.</span> <span id="s1167">And I was for 12 years in Buenos Aires, independent, to think about it.</span> <span id="s1168">And then I went right back to the community in North America....uh...experiencing the following.</span> <span id="s1169">You come together when each one of you takes the beam out of his own eye first before he tries to take the splinter out of the next.</span> <span id="s1170">That's a fact.</span> <span id="s1171">And this I..</span> <span id="s1172">.</span> <span id="s1173">this is simply what I experienced.</span> <span id="s1174">I can only say for here...uh...I found that the Bible is right.</span> <span id="s1175">I do not say because the Bible says that, you should do that because the Bible says that, but I found out that the Bible is right.</span> <span id="s1176">That's the whole point.</span> <span id="s1177">That's just a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1179">Okay.</span> <span id="s1180">And on that note, I think we end.</span> <span id="s1181">I cannot think of a better place to end the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yeah.</span></p></body></html>
