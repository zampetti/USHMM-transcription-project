fire, as she said, the fire was burning from the people who had just came on transport and they made us dance and they took the people with their instruments, they played and we had to dance and I ask

id="s54">CE: Anything about the camp, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And did -- it seemed in the transcripts that you knew and in general, Polish Jews knew a lot more than Selma, or than Dutch Jews about what was happening at first.</span> <span id="s56">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">CE: Well, well, we -- before even I came to Sobibór and we saw people go -- my father, a matter of fact, came six months before me to Sobibór and he went to a camp, so the rumors were that people go to the -- to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s58">But this was so incomprehensible that nobody won’t believe it.</span> <span id="s59">But [indecipherable] when we came to the camp -- a matter of fact I came with my brother and they pick me out to work and when he went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s60">So then we knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s61">So that was not any more a rumors, there was facts, what happened.</span> <span id="s62">Separate --</span></p>

separating the clothes from the people from the transport and I found the clothes from my brother and pictures.</span> <span id="s66">So, that was my experience coming first to Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: You came with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">CE: With him together.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Came together?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">CE: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

didn’t know what it means, picking out, but it meant to be working in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Instead of?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">CE: Going to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span

-- where I come from and I told him from where and he says, “Come out.”</span> <span id="s81">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s82">No reason at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">CE: Just luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And, for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">SE: I came with a -- a whole bunch of girls what we met in -- in jail in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s87">I was in -- in -- in Amsterdam in jail because -- in jail because I was hidden and that was a punishment.</span> <span id="s88">And so we met a whole bunch of Dutch young girls.</span> <span id="s89">The youngest was 16 and I was the oldest, I was 20.</span> <span id="s90">So and -- and then we stayed together, we went to a concentration camp in Holland first and then we went to Westerbork, where all the Jews went through, then we went -- sent to Poland and we went in a freight train, it was the first freight train what went away from Westerbork.</span> <span id="s91">And there wen-went three days and three nights in the train and when we came on, all the Germans were standing there and because we were all young girls, they took us on the side, where all -- the first transport where they took Dutch girls out.</span> <span id="s92">And they say, “You stuus, go stay on the side.”</span> <span id="s93">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: The side of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">SE: No, we were already past the train.</span> <span id="s96">They were already off from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s97">We passed already that we were standing there and then could we see that the women and the children went straight to the gas chamber and the men had to sit on the side and they had to take their shoes off and they have to bundle the shoes together because everything was sent to Germany, so the shoes had to be together and not when they’re loosed and get it lost.</span> <span id="s98">So -- and that we show, also that some German gave them a card and they had to write home that they came now in Sobibór and -- and that they are safe here.</span> <span id="s99">And then we was --were -- that we walked to camp one.</span> <span id="s100">Sobibór was divided in three camps.</span> <span id="s101">Camp one was where we slept, camp three is where we worked and camp two was where we worked and camp three was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s102">So then we walked to -- brought us to camp one.</span> <span id="s103">And so far we don’t know what was happened of that moment.</span> <span id="s104">I had to go to work -- b -- also by the clothes.</span> <span id="s105">Assorting clothes that afternoon, from the people what went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s106">Also an uncle, a brother from my mother, came -- had thre -- three children -- three or four children, I don’t know exactly, to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s107">When they want to take me out, when they came at the same transport as I came to Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">SE: And he went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s110">But I hear -- it was after the war that I saw all the papers and

made you -- why did they choose you to stay.</span> <span id="s117">Do you think that they choo -- chose you because you were young, pretty and --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">SE: We were young and we were with whole bunch of Dutch girls -- 19, I think.</span> <span id="s119">And they all took us because we were young girls that could work there.</span> <span id="s120">And that was -- that was the only reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So the women and children, they tended to?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">SE: Oh, they went all to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s123">Women and children and -- and e-everybody else.</span> <span id="s124">Everybody else -- it was a transport for 2,000 people, they all went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s125">Straight to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: But you did not know this at first -- when you were first --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">SE: Oh, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s128">You know, my mother

Sobibór?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SE: I was hidden in 1942, in half year?</span> <span id="s136">Something like that, a half year.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And you had never been separated from her?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">SE: No, no.</span> <span id="s139">I was the youngest on the children, I was always together with my -- my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And so, you might have been feeling a certain way, that you would see your mother in Sobibór?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">SE: Yeah.</span> <span id="s142">No.</span> <span id="s143">Perhaps, I didn’t even think.</span> <span id="s144">You va -- you have no time to think when you came in Sobibór -- starting screaming and hitting with the whip and -- and you have no time to think, really.</span> <span id="s145">You didn’t have time to think about what -- what will happen.</span> <span id="s146">You had no idea, absolutely no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Hitting you with a whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">SE: Not me, no.</span> <span id="s149">But it was one woman -- they scream and say “Out, out, out .”</span> <span id="s150">And -- I don’t remember exactly, we fell over each other.</span> <span id="s151">I mean, there was one woman which throwed away her -- her backpack and also her baby fell and does she say, “Oh, my baby.”</span> <span id="s152">And then the German hit him with a whip in the face, the blood was streaming.</span> <span id="s153">He said, “I will take care of your baby.”</span> <span id="s154">So -- and there was -- there was a n
