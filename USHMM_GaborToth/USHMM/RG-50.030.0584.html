community was Lazy, l-a-z-y.</span> <span id="s31">And at the age of five, we moved to another small coal mining community, and – by the name Poruba, p-o-r-u-b-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And what country was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Was this north of Prague, south of Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: It was closer to the

and German, so I was exposed to the German language also.</span> <span id="s44">Although people in the community, the coal miners, spoke their own language, which was a mixture of Czech and some Polish and my father really didn’t want us to speak it.</span> <span id="s45">My mother spoke because my parents had the general store, and the customers spoke – spoke this language.</span> <span id="s46">So my mother could easily speak with them, but my father refused, and we had to speak pure Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Well, it sounds like it was like a local patois, a local lingo.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Dialect, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Right.</span> <span id="s51">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I had a brother, two year – two years old – young – younger brother, Erik, e-r-i-k.</span> <span id="s54">As I said before, my parents had the general store.</span> <span id="s55">By the standard of the community, we were very well-to-do, but we were really not wealthy.</span> <span id="s56">We just – we lived on the main street, the street didn’t have a name, it – it was just a main street.</span> <span id="s57">On one side of our home was a baker, on the other side was a butcher.</span> <span id="s58">And we didn’t have very much to do with the butcher, but the butcher’s daughter was my closest friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Were they Jewish, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No.</span> <span id="s61">I had no Jewish fr-friends at all at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Was there a Jewish community in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: There was a Jewish community, not in Poruba where we lived, but in a little bit larger community called Orlova, o-r-l-o-v-a, Orlova.</span> <span id="s64">And there was a beautiful synagogue and there was a large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s65">In my immediate community, only my grandfather, with his two daughter, who were n – daughters who were not married yet, they also had two general stores.</span> <span id="s66">Icar(ph), the neighbor’s – the baker’s daughter was my closest friend, and we are still friends.</span> <span id="s67">Actually I spoke to her a few – few days ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: That’s nice.</span> <span id="s69">That’s very nice that something can last so many decades.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: So many decades, and so many different times when we didn’t know about each other.</span> <span id="s71">Where she didn’t – where sh – where she was afraid to have anything to do with me, under communists, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s73">So tell me a little bit, how is it that your parents – your family came to be in this small coal mining town?</span> <span id="s74">How many – were they new to it, wer – had they been there for generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, no, they lived there for a long time, my grandparents lived there for a long time.</span> <span id="s76">And as I said, nearby was a larger Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What – what do you know of your family history that your parents and grandparents might have told you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: My – I was very close to my mother’s father, to my grandfather, because he lived in the same community.</span> <span id="s79">And my mother was the oldest of six girls, and one son.</span> <span id="s80">I was always told that my mother was the most intelligent of the six, although each one was very talented, each one had the special talent; music, painting, piano.</span> <span id="s81">Each one was very talented.</span> <span id="s82">But my mother liked books, and my father was from Moravia and he was very proud that he was born near the place where the beloved President Masaryk was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Ah yes, ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What was that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: The name when he was born was called

id="s115">A: I was told only few years ago, when I went to visit my cousin in Jerusalem, who adored my parents, she told me that they met through a traveling salesman.</span> <span id="s116">And then they fell in – I was told they fell in love with each other’s handwriting.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: That’s very romantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: And my father – both my parents were in the – wonderful people.</span> <span id="s119">I have never seen anybody come of our home empty handed.</span> <span id="s120">Gypsies, who people resented and were afraid of, my parents always loaded with clothes and food and – and my mother all the – always taught me, give, and it will be given to you.</span> <span id="s121">Wish, and it will be wished out to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Has it – has it fulfilled itself, this thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: In most ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s126">But, as you know, with the fate they faced, life was not really as great and people were not as great, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s128">We’ll come to that moment.</span> <span id="s129">What are your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: So, my earliest memories o-of my parents are Mother sitting at the end of the day on the stove in the kitchen, after we went to bed, and when I went back to the kitchen, always she was sitting on the stove reading books.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did she work in the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes, both my parents work in the store, and we had a housekeeper, live-in housekeeper always.</span> <span id="s133">And the people in the community were wonderful people, honest people.</span> <span id="s134">And only when I came back after the war, I realized how much they loved and admired my parents.</span> <span id="s135">Only when I came back I really appreciated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: How – that’s – how did that show itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I will talk – tell you at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: – end when we came back what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s141">And what are your – that – so your earliest memory of your mother is sitting that – is that she’s sitting on the stove reading a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Right, always reading.</span> <span id="s143">And my father was more outdoorsy.</span> <span id="s144">Both of my parents were very people oriented.</span> <span id="s145">Both loved people and people loved them, both of them.</span> <span id="s146">But my mother was quieter.</span> <span id="s147">As I said, intelligent, thoughtful.</span> <span id="s148">My father was more outdoorsy.</span> <span id="s149">He loved gardening and this I inherited from him.</span> <span id="s150">Also, my memories are of my mother singing a lot, and she sang a lot of Germans songs, operettas and – and I still remember them so well.</span> <span id="s151">Although, she sang nicely and I cannot carry the tune.</span> <span id="s152">And m – as – my best friend was Icar(ph) and we read the same books and we played with our dolls, and they had the double seat swing in the garden, two seats facing each other.</span> <span id="s153">And when we later moved into our home, I bought a swing like this, just because of the memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So, what year were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I was born in 1928, December twent – 1928.</span> <span id="s156">And my brother Erik was born two years and two months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: So the years that you grew up were the 1930s, and you – and you grew up then, I would say in a – in a small town, small place, near – near the Polish border.</span> <span id="s158">And did political events make themselves felt at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Only in 1938</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I never – I have to tell you that I never, ever heard the word anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: That was going to be one of my questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Never, never.</span> <span id="s164">I was the only Jew in sport, I was the only Jew in school.</span> <span id="s165">I never, never felt anti-Semitism, until I came to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What happened then, in the late – in 1938?</span> <span id="s167">Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Let me just tell you that my fondest memories are, on Sundays my – my mother’s sis-sister, the second oldest sister, which her mother was the closest, they had two children, and one was six months younger than my brother Erik.</span> <span id="s169">And on Sundays my father used to take the older son, Walter, and Erik, and me for a walk, and we walked to the ponds.</span> <span id="s170">And my father made whistles for us.</span> <span id="s171">In the meantime my mother cooked a very delicious lunch.</span> <span id="s172">And from the ponds, either we went to the – to Orlova, to the nearest community – there was a wonderful pastry shop, so my father bought pastries that we all like, especially my mother.</span> <span id="s173">Or we went to am – to a nursery.</span> <span id="s174">When they got – it was Mr. S-Slama(ph).</span> <span id="s175">Slama(ph) means straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: And I guess my love for nurseries is since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Why are you –</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: So – and then in the afternoon, we used to go to my grandpa, who had a – most of my mother’s sisters and families came, and my grandpa pan – played cards with his sons-in-law, and we had our cousins and the neighborhood children, and my fa – my grandpa had the very nice garden, and many more flowers than we had.</span> <span id="s180">And my father took care of my grandpa’s garden.</span> <span id="s181">And behind the garden was a brook.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Sounds ideal.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: And geese, and a little bridge to a meadow, and I loved to go to the meadows and pick Lilies of the Valleys, and – and forget-me-nots.</span> <span id="s184">And it was very – a very pastoral setting behind my grandpa.</span> <span id="s185">So m – then, in 1938, the – the Germans took Sudetenland –</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: – and the Polish army marched into our part of Silesia.</span> <span id="s188">And as Jews we had to vacate.</span> <span id="s189">I think they gave us a month to vacate.</span> <span id="s190">Now, to go in – deeper into Czechoslovakia, there was no reason to go because Germans already occupied part of it.</span> <span id="s191">So, we opted to go to Poland where my grandfather had a brother, a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s192">And we – we went to a smaller community near Kraków, Poland, and there we wanted to wait for the rest of the family because we – we knew that they all will have to eventually come.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What was the name of this community, this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I-In?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Near Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Prokocim, p-r-o-k-o-c-i-m, Proko –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: So when you had to vacate, did that mean you had to leave your store?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: We had to leave the store, the home, everything.</span> <span id="s199">So I do not know, because I was not so interested in the arrangements, I was 10 years old in ’38, Erik was only eight when my parents made some kind of arrangement to give the house and the store.</span> <span id="s200">I don’t know if they rented it, or what the arrangement was, to some acquaintances of the baker’s family.</span> <span id="s201">My – my best friend’s family, with the understanding that if we come back, it will revert to us.</span> <span id="s202">So we left practically everything.</span> <span id="s203">When we came to Poland, my – my father couldn’t speak Polish, none of us could.</span> <span id="s204">But we kids learned quite fast, my father never could learn Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did you see Polish soldiers in Poruba before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you have any contact –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: – with anybody Polish at all when – when you still –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: When they occupied?</span> <span id="s211">No, it went very, very quickly.</span> <span id="s212">The army occupied and – very quickly.</span> <span id="s213">And my grandfather was gravely ill in this time.</span> <span id="s214">So I remember that they extended our stay, because Grandpa was dying, so we left after he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: In the beginning, in Poland – well, my – my mother’s sister, I mentioned her, with the two children, they arrived.</span> <span id="s217">And my mother’s younger sister, whom I always adored, she married just – just shortly before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s218">And she married somebody, an engineer from Ostrava, the [indecipherable] city.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: And so we waited for them, and we lived together in a building I think we rented, an apartment.</span> <span id="s221">And for a few months, we were able to go to school, Erik and I, for a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s223">A: Of course, the language was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: So, it was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What – what are your memories from that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Not much, because it was very short.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did you remember saying goodbye to your best friend before leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yeah, of course, you know, it was very sad to leave everything we loved.</span> <span id="s232">And then, in September ’39, Poland was occupied, and people were afraid of the – of the German army, and many people ran.</span> <span id="s233">Whatever – packed whatever they could carry with them, and ran away from the – away from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Do you mean Jews and Poles as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, but mostly Jews were frightened.</span> <span id="s236">So, we packed our belongings and my mother’s youngest sister, with her young husband, and my family went on a run.</span> <span id="s237">We call it in Polish nowa(ph) chechken(ph), now on – on the run.</span> <span id="s238">In the meantime, my mother’s other sister, the one with the two children, went back to Slovakia, because Slovakia was still at peace at this time, and he, her husband was Slovak, so they went to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s239">And we went on the run with my mother’s cousin also.</span> <span id="s240">And it was a terrible time, because the planes were coming, and we were so tired, carrying our belongings.</span> <span id="s241">When the planes came we just hopped into some ditches, and I guess my parents had some money to buy food.</span> <span id="s242">But it was very hard for them to see us kids to walk and walk and walk and not having a place to rest or wash up.</span> <span id="s243">So eventually my father decided to talk to a Polish – a farmer, and ask him to sell us two horses and a buggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: And did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: And he did, because he thought, better to get some money now, than if the Germans will come and cos – confiscate this, I’ll get nothing.</span> <span id="s246">So he sold us two horses.</span> <span id="s247">The horses became members of our family.</span> <span id="s248">We just – we loved the horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: How did you know that?</span> <span id="s250">Did your father say that he was – that this is what the farmer told him?</span> <span id="s251">Or, you just supposed that this is – he was –</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I don’t know, but I – my – my father ma – might have mentioned something.</span> <span id="s255">So after we bought the horses, it was much, much easier.</span> <span id="s256">We could rest, we could –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: – just very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Do you know what direction you were going in?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Toward the Russian front.</span> <span id="s261">And I remember that one time we were – we had to cross a river, and the horses got stuck in the river, and we had to unpack some of the load, and we had to get up – out and push –</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: The buggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: – the buggy.</span> <span id="s264">But we managed.</span> <span id="s265">And then, after – and I don’t know how – how long we were out around.</span> <span id="s266">I don’t know exactly how long [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s267">But again, my father convince another farmer to take us to work for him.</span> <span id="s268">Then my father and my uncle were work with the horses on the field.</span> <span id="s269">My mother and my aunt were whatever needs to be done around the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: For someone who doesn’t speak Polish, he was very, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: He was – he was good, he could communicate.</span> <span id="s272">And ma – my mother could a little bit better with her – what she was talking to the peasants – to the coal miners.</span> <span id="s273">And so the farmer took us, and Erik and I took care of the cows, and I learned very well how to milk cows.</span> <span id="s274">And again, I don’t know exactly how long we were there.</span> <span id="s275">And then the Germans occupied Poland, and we decided, you know, let’s go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Wa – wa – during this time you were with the Polish farmer, did you have any interaction with them?</span> <span id="s277">Do you have any memories of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I just – of the cows, of the fields –</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Just of the cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: – of the fields.</span> <span id="s281">But I have no idea what the grown-ups were talking of.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I guess we had rooms.</span> <span id="s284">I don’t have exac – exact recollection of this.</span> <span id="s285">I just remember the fields and sitting in and milking the cows.</span> <span id="s286">And then we came home, and my father couldn’t get any job.</span> <span id="s287">My uncle also, he was an engineer, but Jews couldn’t get easily job.</span> <span id="s288">So, the horses, Fuksa(ph) and Malutki(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Fuksa(ph) and Marlutki(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Futka(ph) – Malutki(ph) means a little one.</span> <span id="s291">And Fuksa(ph) was a beautiful horse.</span> <span id="s292">Malutki(ph) was the older hors – horse.</span> <span id="s293">But me – we adored the horses.</span> <span id="s294">And so they were moving furniture and whatever people needed to move, and that’s how they found money.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Money.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And then, suddenly – suddenly laws started appearing.</span> <span id="s297">Restrich – reks – restrictions.</span> <span id="s298">One day signs appeared, Jews cannot go to stores, Jews and dogs not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Can I interrupt just for a second?</span> <span id="s300">You returned home, but you didn’t get your store back?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, not home.</span> <span id="s302">Home to Poland.</span> <span id="s303">When we went to this –</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Home to – oh, I see, not – not –</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: – not to the Czech re –</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Not to the Czech Republic –</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: – no, no, home.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: – you went back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: To via – to Prokocim.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Cro – Prokocim.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Near Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s314">And, so signs started appearing.</span> <span id="s315">Next day, Jews were not allowed to go to places or – en-entertainment, or swimming pools and movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And you saw these signs?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: The signs, yeah, every day we woke up to something new.</span> <span id="s318">Then Jews were not allowed to use public transportation.</span> <span id="s319">And then Jews were not allowed to use – to leave the community they lived in, even when grandparents – like in Baltimore we couldn’t visit the grandparents, because we couldn’t leave Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s320">And then finally Jews had to wear the bands, which I am just making because I am supposed to be speaking in a church next week, and I lost my band with the blue star.</span> <span id="s321">White band with blue star.</span> <span id="s322">Wh-When – and then Jews – Jewish children were not allowed to go to school any more.</span> <span id="s323">And of course, you know, the Jewish professionals were not able to – to – to practice their professions.</span> <span id="s324">But, it was very difficult to see all my friends going to school, all my friends going – being able to go on trains or buses, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And you couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: – and – and we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s327">We went – w – I couldn’t leave my community, I couldn’t go on a bus, I couldn’t go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Did you notice any change in your parents and how their manner was?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Frightened.</span> <span id="s330">I could – I could see the fear in them, I could see – and they started – I heard – I heard them to debate, where can we, how can we escape, where can we go?</span> <span id="s331">And one – one day it was England, next it was Bolivia, next time it was some other country.</span> <span id="s332">Who will accept us?</span> <span id="s333">In the end we were trapped in the worst possible place.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: You had Czech citizenship, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Czech-Slovak citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Did that matter by the – by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Matters that we were Jews, that’s what mattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And why would you say it was the worst possible place?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Because Poland was the worst possible place.</span> <span id="s344">One day I was walking with my brother, and my cousin, who had beautiful blonde hair.</span> <span id="s345">He was eight years old – he was nine – nine, close to 10, my – Erik also, and I was 12.</span> <span id="s346">I was so proud at this time that I could wear the – the white band.</span> <span id="s347">I was – I felt so grown up.</span> <span id="s348">I can wear it, Erik cannot, he was not yet 10 years old.</span> <span id="s349">So one day we went for a walk and a Polish teenager approached us, lit a match, and threw it into my cousin Walter’s beautiful blonde hair.</span> <span id="s350">I felt so responsible, I was the older – I was terrified.</span> <span id="s351">I put out the – the fire from his – and we ran home, and from this day on, I was terrified to wear this white band.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Was this the first time you saw an – you felt anti-Semitism from Poland – from Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: That was – maybe one time before.</span> <span id="s354">I had the Christian friend who took me to church once with her, and I heard some people making some anti-Semitic comments, and that was the first time.</span> <span id="s355">And then the first really shocking experience was when men, age I think 16 to 65, if I recall it correctly, had to assemble on an assembly place somewhere.</span> <span id="s356">My father and my uncle were in there and we all went with him, and we waited there all day.</span> <span id="s357">We brought him some food, and we didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s358">In the evening they were loaded on trucks and taking away.</span> <span id="s359">We had no idea where they went.</span> <span id="s360">I forgot to tell also, that during the time when my father was working with the horses and moving furniture, we had the neighbor, also in Poland, a butcher neighbor.</span> <span id="s361">And he suggested to my father and my uncle, they should go with him out of town to buy illegal meat, so he could sell it.</span> <span id="s362">And my father wanted so desperately for the family to have something to live on, that they agreed to do it.</span> <span id="s363">And they went, first of all, they were supposed to wear the bands, which they didn’t.</span> <span id="s364">They were not allowed to leave the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: And they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: And they did.</span> <span id="s367">Second – and thirdly, they were bringing in illegal meat.</span> <span id="s368">So, there were dangers on so many side.</span> <span id="s369">When they – from the minute they left until they came home, we were – this I remember so vividly, we were so afraid for their lives.</span> <span id="s370">When –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Had you seen anyone – I’m sorry to interrupt you – have you seen anyone at that point, murdered?</span> <span id="s372">Or had you seen any corpses, or had you heard any stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, no, not at this time.</span> <span id="s374">Not at this time.</span> <span id="s375">It was just this terrible fear that if he would be caught, he would be shot.</span> <span id="s376">There’s no question, you know, this fear.</span> <span id="s377">So, they went and when they were suppo – we knew approximately when they will be back, usually it was at night they were coming back.</span> <span id="s378">So we took turns waiting on the street to listen if they are coming, and when we heard the horses from far, it was such a relief.</span> <span id="s379">And they went – when they came home, they were s – frozen, literally.</span> <span id="s380">The people and the – and the horses, everything was frozen, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So you meant – it was wintertime when they had done –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: It was wintertime and when – I remember my – when my mother was taking my father’s socks off, it was all ice, all ice.</span> <span id="s383">It was a terrible time for them.</span> <span id="s384">Anyway, so my father was taken away on trucks, and we didn’t know when they will come back, if they will come back.</span> <span id="s385">Few days later, they did come back, and told us that they are working – I forgot also to s – to mention that when we came back after this running, we were put into ghettos.</span> <span id="s386">So we moved from Prokocim to Wieliczka, which was a well known city in Poland, to a ghetto.</span> <span id="s387">When my father was taken to this – on trucks, and when he came back, he said that they are working on the railroad tracks in Prokocim, where we used to live.</span> <span id="s388">So, they must have gotten permission to come on train, because otherwise they wen – would not have been able to – to come.</span> <span id="s389">So, one day they came home and they said that they heard that Jews from Wieliczka will be deported.</span> <span id="s390">It sounded sad, but we still didn’t know what deported means, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So they were able to come back and forth afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: In – right, in the evening.</span> <span id="s393">And they decided that first they have to save the kids, so first Erik and me.</span> <span id="s394">We couldn't go all together, because a big group would –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Be most –</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: – be too dangerous.</span> <span id="s397">So they decided one night, the kids are going, so we walked the whole night until at dawn we came to my father’s – to the railroad tracks where Father was working, and my father hid us under a boxcar.</span> <span id="s398">He must have been sure that this boxcar will not go anywhere.</span> <span id="s399">We were supposed to stay under the boxcar, not to move, not to talk, not to whisper, until e – the evening, when my father would take us out and take us into hiding.</span> <span id="s400">Well, I can, as a parent, I can imagine what it must have been for my father having us under the boxcar, and my brother was a very big rascal, so – very, very.</span> <span id="s401">And my father came, they took us into hiding to a Polish family.</span> <span id="s402">And the next day they went to get Mother and my Aunt Polly.</span> <span id="s403">My mother decided that she has still some things to put in order and that nothing can happen so fast.</span> <span id="s404">My aunt should go and she promised she will come the next day.</span> <span id="s405">My aunt, of course, didn't want to leave my mother, but in the end my mother convinced her go, I am surely going to come the next day.</span> <span id="s406">The following day was too late.</span> <span id="s407">They already – my – my father and uncle heard from some Germans who were in charge and liked my father and my uncle that Jews from Wieliczka are already being loaded on trains.</span> <span id="s408">My uncle somehow managed to convince the Germans to – to come with him and bring some – some papers that Mother is needed to work in the kitchen on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s409">But they went to the trains, but they could not find her.</span> <span id="s410">Well, when we heard that Mother was taken, we were devastated, absolutely devastated.</span> <span id="s411">The only thing we thought, well, maybe she went to another camp, maybe the war will be over next week, and we will see her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: But this all was in 1939 - 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah, that’s not – 1940 - ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: 1940 – ’41, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: [indecipherable] ’41, into ’42.</span> <span id="s416">Into ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So do you remember – excuse me for emphasizing this, but do you remember the date your mother was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: It was summer.</span> <span id="s419">Summer of – the only date – well, I remember only one date, and I will talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s421">So this – so you know it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: – summertime, and it was either 1940 or 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: It was June or July.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Okay, June or July, ’40 or ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Already.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Uh-huh, all right, so you had already been in Poland for a good many years, actually, you know, ’42 you’d been –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: – from 1938, when the Poles [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, we went in a ghetto in, we’re not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s433">And, so my – we were together, and my – we were hiding in three different places, one was – I don’t want to talk so much – one was on a roof and it was diagonally from a police station, and it was in the city where we used to live, so people knew us.</span> <span id="s434">So my father and uncle used to come in the evening, take off their bands, and always watching at night so nobody would see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Were you like in the attic area?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: In the attic area.</span> <span id="s437">Another place was we were in a mai – on a main street, then one night there was banging on the door, and we thought where somebody reported us, but it happened that it was an accident between a motorcycle and a car, and they were calling for help, so they were banging on the door.</span> <span id="s438">But everything was so frightening, because – and then, the third place was the most unusual.</span> <span id="s439">The third place, the Germans who liked my father and my uncle, offered that we can hide in the storage room of the building where the German and Polish offices – officers were, in the cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: These were German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: N-N-No, German – I don’t think they were Nazis, they were German overseers on the railroad tracks, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: So they weren’t part of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: – officer –</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: – military, but they were part of the work force?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: They were not military, but they were – right, not military.</span> <span id="s446">But I don’t think that they were SS.</span> <span id="s447">I – they might have been.</span> <span id="s448">They might have been, but I am not sure.</span> <span id="s449">So they offered we can hide in the cellar.</span> <span id="s450">The cellar, all that was in the cellar were crates, huge crates like from some machines.</span> <span id="s451">And the entrance to this was from the front of the building.</span> <span id="s452">No windows.</span> <span id="s453">No windows that – down to the cellar.</span> <span id="s454">So, we didn’t know what weather was outside, we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s455">The only people that knew that we are there, were our Polish neighbors, former Polish neighbor and I’m also forgot-got to tell you that my parents were so desperate to get Erik and me out when there was so much fear that we’ll be deported, or whatever, that the Polish neighbors send once their son, in the early 20s to bring Erik and me to their house to hide.</span> <span id="s456">It was before we were hiding in the other places.</span> <span id="s457">Wer – he came, and we were sitting on the train, Erik and I already, with this Polish guy, when I decided I’m not going anywhere with my parent – without my parents.</span> <span id="s458">So I ran out of the train, of course, Erik a – behind me, and the guy behind me, and my parents were very, very distraught that here – again we are here in danger, that we didn’t go into hiding.</span> <span id="s459">So, the only people that knew that we are hiding there were the Polish family, and two priests from a nearby church.</span> <span id="s460">And once in awhile they used to bring something and hide in the shrubs, soups, coffee, you know, in the shrubs.</span> <span id="s461">So, my par – my father or uncle took it out from under the shrubs at night.</span> <span id="s462">At night people were not working in this building, you know.</span> <span id="s463">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Tell me, the uncle, this was the husband of your –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Of my mother’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: – of you –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: – younger sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: – ya – sister, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I adored both of them, but my aunt was always my favorite aunt.</span> <span id="s470">So, we were – I don’t know again how long we were in this, but it was very frightening.</span> <span id="s471">We had some bottles to urinate in, in one of the crates, and every time we heard – and it was quite often – Polish or – or German voices in front, talking in front of the door, we jumped into the big crate, and we didn’t breathe.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: I’m a little surprised that Polish officers would have been allowed – you know, would have been cooperating with – with Germans, unless they were Polish police, for example –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Poli –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: – who were working for – because the military was – it was</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, these were Polish construction workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Oh, I see, not military people.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No, no, they were construction.</span> <span id="s478">They were people who are working on the railroad tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: All the people in the building had something to do with building the tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: I see, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: But still, Poles were very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s485">If anybody would see my father going there at night, we would – we would have been finished.</span> <span id="s486">The priests were wonderful, and they offered to do Aryan paper for us.</span> <span id="s487">And we decided maybe that would be another possibility to save ourself.</span> <span id="s488">So somehow my father and my uncle obtained some hair dyeing solution.</span> <span id="s489">My aunt had beautiful black hair, bu – she was a very pretty woman, very pretty woman.</span> <span id="s490">My father and my uncle could have passed ano – as non-Jews.</span> <span id="s491">My uncle had blue eyes, blondish hair.</span> <span id="s492">My father also didn’t have Jewish features, yo-you know.</span> <span id="s493">But Erik and I and my aunt – so we decided, at least my aunt, when she dyes her hair, so it will be less risky.</span> <span id="s494">So they brought this solution, and I was – they went to work, my father and my uncle, and I was pouring this solution in her – into her hair, and rubbing it in, and rubbing it in, and she – it didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s495">She said put more, put more, put more.</span> <span id="s496">So I was pouring more and rubbing in, and suddenly her hair was coming out in chunks.</span> <span id="s497">And sh – I could see that she was ready to scream in – you know, how painful it was, and her hair was burned, her skull was burned.</span> <span id="s498">And here I was a 12 year old kid, 13 year old kid, and I felt I did it to her, I did it to her.</span> <span id="s499">This – what could we do?</span> <span id="s500">Where could I ask what to do, you know, to ask for help?</span> <span id="s501">We couldn’t – she couldn’t scream –</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: She was down in the ce – she was down in the cellar with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: In the cellar, and we couldn’t – sh – sh – I could see the pain she was – she was really in excruciating pain.</span> <span id="s504">So, by the evening when they came back, her hair was gone, her beautiful hair was gone, and this was the end of Aryan paper.</span> <span id="s505">While we were there, we heard about a labor camp, Jewish labor camp, in walking distance actually, in Prokocim.</span> <span id="s506">So, I think the grow – grownups might have thought, well, it’s probably safer to survive in a ca – labor camp.</span> <span id="s507">Labor, it means working, so we will work, and the war will be probably – few months the war – war will be over.</span> <span id="s508">It’s surely safer than in the cellar, e-every moment was really fear, fear, fear.</span> <span id="s509">So we actually walked into the first labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: The four of you – the five of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: The – the f – my – five of us, the five of us.</span> <span id="s512">Let –</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How did your aunt look?</span> <span id="s514">Excuse me, by that point, did she wear a kerchief on her head?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I – she must have some – somehow, yes, beca – but she was really very, very beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s516">So, when we found – it was scary to find ourselves behind fences, suddenly, not be – being trapped again, but we figured we will work, and I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s517">I had to peel potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Not a bad job.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, not – not a bad job, but we had, I remember, seven buckets, big buckets to – to – of potatoes to peel, and there were big table with lots of potatoes, and the women were sitting around it, and everybody was grabbing the biggest potatoes, because it filled faster the bucket.</span> <span id="s520">We assumed that if we obey all the rules, we will live.</span> <span id="s521">The first – there was one room, it was a sewing room, and that was actually our meeting place where w – wife and husband, you know, the husband came to visit, the boyfriends came to visit, it was our – our community room.</span> <span id="s522">And one day we went sitting there in the evening when we heard terrible shots, and we froze, because we haven’t si-si – heard anything like it before.</span> <span id="s523">Nobody moved, until in the morning we heard that nine people tried to escape through the fence, and they were shot on the fence.</span> <span id="s524">The fence was, at this time, not electrified.</span> <span id="s525">So, that was the first shock.</span> <span id="s526">You better do what they tell you to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Or not do anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Anything else, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you see those nine people?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: I didn’t see them dead, no, but I knew them and it was – it was – the whole camp was, for the next few days it was – it was just a horrible, horrible atmosphere in the ca-camp.</span> <span id="s531">But at this – in this camp, Erik was there, I had some friends.</span> <span id="s532">My – I made friends with some teenagers my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: You were now 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Right, 13 - 14, right.</span> <span id="s535">So, we met in the evening, and one of the boys who was suppose – supposing my boyfriend was – had a beautiful voice.</span> <span id="s536">So, he was singing, another was telling jokes.</span> <span id="s537">And I always wrote.</span> <span id="s538">I wrote poetry or stories on home life.</span> <span id="s539">So we met in the evening and we shared, either in song, memories from home, or my stories from home, and we were together still.</span> <span id="s540">But then one day, the camp was liquidated and we have – we had to move to another camp.</span> <span id="s541">Similar, also a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: What was its name?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Pwa – Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: P-l-a-s-z-o-w.</span> <span id="s546">Under –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Is this the camp where Amon Goeth was?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Near it.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Near it, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Ge-Goeth – Goeth we called – in camp we had Get, but Goeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Goeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Goeth was in Plaszów concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And you were in the labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: And I was in the Plaszów labor camp, which was in walking distance.</span> <span id="s555">But, again, we knew that as long as we obeyed the rules, we probably will live.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: And so your father, your uncle, your – your aunt, and your brother were there all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: All together.</span> <span id="s558">And some of my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s560">Now, did you – in these camps, did you live in the same – like, as families in a room, or were the men were separated –</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No, no, no, men separate –</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: – from the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: – men were separate there then, and of course we – on the plank beds, which you see –</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: – in pictures, like sardines next to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s567">So it could be – I’m sorry to interrupt, but it could be that things could happen during the day to a family member, and you wouldn’t find out –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: – you wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: So, in the – we moved to – to the labor camp Plaszów and in the group of my friends were siblings, brother and sister, Lola and Henyik(ph).</span> <span id="s573">Lola was my age, and Henyik(ph) was a little bit older and they had a younger brother Erik’s age, and they had an older brother who was a policeman, camp policeman, and they had a sister who also married shortly before that.</span> <span id="s574">So there were five kids from the same family, no parents.</span> <span id="s575">Parents were gone, just the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s577">Can I interrupt just for a second?</span> <span id="s578">I hear noise outside.</span> <span id="s579">Can we close the doors here?</span> <span id="s580">Okay.</span> <span id="s581">Yeah, pause.</span> <span id="s582">All right, I’m so sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: You were talking – are we back on?</span> <span id="s585">Okay.</span> <span id="s586">We were talking about the five siblings whose parents weren’t there any more, who probably had been deported or – or lost somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s588">One day, the policeman brother went with a group of prisoners who are working outside of the camp, went with them out of the camp, and either he bought, or somebody gave him a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s589">And when he came to camp, they found it, and they shot him.</span> <span id="s590">So that was another –</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: – really shock for us, really, because he was such a wonderful young man.</span> <span id="s593">Such a wonderful young man.</span> <span id="s594">Also, another memory I have of this camp is that there was a young, married woman, Mrs. Unger – Ungar, u-n-g-a-r.</span> <span id="s595">Her husband was also in camp.</span> <span id="s596">And she became friendly – I guess she worked in the kitchen and became friendly with the cook.</span> <span id="s597">Friendly meaning human – a human being to a human being, nothing going on between them, just kind to each other.</span> <span id="s598">He was – and one night we were in beds when two or three of the Nazis came in and ask, is Mrs. Ungar here?</span> <span id="s599">And so she said yes.</span> <span id="s600">So they called her, they asked her, what is your name?</span> <span id="s601">And she said, Mathilda.</span> <span id="s602">And they said, Mathilda, ein schöner namen, a beautiful name.</span> <span id="s603">They took her with them, and they shot her.</span> <span id="s604">Just becau –</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Was the cook German?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: The cook was a German person in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s607">That’s it, see?</span> <span id="s608">So these were the two instances in the camp that I vividly remember, and how they ca – ein schöner Mathilda.</span> <span id="s609">Always when I heard this name, Malthilda, ein schöner namen, a beautiful name.</span> <span id="s610">In this camp we heard of Plaszów concentration camp, and of Goeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: What did you hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: We – I heard people say that they would rather die in this camp than go to this camp over there.</span> <span id="s613">I heard that this Goeth is a brutal – he is really a subhuman, you know, brute – very, very cruel.</span> <span id="s614">And – but the choice was not our made, and one day they liquidated Plaszów labor camp, and we had to walk to Plaszów camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Oh my, oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Erik was walking with my uncle and my dad.</span> <span id="s617">I was walking with my aunt in the women’s group.</span> <span id="s618">As soon as we reached the gates of Plaszów, they separated the children from the grownups.</span> <span id="s619">There was a lot of crying, a lot of screaming and begging and children didn’t want to leave, parents didn’t want to leave, and it was horrible.</span> <span id="s620">It was just absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s621">And the –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Was this 1943 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: I-It was ni – yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So you were 15 and Erik was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Erik was 12 actually.</span> <span id="s626">I was 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: 12, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I was 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: That’s right –</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: – because you were born in December, at the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: And so after lots of commotion and screaming and crying, the Germans said, the children will be going to separate barracks, and just simply, you know, pulled them away from the parents and with all the screaming, I didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s635">I found myself in a huge room, with all the women, huge room.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So you weren’t taken with the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, I didn’t know what was happ – I knew everybody was taken – I was in such a state of – of disbelief what’s happening.</span> <span id="s638">I found myself in this room with all the women, and there were big windows.</span> <span id="s639">And we were – the – the building was on a hill, and the women close to the window noticed that our men are below, in a barrack below, but there was a fence between us.</span> <span id="s640">So the women who were near the window were calling the names of the people whom they knew, you know, that we recognize some people, so there was a lot of calling, come here, you know, your father, your brother, whoever.</span> <span id="s641">And I don’t know how long it took til I – finally I was called, and my father was out.</span> <span id="s642">And all I s – oh, on the day when I found myself in the barrack, we heard terrible machine gun fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: This is in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, in Plaszów –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Already, so – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: It’s already under Goeth.</span> <span id="s647">Terrible machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s648">When I heard this machine gun fire, I completely froze.</span> <span id="s649">I said, our poor children being killed?</span> <span id="s650">So when I came to the window, I ask my father, Erik?</span> <span id="s651">I just called Erik?</span> <span id="s652">And my father just did, you know, like I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s654">So you succeeded in being taken with the women, but Erik was taken with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Erik was taken – I didn't –</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: No, you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: – I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I didn’t know, I just ask my father and so he said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s660">And – but I had this – this horrible feeling, this horrible premonition that they were our children who are being killed.</span> <span id="s661">The next day we were taken to work and we were carrying big, wooden boards, like for building barracks.</span> <span id="s662">Well, you can imagine, I was a small teenager.</span> <span id="s663">It was very difficult for me to carry the boards, and the camp was quite hilly.</span> <span id="s664">You know, up the hill, down the hill.</span> <span id="s665">And always when we were marching in the group, we were searching for people.</span> <span id="s666">I always for my father.</span> <span id="s667">Until the second day or third day, I don’t know exactly, because the whole thing is like a huge nightmare for me.</span> <span id="s668">Finally I saw my father’s group, and he was searching for me.</span> <span id="s669">So when we – they were walking opposite us, so he came to me and he grabbed me, and I could barely recognize my father.</span> <span id="s670">I could barely recognize him, he – something terrible happened to him, I knew.</span> <span id="s671">So, he –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: What did he look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: – grabbed me, just – he age, I cannot tell you, beyond – beyond recognition.</span> <span id="s674">So, he grabbed me and held me, and I said, Erik?</span> <span id="s675">And he said, not here.</span> <span id="s676">That’s all he could say, and – and you know, we couldn’t talk, he had to leave.</span> <span id="s677">And a few days later, we were very short time in the camp, we were – we were again herded to the railroad station to be shipped somewhere else.</span> <span id="s678">And when we were standing at the railroad station, my father again managed to find me and came to me, and held me and said – pointed to a rock on a hill … and said, do you see this hill?</span> <span id="s679">That’s where Erik is.</span> <span id="s680">Only when we were in the other next camp, I found out that when they shot the children, they were covered with a little bit soil, but they selected 50 men to bury them, and my father was among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: And he – he could see Erik’s hand, cause he had the ring.</span> <span id="s683">So, from there – thank you – from there we went on our first train journey, and I don’t have to tell you what the trains were like, I’m sure you heard it from many people.</span> <span id="s684">Packed like sardines, people were crying, screaming, silent, disbelief, you know, we – resignation, well, you name every feeling.</span> <span id="s685">No place to go to the bathroom, I – when I think of it today, I think how humiliating it was, you know, to be – to urinate right there, the smell, the hunger, th-the thirst, everything.</span> <span id="s686">The fear.</span> <span id="s687">And at one point, they s – this train stopped and women at the teeny window could see that we were on some kind of field.</span> <span id="s688">And the Germans with their rifles came in, were banging on the – on the ra – on the car – on the train, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: On the doors, or on the – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: On the doors, banging and screaming, and then there were some shots, and we were thinking, is that it, where we are going to – to die?</span> <span id="s691">And always my thought, is my father still alive?</span> <span id="s692">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Had you had any conversations with him – when everything started, and you were in Poland and things kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse, did he ever sit down or – did you have any – any discussions about what was going on, or did he try to keep it all inside so to spare –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: My father?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Yeah, to spare you any kind of fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: He ti – he – he did try to hide a lot from me, a lot.</span> <span id="s697">But I could sense the pain.</span> <span id="s698">So, the youngest brother of – only Lola survive.</span> <span id="s699">The two of us were the only two children from the whole group that survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: From Lola and Henyik(ph) you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s702">From Lola, and Henyik(ph) was on the men’s side –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: – so I didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s705">But I heard that the younger brother, my brother’s age, was killed also.</span> <span id="s706">And when we were in the other camp, we heard that Erik was beaten because – we thought they shot him because he would beg, let me live, I will work.</span> <span id="s707">This is the only date I remember.</span> <span id="s708">November 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: November 15th.</span> <span id="s710">… How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Between 11 and 12.</span> <span id="s712">This was the only time in my life that I wanted to die.</span> <span id="s713">The only time I wanted to die.</span> <span id="s714">But, I decided I have to live for my father.</span> <span id="s715">So, we went on the train, and the next stop was deeper in Poland.</span> <span id="s716">Georgie, it will take a long time.</span> <span id="s717">I’m sorry we had – have – yo-you didn’t go to the meeting yet, did you?</span> <span id="s718">Oh, you went already?</span> <span id="s719">Yeah?</span> <span id="s720">Okay, I think we – how long have been – we been talking now?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: A little over an hour.</span> <span id="s722">Over 70 minutes.</span> <span id="s723">70 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Oh, it was to take a while – a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A2: How long?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, I’m just – I don’t know, another hour, hour and a half probably.</span> <span id="s727">I will have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Thank you, thank you.</span> <span id="s729">I know it’s costing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s731">And so, we came to the next stop and the next stop was Camp Skarżyska-Kamiernana(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Skarżyska-Kamiernana(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: I better write it down, because that’s a long –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s735">Do you have a piece of paper?</span> <span id="s736">We can do it right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I – I can write it here, on piece –</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Writing – write on this one, that will be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q2: This would probably be a good time to start a new track.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Okay, let’s do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: And that is – and I must apologize for that.</span> <span id="s745">I should have not made an assumption when we spoke, and when I asked you to redo it.</span> <span id="s746">But generally – no, don’t put it on yet, I’ll – [break] – and I will say someth – This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Edith Lowy.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So there you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: – we are in the camp Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span> <span id="s750">I didn’t know, an-and they divided us in three groups in Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Men and women?</span> <span id="s752">Were there men there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Mixed, mixed, three groups, men and women.</span> <span id="s754">And I didn’t know that there were three different camps on the same commander.</span> <span id="s755">The commander of the camp was Kinneman(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Kinneman(ph), huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Cun-Cuneman(ph).</span> <span id="s758">Cuneman(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Here.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: I think – I don’t remember if it is [indecipherable] Cuneman(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: U-Umlaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: I think.</span> <span id="s763">I have it somewhere because I have the – I have a book about Skarzysko-Kamienna called “Death Comes in Yellow.”</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: So, I was very fortunate – fortunate is my four – once my fourth grader, when children had to write their im-impression of my talk, he said, people say that you are lucky.</span> <span id="s766">I don’t think so, he said.</span> <span id="s767">Nobody who was there was lucky.</span> <span id="s768">And it – but I was lucky that my father and I were assigned to the same camp, which was Camp B.</span> <span id="s769">But my uncle and aunt were gone, and I had no idea where.</span> <span id="s770">So, wi – it was very sad for me because I really loved her.</span> <span id="s771">She was my mother, my sister, everything after my mother was taken away.</span> <span id="s772">We came to – to the Camp B.</span> <span id="s773">There was A, B – werk arveg(ph), bayvek(ph), catsen(ph), they were called.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did you learn German during these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I knew German.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: You knew German, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: You knew German before, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: – knew German, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: And by then I spoke very well Polish.</span> <span id="s782">I actually wrote already Polish poetry by then, yeah.</span> <span id="s783">So we – when we came to the camp, people were ask if anybody has some technical or mechanical skills.</span> <span id="s784">And my father, thinking quickly, thought it’s probably a good idea to have something, so he came forward, and they brought some tools to show him if he can recognize what they are, because, you know, people were lying.</span> <span id="s785">So my father could recognize it because he saw it in the store.</span> <span id="s786">So, he was working in a – in a workshop, and his shifts were always daytime.</span> <span id="s787">I was taken to ammunition factory, and my shifts were 12 hour shifts, one weekday, one weeknight.</span> <span id="s788">My work was extremely difficult, extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s789">That was probably my most difficult time in camp, physically.</span> <span id="s790">I was given – hand a tray with hundred pieces of ammunition, tha-that big, and I had to carve rings around the ammunition.</span> <span id="s791">My work was standing at a huge machine, 12 hours shifts, no place to sit or rest.</span> <span id="s792">I had to open the machine, put the – take the ammunition, put it into the machine, take the other ammunition out, like two motions.</span> <span id="s793">Oil was dripping on the ammunition because the ammunition came out quite hot.</span> <span id="s794">My finger was burned to the bone, so painful, I – and standing 12 hour and this motion to open this big machine, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s795">I was so hungry, we were so hungry, so tired.</span> <span id="s796">I – when I talked for the first time to a group of students, and I was showing them how I opened the machine, I stopped talking.</span> <span id="s797">I forgot that I have a group of kids listening to me.</span> <span id="s798">I realized what happened to my finger, you know, the flesh was so burned out, it grew together, but – the skin grew together, but the flesh completely deformed my finger.</span> <span id="s799">It was – it was very difficult, it was clearly extremely difficult work.</span> <span id="s800">One –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: What kind of ammuni – I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: What kind – yeah, what kind of – were – were these bullets, were these –</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Bullets, bullets about that –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: – big, and – and I had to test them through a gauge, and if it slipped through the gauge – it had to click into it, if you – if it went through, I had to discard the ammunition and call a technician, you know, mechanic to – to adjust the machine.</span> <span id="s807">But every so often I had to test it.</span> <span id="s808">And one time, I was so tired, I was just so, so tired, I cou – I couldn’t stand any more, so I crouched somewhere near the machine for a few minutes and I fell asleep and the German supervisor came and screamed at me, and – when we were – in the evening we were – we got a bowl of soup, and a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s809">We experimented with the bread.</span> <span id="s810">Sometimes we starved ourselves to keep the bread for the next day, that if we have two slices, we’ll not be so hungry.</span> <span id="s811">We still went hungry because we – it was so painful, the hunger was so different from when we are hungry here.</span> <span id="s812">So different, it never went out of our mind.</span> <span id="s813">It was constantly on our mind.</span> <span id="s814">One day we made crumbs, and we were hoping that if we eat little crumbs, it will last.</span> <span id="s815">No matter what we did, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s816">So one day, we were standing for soup at night and my father didn’t come.</span> <span id="s817">We always, when I had the day shift, we always stood together.</span> <span id="s818">The prisoners always let me stand, because I – I was one of the very few children.</span> <span id="s819">So they always protected me, and you know, let me stand next to my father.</span> <span id="s820">And on this evening my father didn’t come.</span> <span id="s821">So I didn’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s822">I took my bowl of soup and I went to his barrack.</span> <span id="s823">He was in bed, and he said that he was too tired to come.</span> <span id="s824">I knew that it is impossible because we were so hungry, would have crawled, you know, to – to get this piece of bread.</span> <span id="s825">Only later I found out that he went by the camp’s kitchen, and he found a carrot in a trashcan, which he took for me, and they caught him and they beat him so terribly that he couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s826">But he wanted to hide his pain from me.</span> <span id="s827">Then, one day, it was Yom Kippur, the holiest day, and – and people knew that I was writing, and so they ask me if I could read something for a – they wanted to have a special – some way to celebrate the holiday.</span> <span id="s828">I knew that my father will be at work, so I wrote something.</span> <span id="s829">Not a poem, just a story, my memories of Yom Kippur at home, comparing it to what we have now.</span> <span id="s830">And it was packed, it was packed and when I was reading it, I heard somebody in the back crying.</span> <span id="s831">And I – when I looked, I saw my father.</span> <span id="s832">You know, I didn’t know that he will be there.</span> <span id="s833">And then my birthday is in December, but of course, who – who wanted to think about birthday?</span> <span id="s834">Every day was the same, we didn’t know even what day it was because each day was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: December what?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: December 22nd.</span> <span id="s837">And when we stood the line – in line for food, my father gave me a birthday gift.</span> <span id="s838">I couldn’t believe this.</span> <span id="s839">It was a comb this big, it was made of steel, he made it in the workshop.</span> <span id="s840">Teeth not completely even, and I thought it was the most beautiful gift.</span> <span id="s841">I carried it with me, I slept on it, I – I didn't leave it off my side.</span> <span id="s842">I couldn’t believe how he risk his life to make it.</span> <span id="s843">If he would have been caught for this lousy, rotten carrot, then he – he was beaten like this, they would catch him.</span> <span id="s844">So I was really – I loved this comb.</span> <span id="s845">Then, when I finished my night shift, some of – a little bit earlier, before the men went to work the day shift, so I sneaked into my father’s barrack.</span> <span id="s846">I knew what I’ll find.</span> <span id="s847">All the men were sleeping and my father’s sitting next to a freestanding stove, sitting.</span> <span id="s848">I walked in, not talking, sat next to my father … we just held each other.</span> <span id="s849">And that way we shared our – our love.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: He sounds like an amazing man, an amazing –</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Our – our fear and our – our hopes.</span> <span id="s852">One day in December – okay – then one day I was working and it was almost the end of the – oh, I – I have to mention – mention that once a month we were taken on trucks to Camp A, which was the main camp.</span> <span id="s853">And I found out that my aunt and uncle are on Camp A, and that my aunt, my beautiful aunt was selected to be the housekeeper of Cuneman(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: I was going to ask you about Cuneman(ph), we hadn’t talked about him yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: He was a hunchback.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Always walking with a dog or two, always.</span> <span id="s858">And my aunt was his housekeeper.</span> <span id="s859">So, when we came to – they took us to delouse, because there was a terrible epidemic of typhoid in the camp, and then it was already under control, but every so often, they took us to delouse us, our clothes, our hair, us, to Camp A.</span> <span id="s860">When I came to Camp A, a group of people were walking there, and I looked at them and I said, are these human beings?</span> <span id="s861">Are these human beings?</span> <span id="s862">The people were yellow green; their eyes, their teeth, their fingernails, everything was yellow green.</span> <span id="s863">I said, who are these people?</span> <span id="s864">They were people from Camp C, the worst of the camp, which the people were working – working with poisonous gases, and they were dying a slow death.</span> <span id="s865">It was – the book I have about Skarzysko-Kamienna called, “Death Comes in Yellow,” is because of the people.</span> <span id="s866">When we came to werk A, often, we have to – they assembled us on a big assembly place, and we had to watch executions of prisoners by hanging or by shooting.</span> <span id="s867">So, when I was – when we were supposed to go to werk A, my emotions were really torn, because I was so happy to be able to see my beloved aunt and uncle, but I was so afraid to see an-another execution.</span> <span id="s868">The worse were also – okay – one day I was so tired working at this huge machine, and it was the end of the shift, and I was – I just didn’t know what to do, I just – I didn’t – I was almost sleeping and working.</span> <span id="s869">And the obermeister came to check the ammunition, and went to – took some of mine and it went through, and he’s got, was ist ein das, what is this?</span> <span id="s870">Then he took the next one and it went through, and he started louder, was ist ein das?</span> <span id="s871">And then the next one, and all of it was bad, all of it was bad.</span> <span id="s872">How could I tell him that I just could not function?</span> <span id="s873">I – I – I just couldn’t do it any more, I was so tired, and so hungry, I didn’t know what I was doing.</span> <span id="s874">So after the – after a few, he took the ammunition and with every one he knocked on my hair and screamed, was ist ein das, was ist ein das?</span> <span id="s875">And then he walked away to his office, which was off the machine room.</span> <span id="s876">After a few minutes he came back and called me.</span> <span id="s877">As I was walking behind him, I knew.</span> <span id="s878">I knew what it meant.</span> <span id="s879">And I could s – I could see the silence of the – I could hear the silence of my fellow prisoners and I could see their tears as I was ma-marching behind him.</span> <span id="s880">And all I remember is thinking, what will it do to my father when he finds out that he had lost me too?</span> <span id="s881">I – I knew what my fate will be.</span> <span id="s882">I came to his office, and he looked at me and looked at me and looked at me and paused.</span> <span id="s883">And then he said, take the broom, sweep my office, and go back to work.</span> <span id="s884">I don’t know if my youth moved him, if he had maybe a daughter my age.</span> <span id="s885">But something moved him.</span> <span id="s886">I also am convinced that when I was not taken in Plaszów, it was because I was small and I was standing behind somebody and they simply did not see me.</span> <span id="s887">Because there’s absolutely no reason why I am here and my brother and others are dead.</span> <span id="s888">Th – I’m – I’m convince of it, that they just did not see me.</span> <span id="s889">And it’s not because of I – because I was hiding, because I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s890">I – you know.</span> <span id="s891">So – so that was my other miracle, [indecipherable] that I went behind him and – and he decided, go back to work.</span> <span id="s892">But when my father found out, he was so worried that I will not survive this camp, because it was such horrible work, that when he – when we went to see Aunt Pauline, he – and she also, was terribly worried about me.</span> <span id="s893">So they decided that she will talk to Cuneman(ph) to move my father and me to werk A.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Was it successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: After a few months, I was moved, but my father did not get permission.</span> <span id="s896">So here I – I – I – I adored my father, so I was again torn.</span> <span id="s897">It was easier for me, but I was on [indecipherable] every minute worried about my father.</span> <span id="s898">The worst were the selection.</span> <span id="s899">They used to come on trucks, the Germans, and always when we heard them coming on trucks, it was this fear.</span> <span id="s900">We had to line up and they – they walked and they said, du, du – you, you, you – and we never knew, should we look at them, should we look up, sideways, back, which way?</span> <span id="s901">Should we stand crooked, crou – you know, never – how can we avoid du, because we knew what it meant.</span> <span id="s902">And the first people who were always taken were people with white hair.</span> <span id="s903">And my father, since Erik was killed, my father was white.</span> <span id="s904">So always when I heard that they saw some trucks from werk A, passing by werk A, you know, with prisoners from werk B, I was always, my father still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Did you work in his house, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: She – she –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: – yeah, you, with your aunt, de – when you were transferred to werk A, did you work with your aunt, or were you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, no, she wa – she was his housekeeper, she works for him.</span> <span id="s909">I worked again in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: I was again in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s912">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: How long – excuse me, how long had you been in werk B, do you remember?</span> <span id="s914">… So here?</span> <span id="s915">Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s916">So, slave labor from November 30, ’43 to August ’44.</span> <span id="s917">About nine years.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yeah, but in that – yeah, in – in – combine –</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Oh, it combines with werk A?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s922">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: – it was about nine months then, in total, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: – star – Starzysko(ph)-Kamienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Right.</span> <span id="s928">And so, my life was easier physically.</span> <span id="s929">And then one day I woke up and I felt sick.</span> <span id="s930">And my aunt was standing over me, and two other men whom I didn't know were standing over me, and my aunt was crying.</span> <span id="s931">And I didn’t know what is wrong with me.</span> <span id="s932">And they moved me to a little place, not to the hospital, and I didn't know while I was there what – what was wrong with me, but after I recovered, I found out that I had typhoid, and it was a time when the orders came that every new case must be shot immediately because the epidemic was over, and they didn’t want a new spread of e-epidemic, so every new case had to be shot.</span> <span id="s933">And here they didn’t report, and I think that Cuneman(ph) must have known that I had typhoid, I don’t know, but that he [indecipherable] for my aunt’s sake.</span> <span id="s934">I don’t know if my aunt had to pay a price for it, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Did you ever meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Was he – what was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: He was a very cruel man, very bitter, being a hunchback, you know, and [indecipherable] very beaten, but he –</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Was he physically ugly?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s941">But in the conteres – in contrast to Goeth, who was very handsome man in – in Plaszów.</span> <span id="s942">He was very handsome.</span> <span id="s943">Have you seen the movie with his daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: She is not a very attractive girl, or young woman.</span> <span id="s946">She is not attractive, and her father was so attractive.</span> <span id="s947">That is the – it’s called – I’ll remember.</span> <span id="s948">There is a – a documentary with his daughter, who found out – she did not have good relationship with her mother.</span> <span id="s949">And her mother told her once, you will end up just like your father, you are just like your father.</span> <span id="s950">And she assumed that her father was on the front, that he was a military –</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: That – she didn’t know who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No.</span> <span id="s953">She thought that he died as a soldier.</span> <span id="s954">So she ask her grandmother, why did my mom say that I’ll end like my father, that I’m like – so her grandmother told her what happened, that he was executed because of the horrible things he did.</span> <span id="s955">So she started researching him, and found a housekeeper, a Jewish housekeeper who worked for her father in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Is this Helen?</span> <span id="s957">Because that’s the one who was profiled in “Schindler’s List.”</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Helen who?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Was a housekeeper too, with Goeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: But, and a me – okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: So the two met in Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Oh, I think I heard about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: They met in Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s968">I heard about the film, but no, I have not seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yeah, yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: So – so he was not a very attractive man.</span> <span id="s972">But that was another – another one of my survivors, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: So, you had the typhoid.</span> <span id="s974">You don’t know what cost it might have been to your aunt, or to the others who saved you, but you were able to heal.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: You were able to eat better.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Without them sending me to the hospital, and I listened to a tape.</span> <span id="s978">My cousin interviewed my uncle, my ha – my aunt’s husband.</span> <span id="s979">So he says on the tape – on the tape that Aunt Polly and he practically adopted me.</span> <span id="s980">And he write about the typhus, that they managed to get everyone in the camp, put me in the room, isolated, and so – so that’s – that was Skarzysko-Kamienna, and as I said, Skarzysko-Kamienna was a – then, Skarzysko-Kamienna was liquidate.</span> <span id="s981">I don’t know what happened to Skarzysko-Kamienna, but we had – again we were herded to the trains once more.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: And Father, where was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: And Father was also, but he was in a – you know, he was in B, werk bay, and I was in – in A, so I didn’t know exactly what was happening to him.</span> <span id="s984">But we were shipped to Germany, and this time it was Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: I’ve been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: I’ve been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: But many decades later.</span> <span id="s990">Many decades later.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: So when we came to Buchenwald, my father was shipped elsewhere.</span> <span id="s992">It was only a women’s camp, and I had no idea where my father is.</span> <span id="s993">So, new horror came over me, here I was separated from him, and I had no idea where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Were you with your aunt, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: When we came to this camp, we had to put everything we possessed, everything we had to put on a pile.</span> <span id="s998">I had my poetry, my stories, everything I had, I put it on the pile.</span> <span id="s999">But I decided that there is no way, no way anybody is going to take away my comb.</span> <span id="s1000">But what do I do?</span> <span id="s1001">They searched us, they – we – they stripped us, we had to take our clothes off, how can I keep it?</span> <span id="s1002">So, we had wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s1003">I started kicking the ground under me, and scratching and here, with all the women around me, and I – I kicked a hole deep enough, and I buried my comb, with the hope that when I ever get out, I’ll find it.</span> <span id="s1004">As long as I was in Buchenwald, I was kicking and kicking and walking all around the camp, because I had no idea where I buried it.</span> <span id="s1005">When we arrived I didn’t know the physical layout of the camp, so I was never able to find it, never.</span> <span id="s1006">And when I tell this story to my little students, the especially little, will you go back, will you look for it, will you – I said, I was there and I didn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1007">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: But you didn’t give it up, either, that’s the good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Well, I – I’m still sorry that I never found it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: But in the meantime, somebody made for me a comb which is very special to me, and that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: In Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Buchenwald was – work in Buchenwald was easier than in Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1016">I was again in ammunition fa-factory.</span> <span id="s1017">I was working on bombs.</span> <span id="s1018">And – but it was sitting, there were 10 of us in a row, including my aunt.</span> <span id="s1019">I had two sisters on each side.</span> <span id="s1020">They were older, I was the youngest, and we were cleaning with big, metal rods, we were cleaning scratches inside of the bombs.</span> <span id="s1021">I learned the most beautiful poetry during this time, Polish poetry.</span> <span id="s1022">The two sisters started one day to – just bring something from the outside world.</span> <span id="s1023">And I was so hungry to learn, I said, teach me.</span> <span id="s1024">And so they started – I started memorizing in the words which we couldn’t pronoun – which I could not remember.</span> <span id="s1025">Somebody smuggled a piece of chalk, so I wrote it on the bomb.</span> <span id="s1026">And it – I – I just – several poems, but one was a very, very long poem about the father in Lebanon, who has, I think seven children, and each one died of a epidemic, and he describes the death of each of his children and his wife.</span> <span id="s1027">And at the end it says, where the cemetery is, there is my way [indecipherable], and it’s a very beautiful poem.</span> <span id="s1028">And after the war, everybody, from my friends who went to Poland, I said, please try to find the poem for me.</span> <span id="s1029">After years, a colleague of mine in school said, Edith, I think I found the poem for you.</span> <span id="s1030">My aunt, here in Washington has the book of poetry, and the poem is in it.</span> <span id="s1031">She brought me – it was like finding a beloved friend, but I couldn’t believe, 14 pages, that I learned 14 pages like this, and this was not the only poem.</span> <span id="s1032">I have it, I printed it several times and it got – and I thought no, I – impossible that I learned all of it, but when I went through all of it, the poem, I remembered that I knew every single line.</span> <span id="s1033">I don’t know the poem now in its – but I still remember the first.</span> <span id="s1034">But I – it was really – it meant so much for me to – in this camp, also one time somebody smuggled pieces of cloth, different pieces of cloth and needle and thread.</span> <span id="s1035">And one of the women was a seamstress, so she made beautiful collars for us on our prisoner’s dress.</span> <span id="s1036">I have my prisoner’s dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: You have your prisoner’s dress?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: It will go to the museum, but only after I [indecipherable] I’ll show it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1041">So, on our prisoner dresses, we had this – we knew we cannot walk out of the room, but for just few seconds, we felt we had the most beautiful party dresses, you know?</span> <span id="s1042">In Buchenwald, I had a very good overseer.</span> <span id="s1043">He must have been in – working in – in this ammunition company before the war.</span> <span id="s1044">Not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1045">I knew that he felt very sorry for me, he was a very kind man.</span> <span id="s1046">Sometimes he brought a piece of bread, sometimes an apple, and he hid it, and he told me where to find it.</span> <span id="s1047">As I told you before, my mother used to sing German operettas and songs.</span> <span id="s1048">One day he started singing a song that my mother used to sing.</span> <span id="s1049">And it was like somebody took a knife and went through my heart.</span> <span id="s1050">I burst out in tears, and he came to me and asked me, warum weinst du?</span> <span id="s1051">Why – why are you crying?</span> <span id="s1052">Well, I was so choked up that I couldn’t answer.</span> <span id="s1053">The next day when he came, I ask him, please sing it.</span> <span id="s1054">He said, please tell me why did you cry?</span> <span id="s1055">So I told him.</span> <span id="s1056">And he tra – look at me, and he said, I’ll never sing this song again.</span> <span id="s1057">In this camp was – were some non-Jewish prisoners, they were not the same prisoners as we were, but they were still prisoners.</span> <span id="s1058">And there was a Belgian young man, an electrician, who was working fixing something.</span> <span id="s1059">And I call him my friend, although we never spoke.</span> <span id="s1060">We communicated with our eyes and our smiles.</span> <span id="s1061">And he used to – to point where he put newspaper clippings, so I would know that it’s coming to the end.</span> <span id="s1062">And I will read to you the end of – of the war, okay?</span> <span id="s1063">Cause that’s what I’m usually –</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: So, did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: This is my precious gift story about the comb, which was published in several pa – places, including this one here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Excuse me, I’m going to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1068">Do you want – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: I don’t have to say anything then?</span> <span id="s1070">Okay, all right.</span> <span id="s1071">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Last weeks before liberation, Leipzig, Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1073">My father was also in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: But you didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: I didn’t know for a long time, but then one day some German – some Nazis came and said that we are allowed to write a short card to Buchenwald men’s group.</span> <span id="s1076">I didn’t know if my father is dead or not, but I wrote.</span> <span id="s1077">And my aunt wrote to her husband, and I got an answer back.</span> <span id="s1078">We could all write just I’m fine, I am happy, you know, and – and – just few words.</span> <span id="s1079">I gave the letters to the museum.</span> <span id="s1080">So I knew then my father was in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: And he was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: And he survived.</span> <span id="s1083">Okay, it was at the end of March or beginning of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s1084">From newspaper clippings smuggled into the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish Belgian friend, we knew that the situation did not look good for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1085">One evening, as we lay stretched on our plank beds, we heard sounds of shelling, gunfire and explosions.</span> <span id="s1086">We knew that these were the sounds of the American front being so near.</span> <span id="s1087">What sweet sounds they were.</span> <span id="s1088">Our hopes for being soon free rose high.</span> <span id="s1089">Unfortunately, our euphoria was very short-lived.</span> <span id="s1090">Around nine or 10 o’clock the same evening, we were ordered to assemble outside on the assembly field.</span> <span id="s1091">I don’t remember if we were told for what purpose.</span> <span id="s1092">We were given some supply of food, and we were marched out of the camp into the darkness of the night.</span> <span id="s1093">About 5,000 women began their new journey.</span> <span id="s1094">A journey which became known as the death march.</span> <span id="s1095">We marched and marched.</span> <span id="s1096">Days replaced nights.</span> <span id="s1097">We kept marching, given short periods of rest.</span> <span id="s1098">We mar-marched in sunshine and we marched in the rain.</span> <span id="s1099">We marched through towns, and we marched through villages.</span> <span id="s1100">No one knew where we were going.</span> <span id="s1101">Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1102">While we were marching, we were heavily guarded by our captors.</span> <span id="s1103">They were working in shifts.</span> <span id="s1104">Replacements for them were coming on trucks.</span> <span id="s1105">Food was delivered to them, while our was long gone.</span> <span id="s1106">The officers among our captors were driving by in comfortable cars, enjoying the sight of marching subhuman creatures.</span> <span id="s1107">Their spotless starch uniforms were highly polish – and highly pol-polished boots, must have been quite a contrast with the wrecks and filths we were in.</span> <span id="s1108">I remember when others were given to rest, we turned the seams of our prisoners striped clothes from inside out, and squashed as many lice as we could between our fingernails.</span> <span id="s1109">The itching was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1110">By now some of the events are blurred.</span> <span id="s1111">Others are more deeply engraved in my memory.</span> <span id="s1112">I still can see half faces of the German civilian population, the other half hidden behind the curtain, watching as we marched.</span> <span id="s1113">What were they thinking?</span> <span id="s1114">What did they feel?</span> <span id="s1115">Once, taking a rest near woods, we heard shots.</span> <span id="s1116">We found out later that someone was shot trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1117">How could anyone hope to escape?</span> <span id="s1118">Besides being so heavily guarded, we had only our prisoner’s clothes on.</span> <span id="s1119">How far could we go without being caught?</span> <span id="s1120">So we kept marching.</span> <span id="s1121">We ate grass, and even this was forbidden, if a cruel guard chose to do so.</span> <span id="s1122">Days and nights went by.</span> <span id="s1123">More and more people were unable to keep walking, and each of us was too weak to be able to help someone else.</span> <span id="s1124">We could hardly lift our own feet.</span> <span id="s1125">How dreadful and painful it was to have to leave someone dear behind to die.</span> <span id="s1126">We came up on a desolate concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1127">There was no movement anywhere.</span> <span id="s1128">It was so eerie.</span> <span id="s1129">Where were the people?</span> <span id="s1130">Were they also marching, or were they shipped into crematoria?</span> <span id="s1131">When we still had strength to talk, we kept evaluating our situation.</span> <span id="s1132">One terrifying thought went through our minds.</span> <span id="s1133">We were fearful, and then when the Germans will realize that they have lost, they will shoot us anyway.</span> <span id="s1134">We imagined that they will need our uniforms to make an easier escape.</span> <span id="s1135">There was so little hope for our survival, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s1136">How they do it, keep marching.</span> <span id="s1137">My most vivid memories are of a situation which occurred on a farmland.</span> <span id="s1138">Naturally, we were very hungry, and exhausted when others came to rest.</span> <span id="s1139">Some prisoner noticed in the distance of the field, a wagon loaded with potatoes, which several farmers were about to plant.</span> <span id="s1140">As soon as some of the women prisoner noticed it, they began running to grab some potatoes.</span> <span id="s1141">My Aunt Polly started to run.</span> <span id="s1142">I grabbed her with the little strength I had left, and pleaded with her not to go.</span> <span id="s1143">Just then rifle fire started blasting and that women were falling everywhere.</span> <span id="s1144">A young woman, she could have been between 18 - 20 years old, was shot in the leg.</span> <span id="s1145">She tried to get up, but couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1146">She was not too far from us.</span> <span id="s1147">What pain and terror were reflected in her eyes.</span> <span id="s1148">She screamed and pleaded for help.</span> <span id="s1149">The Germans took their time to kill her.</span> <span id="s1150">We kept walking, leaving more and more people behind, often stepping over them.</span> <span id="s1151">As we grew weaker and could hardly walk with our eyes open, letting ourselves to be pushed by the mass of people, my – my aunt and our small group of friends around us tried to reassure ourself that one or the other are still with us.</span> <span id="s1152">From time to time we called each other’s names in weak voices, and our responses brought some relief to the others.</span> <span id="s1153">The rest periods were welcome, but it was increasingly more difficult to get up, and to keep marching.</span> <span id="s1154">Actually, for most of us, it was impossible to get up, but as soon as a shot was fired into the helpless prisoners, we collected our bit – last bits of energy and kept going.</span> <span id="s1155">One day we found ourself on another farmland.</span> <span id="s1156">There was even food for us in kettles in a huge barn.</span> <span id="s1157">After eating and some rest, we were ordered once more to get up and to continue to march.</span> <span id="s1158">Only this time, some of us were no longer able to do so.</span> <span id="s1159">We reached our limits.</span> <span id="s1160">We had to give up.</span> <span id="s1161">We were told that if we will not vacate this barn, it will be locked and burned with us in it.</span> <span id="s1162">It seemed that our fate was sealed.</span> <span id="s1163">Some women were still able to get up and go.</span> <span id="s1164">We found out later that they were shot, and that that Nazis did use their uniforms.</span> <span id="s1165">As for us in the barn, freedom came in the last moment, and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle, leading the way to more Russian soldiers on trucks appeared and prevented the burning of the barn, with our living corpses in it.</span> <span id="s1166">I have no recollection of what I felt at the time of our liberation.</span> <span id="s1167">I – I don’t remember if I fully comprehended that it was all over, and we were finally and truly free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Did you have any opportunity to sleep on those marches, or during the nighttime they kept you moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: They kept us moving all the time, we must have slept, you know, whenever they told us to rest, but – but it was more and more difficult to kept marching.</span> <span id="s1170">We just had less and less energy.</span> <span id="s1171">We didn't eat for days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Do you know where you ended up, on that farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: What was the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: The place was called Orschatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Orschatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Here – here is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: In that paper that you showed me before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yeah, paper where I had all this camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Orschatz.</span> <span id="s1183">I see.</span> <span id="s1184">To Orschatz, where I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1185">And where is Orschatz, is it still in Germany, or is it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Actually, Orschatz is not terribly far from Buchenwald, you know, we were walking back and forth, they were marching us – the Russians came closer, so they marched us toward the American front.</span> <span id="s1187">The American toward the Russians, so we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1189">It was not in a line, it was in a circle line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: It – it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: And did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Well, when we were liberated, this is a mystery that I have not solved –</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute –</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Oh, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Oh, I’m so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: You want to show us something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1200">We’ll take this off, we’ll pause it for a sec – [break] Just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1201">This is amazing shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: This –</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Are we on?</span> <span id="s1204">The dress?</span> <span id="s1205">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: This dress, if you see it in the museum, it’s another dress, but this dress, as I mention, I was working with ammunitions –</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: – oil –</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: It must have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: – was dripping on it, it got dirty, it had to be washed.</span> <span id="s1211">This is the only thing we had for spring, summer, fall and winter.</span> <span id="s1212">In summer it was hot, in wonter – winter it was extremely cold in the severe winters of Poland or Germany.</span> <span id="s1213">Can you imagine when we had to wash it in the washroom, with a little bit soap, whatever, and we had to squeeze the water out, and had no energy, we were we – weak and hungry, so we couldn’t squeeze it completely, no place to dry.</span> <span id="s1214">We put it on our plank beds in the evening, and in the morning when we were called to roll call, we had to wear it wet as it was, and stand in the most severe winters of – in Poland, or Germany.</span> <span id="s1215">In a few second being outside, it turn into a sheet of ice.</span> <span id="s1216">How did we just, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: I’m amazed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: – die from – from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Just from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: And your number was 781?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1223">It’s quite early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Did you – I see all these spots that are repaired.</span> <span id="s1225">Did they cap – happen later, after you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: I – I – after liberation.</span> <span id="s1227">But first of all, I have no recollection why I kept it, how I kept it, where I kept it, because the first thing when the Russian soldiers saw us, th – in what filth we were, they stripped their shirts and they gave to the women.</span> <span id="s1228">The women, the first thing they had, they took off this full of lice clothes and threw it away.</span> <span id="s1229">So, how did I keep it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1232">And then we were assigned to the German families in Orschatz, depending how well the family was; some people had four prisoners, some had six prisoners.</span> <span id="s1233">Where I was, we were six.</span> <span id="s1234">And the family had to feed us, clothe us, and – until we started functioning as human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: And did – a couple of questions here, when they – do you remember how they behaved towards you, were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Yes, in the families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: The families?</span> <span id="s1239">They were so protective of – even the – the men, I don’t know what they were doing during the war, but they protected na – us against the Russian soldiers, because the Russian soldiers were drinking a lot, and ready to rape if they – even a skeleton, they were ready to rape.</span> <span id="s1240">So the Germans protected us and hid us when they saw the Russians coming, they hid us somewhere.</span> <span id="s1241">It was such a strange time [indecipherable] so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: And your father, when did you dis –</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: And my father was bo – liberated from Buchenwald, and of course, the first thought was to find us, my uncle and – they were liberated together.</span> <span id="s1244">So they went from village to vel – village, trying to find out where the people went from this camp, where we went.</span> <span id="s1245">Until somebody told them that they spotted some people from our transport in Orschatz.</span> <span id="s1246">So they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: They found you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: They found us when we were with the German family.</span> <span id="s1249">And that’s how my father – yeah.</span> <span id="s1250">But I – I have just no recollection of this.</span> <span id="s1251">N-None, zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: You don’t – you don’t recall seeing your father then, or seeing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: You know what the strangest thing is?</span> <span id="s1254">I remember going home with my father to our hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: In – in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1257">But I don’t remember the first – the initial meeting him after the war, and I think that it was because I was so afraid to think that it might not be true.</span> <span id="s1258">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: It was just too much that you had to deal with, too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: So then, when we went home, we had no home.</span> <span id="s1261">So we went to Icar(ph), my friend’s family, to the bakers, and they were in such a shock to find out what we – of course they didn’t know, right – where we went, but that Mother didn’t survive, Erik didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1262">They were – they were devastated by it, you know?</span> <span id="s1263">And so I stayed with them for some time, and the people who took over our home and store said, we will vacate as soon as we can, which was really incredible, because when Jewish people came back to Poland, they were killed by some Poles.</span> <span id="s1264">You know, they didn’t want to give back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: It – it’s so – yeah, it’s so unusual to hear this type of a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: So, not only this, but when people in the community ca – heard that we came back and what happened to us, they came to my father, they said, Mr. Pick, you helped us when we needed it, because when we had the store they – sometimes they didn’t have the money to pay and my parents put it on the book, never asked them, because they knew when the – if the people will have money, they will pay, they don’t have to remind them, you know?</span> <span id="s1267">So, the people came back, she said, you gave us when we needed it, let us pay you back, and open this store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: And that’s what happened?</span> <span id="s1269">You got back your store, you got back your house?</span> <span id="s1270">Your aunt, your uncle, your father and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: My aunt and uncle went to live in the city where my uncle came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: But we – we had our store, we had our home back.</span> <span id="s1274">My father said, all I want is the housekeeper’s room in the attic, but they said, this belongs to you, and we will vacate, and – and the people in the community were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1275">There’s a plaque on the community building naming people, and many of my family member – honor to their memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: How long did you stay in Parowice(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: I stayed, I went to school, I studied like crazy, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: You missed so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: – I wanted to go to school with my peers.</span> <span id="s1280">But my peers went to schools for six years, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1281">I had a little bit Polish education, you know.</span> <span id="s1282">So fo – so I – I had the – I cried awa – to the Ministry of – of Education, let me go, I’ll catch up, and my first report card was four Ds, and I was crushed.</span> <span id="s1283">But my professor [indecipherable] you are sitting in this class with your peers.</span> <span id="s1284">Give yourself credit.</span> <span id="s1285">Next report card was Cs and then I had Bs and by then end I had some As, okay.</span> <span id="s1286">But it was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: But I-I was the only Jew in the Jewish – in the – in the Czech youth movement.</span> <span id="s1289">I was the only Jew in school after the war, in business school.</span> <span id="s1290">I was the only school – Jew in my sport organization.</span> <span id="s1291">Yet I – I cannot tell you how the people were.</span> <span id="s1292">Really, I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1293">But my father remarried.</span> <span id="s1294">And – and in spite of all, you know, that we got back and that we were so welcomed and so accepted.</span> <span id="s1295">Like, my father was – and I were invited to every – in – in January, February, every organization has a ball, a party.</span> <span id="s1296">This ball, the firefighters, the policeman [indecipherable] we were invited to every single one, my father and I.</span> <span id="s1297">In spite of this, it was like being there on a graveyard.</span> <span id="s1298">Being there, especially, especially on the bridge – we went back – you know, my – my fondest memories were of the meadow, all the family and my grandpa.</span> <span id="s1299">No one was there.</span> <span id="s1300">So, I volunteered –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Did you ever know about – mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: I went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Before that, I’m sorry, what happened to your mother?</span> <span id="s1304">Do you – did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: – ever find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: – yes, my – I always thought that she died, and that she perished in – in Treblinka, but she – from the Yad Vashem I got that she perished most likely in Belzec, one of the very first extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1309">But that must have come much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: At that point you probably didn’t know what happened to your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1314">So you went to Israel in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: I went to – in ’48, just after the creation.</span> <span id="s1316">I was in the Israeli Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Well, you also went at a very interesting time, and a very crucial time in Czechoslovakia’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Under communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: I did.</span> <span id="s1321">I we – I – I lived – I lived our – certainly our Jewish history –</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: – you know, from the Holocaust to the – almost the creation of Israel.</span> <span id="s1324">And – and when I was teaching, I was teaching here in the Jewish day school, and we went on a seminar and then we had to write our diaries.</span> <span id="s1325">And I couldn't read, you know, and they were all strangers, I couldn’t tell them about – but one time we had to write our stepping stone of our lives.</span> <span id="s1326">And when I was – I said that’s that I can do.</span> <span id="s1327">So, I – I was telling them I was born in Czechoslovakia, I stayed there until the age of 10, and then I – and we went to Poland, and then to the ghetto, and then to my first labor camp, then concentration camp, and this much, and Israel.</span> <span id="s1328">And there was such silence, because nobody had this kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: History.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: – life as I. And after this, a young woman comes to me and said, Edie, how does one want to survive, if there is no hope, if everything is so hopeless?</span> <span id="s1331">So I said, Sally, you want to talk?</span> <span id="s1332">She said yes.</span> <span id="s1333">So I said, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1334">We sat at a lake, and I said, you talk, you talk.</span> <span id="s1335">So she was telling me that she had – she m – she must have been 35 years at this time.</span> <span id="s1336">She s – she had a bad relationship with her parents.</span> <span id="s1337">She said she – she joined some Moonies and Roonies, you know.</span> <span id="s1338">She married somebody, had a horrible marriage.</span> <span id="s1339">She was raped, she tried to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1340">And here I was, looking, and I said, this is a nice American girl, you know, what happened to her?</span> <span id="s1341">So, after she finished telling me, I said, look Sally, I’ll talk to you as a mother of daughters close to your age, and also as your peer.</span> <span id="s1342">I said, would you have listened to your parents if they would have told you, don’t marry this guy, don’t join this group?</span> <span id="s1343">Would you have, honestly?</span> <span id="s1344">Search deep in your heart, would you have?</span> <span id="s1345">And then I said, and as one thing to survive, I said, you have to find the reason why – why you want to survive.</span> <span id="s1346">For me it was my father.</span> <span id="s1347">So, she lived in Ohio, and one day she came to give seminar on suicide, and the next time she came to the seminar on – on rape, or something, talked to young teenager.</span> <span id="s1348">And I invited her for dinner, and she said, Edith, I am making you a gift.</span> <span id="s1349">I said, why would she make gift?</span> <span id="s1350">Oh, I – my comb story was published and, you know, and my poems, my [indecipherable] of poems that I wrote were published.</span> <span id="s1351">So, I sent her, and she sent me booklet that she had on rape, and on the – she took my comb story and took it to an artisan in Ohio and said, I want you to read this story.</span> <span id="s1352">I want to pay you whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1353">I want to design, I want to do it myself, you just teach me how.</span> <span id="s1354">He read my comb story, he said, I’m not going to charge you, just come and do it.</span> <span id="s1355">She – she came and she – when she came the second time she gave me this little box.</span> <span id="s1356">When I opened it, I was overwhelmed; there was a comb.</span> <span id="s1357">And not like my father’s, but I was just very touched by it.</span> <span id="s1358">And she told me how for seven weeks, twice a week she went to this artisan and each afternoon she did it, and that’s how I – okay, okay, yeah, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: We will – okay, when we finish, then you can show us the comb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: – I took it out, because I was talking to some people, so I was showing it to them.</span> <span id="s1361">So she – she made it for me, and I framed it and it’s on my wall.</span> <span id="s1362">In the meantime, she died in a car accident, so it’s really very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1364">Tell me, how long did your father survive after the war?</span> <span id="s1365">Did he move to Israel, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: No, unfortu – you know, I never thought that I’ll separate from him ever again, but I went as a military and he couldn't come with me.</span> <span id="s1367">And he – his second wife became ill with cancer, breast cancer, during the time I left.</span> <span id="s1368">So we hoping she will get better, and I, you know, I even borrowed money in Israel and rented a tiny apartment and fixed it for them.</span> <span id="s1369">But she died two years later, and the communists were there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: And there was a hundred and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: – they didn't let him out.</span> <span id="s1372">So here we were separated again.</span> <span id="s1373">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1374">It was horrible for me.</span> <span id="s1375">And then, after – some times later he remarried again, and then, after five years of another happy marriage, she became ill with breast cancer, and she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Oh, he lost all three wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: That was it.</span> <span id="s1378">When my father went, and he would never know, he looked like – everybody said he looks like a diploma, that his life was always good – what he went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: How – when did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: He died at the age of 82.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: He died 26 years ago, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Oh, so it would have been in the 70s or 80s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: He –</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: The 1970s or the 1980s he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: He – he was 80 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: No, no, what – what year did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Oh, oh, yeah, a little bit [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: So, he died like 1980 - 1984?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: I think a little bit earlier [inaudible] yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: But you – did you see him again after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Oh yes, we visited him, we met his – I never met his third wife, but – but with his – he – he met – when his third wife died, we just moved in our little house, and we just were a short time here in America, we have no money, but we insisted he should come to visit.</span> <span id="s1393">And by then, the communists let him because what could they lose?</span> <span id="s1394">His pension they could keep, his house they could keep, you know, so – so they let him, but they let him come only for three months.</span> <span id="s1395">But if this – when this was over, I was heartbroken, I was sick, I said, now he will again go there and be home alone.</span> <span id="s1396">So we extended it six more months, but I was not in a better shape when he had to leave.</span> <span id="s1397">So we extended for another six months.</span> <span id="s1398">But when he came, George’s mother was here.</span> <span id="s1399">George is about half an hour by streetcar from where I used to be in the coal mining fr – community, and he is from Ostrava, from the city.</span> <span id="s1400">His parent was a law – his father was a lawyer in the city, and my father used to shop for our store in Ostrava, so they had many mutual acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1401">They didn’t know each other, but mutual acquaintance.</span> <span id="s1402">So, when his mother – his mother lived 18 years with us, but at this time she was only visiting.</span> <span id="s1403">So when she heard that my father will be coming, she was visiting, so she stayed longer to meet my father.</span> <span id="s1404">So we had them for about three weeks, I think, we had both of them here.</span> <span id="s1405">And – and they knew how hard it is for me to let him go.</span> <span id="s1406">So my cousin – my father was her favorite uncle from eight siblings he had – so my mother-in-law and my cousin paid a fare for him to come to Israel before he goes home to Czechoslovakia, so he would have something nice on his way.</span> <span id="s1407">And it was – he had a wonderful month in Israel, and then when he came home, three women were waiting for him.</span> <span id="s1408">But he didn’t – he married somebody else, whom he met visiting a sick friend.</span> <span id="s1409">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Well, is there anything else you’d want to add to what we’ve talked about today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: What I want to add, I know that most – most survivors have guilt feelings that they survived and their loved ha – ones didn’t.</span> <span id="s1412">I never felt that way, I never felt that way.</span> <span id="s1413">I always felt, I was a child and a young teenager.</span> <span id="s1414">I haven’t done anything wrong.</span> <span id="s1415">My parents were wonderful people, it’s not that I should have died, they should have lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1417">Exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s1418">By the age of 20 you had been through hell on earth, by the time you went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: And then, when I speak, you know, college students, high school students say, you must hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s1420">I said, how could I?</span> <span id="s1421">How?</span> <span id="s1422">I have seen what hate can do.</span> <span id="s1423">How could I be part of?</span> <span id="s1424">And forgive, I can forgive for myself, and I have done it.</span> <span id="s1425">I cannot forgive for – for the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Thank you Edith.</span> <span id="s1427">Thank you very much for sharing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: – your story today.</span> <span id="s1430">I know that it’s cost something, and – and we really, really appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Thank you for doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1433">This concludes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: You know, it’s not hard for me to tell what I went through, but it’s hard to talk about my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s1436">He was a child.</span> <span id="s1437">He was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: My mother … and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1440">I can’t imagine it, I can’t imagine it, what it must have felt to see his son there, what it is – must have felt to be afraid for you.</span> <span id="s1441">I can’t imagine it, even though I’m a parent myself, when you’re not in that situation, yeah, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Yeah, you know, it happened so long ago.</span> <span id="s1443">When I come here, and I entertain a lot, I have lots of friends, when I go to the Giant and I buy, or anywhere and [indecipherable] always the groceries, I think God, all I wanted was [indecipherable] of potatoes, or a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1444">All I wanted was just a little corner where I know that nobody will come and drag me.</span> <span id="s1445">You know, I have a nice apartment, I have a wonderful family, and I have – I’m free.</span> <span id="s1446">Oh, and when I – when I walk, when I take a walk, it still comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Did you have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: I went through different stages.</span> <span id="s1449">I had nightmares in the beginning, but it was mostly about bombing.</span> <span id="s1450">I went through terrible – terrific bombing in Leipzig, terrible, when I was afraid to be separated from my aunt.</span> <span id="s1451">And I saw my nightmares were mostly that everybody went to a bunker, and I was left all alone.</span> <span id="s1452">The bunker closed just before I reached, and then here I was in the world alone.</span> <span id="s1453">But my husband says that when we first got married, that I screamed at night.</span> <span id="s1454">Then I had a period that when I was in company, I – I was listening what people were saying, but I found myself that I’m somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1455">So it was a short period.</span> <span id="s1456">And then I had period, we have our best friends who moved with us, they’re upstairs.</span> <span id="s1457">We have been friends since the first week we came – came to America, which is over 15 years.</span> <span id="s1458">So when we – so when we – I had my next period was that we went to – to some wonderful restaurant and we are sitting with friends and I burst into tears, because here was just so good.</span> <span id="s1459">So I went through different periods, and then when we went, you know, sometimes when we are sitting somewhere in a – so we like to go to Alexandria, and, you know, for lunch, and sometimes I na – I get tears in my eyes, he says, again?</span> <span id="s1460">So – so I went through different stages, but I never felt that I needed therapies.</span> <span id="s1461">You know, I just tried to deal with it myself.</span> <span id="s1462">And I am very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1463">I loved what I was doing a-and – and we have many hobbies, and many interests both, fortunately, George and I.</span> <span id="s1464">We both started painting after we retired, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Are any of these paintings yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Yes, these are all mine over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: These, on this wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: On that wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: They’re beautiful.</span> <span id="s1474">Lovely colors.</span></p> <p><span

hours today, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Was it that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Yeah, close to it.</span> <span id="s1487">So, this concludes our interview with Edith Lowy, on
