<p><span id="s13">Q: Mrs. Gach, uh thank you for coming to visit with us this morning.</span> <span id="s14">We're going to be asking you uh to share with us some of your experiences as you recall them, and perhaps the best way to begin is to ask you to tell us your name and a little about your early life in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: OK.</span> <span id="s16">My name is Lilly Brust Gach.</span> <span id="s17">I was born in uh Hungary in Europe, Hungary, Budapest, and uh I had a brother who was younger than I myself, three years and uh we had a wonderful, happy family life and childhood.</span> <span id="s18">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s19">Well educated, if I may say so myself, both of us.</span> <span id="s20">Uh we had elementary school.</span> <span id="s21">Naturally we started with that.</span> <span id="s22">We don't have the kindergarten and what we have here, which is wonderful.</span> <span id="s23">From there we went to the high school.</span> <span id="s24">I was sent out to Vienna for my German, Switzerland to my...Swiss as to my French, and I was a happy-go-lucky girl.</span> <span id="s25">So was my brother.</span> <span id="s26">And uh we finished school.</span> <span id="s27">I got married very early, very happily, and uh then Eva was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Made us more happy, and since then she's my...my life.</span> <span id="s29">My husband passed away here in this country, 1957, January.</span> <span id="s30">It's a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s32">Let's go back then to the time when you were growing up in Budapest.</span> <span id="s33">You had mentioned that you had a happy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Tell us about the changes that you remember in the life of the Jewish community in Budapest at whatever time you can recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well uh, the Jewish...how should I say it...as a young girl I was going to the big holidays with my mother.</span> <span id="s37">I can sit next to her and I was very proud being there.</span> <span id="s38">So was my brother who was sitting downstairs uh with my father, my uncle, and many other family uh and friends whom we know, and I was really brought up in a very warm, Jewish family.</span> <span id="s39">I wasn't too religious, but all the holidays we were keeping and we got together with the family, mother's, father's, and this was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And when did you first realize there were changes in the experiences of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: That's a very good question, what you ask me.</span> <span id="s42">I realized the first time when I was in Vienna, Vienna, in the school , they call that.</span> <span id="s43">And uh I spoke fluently German because Austra-Hungarians we needed it...five hours only between Hungary and Vienna, so we we the language.</span> <span id="s44">And we were making discussions from Vienna, and I saw certain signs which in German naturally I could read...and in English it would say, no Jews and dogs are allowed.</span> <span id="s45">Certain restaurants or buildings.</span> <span id="s46">I was reading it.</span> <span id="s47">I was even asking my teacher.</span> <span id="s48">I said what does this mean?</span> <span id="s49">I don't like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Do you remember what year that was?</span> <span id="s51">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s52">Sure.</span> <span id="s53">It was in 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: 1937 I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: '27. '</span> <span id="s56">27.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: This is the first time that I went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s59">I was fifteen or sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s60">So she gave me a very interesting answer, and uh naturally whatever she said, it was fine.</span> <span id="s61">But I came back to Hungary and I told my parents.</span> <span id="s62">They said you couldn't read that.</span> <span id="s63">You you misunderstood.</span> <span id="s64">They didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s65">So I stopped asking because maybe I made a mistake.</span> <span id="s66">Even so I was reading fluently and these are two words which you cannot...I mean Jewish is Jewish...Juda...and dog is dog.</span> <span id="s67">.</span> <span id="s68">So this was...this was the first time, and it bothered me, but when, you know, young girl, going back to school and this was the end of it.</span> <span id="s69">Now then in Europe what's going on.</span> <span id="s70">Naturally in Germany, so the ...they always said it cannot happen to us.</span> <span id="s71">This was the motto.</span> <span id="s72">Then come closer.</span> <span id="s73">Hungary became...naturally was...we were allied with the Germans so nothing happened, but the minute...minute when uh we became part of the Allies, then we knew that we are Jews and there are enemies in our own country.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Let's go back then to the time the war actually began, in 1939 in Poland.</span> <span id="s75">How did it affect the Jewish community in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: In a way there was a feeling that something is wrong, but we didn't know what.</span> <span id="s77">Certain the Germans are our allies, so they didn't touch us, but you could feel there is something in the air.</span> <span id="s78">You couldn't explain it.</span> <span id="s79">I remember we went with my husband to France just for a trip and uh we had friends over there.</span> <span id="s80">They said, are you going back?</span> <span id="s81">So we said what a question?</span> <span id="s82">Said don't you see what's going on?</span> <span id="s83">So I said yes, I don't care.</span> <span id="s84">Eva is home.</span> <span id="s85">Naturally we're going back, and we did go back.</span> <span id="s86">In 1940 my husband was invited...invited to be in the in the labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s88">Let's talk about that.</span> <span id="s89">In 1940, things changed in Budapest.</span> <span id="s90">How would you characterize the change?</span> <span id="s91">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Well, first of all he went into the labor camp.</span> <span id="s93">Q: How did he go into the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: He got a notice that uh he should uh go on this and this address and have a little bag for himself, the necessities...underwear, jacket, something like that.</span> <span id="s95">Good shoes.</span> <span id="s96">And he will be notified where to go.</span> <span id="s97">When the paper comes, he should be ready, and then he will notify us where he is.</span> <span id="s98">We shouldn't worry, so I was worried.</span> <span id="s99">I don't have to tell you...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Do you remember who he got the paper from?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s102">Oh sure.</span> <span id="s103">Well, this was a paper from the Hungarian uh...what was that...uh ministerial (ph) that he is going in...some were called in for being soldiers.</span> <span id="s104">Then some were called in to the so-called labor camps.</span> <span id="s105">Each man that they were working on the highways.</span> <span id="s106">They went up to...they were taken up to the mountains.</span> <span id="s107">There was nothing for them, so they made their own ditches for uh important things and then they they got...uh they were putting up huts for them.</span> <span id="s108">They were put in a uh train which took them...in Hungary, we were still in Hungary...naturally I went out with him.</span> <span id="s109">And uh I was very upset.</span> <span id="s110">I I didn't know what's going on, so they're starting to read the letters or the telephone calls.</span> <span id="s111">I..</span> <span id="s112">.</span> <span id="s113">we didn't know what...what is labor...labor...labor camps mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s115">So then I started to work in uh his business and helping out and I was busy, and my daughter, naturally, and uh he wrote me a card.</span> <span id="s116">I showed you that I think.</span> <span id="s117">The first one and then the second one that uh he's alright.</span> <span id="s118">I shouldn't worry, and uh there are a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s119">He's very...not helpful because he is not uh a person who can work on the fields but anyway he's trying his best.</span> <span id="s120">The food is so...I should take care of Eva...all my love.</span> <span id="s121">Open card...this was all read by the people how I found out.</span> <span id="s122">Sometimes it was crossed...he said something not...not .</span> <span id="s123">Then I started to find out what that labor camp is, and uh I talked to some gentleman...I don't want to name...give his name because his family is here a very well-known name, but I will tell you later.</span> <span id="s124">And he loved my husband and I said well, listen.</span> <span id="s125">I would like to find out what we can do.</span> <span id="s126">So I said uh find out...uh I will find out and I let you know.</span> <span id="s127">Fine.</span> <span id="s128">He was...he was also Jewish.</span> <span id="s129">He was a highly regarded soldier from the 1st World War, so he was not a youngster, but he was very nice and I called him actually uncle.</span> <span id="s130">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s131">And uh so he found out that there is a doctor in my husband's uh labor camp, and he will talk to him.</span> <span id="s132">He will ask him to go to him and tell him how...what he fells, because he wasn't well, and so he got...he was going to the doctor and uh he gave him a paper that he is not well, and in two weeks he should come back, so he came home.</span> <span id="s133">So then...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So he was in a labor camp for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: He was there uh a few months.</span> <span id="s136">I can't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s137">It started to come to winter, so for two weeks he was home.</span> <span id="s138">He told me or less how it's going...very hard, and naturally the captain who was running the show...he was nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s139">I mean not qualified.</span> <span id="s140">He was...</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s142">What did he do when he came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: First of all, he wanted to look around what...what he can do and I went up to the American Consul and told him that story, that he cannot do it because he is...and I cannot, cannot, cannot.</span> <span id="s144">So I said oh, don't worry.</span> <span id="s145">It won't be too long, but you have your papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">You have your family.</span> <span id="s147">Uh and uh so after two weeks he had to go back, to a different place.</span> <span id="s148">101 .</span> <span id="s149">This was his name...or this number of that camp.</span> <span id="s150">So I went with him and there they had permission once in a while when they came down from the mountains, coming into a town, that I could go there without they should know.</span> <span id="s151">A lot of wives, naturally, found that we had each other, and he came down with a sergeant.</span> <span id="s152">Load for food and to carrying up food to the mountains and all that, but he knew that I will be in this place, so we met there.</span> <span id="s153">They were lovely people.</span> <span id="s154">I never met them.</span> <span id="s155">They opened their house for us that we could sit down.</span> <span id="s156">He can take a bath and you know, important.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What did he do in that labor camp?</span> <span id="s158">A: The...always the same.</span> <span id="s159">Always the... Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Which was they were working...excuse me...they were working on the fields.</span> <span id="s161">They were working there to set up uh uh houses...not houses.</span> <span id="s162">I mean there was huts...huts.</span> <span id="s163">It was...the winter came and they had no clothing.</span> <span id="s164">It was cold.</span> <span id="s165">There was nothing, so they...they were busy but with nothing.</span> <span id="s166">That's the honest truth.</span> <span id="s167">Just to keep them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And how long did he stay the second time?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: He was staying there for uh for half a year maybe or longer.</span> <span id="s170">Then there was a time that they changed places so he came back before they changed places uh spaces or places.</span> <span id="s171">But I could see him...physically first of all he lost a lot of weight but this was the least, but inside something broke.</span> <span id="s172">He was a very cultured, intelligent, warm gentleman, and this killed him inside.</span> <span id="s173">And I could feel...that's why I tried whatever I could but you know, I'm not a psychologist or anything, just plain wife.</span> <span id="s174">He got another invitation.</span> <span id="s175">In the meantime my parents came back again to this country.</span> <span id="s176">Leslie left.</span> <span id="s177">It was 1940.</span> <span id="s178">He was working to get out just from that country to this country, to my parents.</span> <span id="s179">Immediately he went in to volunteer...there was no war in that year, but he wanted to do that, and uh they said alright.</span> <span id="s180">We'll put you down and that's OK.</span> <span id="s181">I don't know where he went.</span> <span id="s182">I think he went to Camp Kilmer (ph) that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And you and your husband and your daughter...?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: My husband was in labor camp.</span> <span id="s185">The...naturally the Americans and the English were bombing us because we were enemies.</span> <span id="s186">Let me tell you honestly, I said thanks God...thank them all.</span> <span id="s187">I couldn't...I didn't think about it what happens to our building where we were living because we don't even own that.</span> <span id="s188">I didn't mind we die, hopefully all three in the same time, but this cannot go on.</span> <span id="s189">We had bombs...the houses are down.</span> <span id="s190">There was no food.</span> <span id="s191">You know, war but I see now it just comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And in 1941...</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: ...one...he came back again but that time it was bad.</span> <span id="s194">This was a , which means Jews, or a percentage.</span> <span id="s195">I was running still his business.</span> <span id="s196">It was...nothing happened to it, but it was very hard because I was a woman and I I wasn't a business woman but uh just used my little brain what I had and I kept...we had to pick up gentile people to keep the numerous clauses...let's say I could have x percent Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Then had to have at least eighty percent non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s198">We had a lot of non-Jewish people in the business because...with my husband, when he was a young man and they were excellent with us.</span> <span id="s199">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Did your husband have anything to do with the Jewish community during that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s202">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s203">Definitely yes.</span> <span id="s204">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: He was in the...in the...how do you do...what is the name of that uh...in the business section and uh uh helping out the community in collecting money for them, but he was not a collector.</span> <span id="s206">He was just taking like like in the government, you have a person who is running the show and then you tell them what to do, so he was the top man almost in that...in that...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Was it the community council that he was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s209">Yes.</span> <span id="s210">That's the name.</span> <span id="s211">Yeah.</span> <span id="s212">He was a community councilor.</span> <span id="s213">He was sitting up.</span> <span id="s214">He wasn't sitting in his regular seat, you know, there and my uncle, my father was not...he was sitting down.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: So he was involved in...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s217">Definitely.</span> <span id="s218">What to bring.</span> <span id="s219">What to take.</span> <span id="s220">What to send.</span> <span id="s221">What to buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Naturally, this is volunteer work.</span> <span id="s223">You don't get paid for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And what years was he doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: He was doing that for...even before he started to...let's say before 1939 because he didn't start with that.</span> <span id="s226">This was an honor and...for him...and he felt that he was honored with that, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So he continued to do that when he returned from the labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s229">Then he went back and we got a telephone call that...don't come back to the business because it's not yours anymore and we give it to another firm.</span> <span id="s230">Good.</span> <span id="s231">So he never went back.</span> <span id="s232">The bank account was closed.</span> <span id="s233">And this was it.</span> <span id="s234">We were still at our home, became a Jewish house because he worked it out because he was up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What does it mean...it became a Jewish house?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: It meant that uh gentile people who were living in the house, houses where we were living, if they want to they can go out and they can take other houses where the Jews will be taken out from their apartment and they can have better apartments or whatever, and these people will and all these people, not one couple left our building, and there was at least fifty-fifty.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Who established your house as a Jewish house?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: The Jewish .</span> <span id="s239">You had to ask for it.</span> <span id="s240">You had to have a reason because there are more Jews than gentiles for we should stay there.</span> <span id="s241">Now he was really there as a councilor and he said listen, we are fifty-four percent at least, and if you can do it, and I bring in in our apartment in every room some friends of ours...husband, wife, children, so according to that we had like six-room apartment here and they Ok'd it and the owner of the building Ok'd it, and so in every room we had a couple friends.</span> <span id="s242">I had an aunt and her husband and a son.</span> <span id="s243">He was sent to labor camp, shot in the with a child, and she was without.</span> <span id="s244">Then we had different friends.</span> <span id="s245">One is up in Toronto.</span> <span id="s246">Another one in ...</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: But during this period of time...?</span> <span id="s248">A: We were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: You lived in a safe house?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s251">We were living in a safe house, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And that was the term that you used for the Jewish house?</span> <span id="s253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">This is what we used.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And your husband during those periods of time when he was living with you in the Jewish house, maintained his contact with the...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: With the Jewish ...this was the only place he could go.</span> <span id="s257">There was nothing for him anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: During the time he was in the Jewish , did he have any occasion to visit with or meet with representatives of the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: You mean with the Hungarian government?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Uh I couldn't tell you that.</span> <span id="s262">I can't remember that really, because they were not important in a way.</span> <span id="s263">They didn't have any demands on on the Jewish except that we should pay more taxes because the had a....the Jewish has a certain tax.</span> <span id="s264">We we we paid that.</span> <span id="s265">But nothing.</span> <span id="s266">The first one was when the Germans came in which was in 1944.</span> <span id="s267">There was no more labor camp for him, and uh the minute when we became allies to the Allies, then naturally the Germans who were allies became enemies</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And how did that manifest itself?</span> <span id="s269">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Well, first of all, in our buildings were people, German-speaking people...one from Austria, a few from Germany...(cough-clearing throat) and we all spoke German and many other...a few other languages, and we got very friendly.</span> <span id="s271">They were younger people and they were out of their home, so they figured we invite them.</span> <span id="s272">They had beautiful libraries.</span> <span id="s273">Come over for a cup of coffee or some Hungarian cookies, you know, and they came over.</span> <span id="s274">When the Germans came over...took over, and I'm using the elevator, I see one of my favorite ones...he was the youngest.</span> <span id="s275">He was a Viennese and I knew Vienna very well.</span> <span id="s276">It was...I was there in school a long time ago then and uh he said, , what do I do now?</span> <span id="s277">I mean you...are you an enemy?</span> <span id="s278">I said I am never...I will be never an enemy and I am with you and whatever I can do, I'll do it.</span> <span id="s279">So this was a very good feeling and I didn't know...should I ask him to come in or shouldn't I?</span> <span id="s280">So I talked it over with my husband.</span> <span id="s281">I said...don't change.</span> <span id="s282">As what he said, you take his words.</span> <span id="s283">If he wants to, he comes in anyway, so don't say no, and he was right, so he came in and we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">One night around two-thirty...in the...it morning...sorry...somebody knocks our door, and .</span> <span id="s285">This was the time when the Germans collected the people...two thirty in the morning.</span> <span id="s286">Nobody...everybody was sleeping so they could do that.</span> <span id="s287">He comes in.</span> <span id="s288">We we we were frightened, really very frightened, and he says listen...he was working for the Germans in the short-wave radio which means that he heard everything what came into Hungary and he was sending it over to Germany.</span> <span id="s289">He said I just heard that the Swedish king is giving a so-called schutzpass (ph)...papers who can prove that they were working with with Sweden or they have families in Sweden...they will tell you if you have anything like that.</span> <span id="s290">I know that your husband is bringing in paper from Sweden, rolls with , and uh because we were importers, so please, this what I heard.</span> <span id="s291">Ask him to go up to the...one of the...on the Buda (ph) side, which are the side, go over there.</span> <span id="s292">Tell you heard that...you can mention even my name...it's official...and tell them what you know, what you have, business.</span> <span id="s293">They will check it and then you can have a Swedish uh paper that you are a Swedish...Swedish uh subject.</span> <span id="s294">Well, we couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s295">My husband the next...this was early morning...two o'clock.</span> <span id="s296">At nine o'clock he was up there.</span> <span id="s297">He crossed the Danube on the on the bridge and he found it and he told his name and he was telling the name of the factories what he was repre...representing and bringing a lot of lot of papers and uh with the papers were boxes, papers for for... for using package, newspapers...you know, the big rolls...so it was quite an ordeal, and they checked it.</span> <span id="s298">Naturally no time did they know the factory.</span> <span id="s299">They called it and they said oh yes, he's one of our biggest but we don't hear from them.</span> <span id="s300">Whatever you can say...I know Mr. Brust very well, or Herr Brust possibly and uh so he got...we were .</span> <span id="s301">I think we were the number...it's on the schutzpass what I brought to you...the number thirty-four, thirty-five...very...in the beginning, which meant we are Swedish subjects.</span> <span id="s302">We do not have to wear the stars, the Jewish stars which was recommend.</span> <span id="s303">It had to be done, which killed me morally because to be...you know, I can sit on the...and I cannot sit in the normal seat, let's say take a bus or sub...or a streetcar.</span> <span id="s304">I had to sit in the back.</span> <span id="s305">I could...you know, this was something which which...it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s306">So we got that and</span></p> <p><span id="s307">was an angel.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: How did that change your life, having the schutzpass?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, I felt uh a little bit easier, but I was ashamed and sad and very sad.</span> <span id="s310">First of all, I have a daughter and I had a husband.</span> <span id="s311">After I saw him what's going on with him and what happens to her.</span> <span id="s312">I mean this is...I give her birth.</span> <span id="s313">I mean we give her birth, so after all my husband has...my brother went out and I got letters from Zurich that I had relatives through my mother's side (coughing-clearing throat).</span> <span id="s314">My mother had wrote that Leslie's fine and he's wearing with big honor the...his new country's uniform because he became a a soldier and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: But you in the time that you're describing now, when you had the schutzpass, you had been living in Budapest...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: ...and your husband was not working.</span> <span id="s318">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: How did you support yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s321">I don't know.</span> <span id="s322">We started to...until we had money touched...that we could touch our money, we bought food and we filled up our pantry but uh there was time that we had once a day food and Eva was a poor eater anyway.</span> <span id="s323">Now that she didn't have that much money and that that that food what she liked, so she started to eat less and this broke my heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: So up until 1944, life was not too difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No, but uh you couldn't...uh there were restrictions.</span> <span id="s326">You couldn't do this.</span> <span id="s327">At five o'clock you had to be home and uh the family who came living with us and the gentiles were really nice.</span> <span id="s328">No problem, and they helped us.</span> <span id="s329">They brought us food and they said don't worry.</span> <span id="s330">We will survive and then you'll give us back whatever we spent on you, or we give something for them, you know, whatever we had in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s332">So we've now established that through a period of time there were difficulties, but it wasn't all that difficult for you.</span> <span id="s333">When did it become actually a serious...?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: We became...yes...when we were told that we should move in from that Jewish house uh to the Swedish house, because they cannot...the Germans won't respect our Jewish house and they will just...we we saw it.</span> <span id="s335">I mean they collected people on the street.</span> <span id="s336">They came in in the houses and uh in the morning, two, three o'clock.</span> <span id="s337">Uh in the meantime, the big war, the Germans went all over Europe.</span> <span id="s338">It started in Holland, in Belgium, always in the early morning and we heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What did you hear...that people were being collected?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: First of all we didn't have a radio.</span> <span id="s341">We were not allowed to have a radio, so the big one...we had a big, old-fashioned radio...there was no television at that time...they took it away, but my husband had a small one, and we put it in his drawer, and he opened Churchill...German...I mean England.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What was it that you were hearing that was happening to the Jewish people who were being taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, everything what what went on... Q: Which was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: First of all in Austria, they collected the people.</span> <span id="s345">They went...they were taken to certain uh...even in my family.</span> <span id="s346">They were picked up and disappeared, and we didn't know.</span> <span id="s347">A cousin of mine who is here in this country...he's quite a young man...he's not a young man anymore...he and his mother were taken.</span> <span id="s348">Then we got a card, a postcard, some kind of...what is that...uh sea...not sea...uh uh what is that...it is like a uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: The specific place isn't important.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No.</span> <span id="s351">Anyway, he got a card...we got a card that he is .</span> <span id="s352">Q: yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: is a little...uh it's not an ocean.</span> <span id="s354">It's like a..</span> <span id="s355">.</span> <span id="s356">Q: It's a sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No, it's not a sea.</span> <span id="s358">It's it's a standing water.</span> <span id="s359">And you can swim in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: It's a lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: It's a lake.</span> <span id="s362">I should know that.</span> <span id="s363">That was...I'm going absolutely... Q: The question that I was asking was in reference...?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: My husband was always in the Jewish .</span> <span id="s365">I showed him, look here what what what we got from Steven.</span> <span id="s366">So he said I just wanted to let you know.</span> <span id="s367">You know what that is...this is Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s368">I said what is that.</span> <span id="s369">And he got the notice from the...in the meantime is that Wallenburg showed up.</span> <span id="s370">Of course, he was an angel sent from God.</span> <span id="s371">I met him twice when I was going for my husband.</span> <span id="s372">I didn't want him to go alone on the street, and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Before we get to Mr. Wallenburg, I'd like to go back to that point about the Germans were collecting people...</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Collecting people from their home.</span> <span id="s375">They take them out.</span> <span id="s376">They had a big truck down on the street.</span> <span id="s377">They were pushed in in the car.</span> <span id="s378">They never knew then where they're going, how long do they...will they be away, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: But you did get some indication that some...</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: We thought they are disappearing.</span> <span id="s381">In the meantime we heard the BBC, late evening, you know, quietly.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Saying...?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: And then Mr. Churchill and the English uh tele...uh radio told us what's going on in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: They told us there is an Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s386">There is a Mauthaussen.</span> <span id="s387">There is a Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">We had never heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: And what did they tell you was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: That this is a collection where the Hungarian people or wherever they are from Europe, they are put...they are put in a in a train without food.</span> <span id="s391">Everything is taken away from them before and then the left-over when they arrive and uh they are put in in ovens.</span> <span id="s392">So I said well, the English, I love them but uh they are crazy.</span> <span id="s393">How can they say that?</span> <span id="s394">I mean this is...it's impossible.</span> <span id="s395">You know, everybody said that because you don't believe that.</span> <span id="s396">So then Steven's first card came from and my husband says, you know what this is?</span> <span id="s397">This is Auschwitz so I want to tell to my friends in the...with whom we are living still in our old house, in our old apartment, and we told...he told them.</span> <span id="s398">He was almost killed by our friends.</span> <span id="s399">They said you are crazy.</span> <span id="s400">You're picking up this news...this is...there is no such thing.</span> <span id="s401">And even so, if you hear it, tell it to Lilly, to your wife.</span> <span id="s402">Don't tell us because we don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: And that was...that was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Don't ever say that.</span> <span id="s405">Just tell me.</span> <span id="s406">I want to know every word you want to say.</span> <span id="s407">Because I didn't want him to hold back.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s409">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Then we went over to the Swedish house.</span> <span id="s411">Q: And what was it like in the Swedish house?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: This is a very beautiful house, four or five floors and uh we had the paper from the Swedish king that we are...we can stay there.</span> <span id="s413">We went in, early morning.</span> <span id="s414">Kitchen was full with mattresses.</span> <span id="s415">Everything was mattresses.</span> <span id="s416">So I said, you know...I was frightened and my husband says, you know, I don't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s417">So Eva said I am tired.</span> <span id="s418">I want to stay there.</span> <span id="s419">I sit down.</span> <span id="s420">She has this doll and uh a tack board (ph), .</span> <span id="s421">So I said leave it there sweetheart, and we will...doll here or a book and take the doll...now I remember well...and we will be back.</span> <span id="s422">We disa...we went out.</span> <span id="s423">They said don't forget you have to be back until five.</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">We never came back, because we decided but this is a collection for only Jews.</span> <span id="s426">The Germans was eating up Europe.</span> <span id="s427">Why should they stop in Hungary?</span> <span id="s428">There is no reason.</span> <span id="s429">They are in and they own us, so when they know...let's say the end...there is an end.</span> <span id="s430">They will still finish up the people in a collected house.</span> <span id="s431">He was absolutely right.</span> <span id="s432">I was upset because I couldn't believe that this can be.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: We figured out that we are going in one of our own buildings in which we gave the the...an apartment as a superintendent to one of my husband's workers.</span> <span id="s435">He was with him for...he was a young man, still my husband, when he was working in the business there.</span> <span id="s436">He was paper importer.</span> <span id="s437">He was quite a nice man.</span> <span id="s438">I knew his wife.</span> <span id="s439">I knew his son and we gave him that apartment.</span> <span id="s440">I don't know why that he should be our super in a no-charge apartment.</span> <span id="s441">It was a heated apartment.</span> <span id="s442">This was brand new.</span> <span id="s443">I mean, very modern.</span> <span id="s444">We didn't have too many like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: You had mentioned a moment ago that you met Mr. Wallenburg.</span> <span id="s446">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s447">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Was it at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Uh Wallenburg was...I met him before we went to hiding.</span> <span id="s450">I was still a Jewish passport and I tell you how I met him.</span> <span id="s451">I picked up my husband and there was a big conference, and he was uh...my husband and the Jewish , the people, the President whom I knew very well there, Mr. Stern (ph), uh they had a big...and my husband said sit in in the back and just listen.</span> <span id="s452">You know that man?</span> <span id="s453">I said yes, I heard him but I never met, so he introduces...a very tiny looking, blue-eyed, blondish skinny man.</span> <span id="s454">If you would see him on the street, you wouldn't say oh my God, I have to look back, you know, because he's nothing.</span> <span id="s455">Very simple.</span> <span id="s456">And I listened.</span> <span id="s457">He spoke uh German and uh naturally and uh I listened and he said listen...I know, you have to tell me what you can do for the Germans, and you have to tell me what the Germans are telling me, telling you.</span> <span id="s458">Let's say they are collecting uh uh this part of the cou...of of the city or this part and I will be there and I try to stop the train that it shouldn't go, and and then he repeated it, so this was...this was something you can believe it.</span> <span id="s459">We still didn't believe it that this can be but he he said you also have it.</span> <span id="s460">So we gave him...every morning almost he was in.</span> <span id="s461">When he...when they...he knew that the train comes and picks up the people, he was there, early morning, late evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: First of all, he gave...uh he had papers.</span> <span id="s464">He said he's coming with me.</span> <span id="s465">I know...I need him.</span> <span id="s466">He is...he's Swedish.</span> <span id="s467">He's French.</span> <span id="s468">You name it...stories.</span> <span id="s469">These were very simple Germans there.</span> <span id="s470">Naturally, I'm not talking because they were killers, and a lot of people were saved through him.</span> <span id="s471">He actually...happened that he stopped a a train...complete...one train.</span> <span id="s472">Not...I don't know how many, but just one part of the train.</span> <span id="s473">There were women, children and elderly or sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Where did they go once the train was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: He was sending...he...I can't tell you that.</span> <span id="s476">That's the honest truth.</span> <span id="s477">I don't know where they went, but wherever they went, the old came mostly who didn't die the natural death, came back.</span> <span id="s478">He was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: During the time that you described your meetings with Mr. Wallenburg and his activities...</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes, twice I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: ...were there any senior German officials with whom you or your husband had occasion to meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s483">Mr. Eichmann.</span> <span id="s484">Q: Mr. Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Eichmann.</span> <span id="s486">He is the nightmare.</span> <span id="s487">He came in, very handsome looking, funny face...you know, something which is...which , very elegantly dressed, boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: You say he came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: He came into the Jewish .</span> <span id="s490">He said I am so and this is my name or his title...I don't remember what he was...and I am talking for my government.</span> <span id="s491">Now we are...we were allies and now we are enemies but we are still allies and when you want to uh have your...have your...the the freedom a few Jewish people, and I will have request for you, and if you can give it to me, I will take a few out and they can stay or we're going to send them...they don't go too far.</span> <span id="s492">We put them in the train, nice story.</span> <span id="s493">They will work.</span> <span id="s494">They will help us out in the factories here, factories there and that's all.</span> <span id="s495">Now we knew this wasn't true because we heard the BBC.</span> <span id="s496">This was our...this was the bible because we knew the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: So Eichmann was telling you the story...?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Eichmann did that, so he came in and he said I need now I don't know how many beds.</span> <span id="s499">Get them.</span> <span id="s500">Said we don't have beds.</span> <span id="s501">You have hospitals, Jewish hospitals, this hospital.</span> <span id="s502">I send my men and we just tell them they should give it to them, so then he he got that.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">What do we get for that, we were asking, not to him but the...I mean , so he said well uh...he said a number, so we started to bargain.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: A number of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Of the people who...for the beds or for linen or for sewing machines or medications or doctor's help, then you get...they wouldn't take x Jewish people...hundred, fifty, twenty.</span> <span id="s506">But it didn't matter because we give everything for for lifes, so they just...but sometimes he was very strong.</span> <span id="s507">I mean I want to have it done and then and then, and uh he got it.</span> <span id="s508">I don't know how they did that, I mean this...my my my people, how they did that, but they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: How many times did you have occasion to meet with Mr. Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Mr. Eichmann I saw a few times.</span> <span id="s511">Once I almost met him directly.</span> <span id="s512">That's a very funny thing.</span> <span id="s513">My husband was going down...it was still...he could go in to pick up to his business.</span> <span id="s514">No subway...no no...with a with a subway.</span> <span id="s515">There was a small subway we had but no streetcar, no buses.</span> <span id="s516">And uh his uh secretary with whom he met there to see what's going on called me around nine o'clock.</span> <span id="s517">We had still telephone but in secrecy because we didn't...we were not allowed to have, so it was everything in a drawer, so I called him and I said John, in Hungarian, uh where is Mr. Brust?</span> <span id="s518">No.</span> <span id="s519">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s520">He called me and he says where is Mr. Brust, so he...I said what do you mean?</span> <span id="s521">He left at least three- quarters of hour.</span> <span id="s522">Even if he walked, he should be there in twenty...fifteen, twenty minutes.</span> <span id="s523">He said no, he's not in.</span> <span id="s524">So he said we are...I'm going down now and I'm going and I want to find out what happened.</span> <span id="s525">As I'm going down...a lot of people walking and as I'm walking, a man and a..</span> <span id="s526">.</span> <span id="s527">was a man and later a woman, as they are coming opposite me, they are talking to me.</span> <span id="s528">They don't...we don't know each other.</span> <span id="s529">They said don't go too far because they are picking up men and women, the Germans.</span> <span id="s530">And they just walked by.</span> <span id="s531">This was like a message, so I know what could happen...could have happened, so I went further, and I saw that there is a big commotion.</span> <span id="s532">I didn't go further because I didn't want to be picked up.</span> <span id="s533">I have a daughter and I don't have if I will be picked up.</span> <span id="s534">I went up to the Jewish , to the president whom I knew very well, and I said listen, I just found out...do you know anything about it?</span> <span id="s535">Well, you know, every corner they do that now.</span> <span id="s536">So he said I'm not interested in that.</span> <span id="s537">See, I am just looking now in one corner and this is my husband.</span> <span id="s538">He gave you a lot of help and I have one help.</span> <span id="s539">I want to know where he is, and you call up Mr. Eichmann...you know the Germans...and you tell him that he is one of your people here who are helping him and his wife is here...you can that, and I want to have him back.</span> <span id="s540">I can't do that.</span> <span id="s541">I can't call Eichmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">You know, this...this was...he's the himself, so I said I am not leaving.</span> <span id="s543">I sleep here until you don't get...I don't care...Eichmann...whoever.</span> <span id="s544">Call up the German who give the order because there...every corner had a..</span> <span id="s545">.</span> <span id="s546">so he saw that I am very stubborn, which I was.</span> <span id="s547">Usually I'm not.</span> <span id="s548">Maybe I am.</span> <span id="s549">I don't know, and he called up the Germans and he found out that a lot of men, mostly men, a few women but mostly men, were picked up who were healthy looking, put in in a car...in a trunk...a truck, truck...and uh was taken up to clear and clean some house on the bigger side where we have villas, private homes, not uh building...apartment buildings, and this what they do, so he said find out where.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">I said I'm not inter...don't tell me stories.</span> <span id="s551">Just call and find out where.</span> <span id="s552">If not, call Eichmann.</span> <span id="s553">I'm not going...he is coming to there.</span> <span id="s554">I know that this was the day when he usually came in for asking and I will stand there.</span> <span id="s555">Maybe he shoots me.</span> <span id="s556">I don 't care.</span> <span id="s557">But I want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s558">So...excuse me...so he saw again that, you know, there is no end to have me there so he figured he better...this meantime he walked in, just miracle again, and the president, he went in ...order order is what he said, so the president said, well there is a lady whose husband you met a few times and he was helping me.</span> <span id="s559">She just found out that he was picked up and was sent up to the mountain with many other men in a covered truck to clean some buildings.</span> <span id="s560">She's asking you, and there he was, uh could you send a message or something that he should be taken out from the whatever he does there, cleaning, because he's more important here than cleaning a house and he's not so good maybe in that.</span> <span id="s561">very funny face and said he will learn it, but he didn't say that and he...very elegantly he looked at me and said uh in German, , which means like madame or whatever, and he said, I try my utmost.</span> <span id="s562">Hold on.</span> <span id="s563">Like a perfect gentleman.</span> <span id="s564">He went away.</span> <span id="s565">He came back in a few minutes and he said don't worry.</span> <span id="s566">I know where he...where these people were taken to different houses but I know where he is...he gives the name...and I am sending up a car and we'll pick...will be picked up a few people included your husband.</span> <span id="s567">He didn't want to make one...this was very cleaver of him, and he will come home.</span> <span id="s568">So I said to him, can I take your word...you know, smilingly.</span> <span id="s569">I didn't insult him.</span> <span id="s570">So he said, like a German officer, he said.</span> <span id="s571">Then I said I believe.</span> <span id="s572">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">And there I was walking on the from there.</span> <span id="s574">Came back and started...I was calling immediately our...his secretary...I mean my husband's secretary, John.</span> <span id="s575">He is coming back.</span> <span id="s576">You walk on this side on the avenue and I'm walking this side.</span> <span id="s577">If he be in a truck, or alone, and he found him on the other side and they scream to me, call me, and when I saw him I said what happened.</span> <span id="s578">This what happened.</span> <span id="s579">They picked him up.</span> <span id="s580">What happened to the other part.</span> <span id="s581">They were sent...not all...a few came down.</span> <span id="s582">He said I was picked up...he had no idea what was going on, but I was up there.</span> <span id="s583">I didn't...I wouldn't dare to tell him that, and I never did, and I said well, I just talked to the president after all and I told him that I would like to have you back because you are needed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: And once he got back...</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: He went immediately back to the to the and said I am back.</span> <span id="s586">Thank you for asking for me and what can I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: He was , you know, .</span> <span id="s589">Then but this I didn't see.</span> <span id="s590">with his orders and they were working together and get this and that and that.</span> <span id="s591">I think the biggest item was for them...I don't even know why...sewing machines, because they were sewing uh clothes and what not.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: And how long did this relationship with Eichmann go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Until uh the Russians started to come from the north.</span> <span id="s594">They was our allies because they were allies to the States, and then they closed up the houses.</span> <span id="s595">Everything was...we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s596">We were...this was before.</span> <span id="s597">We were still in our house.</span> <span id="s598">Then we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s599">We went to the Swedish house.</span> <span id="s600">We were in hiding to our house.</span> <span id="s601">That came again a miracle.</span> <span id="s602">My little daughter, Eva was up with the super.</span> <span id="s603">She didn't look like a little girl from the country.</span> <span id="s604">She looked like a city girl, gray suit with long hair, and there was coming in a woman from the building...a lovely looking...I never met her before, and she asked...this I know from our super...asked uh who's that little girl?</span> <span id="s605">What a nice little girl.</span> <span id="s606">My daughter got up immediately when she talked to her, and uh she said oh this is my sister's daughter, my son's nephew...my sister's daughter...she's my my uh...niece, and just for a short time and she goes back to the country.</span> <span id="s607">When she says to...she told me the story and uh the janitor, the super...I I I didn't believe what I heard.</span> <span id="s608">She made a funny face and then she said listen.</span> <span id="s609">She was a gentile woman.</span> <span id="s610">She lived in our building.</span> <span id="s611">She said I am going up to the mountains for uh skiing.</span> <span id="s612">I give you my keys for my apartment.</span> <span id="s613">This was very unusual because we then...we did not have keys.</span> <span id="s614">We didn't give keys to the super.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Here I do, because this is the way they have it, but uh there we didn't.</span> <span id="s616">We said there was always somebody at our apartment, most of the time, and she said if you want to you can use it or you want to put something in or take out something, I will be out there.</span> <span id="s617">Her husband was a Jewish man who had a white...not yellow star...a white band, because he was half...married to a gentile so this gave him...he wasn't taken out from the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">This was the story.</span> <span id="s619">I never met him.</span> <span id="s620">I never her.</span> <span id="s621">So they left.</span> <span id="s622">Joseph comes in, down to the basement and says you know, we are going up...around five o'clock I'm going up to the .</span> <span id="s623">down into the basement.</span> <span id="s624">It was horrible down there.</span> <span id="s625">It was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: In what way was it horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: First of all, it was cold.</span> <span id="s628">You had a tank for the heating system which did not work because they didn't put the heat on.</span> <span id="s629">We were...we heard the Germans...the the planes.</span> <span id="s630">We heard the Russians.</span> <span id="s631">We heard boots.</span> <span id="s632">We heard the war on the street.</span> <span id="s633">We...people came in the building, Russians or the Germans.</span> <span id="s634">They were...any Jews here?</span> <span id="s635">They said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Nobody.</span> <span id="s637">So we will go around and see.</span> <span id="s638">Well, you know, to sit down in the basement and waiting for them to come down, so Joseph said can I get you...this was...I never forget that...can I get you a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s639">It's not too good but luckily our teapot...whatever we had then.</span> <span id="s640">And they were so cold the Russians, so they sat down and they said thank you and uh I picked up naturally a few Russian words then and almost talked, not at that time but after, and they left so then Joseph came down and said I take you up to an apartment.</span> <span id="s641">You don't move.</span> <span id="s642">I bring you food, and I gave him my keys and I said you go over to my old apartment.</span> <span id="s643">Whatever there you can carry, bring it over to your kitchen and from there give us a little fruit...food.</span> <span id="s644">Your wife, you cook whatever and Eva should get some hot food.</span> <span id="s645">So this what happened.</span> <span id="s646">He went up to this apartment, to this woman's apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Now I..</span> <span id="s648">.</span> <span id="s649">we were...we stayed there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s650">I tell Joseph, Joseph put a little heat on.</span> <span id="s651">Everybody who is in the building should have heat, but it's not allowed.</span> <span id="s652">Don't worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Nobody will ask you that why do we have heat.</span> <span id="s654">They will be happy.</span> <span id="s655">They will give you a tip for that.</span> <span id="s656">I was right, so at least we didn't...we were in an apartment.</span> <span id="s657">This was a one bedroom apartment, one...living room, bedroom...or two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s658">The child had a bedroom and Eva was there.</span> <span id="s659">We had linens.</span> <span id="s660">It was clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: And the war was going on around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: And the war was absolutely going on.</span> <span id="s663">We were bombing day and night.</span> <span id="s664">Q: And how long did that last?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Oh this went on till the war was finished.</span> <span id="s666">Q: A period of...</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Russia came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: A period of time of...?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: And when we saw the first Russian...when we...we left this apartment after two weeks because uh the war, it it came in and uh we had a..</span> <span id="s670">.</span> <span id="s671">my hus...my...wait a minute, how was that?</span> <span id="s672">Oh, I know.</span> <span id="s673">Then we left and we called a friend.</span> <span id="s674">They lived there very close by.</span> <span id="s675">He was an officer in the Hungarian army, a gentile person.</span> <span id="s676">He was working in my father's business.</span> <span id="s677">I saw him...I showed you maybe the picture.</span> <span id="s678">He was a watch importer from Switzerland, and actually I didn't even call him.</span> <span id="s679">He found out...he came in the building, found...finding us, trying to find us.</span> <span id="s680">Not he but she, the wife of his, lovely, tall, good- looking woman asked Joseph where are they.</span> <span id="s681">So he said I want to talk to .</span> <span id="s682">I have an apart...uh a home up on the mountains, which is a beautiful .</span> <span id="s683">We had there too but we didn't talk about it, and this was given by a Jewish family that we should take care of it, and this is empty.</span> <span id="s684">We are going up there.</span> <span id="s685">We don't want to stay in the city.</span> <span id="s686">I want to have these three people, so we went up to that apartment.</span> <span id="s687">Finally, the husband, who was an officer of the Hungarian army, was in Russia, was all over the German army because we were allies.</span> <span id="s688">He came home without permission.</span> <span id="s689">He was afraid.</span> <span id="s690">The Germans...he was not the Germans anymore, with the Germans because they became enemies.</span> <span id="s691">He was with the Russians, but he was in Russia with the Germans, so this was a very unpleasant feeling for him, and he was afraid so he left the army.</span> <span id="s692">He took...they took off his army stuff except a beautiful jacket which he picked up in Germany...in Russia, with uh fur...fur-lined, and he came up and so we got in to this apart...to this beautiful house.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">There was another officer, .</span> <span id="s694">He...when the Russians came ...first time I saw a Russian soldier in the other house , I was looking out in the...on the window and I said this is Russian.</span> <span id="s695">I saw the uniform, cap, so I went down.</span> <span id="s696">I was stepping on a on a high chair then because I was peeking really, and I said I don't want to tell you.</span> <span id="s697">They're going to frighten you, but the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s698">He said what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s699">So my husband .</span> <span id="s700">This was too, a very nice looking man, and the wife and the wife's mother, and they had a child which remain still in correspondence, in Hungary.</span> <span id="s701">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And when they saw the Russian soldier...?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Well, they were happy, except him and uh well, I wasn't sure if I'm happy or not because I didn't...first of all, I knew that they are with the Americans so they cannot be that bad.</span> <span id="s704">On the contrary, they are allies, but I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s705">So they came from house to house and they came into our house.</span> <span id="s706">The first one was , which means give me your watch.</span> <span id="s707">And this was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s708">Your not stealing from my hand.</span> <span id="s709">So my husband said in Hungarian, give it to him.</span> <span id="s710">After I gave it to him, he gave it back to me.</span> <span id="s711">He had at least ten watches on his arm.</span> <span id="s712">I'm not joking.</span> <span id="s713">He said where are the children?</span> <span id="s714">So our friends who owned...that owned what he was taking care of the house, he had a son, my daughter, and there was another unpleasant child which she never met before, and they were the owner's son.</span> <span id="s715">He was there with a little house in the back, and they were hidden there.</span> <span id="s716">So so we were very...then cames out with his beautiful fur-lined coat.</span> <span id="s717">When that Russian sees that...he was not a tall man, the Hungarian fellow...he picked him up like that and where did you get that coat?</span> <span id="s718">This is a Russian...he spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s719">He said I got it...I was in Russia as an officer...or as a prisoner.</span> <span id="s720">It wasn't true but he was stealing it from the Russian which was...they steal from him.</span> <span id="s721">They were stealing from him, so he was stealing back and he was cold.</span> <span id="s722">He didn't believe that and then...but he put him down and he said keep your coat, but we are here now and you will help us speaking Hungarian and Russian, so he was like, you know, helping out, translating.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And is that how the war ended for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Well, not yet.</span> <span id="s725">Oh no.</span> <span id="s726">This Russians...they were not bad.</span> <span id="s727">They were horrible looking with newspapers packed...uh their shoes.</span> <span id="s728">There were no shoes.</span> <span id="s729">They were using cigarettes and newspapers, picking up uh leaves, you never saw anything like that.</span> <span id="s730">They picked us up.</span> <span id="s731">This Russian commander went...he became our friend.</span> <span id="s732">He brought some bread, but he was stealing that he was bring here.</span> <span id="s733">This was always...this was fine.</span> <span id="s734">A big Russian...it was late evening...he comes in to the...the Germans are coming back.</span> <span id="s735">We take you down.</span> <span id="s736">We belong to them.</span> <span id="s737">And we didn't mind.</span> <span id="s738">To get Russian is better than the Germans.</span> <span id="s739">I don't know why but this...this was normal feeling and uh we were all transferred.</span> <span id="s740">There was a lot of people again and we got in a truck.</span> <span id="s741">We went down...I never was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Down to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Down... ...we went down and we went out of Budapest which is let's say if I would come, get out from New York City from Manhattan and I'm getting over to White Plains and then going up near near New York State...</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: A suburb of Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: It it was not a suburb.</span> <span id="s746">It was a..</span> <span id="s747">.</span> <span id="s748">it was a completely different little town, a village which the Russians took over from the Germans and there were bodies...German bodies.</span> <span id="s749">that we had to get out from the trunk, from the truck and uh we were lined up.</span> <span id="s750">I said to my husband, Eva stays with...before me because if they shoot me I want she should be shot too, and then next you.</span> <span id="s751">I didn't want to leave the child alone.</span> <span id="s752">And we were ready for that, and then one of the Russians came in and said what are you doing?</span> <span id="s753">I brought them down.</span> <span id="s754">They are our people, so they went back.</span> <span id="s755">They didn't shoot us.</span> <span id="s756">They were ...was starting to get dark, and we were still walking.</span> <span id="s757">Eva was before me.</span> <span id="s758">She was...I want to go back.</span> <span id="s759">I want to slow down.</span> <span id="s760">I didn't let her...permit her to go...permit to go in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Figured I'd loose her like that.</span> <span id="s762">She's always before me, so and a man comes out.</span> <span id="s763">From far away , physically .</span> <span id="s764">This is...where are you going?</span> <span id="s765">So we said we want to go to sleep somewhere.</span> <span id="s766">Where are you from?</span> <span id="s767">So we said we are from the country.</span> <span id="s768">What is your name?</span> <span id="s769">We changed the Brust to Bollage (ph) which in Europe it's very...like here sometimes you can change it a Polish name or German name to make it American sounding, so Bollage is a very good name and a lot of families, a lot of people in our families changed it.</span> <span id="s770">It sounded beautiful.</span> <span id="s771">I always said, don't you want to...I want to be Brust.</span> <span id="s772">So I said fine, and we are Brust , so I told my name that we are that.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">You come with us, and some other people with whom we met there, so we went there, and he had a little house and he had a basement for I don't know what, maybe washing or...we didn't have washing machines...and he gave us that and he gave...uh there was a mattress, two mattresses, and there was a..</span> <span id="s774">.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">PAUSE - BLANK IN TAPE</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: ...Russians liberated Budapest and if you could tell us how the end of the war appeared to you and what you did with your husband and your daughter at that point in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s778">So when the Russians started out during the war that they were liberating us, and we were really lucky because when they went down to the village, there were Russians coming and going through the village.</span> <span id="s779">They...sometimes they came in in the houses and uh brought some food or...and that we should do it food and we should do it, and I wasn't a good cook and my husband had no idea what what cooking is, but there were others, so we helped.</span> <span id="s780">And then what they didn't use, they didn't eat up, they left it for us, but we couldn't do anything with that, but we were afraid from them.</span> <span id="s781">That's the honest truth.</span> <span id="s782">Even so they were liberating and I felt that uh they won't harm us, uh it was a very difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Was there any characterization of your being Jewish at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Uh this is very funny.</span> <span id="s785">Once a high officer, greyªhaired, tall man...I can see his face like a wild animal in the...in that little whatever that was and uh he said who you, who you, who you?</span> <span id="s786">I spoke rather very simple Russian.</span> <span id="s787">You pick up, you know, a few weeks you are with them...you pick it up the everyday words, so I said husband, wife, daughter, and he picks up Eva...I almost died...and holds her and I said uh...I asked him would you give it back to me?</span> <span id="s788">So he said no, no.</span> <span id="s789">I don't harm him...her.</span> <span id="s790">So this...this was the end of the beginning.</span> <span id="s791">So uh...alright...so he...because you asked about Jewish, so he asked us, are you Jewish, or are you Catholic?</span> <span id="s792">Hungary is a Catholic country.</span> <span id="s793">And we didn't look Jewish, let's put it that way... no characteristics, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s794">So my husband...again, he was the cleaver...he said we are Jews and running from the Germans.</span> <span id="s795">Don't forget they were not allies anymore.</span> <span id="s796">They were against each other, so he goes into his pocket and I thought, my God, he will shoot us.</span> <span id="s797">He takes out a little prayer book and gives it to my husband.</span> <span id="s798">He cannot read Hebrew so I cannot either.</span> <span id="s799">I learned it in school because we have...the the Jewish children go to the Jewish uh religious hour and the Catholics to the Catholic , same time.</span> <span id="s800">We just go different and then we go back regular.</span> <span id="s801">So uh...and I..</span> <span id="s802">.</span> <span id="s803">and I knew that he he was because this was old-fashioned Hebrew and and so I tell him, uh I will tell you the the Jewish prayer which I learned when I was a baby and that's all I know.</span> <span id="s804">He looks at me.</span> <span id="s805">He knows it, so he said sure he knows and she...Eva knows it, my daughter.</span> <span id="s806">He didn't...he put back his prayer book and he knew that we are.</span> <span id="s807">He gave candy to Eva and he said, I am a Jewish Russian Jew and I promised myself that whenever I see a child, German or anything, I just do the same what they did to my children.</span> <span id="s808">They throw them out in the window.</span> <span id="s809">Funny.</span> <span id="s810">When he took Eva, I got frightened.</span> <span id="s811">I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s812">So he said I don't do anything to you.</span> <span id="s813">I bring you food until he was stationed in there and he did.</span> <span id="s814">Eva came back to me, naturally.</span> <span id="s815">She didn't even realize what went on, you know, because she didn't believe in bad and good.</span> <span id="s816">In good she did, but not in bad things.</span> <span id="s817">That man was for a few days there.</span> <span id="s818">Then he disappeared.</span> <span id="s819">They were picked up with, you know, with the army and they went.</span> <span id="s820">Then we went to clean.</span> <span id="s821">I always carried Eva.</span> <span id="s822">I never took my husband.</span> <span id="s823">He was staying there.</span> <span id="s824">I cleaning up a place where the horses were and the cows were, like that.</span> <span id="s825">I did a good cleaning, but after that we got two big loaf of bread, the Russian bread.</span> <span id="s826">You know, what we have here, the white bread...it's squarish (ph), and then we started to run because we figured I don't have the bread...I clean my whatever I had to.</span> <span id="s827">I don't want to get picked up.</span> <span id="s828">The reason the Kozack (ph) with the horses, they run all over, and as I said I spoke a few so they got close to us
