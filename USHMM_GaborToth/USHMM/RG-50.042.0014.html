id="s11">We're starting Brett.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Can you tell me what your transport and arrival at Treblinka was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">It was mostly from my, from my hometown.</span> <span id="s14">Was picked up in those, in those trains you know where you they transfer cattle, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s15">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Describe what it was like when they opened the doors.</span> <span id="s17">What you saw and how you felt and what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">The minute they opened up the door, I was facing right about two stories dead peoples right in front of it laying there.</span> <span id="s19">These were the people that came before dead right in the trains, in those uh trains, and they pushed them out because they did, they didn't have time to haul away because another train came in, and that's what it was, that I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">What I did, I saw it, we're going all, that's it, and I see boys dragging dead bodies to the grave you know, and I jumped right in and start dragging those bodies just like I was one of them.</span> <span id="s22">And they were pulling it to the graves.</span> <span id="s23">And uh so this was about 3 or 4 o clock and you know and then the night rolls around, and I could not join them, so I hide, I was hiding myself between the bodies there, so...And then in the morning, I did start doing the same thing, but I see in that they count fifty people dragging those bodies in this particular time, and two or three were killed, they, they, they shoot them because they couldn't uh drag those bodies, got sick and so on.</span> <span id="s24">So I joined right into the group, and I became one of the people.</span> <span id="s25">So like in the morning they came you know, and they count out the people how many people uh, uh there were right among peoples there.</span> <span id="s26">If somebody is missing so they were looking what's happened, you know, maybe he escaped or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">So you actually sort of broke into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Broken right into the to the crew, like I am one of it.</span> <span id="s29">Everybody was wearing the same, the same clothes like they were come, when they came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Now describe to me in detail if you remember it how Treblinka was laid out.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">The way it's laid out?</span> <span id="s32">Well, we, they make you go the people in, in a little, like a little alley go and they say, "Man at right, woman at the left," and over there they had to take off the clothes, and they pushed them right into the gate, and while they're coming to the gate, they come this way, this way and they join together, and they just went, (clears throat) they just went, that time I didn't know where they go, but then, then they went to gas chambers, all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">What was the camp like?</span> <span id="s34">Tell me about the buildings, how big it was, where you slept, tell me how everything was...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">We slept in a bldg just like a barrack, you know.</span> <span id="s36">Was -------- floor, sand, and that's the way we were sleeping there in those barracks.</span> <span id="s37">This was in the beginning, the first two months when I was there.</span> <span id="s38">Later they built, you know, a barracks, where you can sleep like a, they call this</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Bunks.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Bunks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Tell me how the whole camp was, how many buildings there were, how big it was, where the gas chambers were, describe to me...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">The gas, the gas chambers was about --------------.</span> <span id="s43">That was the size of a single garage, something like that.</span> <span id="s44">A garage, like that.</span> <span id="s45">And they, they pushed them in there, and you know, the Gest-the Gestapo and everything, crying and, people were, they didn't want to go in, they saw it, they, you know, they hit and they pushed each other right in, and they were standing up against ------------, and then they gassed them, and from the other side they were sliding them, they just slided out, and another group was taken into the graves.</span> <span id="s46">That was uh the beginning when I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Tell me how long you were there, and how it changed over the course of the time that you were there.</span> <span id="s48">It did change what they put people in a mass grave, and then when the grave was filled up, and they saw with the -------------- a, a new low, something, they digged out the, the dead people from those graves, and put them in one place where a big fire was going, and they were burning the bodies that I, that was, this was all after a month or so, and they, the new people came they go right in and just throw right into the, to the gr--to the, it was a grave, but, but the fire was a special fire, that was burning there.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">When you got there, how long had Treblinka been going?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Oh, I don't know, maybe, they was, was, they were building that Treblinka, it was about a month or three weeks.</span> <span id="s51">Most of the people was ,was from the Warsaw ghetto, they, they brought them from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s52">To build the Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Tell me about the transports, and was it organized, was it orderly, how long did it take, how often did they come.</span> <span id="s54">Describe to me what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">I I didn't get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">The transports, when a transport was coming in...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Yeah, oh you mean inside Treblinka, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Yeah, once you had been there for a while, and you were working...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Some, some transports has to, had to wait, couldn't get in because inside going in Treblinka was one track, and they put the one in they could not come in the other because was one track.</span> <span id="s60">So they were, sometimes they were waiting for hours, till this one pulled out empty and the other came in.</span> <span id="s61">This was go into late in the evening.</span> <span id="s62">Not at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">What did the people think?</span> <span id="s66">Where did...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">People, the minute they got into Treblinka, they saw what was going on, the dead bodies, and they, they were screaming, that, that's all, everybody was screaming, screaming, crying.</span> <span id="s68">The screaming, you know, and that was going on all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Was there a time when it was busier than other times or --------?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Yeah, sometimes they had a, sometimes they were waiting, and sometimes they just in and out and this ---------------went very smoothly that.</span> <span id="s71">Some of them, those trains came in, there was 80%, 90% dead, people were dead there.</span> <span id="s72">They kept them so long, for 2, 3 days, until they got in there, and there was, they, they had no water, no air or nothing, and they, they died right in the train.</span> <span id="s73">I --------------------dragged out bodies from trains, people, their heads were that big, and the, from the heat there.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Tell me the story of how you were picked up, and when you were picked up, and then transported there.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">We, I went together a, when they came in the morning, in uh my hometown, the ghetto, and they, they ordered everybody out from the houses, this was in the ghetto, so we all took packages, you know, bags, and sit right in the corridor, in the house there, because this was, you know, the people lived all the way around in the house, it's like a court.</span> <span id="s76">And then about 8 o clock, 8:30, we had to, they told us to go out and go to file, to march right there, maybe about a mile from my house went to the, to go to the trains.</span> <span id="s77">So we all went together, so they picked me up from the, from the group on the side, so they picked up uh 2, 2, 300 people, and put them in a different, in a different barrack, and they, and they, they need the people to work in the city, so I remained as a worker, but I didn't work.</span> <span id="s78">The next day was another transport.</span> <span id="s79">I got out from the, from the group, and went into --------, to the, to the transport because we didn't know we were going, and I said to myself, my parents were not going to be survive 24 hours if I wouldn't be there.</span> <span id="s80">You know, the, the people they -------------age, you know, uh, take care of them, you know.</span> <span id="s81">So I went, uh, ----------------by myself in and then we got into Treblinka.</span> <span id="s82">They kept us a whole day in a big filth, till they pushed us in to, to the, to the, those trains, what do you call the train, I call it that, where they carry the, the cattles, and the...</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">All right now describe for me again, the arrival in Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">We arrived at Treblinka just the way I, I told you before.</span> <span id="s87">They slided up the door, or, open the door, and they told them, "Go right in here, this, this way."</span> <span id="s88">And of course there was a little arch, says, woman right, and they go to, you know take a shower and stuff like that, and then they got into at the little field??</span> <span id="s89">there, everybody had to get undressed.</span> <span id="s90">They didn't keep the people o-overnight.</span> <span id="s91">(Cough) The, the whole thing has to be finished up, the whole train, and they put them in the gas chambers, and, and the other side was another group, hauled them away, to the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">We're going to run out very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Tell me what kind of a camp Treblinka was, and how it differed from other concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">From Treblinka was previously a death camp.</span> <span id="s95">Nobody was used for any uh hard labor or anything, just, labor was just with bodies, pulling people from from the, from the train, and uh, taking out different things, but they, of course, some people, girls, if you worked in a laundry there, not for us, just for the, for the, for the, for the Ukraine, the Germans, and of course, there was a kitchen there, in there, (cough) a shoemaker, a tailor, a little, a little quarter with all the shops, and a blacksmith, you know to put shoes on the horses, they had horses there too, and they used the horses just to bring the, they didn't have cars, so they used the horses to go in a little town to bring supplies for the, for the Germans.</span> <span id="s96">-------------.</span> <span id="s97">Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Tell me how many of you there were, and how many Germans there were, how many Ukraines there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">By the, by uh, there, there was about, about a thousand, twelve hundred people, but uh, by the end was between 13 and, and 15 hundred people in that camp.</span> <span id="s100">Working.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Who were all of them?</span> <span id="s102">Were they all, they were all prisoners like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Yeah, --------the same here???</span></p> <p><span id="s104">All right, now I want you to tell me again how you managed, what you did, when the doors opened.</span> <span id="s105">Tell it to me as though you didn't tell me before, how you managed not to go through one of those gates, and go into...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">You know, when the train arrived, you know, like they do in the, they pushed, opened up the door, not open doors, were sliding, you know, and, and this, in the most, like I, I say, the most of them came from other towns.</span> <span id="s107">Happens to be from my time when I came out the, most people got sick there, but not didn't die, but the most trains came in and people were laying dead.</span> <span id="s108">And the, and there was a group of the people, that's what I did, pulled out the people, and that why piled up a big pile of dead people because the next train is coming out.</span> <span id="s109">They had no time to haul away.</span> <span id="s110">And uh, and farmers around, around the neighborhood had a, there was a, they made a law, they should, should bring a buggy and a horse, and, and leave it at the, at the gate at Treblinka.</span> <span id="s111">In the evening, they, they, they picked it up, the horse and the buggy.</span> <span id="s112">So we used the buggy and piled them on the, on the little, little buggy, and uh some people were dragging dead people without the buggy.</span> <span id="s113">Was so many people, you know.</span> <span id="s114">Because the grave was a, was away about uh about 500 yards, 400 yards, from the, from the train, from the railroad.</span> <span id="s115">And that's why I,I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Now tell me about your conscious effort to survive.</span> <span id="s117">Tell me what you decided to do...</span></p> <p><span id="s118">We knew we're gonna die any minute, but at that time, you know, you just, you became one of, one of the, you know because, not a human being, you know.</span> <span id="s119">I was, I was afraid to kill a fly, and here I had to lay between the bodies and pull the bodies, and it just became like a nonsense you know, like, like, not like a human being.</span> <span id="s120">And this was in the beginning, but then, then I do it, I did some something different.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">What kinds of different things did you do?</span> <span id="s122">Did you have friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">No friends, uh, we, we all became friends.</span> <span id="s124">Uh, doesn't make a difference.</span> <span id="s125">One is from this town, this town, and practically everybody was almost uh my age.</span> <span id="s126">You know, they picked up these young boys, you know, 19, 20 years, 18 years, all, you know, about, about 20, 22, 23, very-----------we found one there.</span> <span id="s127">So that was too old at that time.</span> <span id="s128">And we saw this and then the, the camp got organized and what happened, how do I got survive, so I would work in a lot of things there, I was hauling water.</span> <span id="s129">You know, there was a little, whatever you call this, well, you know, you picked up the water, and, and, and carried to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s130">I was working on that and maybe a couple weeks, and then one time they picked up a bunch of people.</span> <span id="s131">See they separated Treblinka.</span> <span id="s132">Was too, the, the, the camp was number two anyways.</span> <span id="s133">Number, I'm not talking about number one, but at the number 2 camp, they separate, they put the, at the gate the, was when, when you came out from the gas chambers, there's another group hauling the bodies, and put into the graves.</span> <span id="s134">And those people, with this people didn't got together, they was, was in the same field, the same people were running there, the SS and the and the Ukrainians, what we didn't got together.</span> <span id="s135">One time they picked me up, and you know, we had to, every morning you had to pull out all the people and they counted how many people were here.</span> <span id="s136">Otherwise, there were two or three missing, they know somebody escaped, and they punished and that and that for that.</span> <span id="s137">Punished other people, not, not who escaped.</span> <span id="s138">So, one time they picked about 20 or 30 people from this group and took them to the other side where they pulling people to, to the graves, and I thought over there, I cannot survive 48 hours.</span> <span id="s139">The next day, when I, then they make me hauling water, and the water was at the other side where the train come in, this part of Treblinka, and I saw what's going on, and, and I see them crying and is not looking at me, they just went to somebody and talked.</span> <span id="s140">I left the two, the two barrels of water, and got into the, back to the same group that I was before, and started working so that's why and then I got back into the same group.</span> <span id="s141">Over there, there was food because people came to Treblinka, and somebody had a piece of bread and that and that, so you, you picked it up, you found the food to eat there.</span> <span id="s142">And over the other side, there were, you were dealing just with the dead bodies, and this, I was, was uh people just arrived.</span> <span id="s143">They left the clothes everything, over there, just plain dead bodies.</span> <span id="s144">So I got back to this thing, and, and that's why, and then I remained there in the, the, stay with the --------, I changed the job, they would have killed me right on the spot.</span> <span id="s145">But we knew anyways we gonna be killed, nobody's gonna survive.</span> <span id="s146">So, it happens like this.</span> <span id="s147">The way I survived is like this.</span> <span id="s148">In that camp there was a, a, a horse, and a, and a two-wheel buggy, which picked up garbage, you know and, and wor--picked the garbage and took it to the grave where the people were burning, and he backed it out and, and dumped it the garbage and for burning.</span> <span id="s149">There was no trashcans, uh something to haul away, everything that went into the grave and to burn it.</span> <span id="s150">Nobody had cans there or anything, there was not such a thing what uh, this is going to burn, not going to burn.</span> <span id="s151">So, what happened, when the guy pulled back the horse, told him the, the horse, pushed him to go backwards, the horse got wild, and backed it up, and went in right to the pile with the buggy.</span> <span id="s152">And then the, the German was, was around to see what's going on.</span> <span id="s153">He shoot him.</span> <span id="s154">There was a stable.</span> <span id="s155">There was five horses.</span> <span id="s156">And they used the horses for, for horseback riding and two horses for going for, for, to bring this materials you know, the food from the, from the other towns for the Germans.</span> <span id="s157">So they need an another guy, and it happens to be, I was in the barracks with a guy, who worked in the stable, cleaned the horses, the uh, uh feed the horses, he said, he said, "You're going to be good???"</span> <span id="s158">And I substitute the other guy who got killed.</span> <span id="s159">----------- And account of that thing, I survived in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s160">I, from then on, I had nothing to do with the people with the, working by the dead people.</span> <span id="s161">I just used the horse, and I learned how to clean horses and feed them and water.</span> <span id="s162">There was no ------------, we had to go the well and get the water.</span> <span id="s163">And this fellow, happens to be, was a few years older.</span> <span id="s164">And that Ukraine, was a an Ukraine who was in charge of that stable.</span> <span id="s165">When he got to the town, he got for himself, uh food you know.</span> <span id="s166">All those uh salamis and vodkas and that, so I have uh as far as food is concerned, I was eating then it was, it was okay.</span> <span id="s167">And then he want me to drink some vodka.</span> <span id="s168">I didn't touch it, and the guy said, "Don't you touch it."</span> <span id="s169">I don't know if, if they, they came in and they see you a little, little drunk, you be killed, and I was listening to him, and that's why I survived.</span> <span id="s170">That's why I survived that long to be in Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Did you have Kapos in Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Tell me what a Kapo is.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">There, there was one of my kapos, he was a young fellow, he was, he came a little earlier, and his name, -----------his name is Monek, I can't say, because we call him that, I remember that.</span> <span id="s175">He acted, well, uh, the, the, the Gestapo is rough to the people, but he didn't harm people.</span> <span id="s176">He didn't harm nobody, this particular guy.</span> <span id="s177">So there was about, about 2 or 3 kapos, but he was my kapo, this particular guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Tell me about the uprising.</span> <span id="s180">Tell me all about the whole plan and then go right through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">So, I was the one who knew we're gonna have the uprising because they came to the stable and they told me, "Listen, this is going to be an uprising."</span> <span id="s182">But happens to be, was a little boy, was really young, his father was there with him in a tailor shop, and happens to, he was from my hometown.</span> <span id="s183">Happens to be was from my hometown.</span> <span id="s184">That little boy was a shoeshine boy in, at the barracks where the, where the Germans were, uh, living there.</span> <span id="s185">So, and, and over there they had the supply of ammunition there.</span> <span id="s186">Supply, and he had a way of ,of going in.</span> <span id="s187">He brought out a lot of, stole a lot of ammunition, he distribute, distributed to some people who knows how to handle it.</span> <span id="s188">Not everybody in the camp knew there's going to be an uprising.</span> <span id="s189">And I was told, when you hear the uprise...when I hear the uprise, I should grab the rifle from the Ukraine because he had a rifle laying there openly, you know the, I got the access to it all the time, but he didn't care because I been there a few months there.</span> <span id="s190">So, they told me that if you hear the uprise, grab that rifle and run with us in the uprising.</span> <span id="s191">So, and the, and the, and the people from the, from the barracks, what they used to tailor shoes shoemakers and, and a, if in this particular time, 11 o’clock, if any of the Gestapo comes in there to, to the room there, to the, to the place, grab him, choke him, he cannot say I would just kill him there because the uprise is, is 11 o’clock.</span> <span id="s192">Somehow it did delayed, and the people who knew about it didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s193">So the uprise was a little later, and maybe 2, 3 of the Germans were killed, and then we start running.</span> <span id="s194">The wires, you know, the wires around the barracks, was not electric.</span> <span id="s195">In Treblinka they didn't make any tattoos on your arms.</span> <span id="s196">You wear the clothes which you wear all the time.</span> <span id="s197">That was, that's the way this camp was like that.</span> <span id="s198">So, so we run, we start running and I jumped across the wires, and the, and the, and the, the people you know, the, the patrols start shooting left and right, and I was running in the field and I saw it how the bullets popping in the in the ground in front of me.</span> <span id="s199">And then we got into the, then it got dark and I got into deep woods because we, from the distance we see black, this was woods.</span> <span id="s200">We were running straight into the woods.</span> <span id="s201">And we hided out overnight.</span> <span id="s202">So, and so the, the next, the next day, we didn't know where to go what to go.</span> <span id="s203">I saw a little farm, a farmer, all by himself.</span> <span id="s204">I was with another guy.</span> <span id="s205">And we got into his place, and we told him the story, and he kept us, hiding, uh hiding, but later he used us as to help him work, and this was uh, I don't know what to say now...</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Tell me how big an escape it was.</span> <span id="s207">How many of the inmates were involved.</span> <span id="s208">How many do you think got away and then what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">It got away a handful.</span> <span id="s210">The rest all of them were killed right on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">How do you know of that?</span> <span id="s212">How did you find out----?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Because after the war, we tried to get together how many people survived.</span> <span id="s214">Was only 27 people from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s215">From both camps, the camp where I was called Treblinka 2.</span> <span id="s216">There was another one, a labor camp, they chopping woods there, they're making roads.</span> <span id="s217">All together was 7, 27 people.</span> <span id="s218">After the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">How many people did you kill during the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Nobody.</span> <span id="s221">I was running.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">How many did inmates kill in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">It it got, the inmates killed or, or the Germans killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">How many of the Germans got killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">About two or three.</span> <span id="s226">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Now go back to when you were in the camp, and tell me about any sabotage that you did or that other prisoners did.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">There was two prisoners tried to escape at night.</span> <span id="s229">Tried to uh, uh throw up under the wire, and they were caught.</span> <span id="s230">And they brought them right into the appel in the morning when we had the appel for counting out the people.</span> <span id="s231">They, they hang them right in the middle, everybody should see what's happened when they, they hang them up by their legs.</span> <span id="s232">And they were screaming and swearing.</span> <span id="s233">They want to be shot.</span> <span id="s234">They can't you know they ------------.</span> <span id="s235">And then they showed us a sample if we ever, if we do uh run away, that's what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s236">And then a guy didn't behave himself, they uh and they showed at the appel where we were standing, uh, uh get, 25, you know there was a a heavy belt over his back, and some of them couldn't even make it af-after that.</span> <span id="s237">They went with a big -----------.</span> <span id="s238">And of course there was a, a guy, g--we called him uh Lalka, he was uh, his face looked, Lalka is a doll.</span> <span id="s239">His face was like a doll, but he was a murder, I said this, this guy, he went with a, had a German shepherd walking around, and he didn't like the other guy walking, just to tell the dog and just tear him apart.</span> <span id="s240">He was just dangerous this guy.</span> <span id="s241">Just dangerous this guy.</span> <span id="s242">And at the appel, there was another guy, we called him Kivi.</span> <span id="s243">His name was not Kivi, we just gave him a nickname, and looked like a, a Jewish typical guy, you know, the way his nose was, was raised and stuff like that, and he was terrible that guy.</span> <span id="s244">I think this guy got killed.</span> <span id="s245">This guy, I found out from the guys, after, after the, the war was over.</span> <span id="s246">And there was many thousand things, I could not even think, maybe if I lay down in bed and think about it, I can give you twice as much.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Tell me about when you went back and walked through the camp and how, what you remembered about where things were.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Back, what, Yeah, when you went back recently in the last ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Oh yeah, nothing there, nothing.</span> <span id="s250">They made, made a big statue there, and, and then they where the grave was with a where they were burning the people, they put uh stones you know memorial stones, and, and pointed out this Warsaw, my hometown, all the towns where people came into Treblinka, every town.</span> <span id="s251">It's just like mushrooms sitting there on a big spot, and, and the and the gas chambers, they poured uh asphalt, just to make known this was the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s252">A big, a big line, but you know, but that was the size of a, whatever the size is of the of the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s253">It's laying on the ground.</span> <span id="s254">They poured asphalt like this and they, there was the, the gas chambers, and this is the spot, was the spot, was the size of it.</span> <span id="s255">And the rest, everything is filled.</span> <span id="s256">Pine trees is growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Did you and other prisoners talk about getting even while you were there.</span> <span id="s258">I mean, at night when you weren't working, were there...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">You mean in Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Oh yeah, there was a one fellow, one appel, it was right in front of me.</span> <span id="s262">A guy went in and stabbed the guy who count the people and then they ss-they sprayed him bullets, and our people from the group, a lot of people ------------too, same time.</span> <span id="s263">The guy knew he's gonna die, so he took uh revenge you know, and stabbed him right in the back and killed him.</span> <span id="s264">This was during the time I was at, I swear, was in the app--appel means that everybody gets off before they go to work and they count them out how many people is here, how many went at night to sleep, and in the morning if anybody is missing.</span> <span id="s265">They didn't want nobody to escape there.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">So he he killed a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">He killed a German.</span> <span id="s268">And he was shredded from bullets that that guy who did it.</span> <span id="s269">But he knew it, he went for ------------.</span> <span id="s270">Yeah, night, night came in with the train.</span> <span id="s271">There, there was a lot of people tried to get out of the train so they behind they, they, they grabbed, they tried to go underneath, underneath the train.</span> <span id="s272">When the train goes back out, then he can run out and escape.</span> <span id="s273">And all of the sudden, one is going through so everybody seeing that whoever was capable, done the same thing.</span> <span id="s274">When the German saw it and he shoot him right there under the, you know behind right by some kind of item so he can hang on to it, and the train would go out and, and he, then he would try to escape.</span> <span id="s275">People tried to escape when they were sorting the, the goods, you know, the clothing, and packing during the day into the train.</span> <span id="s276">So other people got stuffed in, got inside, and they jumped during the time when the train was going, I don't know where the train was going, but there was the clothing, people's clothing, and they jumped out into, through the little window.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">All right, we're going to run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">In other camps when people arrived like at Auschwitz there was a selection made, and mothers and children, and people of 50 and over were often killed, but people who were able to work were chosen for work and for life.</span> <span id="s279">Describe to me how arrival at Treblinka was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Well each camp probably was a different system.</span> <span id="s281">What, what, what did they have, I never heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">They had selections.</span> <span id="s283">Were there selections at Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">No, there was Treblinka no selections whatsoever.</span> <span id="s285">They didn't took out any people.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Did they, at Sobibór they made a pretense.</span> <span id="s287">They gave people a receipt for their belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">No.</span> <span id="s289">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Everyone knew what was happening in Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">True.</span> <span id="s292">The, the minute they, they opened up the door, we saw what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Tell me, talk to me a little bit about choices, the choices the people who arrived there had, and the choices that the guards had, the Ukrainians or the Germans.</span> <span id="s294">Did they, were they just following orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">They, they run the, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s296">The Ukraine they were following the orders from the Germany, from the Germans, but they can do anything they want anyways.</span> <span id="s297">They could have done, they could have done it.</span> <span id="s298">-----------they they killed a lot of people, they watched -------------and everything.</span> <span id="s299">They actually, is, was mostly was run by the Ukraine people.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">What kind of choices did the prisoners have?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">There was no choice.</span> <span id="s302">They were standing both side and making out, out from the from the from the -------------, tells you right away go there, take off your clothes, and join this and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">In all your years there, tell me about any people who helped you at any time.</span> <span id="s304">Like the guy whose horse you watched.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Yeah, I help, help with my coworker there.</span> <span id="s306">He, he helped me.</span> <span id="s307">He, he told me "Don't do that, don't do that," and the account of him, I was, you know, I was young that time, you know, so he, he was much older than I am.</span> <span id="s308">Do that and do that and that was the help that I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Describe for me how, I don't remember exactly what guard it was that you had, but you were worried that in the uprising you might have to kill him.</span> <span id="s310">Describe to me that whole relationship as though you haven't-- There was Ukrainian guard.</span> <span id="s311">He wasn't there in this particular-- But tell me that whole story, tell me who he was and-- He was, he was a Ukrainian, he took care, that his job was to take care of that stable there.</span> <span id="s312">Uh, to bring all this supply of food, he was the one that supposed to bring and he, he watched the horses and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s313">He, he was the commander from, of the stable.</span> <span id="s314">That's all.</span> <span id="s315">Germans used to come and he ------------and they told, "Fix me up this horse for riding," so he came he just stepped up, and right away...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Tell me when you were working in Treblinka, tell me what a typical day was like, when you had to get up and how long you stood on the appels, when you went to work, and when you quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Oh we get up in the morning probably was about, I don't know, like 6 it was, between 7, 8 o clock.</span> <span id="s318">Then they counted out the people and everybody went to his own, with the, the Ukraine was standing waiting, and went to his own group.</span> <span id="s319">Back what he, what, back to the same job.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">And then how long did you work at Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Well, there was no time, but it was not late at night.</span> <span id="s322">Till the, the transport came in and it's all finished up, and they went to the gas chambers and, and they put them to the grave and then it was over.</span> <span id="s323">And they count again how many people was in the morning, in the evening, and that's all.</span> <span id="s324">And then we went into the bar-barracks, to sleep and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Was there any religious resistance?</span> <span id="s326">Did people pray?</span> <span id="s327">Prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Oh yeah, when they arrived, there was always those people, they took out the shawl you know, wrapped around them and fell to the ground and, and --------------.</span> <span id="s329">Many people like that.</span> <span id="s330">So, the minute when they arrived and they had to go out from, from the train, from the cattle train, and they fall to the ground and the pray was so loud, so was a lot of, of religious people came along, uh, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s331">They go, if they see they didn't want to go they just kicked them, beat them, and make sure they goes in there, takes off his clothes and goes right in.</span> <span id="s332">-----------Was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Could any of you who were working with them help them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">No.</span> <span id="s335">No, No.</span> <span id="s336">We cannot go and do anything because everybody, because we know if we go over and try to help them or something, they, they shoot right away.</span> <span id="s337">There were many times during the day if they didn't like the guy who worked, they shoot them right on the spot, don't care what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Did any of you pray or support each other in friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Yeah, well we didn't pray, uh, we didn't pray, but uh, I got up in the morning, in the barracks, and was right in front of me I see four or five people --------------------and hang themselves.</span> <span id="s340">Then we run over, "Don't do it!"</span> <span id="s341">Uh, then the third guy says, "Don't disturb them.</span> <span id="s342">If he wants to...," because he knew he he wouldn't make it you know.</span> <span id="s343">He got a little sick and that and then, so he hang himself.</span> <span id="s344">Instead of being tortured and killed.</span> <span id="s345">This I saw quite a few.</span> <span id="s346">Right in, in my section.</span> <span id="s347">It was all over because there were so many people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">What other kinds of resistance was there among you people who worked there.</span> <span id="s349">Any other kind of resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">What do mean by resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Any kind of resistance.</span> <span id="s352">Mental resistance, did you joke with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s354">There was no joking.</span> <span id="s355">But later in, in the evening, they organized a, a got a, they let in the, in the barracks you know there was like a court and, and a guy was singing, they let him do that.</span> <span id="s356">And Sunday, nothing, was, was free.</span> <span id="s357">Nobody was in there.</span> <span id="s358">No transfer came in and that guy was singing a "------------------," the Jewish songs, you know, and everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s359">So, that's what it was.</span> <span id="s360">--------------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Tell me about the sports that were arranged there, some of the, the soccer and--------- Yeah, I just wanted to say that.</span> <span id="s362">Sunday we played soccer, and the Germans were standing around and watching us.</span> <span id="s363">As matter of fact I played soccer.</span> <span id="s364">This finger is from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s365">I got up and my finger was like this.</span> <span id="s366">I pulled it and pulled it back, and I still have a little nerve here, ----------nerve.</span> <span id="s367">Yeah, I played soccer there.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Was there an orchestra there?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Yes.</span> <span id="s370">Tell me about that, tell me...</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Yeah this was late, late in the game, and when they uh the transport arrived and people recognized one the other, and you know, oh he's a, a, a violin player, there, so they took him out and he joins the, joins the orchestra.</span> <span id="s372">They didn't play the orchestra while the, the people went to the death, you know to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s373">Was a different times you know, they played the orchestra.</span> <span id="s374">There was orchestra.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">And what about the boxing match?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">There was one was a famous boxer in Europe and another guy on Sunday, and they had a a boxing you know just for like, like roosters, who, who killed, just supposed to kill them dead, that's it.</span> <span id="s377">That's the way the boxing was done.</span> <span id="s378">Wasn't going to the regular time.</span> <span id="s379">Just the, there was not so many boxing, wasn't a, just one or two fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">How does everything you saw make you feel about humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">That time when I arrived there, I became like a, a I don't know how to explain it, just didn't care, like a, a void person.</span> <span id="s382">Just didn't, didn't bother me because I know I'm going to be dead, now or in five minutes or ten minutes, and I just became like a, just like a person who uh has been doing this for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Tell me more about how the uprising got started and organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">There was one, he was from Warsaw, a fellow, very intelligent, he was an officer in the, in the, the Polish army from, from, from professionally he was a, an engineer, and he was the camp, the camp leader.</span> <span id="s385">He, he… We're running out, we're going to have to start this again when we reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">I want you to back up and tell me as though you didn't tell me before, tell me how it got organized and who was the leader of the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">The leader, I forgot his name, he carried a Polish name, which was his name, and he was the commander of the at the Treblinka at, at the camp, you know, with the Kapos and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s389">So he got the orders and he told the Kapos what to do, and, and actually we didn't have bad Kapos there in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s390">Was one, two, two kapos.</span> <span id="s391">The main Kapo was a, as I said young fellow, we called him Monek.</span> <span id="s392">Whoever was in Treblinka knows him.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Tell me how the uprising.</span> <span id="s394">Did everyone know about the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">All right, so tell me how the whole thing worked and what the plans were.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Uh, uh about the uprising, there was a ---------------------for everybody, otherwise they would get suspicious, and so they would just kill all of us, right in the same spot.</span> <span id="s397">So, they told just certain people who were, like at the tailor shop, who was the, the foreman in tailor shop, and from the s-blacksmith, and all those--------------------, there were shoemakers, that's what they have, carpenters.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">How did they decide who to tell and who not to tell, and then did everyone try to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">The uprise came along and so everybody screamed "Run, and run out," and that's it.</span> <span id="s400">You know, who has the ammunition, use that and that's it.</span> <span id="s401">So there was a little bit of ammunition.</span> <span id="s402">That that what the shoeshine brought it out a couple days ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">The Sobibór uprising was triggered by notes that the people in clothes found that were from people from Treblinka, and the notes in the pockets said, "Take revenge."</span> <span id="s404">Tell me about, do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Did you ever hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">About the take a revenge?</span> <span id="s408">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">There's no revenge, what are you take a, take a revenge with there?</span> <span id="s410">With the empty arms against uh, people who were sitting on the little things, you know upstairs in the with the machine guns, stuff like, what kind of revenge you got.</span> <span id="s411">We knew we gonna be dead anytime, so might as well do that, kill all what we can and run out.</span> <span id="s412">Whoever, whoever got saved, got saved.</span> <span id="s413">In this respect I was lucky, I didn't got killed.</span> <span id="s414">I was not a hero, to be, to be to escape, but just happened, all the bullets and the, was falling right in front of me and didn't hit me.</span> <span id="s415">People got hit in the legs, I saw it and fell down, couldn't go, couldn't go any farther.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Tell me what happened to your family, and also did you think about them when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Sure I think about, I knew they, they right around there someplace.</span> <span id="s418">Or think that they're on the fire burning, that's all.</span> <span id="s419">But you got so much with yourself, that you would not even think of anything.</span> <span id="s420">You, you became yourself an animal while you was there you know.</span> <span id="s421">Didn't, didn't bother us, we knew that tomorrow will never come.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">But you broke into Treblinka in the -------------- so that you could go rescue your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">No they came before I, I got there.</span> <span id="s424">One day before.</span> <span id="s425">Remember I said I walked out from the appel and go out, they, they choose me to get, to go out and they keep me there, because they left in the ghetto 300 people to do work.</span> <span id="s426">To remain in the city.</span> <span id="s427">Every city I guess got the same thing, and they, they remained a little portion, they make a little ghetto for those t-people, and they done you know work, tailoring or was some sewing was, so, so they took me out to remain so that and my, and my family and the parents, they just went straight to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">How do you feel about the whole thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">I still have nightmares.</span> <span id="s430">Still have nightmares.</span> <span id="s431">That was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Tell me about before being transported there.</span> <span id="s433">Tell me about when the war first started and how life changed and what people thought was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">We didn't know that we going to get, they going to kill us out, but uh we know what's going to, we gonna have a bad time.</span> <span id="s435">You mean when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s436">Sure we got the, just like anyplace else.</span> <span id="s437">Was the same system.</span> <span id="s438">So, Ger--I mean, the Germans took over the country, so there was rationing and ,and there was a hard time to survive, but somehow we survived, but we didn't know this is going to happen.</span> <span id="s439">And then they put us to the ghetto, and the ghetto was terrible, the ghetto was terrible.</span> <span id="s440">So like you hear about the Warsaw ghetto, same thing was in our hometown, identical same thing.</span> <span id="s441">People starving and dying laying on the, laying, laying on the sidewalks, so...that's what, that's what it was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Did you want to take revenge after you escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">After I escaped no, I was uh hiding myself for survival.</span> <span id="s444">For survival.</span> <span id="s445">How can I take revenge.</span> <span id="s446">We just were fighting, hiding out in foxholes for survival.</span> <span id="s447">And I, when I went to that farm, the farm and stayed there, then came a, a group, boys, Jewish boys, they had ammunition, and, and I told them my story, and they want me I should go with them.</span> <span id="s448">Stay with him because I wanted to make sure where they are, and when I went back to this guy, but he was treating, food wasn't much to eat, but he was, he was hiding us out, so we go used to that, so we don't want to go with them, but lately, if we went there, and we heard that the, that the front you know, the, the Russians coming closer, we made a foxhole in the woods, and then we all joined each other, and we stayed in the foxhole, and the Russians came along.</span> <span id="s449">That's when I got liberated, by the Russians.</span> <span id="s450">There was a, a bunch of people, about 8, 9 people that uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">What would you, what would you like to say future generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Well, the future generations around the world, well I know would ---------------------never again or something like that.</span> <span id="s453">This is, this is the future generations, I guess they know that.</span> <span id="s454">Anything gets suspicious, uh, where do they go, uh, right into the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Is your survival an achievement?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Sure, there's a, there's a lot of people survived in different forms, in different forms.</span> <span id="s457">People survived, people got killed, after the liberation people go this you know.</span> <span id="s458">There's a lot of different things.</span> <span id="s459">It's a, survival myself, and take a gun and kill a German, no I didn't, after the liberation, no, was not in my thought but I, just, I just hate them, what they did...Can sit there for hours, if I get uh just sometimes, I skip it, can't get this figured out.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Can you think of something you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Nothing.</span> <span id="s462">There is certain things, but I don't, you need a whole story, big story, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Whatever you can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Ask me some, maybe I'll remind myself.</span></p>

question.</span> <span id="s484">Okay, I want you to tell me again the story of the prisoner who killed the Gestapo on the appel, but I want you to tell me as though you haven't told me before.</span> <span id="s485">I don't know this story, so explain to me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">What's happening?</span> <span id="s487">Yes, tell me what an appel is and tell me...</span></p> <p><span id="s488">They bring, the people came out at this particular time, and they the appel means they counting how many people were here and going to work.</span> <span id="s489">Then, after the work is all done, you back again and you count if nobody is missing.</span> <span id="s490">They want to know if anybody disappears or something, you know, right away.</span> <span id="s491">And then uh -------------------liking the guy or something.</span> <span id="s492">------------just very simple.</span> <span id="s493">Run out on the appel, and he was standing there, count, count, and he came from the other side, stabbed him, direct-- You've got to tell me that it was your friend and that he stabbed a soldier, a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">You've got to tell me that so I understand who it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">The guy was one of, of the our, our workers there, what came out to the appel, so he just uh didn't ask nobody, went over, and stabbed him, that's all.</span> <span id="s497">There was easy there to find a, a knife or something because people were bringing down you know every day.</span> <span id="s498">That's what, that's what happened.</span> <span id="s499">Then they, they start shooting at the people everybody.</span> <span id="s500">A lot of people got killed.</span> <span id="s501">I mean from the, the appel people.</span> <span id="s502">Because bullets were coming from all over on this guy because the Ukraine was sitting on that uh what do you call this</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Guardpost Guard, guardpost that's right.</span> <span id="s504">And there was all over guardposts, and he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">So a prisoner killed a Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A Gestapo yeah.</span> <span id="s507">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Just tell me that.</span> <span id="s509">Tell me that a prisoner killed a Gestapo, and then tell me the story.</span> <span id="s510">And use the word prisoner and use the word Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">So one of our prisoners came out in the morning what they, and they made an appel, you know, they tried to put him to work, so he got out and killed a Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">How?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Just, just like uh taking a revenge you know.</span> <span id="s514">He knew that he's not going to live.</span> <span id="s515">Everybody knew that he's not going, not going to live.</span> <span id="s516">He, he thinks what's the sense?</span> <span id="s517">Get up, and work and go to sleep, and come in the morning and do the same thing.</span> <span id="s518">And by the end they gonna kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Who paid for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Who paid for that?</span> <span id="s521">Nobody, but the people got, this guy got killed in pieces, I mean they just tear him in pieces.</span> <span id="s522">And that's all.</span> <span id="s523">Then uh they start shooting, right into the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Tell me about close calls when you were hiding.</span> <span id="s525">After you escaped from Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">I was hiding in a barn in a place, this was up, up you know, there was above the, the cows and horses, but they had straw underneath.</span> <span id="s527">Then the people, the other people well they were in Treblinka but they, they run away from the towns and, and hide themselves around in the neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s528">And they organized themselves ammunition.</span> <span id="s529">So they found out that I am there with another guy.</span> <span id="s530">At, at this farm and hiding out.</span> <span id="s531">So they came and, and they got into the house there and uh, uh one of the children told them, "Oh those guys is in a barn upstairs."</span> <span id="s532">So, they went up and start talking Jewish, so, so we came down so we got together.</span> <span id="s533">So, we know each other, and they were hiding also in a in a foxhole at, at another farm, and so we, we, we got together in the evening, only in the evening when it was dark, not when the, the, the, not when it was bright, we call it uh</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Full moon.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Full moon, yeah.</span> <span id="s536">We didn't see each other because you could just uh point you can, you go around, they see you walking at night.</span> <span id="s537">You only saw each other when it was, when the moon was dark, just dark.</span> <span id="s538">So, so they somehow want me to I should join with them to be together, they, they get to like me or something like that.</span> <span id="s539">I told them where I was, so I went with them sometimes and I came back, and then by the very, very end, I remained there with them, and we had a foxhole right in middle, middle of the field, and we were sitting there, waiting.</span> <span id="s540">Then we heard, we heard, after a long time, we heard this big "Russian, Russian, Russian."</span> <span id="s541">So we got out and we saw the Russian people right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Did you do any fighting with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s544">This was the front line.</span> <span id="s545">This was the front line.</span> <span id="s546">---------- fighting.</span> <span id="s547">Russians------ Tell me once more how the buildings at Treblinka were laid out.</span> <span id="s548">Where the train came in, where the gas chambers were, how -------------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">The train came in, let's see, this way, then, I s--I sat a little distance there, don't know how many feet-two, two hundred feet, a hundred feet or, was a arch, and was, was like, like a with wires around where the people uh they says, "Go straight here, you're going to take a shower."</span> <span id="s550">Whatever it is.</span> <span id="s551">And the men right, women left, they had the, and they told them, "Get undressed just nude, and then they, they were going in their barr-barrack, and the woman goes there, and then they, they join together.</span> <span id="s552">And they went into the, to the gas chambers, at the gas chambers was very rough people standing there, pushing the people, hitting, hitting, hitting.</span> <span id="s553">Children, any, any, anybody.</span> <span id="s554">Uh, whole families.</span> <span id="s555">Then they got into the gas chamber, and it's all packed up standing everybody standing just like, they close it, and then they put together in there.</span> <span id="s556">And they put together so, and that's what it is.</span> <span id="s557">On the other side, a few minutes, slided open the doors, pushed them, this was a hard job because everybody was, was stick to each other you know.</span> <span id="s558">You have to ------------break them apart you know, apart, and put them to the, (cough) to the uh holes where the fire was.</span> <span id="s559">So in the in the beginning they piled up the dead people in big --------, filled it up, throw lots of dirt on top.</span> <span id="s560">Then they digged another big hole there.</span> <span id="s561">While I was there in the same time, came a -----, just like you see those big cranes digging the, the, the dirt, that's the way they picked up the people from the graves, turn around, and throw right on the fire.</span> <span id="s562">That's how ------------.</span> <span id="s563">Just came, turned there, all the way.</span> <span id="s564">I didn't work there, but I saw it.</span> <span id="s565">I was passing by back and forth.</span> <span id="s566">So, and they burned the bodies.</span> <span id="s567">They burned, they didn't want to have uh a grave with bodies, just to burn them, and that's what was going on the rest of the time.</span> <span id="s568">Burning.</span> <span id="s569">So at, I can I can I can draw with a pencil and tell you exactly how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Okay, let's cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">That's it?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Take 7 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s574">Start and describe-------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Yeah, this is, this is the main entrance, where the train came right on the side.</span> <span id="s576">And this is the, this is railway for the train what they arrived...and this is, this is a cattle train, coming around here.</span> <span id="s577">That's the cattle trains here.</span> <span id="s578">And here was the Ukrainian Gest--Gestapos and the and the the laborers, the workers would open up the the the doors, slide up the doors, and there were coming on here...so the people, they make them walk, walk in here to the, here is an arch, is an arch here, and said, men right, and woman left.</span> <span id="s579">Woman left.</span> <span id="s580">So the people came out from the train and and and told them to go right in here to that, (cough) and they gonna have a a a shower, so the people were walking from from both, from both sides into that place with shower.</span> <span id="s581">That's what --------------------.</span> <span id="s582">When they walk inside there, and...so the people here inside, they had to get undressed.</span> <span id="s583">Had to get undressed and there were, they were walking right into the to the very first two gates here, and the people come in right ----------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Let's put another roll on now.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Okay we can go again.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Start all over again?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">No, just keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">So the, the men went right and the woman left, and they got, and they got to get undressed, and they, they told them if any has valuable things, gold, to put them in, in this little basket right there, and they were, they were guided right to this rail, and this was a rail, wire fencing, tall wire fencing, and the and the and the people were pushing each other right in, and, and the Ukrainians and the Gestapo were standing right there, and they pushed and chased them into the -------- thing, to the to the gas chambers, and, and here where the gas chambers was, there was right, another gr-another group of people, take the people out from the gas chambers and put them right there, and here was the a, a, a mass grave, and here was a, a mass grave.</span> <span id="s589">But this was, this was isolated.</span> <span id="s590">This, this part where they where they pulled out the dead bodies to the to the, was isolated.</span> <span id="s591">And here was a big grave right on this hand side, was a big grave.</span> <span id="s592">And, and here when they went to this, this grave, there was the gas, the gas chambers was right over here.</span> <span id="s593">That's the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s594">And they, they got them right at this, this big, big grave, here.</span> <span id="s595">Now, our barracks was here.</span> <span id="s596">This was the barracks here.</span> <span id="s597">Not far, not far away from the graves, and here was a kitchen.</span> <span id="s598">Here was the kitchen right there.</span> <span id="s599">The kitchen was this side.</span> <span id="s600">And here and here was the, the on both sides was the Germans' upper office of and, and sleeping areas right there.</span> <span id="s601">And this was all, all here, all here fill, and here was the stable, and here right exactly here was the stable.</span> <span id="s602">Here was the stable where the, the horses are.</span> <span id="s603">And that that was the whole Treblinka right there.</span> <span id="s604">That was a bigger amount here, bigger space.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">How many gas chambers were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">About 14.</span> <span id="s607">------------gas chambers.</span> <span id="s608">Here came right the train come from this side, and they stepped out here, they were, here was, and here was a and they came down from here, there was a pile right there in the middle of dead bodies, right here, when you walked out from the train you saw it right there.</span> <span id="s609">This was the barracks right here, and that------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">All right, let's cut for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Take 9 is up</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Yeah.</span> <span id="s614">Talk about Treblinka here.</span> <span id="s615">This was a main gate, main gate coming in to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s616">Then the side was the railroad track, right over here, went in right through the middle here, and they, and they stop, right behind them was a wire fence, and here was uh they were guarding to say men go right and woman goes left, and right beside when I I came in was a big pile of dead people sitting right near, near the big arch where it says Woman left, Men right.</span> <span id="s617">And right to my right, on the road was the barracks, was, this was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s618">Where they put the barracks there for the people who just arrived.</span> <span id="s619">And... and this, this the barracks there.</span> <span id="s620">And here was the was a big mass grave where they put the people in the, drive them by horse and buggy and people was dragging by, by their hands right into this big grave on the right hand side.</span> <span id="s621">The gas chambers was just right coming out from that big arch where it says, "Woman left, Men right" and they had to get here undressed, and they asked them if anybody has gold, they put it in the basket there, and they, they were driven right on into the gas chambers at the left, and walking in to the, the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s622">And --------------there was a Gestapo and a Ukraine and just with a with a with a, a whip and uh hitting them to each, each one was pushing himself into to the to the to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s623">So of course at the other side, where there they, they slide off the doors, there was a, a different group than this one here, and we cannot communicate with them, just se, just seeing those people over the fence.</span> <span id="s624">And they were dragging the people in to uh, dragging the, the, the drag the people out from the camp from the big grave into another grave, on that side they, they were burning the bodies, and they empty out the big -------------.</span> <span id="s625">Now all the transports which came after that, came right in, they were thrown in right to the, to the, to the grave there, where the fire was.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Is that all?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Take

"Woman left, men right."</span> <span id="s632">And then here on the arch they, they say, you're going to take a shower, take take your clothes off."</span> <span id="s633">Okay, from the other, from the other side, they were, they were they were taking off their clothes and everything, and they were going right to the, to the gas chambers right here.</span> <span id="s634">The men came along and they joined together right in here, and they were into the, the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s635">Here is a, here is a, here was a pile of dead people, sitting there when I got there.</span> <span

time.</span> <span id="s640">And this was the, the mass grave and then came a, a some kind of law???</span> <span id="s641">, they had to take out from the mass grave here, make a big grave here, and burn all the bodies, took out those bodies from before, and the new arrivals they, they drag them in right to the big grave where they were burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Tell me how the gas chambers worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Oh they, they got into the gas chambers, they, they pushed them in like a, like a -----------, it was a, I guess about 14, and they pushed them right in,
