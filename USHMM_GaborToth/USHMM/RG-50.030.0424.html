Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A. I was born in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s50">I was born in Warsaw and I left Warsaw in 1943, as I told you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q. Tell me a little bit about your family before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A. Before the war, my family was a beautiful, nice family and a popular family and people I should say with money, not poor.</span> <span id="s53">They used to say in Warsaw, "If you can afford to buy fish for supper to eat fish on Friday night and serve it, means that you are not a poor man."</span> <span id="s54">We had a lot of poor people in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s55">Usually on Thursday, the poor, the beggars they used to go from door to door, from store to store to give them a few pennies.</span> <span id="s56">That was every Thursday.</span> <span id="s57">In fact they used to come to my father's place on Thursday and he was ready for them, you know to give everybody some money.</span> <span id="s58">My family was a religious family.</span> <span id="s59">I should say that my family was in those days an orthodox family, the whole family.</span> <span id="s60">My father was, I should say if he would come to the United States he would be a good canter.</span> <span id="s61">He had a good voice.</span> <span id="s62">He used to dom for his friend in the shobots and you know on the holiday.</span> <span id="s63">He used to help my uncle, which actually that was my father's uncle.</span> <span id="s64">We call him the _______________ in Jewish.</span> <span id="s65">___________ is an uncle.</span> <span id="s66">And he used to dom a lot of holidays and his apartment he had the people and they used to come and my father used to help him out and I was a good singer too, which I used to sing in the synagogue in Warsaw for the ________________, the greatest cantors we ever had in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">And I used to sing with them and I was a good singer.</span> <span id="s68">Some holidays I had to take off and go with my father and my brother too.</span> <span id="s69">We used to help my uncle as a choir.</span> <span id="s70">So, that's what happened in that time.</span> <span id="s71">It's a fact that one of my second cousins I should say, and the first cousins, I didn't know that they went to Australia in that time before the war.</span> <span id="s72">A lot of Jewish people before the war went to Australia.</span> <span id="s73">Why?</span> <span id="s74">They didn't have to pay anything.</span> <span id="s75">Australia was looking for people at that time.</span> <span id="s76">A lot of people went from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s77">I didn't know this but I find when I went to Australia to visit my cousin, I find a lot of people from Warsaw and that synagogue and that Saturday I was invited to be at the bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s78">I didn't know about this.</span> <span id="s79">I wish I would know about it that time and I wouldn't have had to be in concentration camps and the Warsaw uprisings and I would go to Australia too.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">My whole family if you want to know what my family did, I should say almost --about 75 percent of my family was in the furniture business, salesmen or in the business.</span> <span id="s81">We had a street in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s82">The street name was Bugner.</span> <span id="s83">The Bugner Street was a very popular street as a furniture business street.</span> <span id="s84">If somebody needed something, to buy a piece of furniture or antiques or to remodel to restyle furniture, they went to the Bugner Street.</span> <span id="s85">My father was there, my aunts -- I had two aunts.</span> <span id="s86">They were there in the furniture business.</span> <span id="s87">I should say that my family occupied maybe half the street of the furniture business, very popular.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Of course my father's name was very popular.</span> <span id="s89">In my neighborhood everybody knew Shyet Svibaum.</span> <span id="s90">Shyet Svibaum was a very popular man.</span> <span id="s91">First of all, he was a president from ____________ hasidic not far from the street where I lived.</span> <span id="s92">____________ hasidic means that that was an organization that they sent to sick people for overnight.</span> <span id="s93">They call it _____________, a Russian ___________, you know, to take care of the sick people for nothing, no charge, freely.</span> <span id="s94">My father was president there and he was a very popular man.</span> <span id="s95">Even his friends were very popular.</span> <span id="s96">In Warsaw, maybe people through Warsaw they know this.</span> <span id="s97">In Warsaw, my father had long hair.</span> <span id="s98">He was blonde.</span> <span id="s99">Our family, almost everybody was blonde.</span> <span id="s100">Only my brother had dark hair.</span> <span id="s101">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s102">My mother was blonde.</span> <span id="s103">My father was blonde.</span> <span id="s104">I was blonde and my father had a tough time with his hair.</span> <span id="s105">His hair, it used to stick on.</span> <span id="s106">Whenever he put on a Jewish hat, a yamakah, or he put on the -- the yamakah was not bad, a hat, a regular hat, it always used to stick out, his hair, here in the front.</span> <span id="s107">So, in Warsaw they give him a name.</span> <span id="s108">_______________, why they called it _____________, it comes from Polish.</span> <span id="s109">It's a Polish word.</span> <span id="s110">___________ means if the hair is sticking out here, whatever you're doing the hair comes out.</span> <span id="s111">So, he had a lot of friends and his friends every one of his friends had such a nick name.</span> <span id="s112">That's how it was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s113">They give everybody -- if it was Levin they give him another name, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">So, and then we had I should say, when I started to work -- I was 13 years old when I started to work.</span> <span id="s115">I started to work as a furrier for Maximillion at that time.</span> <span id="s116">His name was Maximillion Applebaum.</span> <span id="s117">When he arrived in the United States the Applebaums, he had a different name.</span> <span id="s118">He put up for business a different name, Maximillion first, which is in New York, Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s119">I used to work for him for three years to learn the trade and I didn't get paid a penny.</span> <span id="s120">He didn't pay.</span> <span id="s121">First of all, it was hard to get into his place.</span> <span id="s122">It was a strictly union place, but I had a cousin and the cousin knew Maximillion very well, a woman, and she asked me, "Would you like to work for him?"</span> <span id="s123">I said, "Yes, let's start to work.</span> <span id="s124">Let's learn a trade."</span> <span id="s125">So, when I finished my public school, and I used to go evening courses, I take, the name was _________________.</span> <span id="s126">_____________ means "school," ______________ means where they teach you business.</span> <span id="s127">I used to take the evening classes.</span> <span id="s128">I finished at that time my public school and I went to learn this trade.</span> <span id="s129">I learned for three years there.</span> <span id="s130">Then finally, I learned something, I changed the place.</span> <span id="s131">I couldn't make money there you see.</span> <span id="s132">They didn't pay me.</span> <span id="s133">So, I had to look for a job and I started to look for jobs and I went from one job into the other and the ____________ was very good at that time.</span> <span id="s134">It's not like as it is now here in the United States.</span> <span id="s135">The _______________ is going down in the United States.</span> <span id="s136">So, I went from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">I went to a place as an operator already, a machine operator.</span> <span id="s138">There was a fellow, a cutter, we call it cutters, people cutting the furs, and I was an operator on the machine.</span> <span id="s139">The cutter gave it to me operate.</span> <span id="s140">We had a cutter in that shop and our bosses name was Stigel, that was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s141">He was the boss.</span> <span id="s142">He was the owner from that fur business.</span> <span id="s143">He was a very popular man in a very popular beautiful area.</span> <span id="s144">I should say that Warsaw was before the war so beautiful that they called Warsaw the second Paris which people don't know about it.</span> <span id="s145">That's how beautiful Warsaw was.</span> <span id="s146">But I want to finish with that fur operating.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">That fellow who was the cutter, who gave it to me to operate the stuff, his name was Daniel Swartzfooter.</span> <span id="s148">That's Daniel Swartzfooter's family was one I should say of the wealthiest people in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s149">What they did, they used to sell materials for suits, English materials for suits, for the men you know, for the women and they were very popular in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s150">A big family.</span> <span id="s151">They lived a few blocks away from me, and that particular Daniel Swartzfooter before the war started, before the Germans occupied Poland, that I should say was between 1936 and 1937, he asked that Stigel, our boss, Mr. Stigel, would you like to go to Australia with me?</span> <span id="s152">He said, "No, Daniel.</span> <span id="s153">I'm an old man already."</span> <span id="s154">He said to Mr. Stigel, "Mr. Stigel, I tell you there's going to be a war here and who knows what's going to happen with you."</span> <span id="s155">And Mr. Stigel says to him, "Look Daniel, whatever is going to happen, I don't care.</span> <span id="s156">I wouldn't go to Australia now and open a business at my age.</span> <span id="s157">I'm an old man already," he says.</span> <span id="s158">And he says, "Whatever is going to happen, if I have to die here, I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s159">That's it."</span> <span id="s160">That Swartzfooter quit the job.</span> <span id="s161">I didn't know about it but after I find out -- that Swartzfooter was so popular in Warsaw that I am a theater lover and I am a cantor lover myself.</span> <span id="s162">I love cantors but good ones, popular ones.</span> <span id="s163">My daughter knows that.</span> <span id="s164">If I come here I'm looking for a famous cantor so she takes me there.</span> <span id="s165">And that Swartzfooter had a lot of friends, Jewish actors the most popular actors, what we had, and it's a fact that Swartzfooter married a Jewish actress from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s166">She was a dancer.</span> <span id="s167">She was a very popular actress.</span> <span id="s168">I forgot her name.</span> <span id="s169">And, he after he got married he moved to Australia.</span> <span id="s170">I didn't know this.</span> <span id="s171">I find out later on that he went to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Now, what would you like to know now, about my brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q. Well, did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A. I had one brother.</span> <span id="s175">We are two kids, that's all.</span> <span id="s176">He was a furrier too.</span> <span id="s177">He was a different kind of furrier.</span> <span id="s178">I should say that he was one of the best mechanics in Warsaw and the best furrier I should say.</span> <span id="s179">Why?</span> <span id="s180">He knew how to make a garment, and he knew how to finish a garment as a finisher too.</span> <span id="s181">It means he could make a garment from the beginning to the end, to finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q. Now, you went to a public school?</span> <span id="s183">You didn't go to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A. Yes, I went to a Jewish school before, to a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s185">The fact that my teacher was one of the best teachers Poland had.</span> <span id="s186">The owner from the Jewish school, from the Hebrew school, lived in my apartment building where I lived.</span> <span id="s187">My apartment building was a very popular apartment building.</span> <span id="s188">They called it _________ Street.</span> <span id="s189">In Polish it's _______________ number 24, and this was a very popular building.</span> <span id="s190">That's why we had wealthy people living in this building, very popular ones.</span> <span id="s191">We had a lot of business people from the street which they lived in this building.</span> <span id="s192">The owner from the Hebrew school lived in this building.</span> <span id="s193">His name was _____________ Clapper they call it in Jewish.</span> <span id="s194">It was a popular Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">We had _______________ rabbi, a very popular rabbi lived in my apartment building.</span> <span id="s196">It's a fact that we had like -- that man they call it ______________.</span> <span id="s197">_____________ was a very strong, popular -- one of the strongest people of Europe.</span> <span id="s198">He used to appear in different cities, maybe overseas and he used to make from steel, from iron, he used to make different kinds of flowers in his hands and all the kind of things, he was very, very strong.</span> <span id="s199">Every Friday he used to come to that _____________ rabbi, to my building, every Friday and he used to ask that ______________ rabbi that he should pray for him that nothing should happen to him.</span> <span id="s200">If he appears to make the flowers or you know, he used to hit with nails.</span> <span id="s201">Different kinds of things, very strong, very popular.</span> <span id="s202">That's what he used to do.</span> <span id="s203">Every Friday night he came with an open car, a beautiful open car with a leather jacket and a leather hat.</span> <span id="s204">He was a very, very popular man.</span> <span id="s205">He had a brother, but the brother wasn't as strong as he was and living in a different city.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q. Let me ask you, you lived in a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A. Yes, our neighborhood was strictly, strictly, a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s208">It's a fact that on a Saturday every store was closed.</span> <span id="s209">You couldn't have an open store.</span> <span id="s210">You couldn't see an open store on our street.</span> <span id="s211">You could see just walking very religious people with long coats, the ____________ and with the Jewish hair and the black hats, to the synagogues, walking a lot of people.</span> <span id="s212">Strictly the sabbath and every store was closed in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s213">It's a fact on my street, I lived farther _____________ 24, _____________ 6 was a very famous _______________.</span> <span id="s214">The ___________ synagogue has a lot of history.</span> <span id="s215">That's why the _____________ synagogue is the only synagogue left from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s216">The only synagogue which the Germans I guess didn't have the chance, didn't have the time to do something with that synagogue to destroy that synagogue.</span> <span id="s217">That's why the Russians, they were after them when the Russians started to occupy Poland they used to fly.</span> <span id="s218">They had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">This synagogue first of all, what I wanted to tell you about later on maybe about cantors, which I used to sing.</span> <span id="s220">When I sang in that ______________ in the choir, it was one of the best choirs we had and ______________, the very, very famous cantor, very famous, the most popular I should say in Europe at that time was ________________.</span> <span id="s221">And _________________ as I remember that _____________ has the last service before the Germans closed up that synagogue.</span> <span id="s222">They closed it up for a reason which I find out.</span> <span id="s223">The reason was they made from that synagogue a warehouse.</span> <span id="s224">The warehouse was, the Germans took away, they went from door to door with the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s225">The Ukrainians they used to help them out.</span> <span id="s226">They went from door to door from apartment to apartment, they cleaned out furniture.</span> <span id="s227">They took away diamonds from the people, everything, clothing, and they put in that particular synagogue.</span> <span id="s228">That's what the Germans used for a warehouse.</span> <span id="s229">It's a fact that before the Germans left, they used to make auction sales in that particular synagogue to sell this stuff to the poor, the Polish people, and the rest they give it to the army for nothing, whatever was left over.</span> <span id="s230">After that, as I heard that they left Warsaw, the Germans, they had to go -- as I told you before, the Russians, they were after them.</span> <span id="s231">That's why that particular synagogue is still there, but in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s232">They didn't bomb that synagogue.</span> <span id="s233">They didn't destroy that synagogue, but the Polish people didn't take care of it and we didn't have Jewish people there anymore there so nobody -- they didn't have a chance to take care.</span> <span id="s234">I find swastikas on the walls when I visited three years ago Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q.

Yes, I tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s393">When I was in the apartment, my apartment, usually what they did, the Germans, they had a lot of Ukrainians helping them.</span> <span id="s394">The Germans didn't go to the apartments.</span> <span id="s395">The Ukranes came to the apartments looking for people and take them out.</span> <span id="s396">They took away stuff, but first looking for the people to take them out.</span> <span id="s397">What I did, I told my mother --- she said go to a closet and she would cover herself up with the coats, with whatever and to be quiet.</span> <span id="s398">I left.</span> <span id="s399">I told her what's going to happen that the Ukrainians are going from home to home, from apartment to apartment, and they're taking out people.</span> <span id="s400">What they do with them I don't know, I said to her.</span> <span id="s401">So, you stay here and cover yourselves and be quiet and you'll see what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s402">I went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Then, when I came back, she told me that people like the Ukrainians, they came and they knocked at the door, they opened the door and they started to look for people.</span> <span id="s404">I was quiet and they were sitting around the tables and looking at the ovens and the top of the ovens, inside the ovens and like the chimneys and they were looking for people.</span> <span id="s405">They couldn't find me, she says.</span> <span id="s406">I heard when they were sitting around the table and they would step out already.</span> <span id="s407">They were thinking maybe somebody will show and come on out, you know, from the hiding places, but she knew this was a trick, that they were still sitting at the tables.</span> <span id="s408">Then, they left.</span> <span id="s409">Then she came out from the closet.</span> <span id="s410">That's what she told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">My father, this was in 1941, I was waiting for my father to come into the apartment.</span> <span id="s412">He didn't show up.</span> <span id="s413">So, I didn't know what happened with him, but a friend of his, he lived not far from me, was at that time on the street and he told me that a truck with Germans, they jumped from the truck.</span> <span id="s414">The truck was on the street, and a few Germans jumped down and they grabbed my father and they put him on the truck.</span> <span id="s415">Since then, I didn't know what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s416">He disappeared.</span> <span id="s417">So, that's what happened.</span> <span id="s418">My mother was at that time still alive.</span> <span id="s419">What happened with my mother, I was walking on the street.</span> <span id="s420">This was in 1942.</span> <span id="s421">I was walking on the street with my mother and holding my mother on the arm, and walking with her and a German soldier, whatever he was a captain, a sergeant, jumped from a truck and came over to me and took my mother away from me.</span> <span id="s422">I started to cry.</span> <span id="s423">When I started to cry, that German officer whatever he was, says to me, "Look if you'll cry we're going to take you too."</span> <span id="s424">And he took away my mother but I should say that was about three blocks away from me, and they put her in a group which there were more people in her age.</span> <span id="s425">Then I heard that maybe an hour later I heard a machine gun was shooting and this is where they killed the whole group, and my mother was there too.</span> <span id="s426">This was about three blocks away from me.</span> <span id="s427">The street was Miller.</span> <span id="s428">The name of the street was Miller.</span> <span id="s429">And on that Miller Street, the uprising started.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q. So, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A.</span> <span id="s432">This is what happened with my mother and what happened with my father I told you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q. Now, you were describing that after Warsaw was occupied, little by little the Germans were taking away your rights and they had help from the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s434">What about the Polish people?</span> <span id="s435">Did they have help from them as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A.</span> <span id="s437">The Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q.</span> <span id="s439">What were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A.</span> <span id="s441">What happened to the Polish people?</span> <span id="s442">They didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s443">They didn't anything absolutely.</span> <span id="s444">If they found out they were Polish -- first of all, they separated the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s445">That time they made the ghetto, they put fence, walls from concrete, sometimes from bricks and they started to close up the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q.</span> <span id="s447">When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A.</span> <span id="s449">This was -- they built the ghettos already in 1940 and 1941 they started to build the walls.</span> <span id="s450">I moved from one street -- I had to move to the other street to live in a different apartment building.</span> <span id="s451">Then little by little they stopped everything.</span> <span id="s452">The Jewish people, they took away their rights.</span> <span id="s453">They took away the businesses.</span> <span id="s454">You couldn't work, especially when I was a furrier, I had some connections with the Polish side, with the other side.</span> <span id="s455">I made connections and the Jewish women they couldn't wear fur coats any more.</span> <span id="s456">They give a spot, there was a certain spot in Warsaw which they had to deliver all of the fur coats, all of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s457">The Jewish people had to deliver the fur coats otherwise they could take them to the concentration camps or they could kill them if they didn't -- you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s458">There was a certain date and we had lines with people staying there with their fur coats in their hands to give away the fur coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">What I did in that time I took a chance.</span> <span id="s460">I put on the attic in my apartment on the left floor there was an attic, I put up a shop there with my brother.</span> <span id="s461">I put up a shop and I took a chance at that time.</span> <span id="s462">They could kill me for it if they would find out.</span> <span id="s463">If they would find a piece of fur there and find out I have a shop they would take me away, but I took a chance with my brother.</span> <span id="s464">We used to make remodels, to remodel for the furriers which they were on the other side fence, on the other side walls, and I made a lot of money at that time.</span> <span id="s465">I took a chance, if I made a fox for somebody or whatever, I put it on my stomach around, underneath and that's how I smuggled the stuff on the other side.</span> <span id="s466">I took a chance, I took off my Jewish star from the armbands and I looked like a Gentile.</span> <span id="s467">I didn't look like a -- I was blonde with a little nose like this.</span> <span id="s468">Now I have a long nose already.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">So, I took a chance and the guard he looked at me and looked at me but he didn't stop me.</span> <span id="s470">I took a chance and I give the fox there to the Polish people.</span> <span id="s471">That was the Polish furriers I was dealing with.</span> <span id="s472">He gave me the money and at that time I had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s473">I just didn't know.</span> <span id="s474">We couldn't get so much for the money.</span> <span id="s475">Food was the most important thing at that time.</span> <span id="s476">A lot of people started to die from hunger.</span> <span id="s477">That's why they didn't have enough food.</span> <span id="s478">We couldn't buy -- they closed up all the stores.</span> <span id="s479">We had to smuggle.</span> <span id="s480">We had to get the food from the other side to get connections with Polish people and they give us the flour, bread, whatever, from the other side, and I had to give them the money.</span> <span id="s481">First I had to give him the money and then he give me the sugar, flour, whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s482">I had a lot of food at that time.</span> <span id="s483">I had plenty.</span> <span id="s484">What I did, I used to help my family, wherever I had to my family.</span> <span id="s485">I used to help them out.</span> <span id="s486">From the table where I used to nail the furs, I made a dining room table and I invite all, wherever I could find my family people, and we used to cook and eat and give them to eat, at that time.</span> <span id="s487">I wasn't hungry.</span> <span id="s488">I had plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q. Now, let me ask you, was it easy to get in and out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s491">That's what I did.</span> <span id="s492">I took chances and I went out from the ghetto to the other side.</span> <span id="s493">To the Irish side I call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q.</span> <span id="s495">How did you get in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A. I was walking.</span> <span id="s497">I took off the star and the guards, they knew my face already, and I took a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q. Where did they think you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A.</span> <span id="s500">He didn't ask me questions, nothing.</span> <span id="s501">He didn't ask me.</span> <span id="s502">I had connections already with the other side with the people.</span> <span id="s503">I told them, "Look I'm going to ten o'clock here at this spot.</span> <span id="s504">Eleven o'clock wherever."</span> <span id="s505">And the people were waiting for me and I gave them the stuff and they gave me the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q. So, you just walked out the gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A. I just walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q. Tell me a little bit about the life in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A.</span> <span id="s510">The life in the ghetto was very tough.</span> <span id="s511">It was miserable, very tough.</span> <span id="s512">I for instance, I had money and I organize myself with food and I was all right.</span> <span id="s513">I could help my families, my relatives to give them food and give them to eat.</span> <span id="s514">I was all right.</span> <span id="s515">Look, I complained, it was tough.</span> <span id="s516">I could see what's going on.</span> <span id="s517">It was getting worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s518">People were dying on the street from hunger.</span> <span id="s519">They couldn't get food and you could see on the street laying -- almost on every street you could see some people laying dead from hunger and they looked like skeletons.</span> <span id="s520">So, that's what happened.</span> <span id="s521">It started to get worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s522">They started to close up more and more and more -- the Germans they started to move the walls, closer and closer and closer.</span> <span id="s523">People from small towns from Poland, they would think that they were going to save their lives in Warsaw that's why it's a big city, so they came over to live in Warsaw and to save themselves.</span> <span id="s524">This was a trick from the Germans.</span> <span id="s525">That they throw them out from the small towns from the small that they should go to Warsaw, that they have them all in one place.</span> <span id="s526">They should be able to finish them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s528">After that, on my street where I lived, I had to move to another.</span> <span id="s529">I moved three times.</span> <span id="s530">I had to move that's why they closed up the ghetto, closer and closer, to have the people as I told you in one place.</span> <span id="s531">I started to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s532">They needed tailors and furriers.</span> <span id="s533">I was one of the first ones with my brother to go there.</span> <span id="s534">That's why I lived on the same street, I moved, where they put up the shops, the Germans for tailors and furriers.</span> <span id="s535">I worked there with my brother.</span> <span id="s536">They give us to eat, you know, meals.</span> <span id="s537">So, we had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s538">I wasn't such afraid as the other ones.</span> <span id="s539">That's why I was working for them.</span> <span id="s540">We made fur gloves and fur vests before they started to go over to the Russians.</span> <span id="s541">So, they prepared themselves.</span> <span id="s542">Russia was cold.</span> <span id="s543">They needed it for the army, gloves and vests.</span> <span id="s544">That's what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Then they closed up the shop.</span> <span id="s546">They closed up the shop and we didn't work there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q.</span> <span id="s548">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A.</span> <span id="s550">We found out something was going to happen here.</span> <span id="s551">The people they start to build bunkers underground.</span> <span id="s552">This was before the uprisings.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q. I want to ask you a few more questions about ghetto life before we get there.</span> <span id="s554">The people who couldn't get food, were there soup kitchens, was there any way to try to help people?</span> <span id="s555">Were there orphanages?</span> <span id="s556">What was going on?</span> <span id="s557">Did they set up different organizations within the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A.</span> <span id="s559">There was only one organization, they called it the ______________.</span> <span id="s560">That was on ______________ Street.</span> <span id="s561">We had like a Jewish community, like a community center.</span> <span id="s562">They were trying to help the Jewish people there, but the Germans didn't let them do it.</span> <span id="s563">Then, what happened, they closed up this place altogether.</span> <span id="s564">This place they kept only _________________, if they gave orders to the Jewish people in Warsaw, you have to give away your fur coats, or you have to do this or you have to do that, it was only in that particular spot and that had to go there and you know give the fur coats away.</span> <span id="s565">Wherever they told us to do it, that was the spot, like a Jewish community center.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q. Were there efforts to help people maybe that were illegal, that were maybe underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A.</span> <span id="s568">The underground we start to build after it started to get very bad.</span> <span id="s569">We could find out what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s570">They start to look up for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s571">They want to try to find them and take them to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s572">At that time we started to build -- and that was 1943 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q. Actually, I have a few more questions before we get to 1943.</span> <span id="s574">Now I guess I read somewhere that in the Warsaw ghetto that there were you know maybe underground schools for the children.</span> <span id="s575">That there were symphonies, there were concerts --?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A.</span> <span id="s577">They liquidated everything.</span> <span id="s578">They didn't give a chance to the Jewish people to organize themselves and to do something.</span> <span id="s579">They started to close up everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q. So, none of this was happening in the hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A.</span> <span id="s582">The hiding was tough.</span> <span id="s583">In the hiding we had to organize for food.</span> <span id="s584">We organize for food let's say for one year food.</span> <span id="s585">Our bunker had for one year food.</span> <span id="s586">We bought it from the Polish people.</span> <span id="s587">The Polish people, they actually were the builders for the underground.</span> <span id="s588">They built it, bricklayers, and we had to pay them a high price for that.</span> <span id="s589">And then what happened on the end, they showed the German people where the Jewish people are laying, where they have the underground.</span> <span id="s590">That's what happened in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q.

That's what they did.</span> <span id="s647">They used to take people from the streets, and they used to take them out from the apartments, from the buildings at the same time.</span> <span id="s648">But this was a job which the Germans left it for the Ukranes.</span> <span id="s649">To show the world maybe that the Germans, they don't do that.</span> <span id="s650">That that Ukrainians do that, they worked together.</span> <span id="s651">This was actually a job for the Ukrainians to go from house to house, from apartment to apartment and take out the people and put them on the trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q.

So, what did happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A.</span> <span id="s913">What happened, they find our place as I told you.</span> <span id="s914">We had to come out and they took us right in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s915">We were waiting there and then they destroyed old buildings at the same time.</span> <span id="s916">We were standing right in the middle and everything around me, around us, fire from the buildings that they destroyed.</span> <span id="s917">They destroyed the ghetto at that time.</span> <span id="s918">I know about my area.</span> <span id="s919">What happened on the other side, I don't know what happened there, but I know what happened around me.</span> <span id="s920">I see fires from the bombs.</span> <span id="s921">That's what they did, and then they put us on the trucks.</span> <span id="s922">They put us on the trucks and we traveled a few miles away from that spot and there was a train.</span> <span id="s923">There were trains waiting for us.</span> <span id="s924">I was thinking I was going to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s925">They were Polish trains, and then they took away my brother from me.</span> <span id="s926">They put him in a different group across the street.</span> <span id="s927">They asked who is a tailor and a furrier and I was standing together and I raised my arm and I said "I am a furrier."</span> <span id="s928">And he raised his arm too and he said I am a tailor.</span> <span id="s929">They took him to the other group.</span> <span id="s930">They said that this group will go to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s931">Going to have a shop and the tailors and furriers are going to work for them and I was here.</span> <span id="s932">Here's what they did, they separate one brother from the other, a sister -- you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s933">They separated them.</span> <span id="s934">They took them away, they separated them.</span> <span id="s935">Then my brother says to me, come on, come over here.</span> <span id="s936">Come to me.</span> <span id="s937">How could I go to him.</span> <span id="s938">I was surrounded with the German soldiers with weapons.</span> <span id="s939">How could I jump over to his group.</span> <span id="s940">How could I do it.</span> <span id="s941">He was thinking that he heard that this train goes to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s942">If this train goes to Treblinka he knew that I was going to be dead.</span> <span id="s943">And I knew that he was going to be alive.</span> <span id="s944">That's why they're going to work for the German government as tailors and furriers.</span> <span id="s945">Then they changed their minds, the Germans.</span> <span id="s946">Instead of going to Treblinka, they took us to another camp, to _________________.</span> <span id="s947">They changed their mind.</span> <span id="s948">So, from ___________, I was there and from ____________ they put us to Maidonik and from Maidonik we went to Auschwitz and from Auschwitz we went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s949">I was in four camps.</span> <span id="s950">In Buchenwald I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">What happened with his group, they were supposed to go to ____________, too, his group, but to work for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q.</span> <span id="s953">How did you know about all these camps beforehand?</span> <span id="s954">You said, "I thought they would take to Treblinka."</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q.</span> <span id="s957">How did you know about all these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A.</span> <span id="s959">We had conversations with the people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q. With the Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s962">We had the conversations that this train will go to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s963">So, then I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q.</span> <span id="s965">But you already knew from your Polish contacts what Treblinka was.</span> <span id="s966">How did you know what Treblinka was?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A.</span> <span id="s968">We heard about it.</span> <span id="s969">We found out what Treblinka is from before, that Treblinka is a place where they put them in the gas chambers, and Birkenau too, they have the gas chambers, next to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s970">Birkenau was connected with Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s971">But it's a fact that I didn't see it before.</span> <span id="s972">I didn't see the ovens where they put the people into the ovens, how they killed them there.</span> <span id="s973">I just find out after the war when I was in Poland.</span> <span id="s974">I visited Poland and I went to Auschwitz and I saw these ovens.</span> <span id="s975">We couldn't see it.</span> <span id="s976">When I was in Auschwitz I couldn't see those ovens.</span> <span id="s977">They didn't show them to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q.</span> <span id="s979">You were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A. I'll tell you something else that they did in the concentration camps when the people arrived to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s981">They took away the children from the mothers from the parents.</span> <span id="s982">There was a French commander, they call it.</span> <span id="s983">They call it a French commander, from France they brought him over.</span> <span id="s984">They used to wear French berets, red berets, red shoes.</span> <span id="s985">Those are specialized, -- they give them the job to put the children in the ovens to burn them.</span> <span id="s986">That was the French commander's job.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q. Which camp are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A.</span> <span id="s989">This was a Maidonik.</span> <span id="s990">They did the same thing in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s991">This was their job to do it.</span> <span id="s992">The children taken away from their parents.</span> <span id="s993">With the women, they took away the women from the men, say it was a husband and wife.</span> <span id="s994">All the women they took away and they put them in separate blocks and they use them as prostitutes.</span> <span id="s995">They made prostitution places in the barracks for the women, which the soldiers they used them.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q.</span> <span id="s997">In Maidonik?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A. Yes, in Maidonik, and in Auschwitz too.</span> <span id="s999">It's a fact that some days they came to us, they invited us to go to those places if we want to we can go to Block Number four, and we can have a good time there.</span> <span id="s1000">We can use the women.</span> <span id="s1001">Every one was like a skeleton, he couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1002">You had no power to walk to go to a woman to use a woman.</span> <span id="s1003">It was a joke.</span> <span id="s1004">But they used them, the soldiers used them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">In one camp, in Maidonik, they had the Jewish from Warsaw, the kapos where I told you, the Germans they made a party in our block.</span> <span id="s1006">In our block they made just a party, you know, to drink to eat for them, and there was a boy -- I forgot his name, he was supposed to be hanged.</span> <span id="s1007">They were supposed to hang him up for something and then they asked the people from our, you know, who could sing.</span> <span id="s1008">I could sing.</span> <span id="s1009">I sang in a choir.</span> <span id="s1010">But he started to sing, that boy that was supposed to be hanged and he started to sing you know the song "Mama --" an Italian song, a nd he was singing so good that the Germans started to like it and the Germans said to him, you know something we're not going to hang you for that.</span> <span id="s1011">You are a good singer and we like the song and you know something from now on if we will make a party you'll come to our party and you will sing songs.</span> <span id="s1012">That's what happened and he saved his life this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q. Which of these camps were you in the longest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A.</span> <span id="s1015">The longest camp I should say I was in Buchenwald, but I was lucky in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1016">Why was I lucky?</span> <span id="s1017">They were looking for a tailor and there was another man, a little older than I was, a tailor.</span> <span id="s1018">We were laying on the beds and they said "Who is a tailor, raise your hand, raise your arm."</span> <span id="s1019">I raised my arm and the other fellow raised his arm.</span> <span id="s1020">But actually I wasn't a tailor.</span> <span id="s1021">I'm not a tailor, I am a furrier and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1022">If I tell him I'm a tailor I figure I'm afraid maybe he'll tell me "Look can you make a pair of pants for me or can you take in a jacket or something."</span> <span id="s1023">I didn't know this.</span> <span id="s1024">I took a chance -- they could hang me for that.</span> <span id="s1025">And he picked me and said, "You, you come out."</span> <span id="s1026">And I went out and he explained to me what I have to do.</span> <span id="s1027">You see when the people are going out to work, you go to every bed and see if the blankets have a rip or an opening and you close it up.</span> <span id="s1028">Oh, that's good.</span> <span id="s1029">That's a good job and since then I had good in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1030">I didn't go out for the countings, we used to go out in cold weather to count the people.</span> <span id="s1031">We used to count every day the people and they used to hang every day the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Before I got this job to stay in the block, not to go out, to fix the blankets, I used to go out, you know.</span> <span id="s1033">And I used to go out when they hung the people.</span> <span id="s1034">We had to salute, you know.</span> <span id="s1035">To salute means we had to take off the mitten, these berets that we used to wear and to stay straight and to salute.</span> <span id="s1036">We had 12,000 people at that time in that camp and I forgot, I concentrate on something and I forgot to take off that mitten.</span> <span id="s1037">An officer comes over to me and he tells me look, see everybody here?</span> <span id="s1038">Twelve thousand people, look, you are the only one that didn't take off the mitten.</span> <span id="s1039">I said, "Look officer, I was concentrating on my mother and my father, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">I was thinking about them and I just forgot.</span> <span id="s1041">I'm sorry."</span> <span id="s1042">He says, "Look, after we're finished here the things, this is my office there, you see, you come into the office."</span> <span id="s1043">I said okay.</span> <span id="s1044">I went into the office.</span> <span id="s1045">There was a kapo, the guy with the red hat, the red shoes and holding a stick, a heavy stick in his hands and he says he should give me -- I had to drop my pants and go into a special table, to bend down, and he had to hit me 50 times over my back side.</span> <span id="s1046">They had the rules at the time, the regulations the Germans that if they broke a stick they should stop it.</span> <span id="s1047">He broke the stick on 25 on me, that kapo.</span> <span id="s1048">And I was thinking I'm done.</span> <span id="s1049">He says to him take another stick and finish off on him fifty.</span> <span id="s1050">So, he took another stick and finished to 50.</span> <span id="s1051">That happened after that I got this job in the barrack and I had what to eat and I met that cook there and everything, he gave me soups.</span> <span id="s1052">I was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q.</span> <span id="s1054">You were in Buchenwald how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A.</span> <span id="s1056">A few months.</span> <span id="s1057">Maybe eight months, all together I was in those camps short times.</span> <span id="s1058">They send me from one camp into the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q. Which was the worst?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A. Maidonik.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q.</span> <span id="s1062">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A.</span> <span id="s1064">In Maidonik for every little thing they could kill you.</span> <span id="s1065">Some people some survivors, for little thing they tell them to run all around.</span> <span id="s1066">He was running so long until he fell and he collapsed.</span> <span id="s1067">If he didn't collapse they finished him up, not with weapons, but you try things, they beat him up until he died.</span> <span id="s1068">So, Maidonik I should say was a very, very bad camp.</span> <span id="s1069">In Maidonik, -- Dr. Mengala came to Maidonik.</span> <span id="s1070">He picked the people.</span> <span id="s1071">He was the expert on who was strong and who was weak.</span> <span id="s1072">Who was good for work, who is not good for work.</span> <span id="s1073">He picked -- he looked at the faces.</span> <span id="s1074">He walked by -- everybody had to come out and he picked ___________, ___________, _________ to die and ___________ to work.</span> <span id="s1075">He picked me to work.</span> <span id="s1076">I was strong at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q.</span> <span id="s1078">How did you know it was Mengala?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A. I heard the name.</span> <span id="s1080">It was Dr. Mengala.</span> <span id="s1081">He was the expert on picking strong people and who is strong and who is not good to work, and he picked us.</span> <span id="s1082">As in one camp I could see with the children what happened too, which we're not supposed to look out, to open a window to open a door to see what the French commander did to the children.</span> <span id="s1083">That was about two o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s1084">I looked out and I had seen how they took away the children.</span> <span id="s1085">They put them on trucks, the French commanders and they took them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">So, in Buchenwald -- actually I was liberated in Buchenwald, in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q. I want to ask you a little bit more about the other camps because this is really important information to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A. Maidonik was a very, very bad camp.</span> <span id="s1089">One of the worse camps was actually Maidonik and Maidonik was actually where they separate the women to make the prostitution houses for them.</span> <span id="s1090">That was in Maidonik.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q.</span> <span id="s1092">In terms of the general conditions was the food or the crowdedness or all of that the same in all of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A. Almost all the same.</span> <span id="s1094">They give you a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1095">A piece of bread was enough for the whole day.</span> <span id="s1096">They gave you one soup, a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s1097">That was actually good for the whole day.</span> <span id="s1098">We had the Hungarians in the camps.</span> <span id="s1099">What they did, the Hungarians, they saved the bread -- we had smokers, they smoked cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1100">They went to the toilets, to the men's room and smoked cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1101">But if they didn't have cigarettes, the Hungarians were organized and they had the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1102">What the people did, they didn't eat the bread.</span> <span id="s1103">They wanted to smoke so they went to the Hungarian people, went to the toilets, like a black market.</span> <span id="s1104">The guys were watching if the Germans are coming to the area.</span> <span id="s1105">They made a deal.</span> <span id="s1106">They used to roll the tobaccos.</span> <span id="s1107">They'd say, "How much?</span> <span id="s1108">I'll give you a piece of bread and you give me tobacco."</span> <span id="s1109">He said, "How much bread are you going to give me."</span> <span id="s1110">So the guy says, "Look, so much."</span> <span id="s1111">"Such a little piece of bread for tobacco.</span> <span id="s1112">That's not enough.</span> <span id="s1113">I want more."</span> <span id="s1114">So, they got a guy says, "Look until here, another piece, okay?"</span> <span id="s1115">And they made a deal.</span> <span id="s1116">Cigarettes for bread or bread for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1117">There was a black market in the men's room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q.</span> <span id="s1119">This was in Auschwitz or where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A.</span> <span id="s1121">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q.

For me I was trying to do the best by whatever they told me, I was trying good to talk nice to them, you know, to the kapos.</span> <span id="s1440">For instance in Buchenwald, two days before the war --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q. Perhaps you can tell me a little bit about Buchenwald because that's where you spent the most time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A. Buchenwald, a few days before the end of the war -- I didn't know that it was going to be a few days before the end of the war, but the manager our ___________ what we called it in German, was Polish.</span> <span id="s1445">He knew that it's going to take maybe two or three days it's going to be the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1446">But the Germans they still be looking around for the Jewish people to pull them out and to kill them.</span> <span id="s1447">There were a few mountains there.</span> <span id="s1448">They put them into the mountains there with machine guns and they finished them up.</span> <span id="s1449">Even at that time they knew it was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1450">So the Polish ____________, the manager from the block came to us and he knew that we are Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1451">We had a couple Gentiles there too, a few people.</span> <span id="s1452">And he says to us, he knew that we were Polish Jewish people and he says to us, "Look, pretty soon a German officer will come in here to the block and he's going to look for the rest of the Jewish people to take them out and to finish them."</span> <span id="s1453">He says, "I know that you are Jewish, Polish Jewish and I am trying to help you so now it's up to you.</span> <span id="s1454">You have to decide what to do, to stay in the block inside or to go out and hide yourself."</span> <span id="s1455">I decided to stay.</span> <span id="s1456">There were two brothers, their names was Vina, two brothers and they had longer nose than I had.</span> <span id="s1457">I had a short at that time little pointy nose.</span> <span id="s1458">So, he says to them, "Look, I know the Germans they know that the Jewish people have long noses.</span> <span id="s1459">And he will come into the block, the German officer, and he will look at you.</span> <span id="s1460">He'll take you out.</span> <span id="s1461">I don't want to be responsible.</span> <span id="s1462">That's why I tell you that."</span> <span id="s1463">That's what he says, the manager.</span> <span id="s1464">It was nice for him to tell that.</span> <span id="s1465">And they took a chance, the brothers and the others.</span> <span id="s1466">All others were standing up, the officer came into the block.</span> <span id="s1467">You had to stand in one line, you know, stand up, and he started to walk, walk and look at the faces.</span> <span id="s1468">He walked by me.</span> <span id="s1469">He looked at those two brothers, into the faces, look, look, and he let them go.</span> <span id="s1470">He walked by them.</span> <span id="s1471">He didn't take out a single person from the block.</span> <span id="s1472">They were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">So this was one thing.</span> <span id="s1474">Now a second thing.</span> <span id="s1475">The Polish manager, the ______________, said to us, "Look, it's going to be pretty soon the end of the war and you can do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1476">It's up to you.</span> <span id="s1477">If they get you, they'll get you.</span> <span id="s1478">Maybe somebody else will come in to look up to the people, to take them out."</span> <span id="s1479">What I did, I went under the block, to hide myself.</span> <span id="s1480">At that time it was raining and damp and wet underneath and I didn't eat, nothing.</span> <span id="s1481">We wanted to see the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1482">And I was laying there underneath and then a guy -- we couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s1483">It was underneath.</span> <span id="s1484">You couldn't stand up, nothing.</span> <span id="s1485">You had to lay there and one guy comes to me on his stomach, comes closer to me and he says, "Show me your hand."</span> <span id="s1486">And I showed him my hand and he started to do it like this and he started to do it like this, and I show him.</span> <span id="s1487">He said, "You know something, I think I don't have a watch.</span> <span id="s1488">We don't have watches, but roughly I would say about a half an hour we will be liberated."</span> <span id="s1489">I heard this, I thought to myself, what he's crazy!</span> <span id="s1490">How does he know.</span> <span id="s1491">And it was I should say about a half an hour and I hear screaming, hurray and this and that and we came out.</span> <span id="s1492">We came out.</span> <span id="s1493">There were Hungarian people but they came over to that person who told me that in half an hour we'll be liberated.</span> <span id="s1494">It came out that he was a rabbi from Budapest.</span> <span id="s1495">They start to kiss him, to grab him, the Hungarian people.</span> <span id="s1496">Then, came into the block, a rabbi ________________, he was an officer in the Seventh Army.</span> <span id="s1497">He wrote a book, "I Liberated Buchenwald."</span> <span id="s1498">That was him, and he came to our block with two Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s1499">They start to talk Jewish to us.</span> <span id="s1500">Now he wrote that book, "I Liberated Buchenwald" and he was in my synagogue as my rabbi invited him, and he had a speech.</span> <span id="s1501">He told the story that he liberated Buchenwald, what happened, and he said, "Is somebody here that was in Buchenwald?"</span> <span id="s1502">And I stood up and I raised my arm.</span> <span id="s1503">He said, "Oh, come on up."</span> <span id="s1504">I went to the stage and he says, "See, I have a live witness."</span> <span id="s1505">I said "Yes, rabbi, you're looking pretty good, you look good and that time you looking pretty good I recognize you.</span> <span id="s1506">You liberated my block.</span> <span id="s1507">You came into my block and that was block number one, it says it right on the corner."</span> <span id="s1508">And he says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1509">So, he was a guest in my synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">So, this was at that time the end actually of the war.</span> <span id="s1511">They find a lot of German soldiers on the towers.</span> <span id="s1512">They took them off and they took them away.</span> <span id="s1513">What they did with them, the Americans, that was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1514">What happened, I was looking to do something, to go out.</span> <span id="s1515">To do something, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1516">And I walked, walked with the two brothers that were in the same block.</span> <span id="s1517">We walked in the direction of _____________ in the city where Hitler built his Nazi party there.</span> <span id="s1518">I started to sing "Where shall I go, where shall I go."</span> <span id="s1519">I started to sing in Jewish ___________________, and I started to sing this song and a German woman heard me singing and she pulled me into the house.</span> <span id="s1520">She invited me, she wanted me to sleep over there, but I didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1521">I didn't know what was going to happen here.</span> <span id="s1522">We had to stay in the place, but she gave me to eat.</span> <span id="s1523">At that time she says "You're singing very nice.</span> <span id="s1524">I like your singing.</span> <span id="s1525">What are singing?"</span> <span id="s1526">So, then I had to go back.</span> <span id="s1527">I went back and the Seventh Army organized us and then they put us on trains and we went to Landsberg, our group went to Landsberg, which that was before a German camp and the Americans took away from them.</span> <span id="s1528">They should have a place where to put us in.</span> <span id="s1529">So, we went there and we lived there and the room where I was I had about six or seven people sleep in there, two beds.</span> <span id="s1530">That's the place where I met my wife, through somebody.</span> <span id="s1531">That's the camp I was and I took, I had a job at that time, they give me a big job I should take care that the camp should be clean.</span> <span id="s1532">I took over this job, to take care, to be the manager, that the camp should be clean.</span> <span id="s1533">Clean the steps, rooms and everything.</span> <span id="s1534">Then I took over, which I have the picture I think with me.</span> <span id="s1535">General Lucius Clay came into the camp and I started to look and he liked the job that I did, and there was a chief of police, which he didn't want to be anymore the chief of the police.</span> <span id="s1536">He went to the United States.</span> <span id="s1537">He went through the trouble to go to America.</span> <span id="s1538">I took over as an assistant from him his job which Lucius Clay gave me the job.</span> <span id="s1539">I have the picture here.</span> <span id="s1540">I think I should have the picture here with another fellow, which he was a sergeant with me.</span> <span id="s1541">We made a picture and the guy who introduced me to my wife.</span> <span id="s1542">He was in the picture.</span> <span id="s1543">He was in the police department.</span> <span id="s1544">It's a fact that he's in Israel now and here I think a sewing factory.</span> <span id="s1545">I was looking up for the other sergeant who I was with him, I went to New York and I came to the United States and I couldn't find him.</span> <span id="s1546">I was looking for him.</span> <span id="s1547">I couldn't find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q. Let me ask you a few questions about your liberation in Buchenwald and then I want to ask you about Landsberg as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q.</span> <span id="s1551">When you were liberated did the prisoners try to retaliate at all against the German guards?</span> <span id="s1552">Was there any of that or were had they gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A. No, they grabbed a few of them.</span> <span id="s1554">Actually, they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1555">What could they do with them.</span> <span id="s1556">They gave them to the Americans, to the Seventh Army, to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1557">Whatever they did with them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1558">They actually, they didn't kill them right away, right there, with machine guns.</span> <span id="s1559">Whatever happens with them, they just got them and that's it, as prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q.</span> <span id="s1561">Did the American soldiers feed you?</span> <span id="s1562">Did they give you medical --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1564">They took maybe not even an hour, trucks came into that camp with a lot, a lot of food, all kinds of food.</span> <span id="s1565">It's a fact that people were eating so much that they would die and they would choke themselves and they died from overeating.</span> <span id="s1566">That's what happened right there, right in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1567">That's how much food they got.</span> <span id="s1568">They give us plenty to eat, plenty, from everything.</span> <span id="s1569">Yes, they bring in medicines and everything, doctors, everything.</span> <span id="s1570">It didn't take long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q.</span> <span id="s1572">Did you go through a process.</span> <span id="s1573">I mean did they clean you, did they delouse you, any of that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A. No, actually, not specially.</span> <span id="s1575">They took us away.</span> <span id="s1576">They give us in Landsberg, it was everything.</span> <span id="s1577">In the kitchen they give us to eat, everything was organized there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q.</span> <span id="s1579">How long were you in Buchenwald after liberation before you went to Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A.</span> <span id="s1581">A short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q.</span> <span id="s1583">A few weeks or a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A. Not a few days, the same day they took us away.</span> <span id="s1585">We didn't go back to the barracks to sleep.</span> <span id="s1586">Oh no, it was finished.</span> <span id="s1587">I don't know if everybody went to Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1588">Some of them went to Salzheim, you know.</span> <span id="s1589">They separated two groups I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q. Do you remember how you were feeling when you got liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A. Like I was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q.</span> <span id="s1593">How you were feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A.</span> <span id="s1595">The feeling was -- I had a bad feeling, I had nobody.</span> <span id="s1596">I lost the whole family.</span> <span id="s1597">That's what I was thinking.</span> <span id="s1598">That was the first thing, that I was left alone.</span> <span id="s1599">That was the worst thing to me.</span> <span id="s1600">So, I suppose to go at that time to Treblinka on the train and you see I was one of the lucky ones, but how good is it that I lost a whole family.</span> <span id="s1601">I was left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q.</span> <span id="s1603">Did you have thoughts about trying to go back to Warsaw and find people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A. Actually I wanted to go back to Warsaw to find out, you know, but I knew, I knew that I wouldn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s1605">I knew what happened with them.</span> <span id="s1606">They were all dead.</span> <span id="s1607">The only thing that I was thinking was maybe go back to Warsaw and ask, maybe go to the government and maybe they have some records or something, but my brother, that was the only thing.</span> <span id="s1608">But I figured, who am I going to ask.</span> <span id="s1609">You see, the Germans, they destroyed the documents.</span> <span id="s1610">They destroyed everything.</span> <span id="s1611">No records.</span> <span id="s1612">So, I didn't want to go back, but I went back but it was with my group, with my synagogue, my rabbi.</span> <span id="s1613">We went back now about three years ago.</span> <span id="s1614">We went back to Warsaw and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q. Before we talk about Landsberg, is there anything else you want to add about Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1617">The last few days in Buchenwald before the end of the war, I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1618">They took me out to work and I worked in a certain place there and we had a guard, a German soldier with the machine gun watching us, we should run away.</span> <span id="s1619">We were working there and one guy was sick and tired, he couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s1620">So, what happened, they had the rule at that time, the Germans, if you walked away from the place where you worked, say you worked in this area.</span> <span id="s1621">When you start to walk away 50 feet the soldier had the right to shoot the person, to kill him.</span> <span id="s1622">So, that guy, one guy was tired.</span> <span id="s1623">He didn't care.</span> <span id="s1624">He started to walk away from the place where he did the work.</span> <span id="s1625">So, that German soldier who was watching us went to that guy.</span> <span id="s1626">He walked about ten, fifteen feet away already and he wanted to start to walk, so he started to walk, so that soldier walked over to him and he says to him, "Why are you walking away from the place where you work.</span> <span id="s1627">You know I have the right to shoot you if you walk 50 feet away from the place you work."</span> <span id="s1628">He says, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s1629">Shoot me.</span> <span id="s1630">I'm sick and tired of it already.</span> <span id="s1631">I want to die."</span> <span id="s1632">He says, "You're foolish.</span> <span id="s1633">The war will take another few days.</span> <span id="s1634">It's going to be the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1635">Why do you do this.</span> <span id="s1636">Don't do this.</span> <span id="s1637">Come back."</span> <span id="s1638">And he walked back to the place.</span> <span id="s1639">That was very nice from that soldier to tell him that.</span> <span id="s1640">He didn't want to shoot him.</span> <span id="s1641">He didn't want to kill him.</span> <span id="s1642">It's a fact that a few days later it was the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q.</span> <span id="s1644">Did you think the end of the war was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A.</span> <span id="s1646">If the war was coming do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q.</span> <span id="s1648">Did you think the war was going to end soon, did you think maybe finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A. That's what I heard, and I heard from that guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q. I wanted to ask you about Landsberg, but first is there anything else you want to fill in from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A.</span> <span id="s1652">If you want to know about the rabbis, I'll tell you what happened with the 11 rabbis.</span> <span id="s1653">They were rabbis usually from Europe.</span> <span id="s1654">They came, most of them, from small towns and they settled in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1655">You don't know those towns, if would be somebody from Poland I would tell them, from what of towns they settled in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1656">The rabbi who lived in my apartment building, he was there too, with the eleven.</span> <span id="s1657">There were a lot of other rabbis, very popular rabbis in Poland.</span> <span id="s1658">They're not the rabbis you have here.</span> <span id="s1659">Here the rabbis in the United States, they have money.</span> <span id="s1660">They invest in properties.</span> <span id="s1661">They invest in land.</span> <span id="s1662">All those kind of things.</span> <span id="s1663">They live good.</span> <span id="s1664">They have luxury homes.</span> <span id="s1665">The rabbis in Europe, say in Warsaw, they were very poor, poor rabbis.</span> <span id="s1666">They had a hard time even to organize some food.</span> <span id="s1667">They had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1668">So, if you came into a rabbi at that time into his apartment, his office, they were stinking -- it smelled from the books, from the things from the learning.</span> <span id="s1669">They used to learn day and night, and poor.</span> <span id="s1670">They had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">So, what happened with those rabbis, they took them out from the attic.</span> <span id="s1672">They told them to take off their clothes, all naked.</span> <span id="s1673">They put them against that particular wall and they shoot them with the machine guns, they finish them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q.</span> <span id="s1675">Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A. Yes, I saw it.</span> <span id="s1677">This was when I was in the center street.</span> <span id="s1678">I told them when they took me out, they took them out from the attic too, at the same time, and I watched it and I could see how they shoot them with a machine gun, all eleven rabbis.</span> <span id="s1679">At that time people start to ask question "Where's God, where was God, where is God?"</span> <span id="s1680">Highly rabbis, strictly highly rabbis, poor people.</span> <span id="s1681">They would learn day and night and why did God let them do it.</span> <span id="s1682">Why didn't God show a miracle at that time to save those rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q. And Warsaw was burning all around you, or the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A. Sure.</span> <span id="s1685">Then they burned everything.</span> <span id="s1686">The whole area was burning at that time.</span> <span id="s1687">Then they took us and put us on the trucks and that was it.</span> <span id="s1688">We went to the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q. Do you remember what you were thinking at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A.</span> <span id="s1691">What I was thinking?</span> <span id="s1692">What could I think at that time?</span> <span id="s1693">Nothing good.</span> <span id="s1694">All bad.</span> <span id="s1695">I was thinking what are they going to do with us next, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q. From Warsaw to the various camps you were sent to, at what place did you think that this might really be the end for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A. I didn't know that this is the end.</span> <span id="s1698">I expect it's going to be very, very bad, after they took us out.</span> <span id="s1699">We were fighting against them.</span> <span id="s1700">What could I expect good here?</span> <span id="s1701">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1702">I expect actually the worst, but I didn't know what's going to be.</span> <span id="s1703">I was thinking maybe they were going to take us to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q. Was there a time when you were more afraid than another time or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A. I tell you about the same.</span> <span id="s1706">You could never tell what the Germans are going to do next, what they're going to do next.</span> <span id="s1707">It was very hard to predict things like that.</span> <span id="s1708">Nothing good.</span> <span id="s1709">You couldn't predict nothing good.</span> <span id="s1710">Everything bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q.</span> <span id="s1712">There was never an especially close call?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q.</span> <span id="s1715">How was the life in Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A. Life in Landsberg?</span> <span id="s1717">In the beginning it was hard.</span> <span id="s1718">I had to look around what to do after the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1719">I was poor.</span> <span id="s1720">I had nothing, almost naked, nothing to wear.</span> <span id="s1721">I had to look around what to do.</span> <span id="s1722">So, you know, I came out from it.</span> <span id="s1723">That's it.</span> <span id="s1724">The only thing I was glad you know and happy to find somebody from my family, my cousin.</span> <span id="s1725">I was happy really.</span> <span id="s1726">I wouldn't believe that I'm going to have another Svibaum, my family.</span> <span id="s1727">I find him -- actually he find me.</span> <span id="s1728">I didn't find him.</span> <span id="s1729">I would never find him.</span> <span id="s1730">How could I find him.</span> <span id="s1731">I changed from Svibaum into Baum.</span> <span id="s1732">But he changed from Svibaum into Svibon.</span> <span id="s1733">I would never find a Svibon into a Svibaum.</span> <span id="s1734">I wouldn't find him, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q. Was Landsberg well organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1737">I organized a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1738">First of all, in Landsberg, the camp was clean like a whistle under my management.</span> <span id="s1739">Then he give me another job, Lucius Clay, the general.</span> <span id="s1740">He came in.</span> <span id="s1741">He liked it.</span> <span id="s1742">He liked my job what I was doing, and it's a fact that I have papers from Landsberg which it's written that I am one of the best workers in Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q. Were there schools and training for people?</span> <span id="s1744">Tell me a little bit about the camp itself, the life there, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A. Nothing actually.</span> <span id="s1746">It was nothing.</span> <span id="s1747">They were eating and eating, drinking and eating and that's it.</span> <span id="s1748">Everybody was trying to organize themselves.</span> <span id="s1749">To meet girls, to meet boys, to get married, things like that.</span> <span id="s1750">So, that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1751">The Americans didn't send them to work.</span> <span id="s1752">This was only a short time.</span> <span id="s1753">That's why everybody was trying to find some way to make a living and to meet people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q. Were there vocational training schools or anything like that in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A. Actually what I know now I didn't see anything.</span> <span id="s1756">They organized -- they made the police department.</span> <span id="s1757">We should watch if something happens to the Germans to find, you know, some spies or whatever.</span> <span id="s1758">There was the police department and the cleaning department.</span> <span id="s1759">There was a big kitchen for the people together to eat.</span> <span id="s1760">The Americans, they supplied a lot of food.</span> <span id="s1761">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q. Were you living in houses or in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A.</span> <span id="s1764">We were actually living, it was actually I wouldn't say barracks.</span> <span id="s1765">They were like apartments, the building.</span> <span id="s1766">What they put a lot of people into one room and a few beds into one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q.</span> <span id="s1768">Who ran the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A.</span> <span id="s1770">The camp?</span> <span id="s1771">Well, there was Americans, Americans they took care of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q.</span> <span id="s1773">Did people start celebrating Jewish holidays?</span> <span id="s1774">Did all of this start taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A.

So, where did you go after Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A.</span> <span id="s1794">After Landsberg I went to Salzheim where I met my wife.</span> <span id="s1795">From there I moved to Munich.</span> <span id="s1796">I went to Munich I start to work, to make some money.</span> <span id="s1797">I started to make coats, rabbit coats.</span> <span id="s1798">The rabbit coats were in style at that time, grey coats.</span> <span id="s1799">The American Army, the American soldiers, they met the German girls and I made the coats for them, and I made the coats for them, for the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1800">They paid me with scripts, the soldiers, they get scripts in the Army, not dollars at that time.</span> <span id="s1801">I changed the scripts for dollars.</span> <span id="s1802">That's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q.</span> <span id="s1804">How were your relationships were the German population at that time?</span> <span id="s1805">Did you have contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A.

I had very, very difficult experiences, which I don't believe myself that I'll be able to take it.</span> <span id="s1822">The worst thing for me is that I lost a family.</span> <span id="s1823">That is the worst thing for me and I had to hope and the way somebody told me when I went to Atlantic City -- I used to go to Atlantic City, there I met somebody sitting on a porch.</span> <span id="s1824">I rented an apartment at that time.</span> <span id="s1825">Somebody was sitting on a porch and he asked me my name, from where I am, you know, and I told him.</span> <span id="s1826">I described to him my brother, how my brother looked and everything.</span> <span id="s1827">He was a furrier.</span> <span id="s1828">He says to me, "You know something, the way you tell me about your brother, the way you describe him, I met a man in Sweden, and I think that this must be your brother.</span> <span id="s1829">The way you tell me about your brother.</span> <span id="s1830">He was a furrier.</span> <span id="s1831">He was from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1832">And the way you describe to me the way he looked, his height and everything, that this is your brother, and I was talking with him.</span> <span id="s1833">And your brother says to me, you know something, I don't like it here.</span> <span id="s1834">I'm going to move from here.</span> <span id="s1835">And he just went someplace.</span> <span id="s1836">I don't know what happened with him."</span> <span id="s1837">That's it.</span> <span id="s1838">So, I was thinking that in the way that he was so sure that this is my brother that he's alive.</span> <span id="s1839">And I started to look for him at that time.</span> <span id="s1840">I started to search.</span> <span id="s1841">The Red Cross and different organizations.</span> <span id="s1842">You know, wherever I had a chance that's what I did, until now.</span> <span id="s1843">He didn't show up yet.</span> <span id="s1844">After so many years so I don't know what I shall say.</span> <span id="s1845">I don't know if I could still find my brother after so many years.</span> <span id="s1846">And the way I look for him, maybe he would look for me too, the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q.</span> <span id="s1848">How important was religion to you throughout all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A. Not so important, the religion, after all, after those things happened.</span> <span id="s1850">I stopped to believe in that.</span> <span id="s1851">First of all, how could God do something like this to let kill so many people, such high people, rabbis, distinguished people and good people.</span> <span id="s1852">They didn't kill.</span> <span id="s1853">They didn't rob.</span> <span id="s1854">Why?</span> <span id="s1855">So, at that time a lot of Jewish people they stopped just believing in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q. Does being Jewish mean anything to you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A. Today?</span> <span id="s1858">Look, I know I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1859">I was Jewish for so many years, and I like to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1860">I have to believe.</span> <span id="s1861">You have to believe in something, especially I had a very religious family, believers.</span> <span id="s1862">They believe in God.</span> <span id="s1863">I was seven years old and I used to go already with my father to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1864">When I was seven years old, and I was learning and I study Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1865">I study the Bible and I know a lot about it.</span> <span id="s1866">So, I started to believe in it, but what I saw, you know, what I experienced, I just couldn't figure out what happened.</span> <span id="s1867">How to believe in those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q.</span> <span id="s1869">But you do again.</span> <span id="s1870">What you're saying is it's part of you?</span> <span id="s1871">Was it difficult to begin a new after all of this, to start your life again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A.</span> <span id="s1873">After the concentration camps you mean?</span> <span id="s1874">It wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s1875">It was hard, but I find a job in Germany, I find a job.</span> <span id="s1876">I lived in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1877">Frankfurt was very close to Salzheim.</span> <span id="s1878">When they closed up Salzheim, the camps, and the Americans I guess they made some kind of an agreement to give back to the Germans, I think, the camps.</span> <span id="s1879">This was a temporary.</span> <span id="s1880">I found a job in Frankfurt and I worked for a German furrier there.</span> <span id="s1881">I wanted to make some money.</span> <span id="s1882">So, he paid me in German money, not too much, a little bit, but anyway, as long as I find something to do.</span> <span id="s1883">He was so friendly with me.</span> <span id="s1884">He got so friendly with me that at lunch time we used to play ping pong in his attic.</span> <span id="s1885">And when I left Frankfurt he says to me, I said I'm going to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1886">I am going to go to America.</span> <span id="s1887">He says, "Look, when you will make $100 a week, you let me know.</span> <span id="s1888">You call me and I will close my business and I will go to the United States if you make $100."</span> <span id="s1889">When I made the $100 a week in the United States, I called him up and I told him, "Look I'm making $100 a week are you going to come to the United States?"</span> <span id="s1890">He says, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1891">I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s1892">I'm going to stay here."</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q. Let me ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s1894">Have you thought about sort of what the long term effect of all of these experiences has been on your life.</span> <span id="s1895">I mean besides losing your family, and i Know that's the most significant, but the way that you've lived your life since then, when you came to America, you had a wife.</span> <span id="s1896">You had children.</span> <span id="s1897">Can you think of ways that those earlier experiences effected the way you live now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A. Yes, I tell you it's very hard to forget the experiences from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1899">I will never forget that, and we shouldn't forget it.</span> <span id="s1900">That's what we should do.</span> <span id="s1901">It's very hard to forget the experiences from the ghettos, from the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q. Because you think about it, I'm sure, daily, did that impact the way you did a certain thing, the way you worked, the way you raised your children?</span> <span id="s1903">Is there ways that maybe you acted differently than somebody who didn't go through that, do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A.</span> <span id="s1905">The time I'm here in the United States, I say that the American people are just lucky people.</span> <span id="s1906">They didn't live through that.</span> <span id="s1907">They are really lucky people.</span> <span id="s1908">It's a miracle I tell you what happened, that the Germans lost the war.</span> <span id="s1909">The Germans, they almost occupied Russia and Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1910">Stalin actually I should say as bad as he was I think he saved the world.</span> <span id="s1911">He started to push the Germans back from Stalingrad all the way to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1912">If the Germans would occupy, they would take Russia, the world would be lost.</span> <span id="s1913">So, the Americans are just lucky people, I tell you, that they didn't live through that and they didn't see that and didn't know that, what happened in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">The worst spot was Poland, I don't know what happened in Hungary, but in the way I heard after I read the stories that Poland was the worst spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q. Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A.</span> <span id="s1917">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1918">There's actually no end to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q. Are there images that still linger with you after 50 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A. Yes, it's still in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q.</span> <span id="s1922">A specific image?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A. Still in my mind.</span> <span id="s1924">I can never forget, you know.</span> <span id="s1925">Those people, as long as they're going to live, I guarantee you, they'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s1926">It's always going to be in their mind.</span> <span id="s1927">A very bad, very bad experience.</span> <span id="s1928">And they shouldn't forget it, and we shouldn't forget that, and don't let it happen again.</span> <span id="s1929">That's important.</span> <span id="s1930">It could happen again.</span> <span id="s1931">So, that's the story of my life.</span> <span id="s1932">Not stories from the books or the papers, but stories of what I lived through, and I'm the live witness, as the rabbi said to me.</span> <span id="s1933">He says, "I have here a live witness."</span> <span id="s1934">And he liberated Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q. Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
