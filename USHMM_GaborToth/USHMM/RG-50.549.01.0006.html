My name is William Loew.</span> <span id="s3">They call me Bill and I am not being interviewed for my after the liberation part where I was liberated after 1945, April 23, 1945.</span> <span id="s4">It was a glorious day then and it's a great day today after so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q. I want to go back just a little bit before that day, April 23, and ask you because I wasn't completely clear from the interview earlier how long were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A. Well, I arrived in Auschwitz on the day of my birthday and that was October 29, 1944 and I came from Budapest, from Hungary.</span> <span id="s7">That was the time where I was imprisoned by when I try to flee Hungary into Rumania.</span> <span id="s8">I was sent by the underground organization that I used to work for.</span> <span id="s9">At that time I was a courier for that organization.</span> <span id="s10">I was caught on the border and brought back through different parts of Hungarian cities until they brought me back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s11">That's where I used to live for basically a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">I arrived in Budapest I think I escaped from Poland through Slovokia and then finally arrived in Hungary and from that city which I don't recall this point in time.</span> <span id="s13">I was brought back to Budapest where I was received by some people who used to deal with the refugees and I received my papers.</span> <span id="s14">A refugee from Poland and I wanted to make sure that my status is a Gentile rather than Jewish for very obvious reasons.</span> <span id="s15">And the papers actually were falsified and my name was Budinski Neokivchov where I held that name after a very good friend of my from Poland from _________________.</span> <span id="s16">So, I had those remembering days, those days actually are kind of vivid in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q.</span> <span id="s18">You said you don't have a lot of memories of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A. Very little.</span> <span id="s20">For a reason that I don't understand it and maybe I'm trying to block it off subconsciously or not.</span> <span id="s21">I don't know.</span> <span id="s22">I remember certain events.</span> <span id="s23">I remember events when I was going through the gate to so called -- that's a very vivid recollection in that we were going through the gates and there was an orchestra that was actually playing most of the time Sousa's march and we had to keep our step with that march beat.</span> <span id="s24">That was one of those events that I recall.</span> <span id="s25">The other things that I recall that I had some sores on my neck and I couldn't clean them up or didn't have the medicine or didn't have the gauze didn't have the things to keep them clean and I didn't have any choice but to go to the clinic and the clinic was a notorious place not to go for reasons that all kinds or rumors were among us, among the inmates.</span> <span id="s26">But I went there and to my surprise to m pleasant surprise I met my doctor, my physician from Lamberg who was also there as a prisoner and he recognized me and he helped me out with those sores.</span> <span id="s27">We had very little things to say to each other than he wished me luck and I wished him luck and hopefully we will meet again which we never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">This is other event that I recall.</span> <span id="s29">The other event was that there was five police escapees that escaped from Auschwitz, I think there were five and we were -- they caught them and brought them back to the camp and that was the day that we were waking up at night and we had to stay outside.</span> <span id="s30">It was winter time.</span> <span id="s31">I don't recall whether this was December or January.</span> <span id="s32">I think it was December.</span> <span id="s33">It was already cold and it was already winterish.</span> <span id="s34">A lot of snow already on the ground.</span> <span id="s35">See Auschwitz is on the western part of Poland and it's pretty cold there.</span> <span id="s36">So, it was probably the end of December and we were outside.</span> <span id="s37">Apparently not knowing what was going to happen, but rumors were that there will be a public hanging and this is what happened.</span> <span id="s38">At dawn those five Polish men got hung.</span> <span id="s39">Before they were hung, I heard distinctly their outburst and their slogans for independent Polish state.</span> <span id="s40">Down with the tyranny and so on and then they were hung.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">We were outside basically almost all night and we were basically almost numb but only by the event that was shown to us but the physical endurance during the winter time it was quite vivid event.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q.</span> <span id="s43">They made you watch the hanging?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s45">It was a lesson apparently for them to show to us what would happen if anyone would escape from the camp.</span> <span id="s46">Besides it was very difficult to escape.</span> <span id="s47">There were no cases that I know of to escape out of the Auschwitz camp.</span> <span id="s48">First of all, the camp was surrounded by barb wires that were electrified with high voltage that it was impossible.</span> <span id="s49">The only way you could possibly escape would be from some kind of outside work outside the camp that you could probably sneak out, but I don't know of any cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q. Was there any physical abuse?</span> <span id="s51">Did you have anything happen to you while you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A. No, I was never abused per se, other than that general day by day intolerance and lack of food, lack of clothing, lack of sanitary provisions.</span> <span id="s53">There was one other event that I recall and that was something very interesting to me and to many other of my status because I didn't know that I was a ____________.</span> <span id="s54">A _______________ is a person who apparently by the status of the German or the camps regulations I was a person who has certain knowledge about things that they need to extract from me.</span> <span id="s55">Because when I was caught on the boarder between Hungary and Rumania, it was the time that they tagged me as a spy.</span> <span id="s56">And being as a spy I must have certain information, although they tried to extract this information back in ____________, that was one of the areas where they held me for a few days before they brought me back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s57">I didn't have basically any information for them, but they didn't know that.</span> <span id="s58">They felt I had a lot of information.</span> <span id="s59">I was a young fellow.</span> <span id="s60">I think I was 17 or 18 years old, but they felt that they had information.</span> <span id="s61">So, when they brought me from Hungary, from Budapest, it was a prison for political people, used to call it -- what was the name of it -- I forget.</span> <span id="s62">When they brought me from that political prison from Budapest to Auschwitz they gave me a special number, 193229, without any prefixes and that was a number that was assigned basically to all those _________________, all people, prisoners that need to be preserved for a later time to extract certain information.</span> <span id="s63">But that was to my benefit because when there was a selection one day where they were selecting certain people, not knowing where they were going to go and I was selected to that group that I had to go somewhere, frankly I don't know where, they pulled me out because of my number.</span> <span id="s64">That was the first time I realized that I'm a ________________ and everyone else was curious about it and when they looked at my number they said oh, you are a __________________.</span> <span id="s65">You are a person to be preserved.</span> <span id="s66">That made my day that I was lucky enough to have that number.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Other than those events, maybe there are some other events that I recall, very few.</span> <span id="s68">There was a friend of mine whom I was brought from Budapest also on the same train.</span> <span id="s69">There were only a few of us that we were brought from that prison.</span> <span id="s70">I think 13, that was the number that comes to my mind and ________ was another fellow that we befriended actually in that prison there in Budapest so we kind of stuck together making sure that we tried to survive.</span> <span id="s71">We were together and we tried to help each.</span> <span id="s72">I recall one day they were distributing bread extra bread to be consumed by us but the bread was very stale.</span> <span id="s73">As a matter of fact, moldy, and we were told later on that this bread was actually from another group from a train that was gathered from those who were not as lucky as we were and brought in directly to the chamber and that bread is being distributed now among other prisoners.</span> <span id="s74">There may be some other events but I don't recall.</span> <span id="s75">There are only flashbacks that come to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q. You're saying the bread was for people who ended up going to the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A.</span> <span id="s78">That bread used to belong to them and then this bread was collected and then distributed among the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q. Can you tell me about the circumstances that led up to liberation, the weeks, the time what you remember about just before liberation, where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A. Well, liberation was not on our minds because there was a very bleak conditions for that.</span> <span id="s81">I recall being in Flosenberg there was little thing that I remember out of Flosenberg.</span> <span id="s82">There was the only event in Flosenberg that I recall is when President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s83">That was the time when all hopes that we had kind of vanished.</span> <span id="s84">Somehow we were connecting with his longevity, with his presence with our liberation.</span> <span id="s85">So, when he died, the hope also died within us, at least with me.</span> <span id="s86">So, it was kind of a bleak day at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">I don't remember too much from Flosenberg.</span> <span id="s88">They gave us some camp money for the chores that we were doing over there and I don't recall the work that I had done for them, but I do remember I used to get some printed some type of camp money which I have it still.</span> <span id="s89">One mark, and I met since a man who actually used to be in Flosenberg and he found me or I found him through my daughter Jennifer, who works with the Holocaust Museum, and this man, his name is Harry _________, who was trying to find other inmates, others who were actually in Flosenberg and she overheard that and she pointed out to him about me.</span> <span id="s90">We got in touch and we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s91">He visited me here last year and he has great memories he recalled a lot of things I still don't understand, don't know what it was but he knows it.</span> <span id="s92">He remembers a train that came to Flosenberg from Auschwitz and he says that train and those people who were on the train was a sore lot.</span> <span id="s93">Very, very sore and hardly walking people.</span> <span id="s94">I was one of them, of that train.</span> <span id="s95">Because we were on that train in open carts that they hauled us from Auschwitz all the way through part of Poland, part of Germany through ___________.</span> <span id="s96">I don't know all these days how long we were there, but we were frozen.</span> <span id="s97">I developed a lot of frostbites on my feet and which I don't recall any more other than I still have those physical remains on my toes.</span> <span id="s98">But Harry, he remembers.</span> <span id="s99">He knows what shape we came in and I recovered and I recovered rather fast because when we were about to move out of Flosenberg I felt pretty good.</span> <span id="s100">I felt strong enough.</span> <span id="s101">It was probably April the 20th or so, in 1945.</span> <span id="s102">When the rumors were that we were moving out of this camp, Flosenberg, to Dachau and we would be traveling.</span> <span id="s103">So, I felt strong enough.</span> <span id="s104">I never met Harry on that and some of these columns that we were with the rest of my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">There was one young man also from Russia that I befriended, a very nice fellow, but his face colors were very grayish and he didn't look good to me at all and I wasn't sure whether he's going to survive this trip.</span> <span id="s106">But I stayed with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q.</span> <span id="s108">You took care of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A. Yes, I did, at time.</span> <span id="s110">Whenever he was really wobbly we were together and it was one of those nights that as we were walking and they gave us a rest and we would be resting in some of the ditches on the way to Dachau and it was one of those nights that he disappeared and I never found him.</span> <span id="s111">He was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q. Do you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A. No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s114">I never met him.</span> <span id="s115">I never found him.</span> <span id="s116">He just disappeared from me that night.</span> <span id="s117">That was the time that we were completely exhausted, everyone was exhausted so that few minutes that we had to rest we immediately fall asleep and strangely enough even until today when i am very tired and try to rest I have the same feeling of succumbing into that deep sleep that I had then.</span> <span id="s118">It's a good feeling in a way because at least now I don't have to wake up for the next walk.</span> <span id="s119">Here I am safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q.</span> <span id="s121">You have that feeling when you're really tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A. Right, right, and that still prevails.</span> <span id="s123">It's a very, very deep almost resigned feeling, and that still prevails.</span> <span id="s124">On the one hand that's the flashback that I usually get when I rest and just before I fall asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q.</span> <span id="s126">What kinds of associations does it have?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A.</span> <span id="s128">It is that trip.</span> <span id="s129">It is that trip that gives you being exhausted, having no hope, just walk and no hope for the future, although it's kind of mixed now other than you're very tired.</span> <span id="s130">But that flashback always comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q.</span> <span id="s132">How often do you have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A. Whenever I'm tired.</span> <span id="s134">Whenever I am very exhausted.</span> <span id="s135">In fact, working here in my vineyard it's a lot of work involved and that's when I'm ready to rest, when I'm ready to take a nap, that's the time it comes in, that undescribable feeling, and that probably remains for the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q. Tell me, you never made it to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A. Right, I never made it to Dachau, none of us made it to Dachau.</span> <span id="s138">The only time that I remember is that this was probably a very nice day.</span> <span id="s139">Obviously we were liberated.</span> <span id="s140">It was April 23, 1945.</span> <span id="s141">It was a beautiful day at that time as I recall for a number of reasons.</span> <span id="s142">We were on the way to Dachau and I don't recall too much about that other than as we were walking in those columns, all of a sudden we heard some roaring sounds, and these were actually the sounds from tanks.</span> <span id="s143">It was American tanks and before we knew that, there were the guards who were guarding us as we were walking, all of a sudden were running onto the forest because we were going through part of a forest.</span> <span id="s144">And they're running and apparently it was known already that the Americans are behind us and some of our inmates, some of colleagues were running after the guards.</span> <span id="s145">I wasn't capable.</span> <span id="s146">I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s147">Some people were in much better shape than I was.</span> <span id="s148">I don't recall from there on anything.</span> <span id="s149">Harry remembers alot of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q. What's the next thing that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A.</span> <span id="s152">The guards running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q.</span> <span id="s154">The American troops coming and what's your next memory after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A.</span> <span id="s156">The next memory was where am I and with whom do I associate.</span> <span id="s157">Very little other than we are all of a sudden in no man's land.</span> <span id="s158">Basically yes, we are happy, but how and where are we going to go, and I don't recall at that point anything other than seeing those tanks roaring and thrusting ahead into the columns were actually split on both side of the road and the tanks kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q.</span> <span id="s160">Did you have any interaction with the troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A. No, not at all.</span> <span id="s162">Not that I recall.</span> <span id="s163">Obviously we were very happy to see them.</span> <span id="s164">The only time that I recall of me walking into that village, and I think it was named ______________.</span> <span id="s165">That's the village that I recall.</span> <span id="s166">From there on I again, just a matter of recomposition of your own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q.</span> <span id="s168">When did you realize that you were free?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A. That's a good question.</span> <span id="s170">I wasn't sure.</span> <span id="s171">I'm not sure, but I was free I felt strange, but there's no question about it, I was free.</span> <span id="s172">The only question was from here on how do I recompose myself not knowing too much of where I was.</span> <span id="s173">What do I do from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q.</span> <span id="s175">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A. I didn't do too much.</span> <span id="s177">I went to this village and one of the houses that we stayed was which I recall very little, it seems to me that I ate but there is very little that I recall from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q. Do you remember your first meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A. I don't recall although I remember that that was the time that my stomach was really upset for a number of days because of the food I was consuming or the food I didn't consume.</span> <span id="s180">So, it was a number of days before I realized that I had to be a little more reasonable with my intake.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q.</span> <span id="s182">You were eating too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A. I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q.</span> <span id="s185">You just didn't feel good?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A. I didn't feel right.</span> <span id="s187">It was just a matter I needed more of a rest.</span> <span id="s188">Rest and to gather my thought and to reconstruct my whole system.</span> <span id="s189">My whole system was out of order.</span> <span id="s190">There was a time that I recall when I was in one working on a road with some other of my colleague and a jeep came through with American soldiers.</span> <span id="s191">There were three of them and they asked us certain questions and I was the only one that I had some knowledge of the English language, and they asked me whether I would like to join them because they're going to Bumberg, and not knowing where Bumberg was and not knowing where we are then, I felt that any place other than here would be an improvement.</span> <span id="s192">So, I said I would like to go with them, and they took me in that jeep and I recall that we were traveling for 10 or 12 hours overnight and they brought me to Bumberg, but they didn't know where to put me so they invited me to their shelters.</span> <span id="s193">It was a barracks.</span> <span id="s194">Barracks where the American G.I.s stayed.</span> <span id="s195">I remember this was the first division 16 Infantry and they invited me and I could communicate with them, and I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s196">I liked them.</span> <span id="s197">They liked me and they felt that they could use me for purposes because they did have a lot of German prisoners and I could help them in interpreting some of their cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">So, I became an interpreter and they gave me a uniform, a G.I. uniform --.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q.</span> <span id="s200">An American uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A.</span> <span id="s202">An American uniform, so I felt I was one of them and I stayed in their barracks.</span> <span id="s203">So, I wasn't a soldier but I was working for them.</span> <span id="s204">It was very interesting because I had now a chance to interrogate some of the German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">So, I worked there for a number of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q.</span> <span id="s207">What kind of questions would you ask them?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A. Well, basically those questions were related mostly to where they're from.</span> <span id="s209">Their ranks, how come they were in the area of Bomberg.</span> <span id="s210">Mostly they were from the east part of Germany.</span> <span id="s211">Some of them were from the south part of Germany.</span> <span id="s212">None of them had uniforms.</span> <span id="s213">They all were in civilian clothing, but they were actually German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">I don't recall of any SS people being interrogated, mostly ______________.</span> <span id="s215">It was questioned that they had to feel out apparently and to process some of these soldiers one way or another.</span> <span id="s216">They were not be released.</span> <span id="s217">They still had to be incarcerated for a time being but later on I remember a column of those Germans just left and maybe they went to a different camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q.</span> <span id="s219">What was your attitude towards them?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A. My attitude was ambilivent.</span> <span id="s221">I didn't compose myself yet.</span> <span id="s222">I wasn't sure what to do with my life and I was confused in many ways.</span> <span id="s223">I wasn't angry in that sense.</span> <span id="s224">It doesn't mean that I liked them.</span> <span id="s225">It was just a matter I didn't want to have anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s226">Not that they were responsible for what was done to me or my family, they may not have been responsible, I don't know.</span> <span id="s227">But I didn't have enough time to build up the anger.</span> <span id="s228">The anger was there but it was tame.</span> <span id="s229">That's the kind of attitude I had at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q.</span> <span id="s231">It was tamed?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A. Tamed yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q.</span> <span id="s234">You weren't allowing yourself --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A. I was controlled.</span> <span id="s236">I controlled myself a lot, so maybe because I was organized then.</span> <span id="s237">Maybe because of a lot of things that I wasn't sure what may happen or should happen to my life.</span> <span id="s238">But my main goal was not to be involved with things that will not relate to my life because I need to reconstruct my life.</span> <span id="s239">That was my main objective.</span> <span id="s240">How do you do that without any family, without any friends, without any advisors.</span> <span id="s241">You're on your own.</span> <span id="s242">You have seen a lot but that doesn't bring you to a point that you could do a lot with your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q.</span> <span id="s244">How did you go about reconstructing your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A. I was basically very methodical in doing things that I need to do.</span> <span id="s246">First thing after when I used to live on those barracks I felt first of all I had to get out of there and to see what other things I have to do outside the barracks.</span> <span id="s247">And it was a good feeling to be there, but on the other hand I had to get out of there and to join the other people who actually in town.</span> <span id="s248">Also Jewish survivors, and in fact there was a committee that organized in Bomberg and I joined that committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">In fact they issued identification card for all of us who were actually in the area of Bomberg and I got one.</span> <span id="s250">I still have it and in that picture that you identify yourself I was in that G.I. uniform and it gives you certain information, where I am from, where I was born, the date I was born, and that I am identified and that I'm registered in that Bomberg Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Then I found that while I was there I really didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s252">I was run down.</span> <span id="s253">It was a very false feeling that after the liberation everything is fine.</span> <span id="s254">Your system is fine, and this was a false signal.</span> <span id="s255">I wasn't fine.</span> <span id="s256">I was in fact in bad shape.</span> <span id="s257">I was run down, and I went to a doctor to find out whether or not what it is the problem that I am so run down.</span> <span id="s258">In fact I did have a case of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s259">I go back to a sanitorium to be taken care of and that was from Bomberg I left to a hospital -- sanitorium rather than a hospital, to bring back my health and I stayed there for more than a year before I got help.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q. Where was the sanitarium?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A.</span> <span id="s262">That was not far from Munich called _____________.</span> <span id="s263">In ___________ there were a number of us, none of whom I recall but there was one person that I met in ______________ whom I met in Budapest that was also in the same condition.</span> <span id="s264">He also got sick and he was trying to get better.</span> <span id="s265">So, I met him in Budapest and we all tried to survive in Budapest and it was a good meeting for him.</span> <span id="s266">We tried to recall the small events that we had together.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">______________was a sanitorium maybe held three to four hundred survivors.</span> <span id="s268">They were all in run down condition and it takes a long time to really recuperate.</span> <span id="s269">It took me more than a year to recuperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">But during that time of recuperation I took courses because I needed to get back into my schooling.</span> <span id="s271">So, I took the high school courses to finish up what I had to do, because my goal was back to the school, to college and to get a degree.</span> <span id="s272">____________ was not far from Munich where major universities were and when I finished my high school courses I took an entrance exam into ________________ which is basically the engineering college in Munich.</span> <span id="s273">I passed that and they took me in and from _________ to Munich was a train and it was __________ there while I was recuperating.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">And I went there for two years and then I finished only two years of the major science courses before I left for ___________.</span> <span id="s275">That's in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s276">There's another place where we would be getting rehabilitation.</span> <span id="s277">It was a welcome sign that I was already in much better shape than when I came into ___________ and I stayed there for a number of months.</span> <span id="s278">I still didn't finish my school.</span> <span id="s279">I wanted to finish my school.</span> <span id="s280">I took some other courses there in ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Then I got a call from a friend of mine and this time it was a call from Umberg and that was a name it was not camp but it was a major center for people -- for displaced persons who were trying to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s282">Again, they were trying to recruit some interpreters for American Embassy to help out the process for the displaced person.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">So, they recruited me as interpreter for those people.</span> <span id="s284">And there were all kinds of people there from different countries.</span> <span id="s285">There were Polish there were Russians and there were Slovaks and there were German Jews and so on, and the first thing they asked me to do is to interpret all their regulations into-- End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A. Interpret that and write them into those languages that that person may be more familiar.</span> <span id="s288">So, all the regulations I translated that.</span> <span id="s289">Some were in Yiddish, some were in Polish, some were in Russian and German.</span> <span id="s290">So, I translated all those regulations in a clear language so that they would be comfortable with because they were not knowledgeable in the English language.</span> <span id="s291">That was my job plus the job was that I would be in presence of the I call them ambassadors, when he was interviewing the prospective immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q. American?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A. American, yes.</span> <span id="s294">I stayed there for a number of months helping them out.</span> <span id="s295">There was actually three of them that I would work for.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q. Can I go back a little bit and just ask you between that job and before that job what did you do for money?</span> <span id="s297">How did you support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A. Well, during the time that I was in ____________ that already was subsidized by the German government and given the time when I was in ____________ and that was only a few months there was also subsidized by UNRO.</span> <span id="s299">This was United Nations Relief Organization.</span> <span id="s300">I think that's what they called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">So basically we were taking care of -- we didn't have any money but at least we were helped out by those organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q.</span> <span id="s303">Did you have any possessions?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A. I did not.</span> <span id="s305">I did not have any money.</span> <span id="s306">I did not have any possessions.</span> <span id="s307">I was -- I felt that I should have but I didn't.</span> <span id="s308">I was in process of getting there so it didn't bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q. Clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A.</span> <span id="s311">That was again helped out by the major organizations so I did not have any income.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q.</span> <span id="s313">What did you know about -- you hadn't heard what had happened to your older brothers or your mother.</span> <span id="s314">During that period did you try to find out what happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A. Well, my family was decimated so I didn't have any hope for Abe, which was my older brother.</span> <span id="s316">He was killed in Lamberg.</span> <span id="s317">My mother was taken away in one of the actions, meaning they taken away thousands and thousands of us and my mother was one of them that took her away not knowing where.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Most likely to one of the camps and we did have a camp in ______________ called _____________ camp.</span> <span id="s319">There were some massacres over there but only in terms of thousands but the real destruction camps were somewhere else, in Treblinka and some other camps that I don't even know.</span> <span id="s320">Now there were destruction camps in hundreds of thousands so I'm not quite sure but I think they took away my mother in one of those camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q.</span> <span id="s322">You weren't able to find out for sure what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A.</span> <span id="s324">There was no way to find out.</span> <span id="s325">The only time that I recall about my brother Eli who apparently was in __________ camp and I was told that he escaped and I tried to rescue him and I couldn't rescue him to bring him back to the place I worked in _________ fabric, that was in Lamberg, _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">I was one of the 40 Jews who were on the premises of that factory and when I found that when I heard that my brother Eli is in one of the ghettos during one of the actions that he's seeking my help, that was the time that I left the factory with armband using a W with a stamp of SS that I am in good standing working for the German ____________, German enterprises.</span> <span id="s327">I went to the ghetto to look for him and the way I understood from a lady where the place was apparently that Eli was supposed to be there and she told me that they took him away.</span> <span id="s328">I was too late, because I was going to bring him back to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">There were some other people on the premises but hidden in the factory.</span> <span id="s330">There was a wall constructed that I later found out and behind that wall were some members of the family of the friends who used to work there, and that was the time that I wanted to bring Eli to that place and most likely he would be able to work for us, but I was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">After the war, knowing how resourceful Eli was, I thought he may have survived.</span> <span id="s332">There were all kinds of rumors that someone saw him here or there and in fact I got a call, I got some information that Eli was seen somewhere in France, in Paris so I sent out all kinds of advertisements seeking him.</span> <span id="s333">I never got any answers to my search.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">So, I didn't find Eli.</span> <span id="s335">I knew about Abe that he was dead and my mother was gone to one of the transportation.</span> <span id="s336">The rest of the family, Aunt Miriam, she disappeared from us in the very early part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s337">So, the immediate family was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">The uncles and their families we were 80 people strong in our immediate family.</span> <span id="s339">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s340">So there was no hope for me to find anyone alive from Europe.</span> <span id="s341">The only ones that were left was one that I knew there was somebody in Argentina, Uncle ____________, and someone in Israel from my mother's side, the _____________ family and they were alive and it was later on that I got in touch with.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q.</span> <span id="s343">A little bit more about the job you had at the displaced persons camp in Homburg, but first I wanted to ask you -- Umberg, if you could tell me about some of the friends you made between the time you were liberated and the time you went to work at the displaced persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A. Well, the friends that I cultivated since 1945 were probably quite a few and frankly I don't know where they are although some of them are in Israel, some are in the United States.</span> <span id="s345">There was a fellow with whom we studied together for college.</span> <span id="s346">His name is _________, there were two brothers and they immigrated here to the United States.</span> <span id="s347">Another fellow who we studied also together he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s348">We kept some communication with each other.</span> <span id="s349">There's another fellow that I stayed with in ____________.</span> <span id="s350">His name is Rabinovitz and he left for Switzerland to continue to recuperate.</span> <span id="s351">Since that time he actually got married and he became a designer, a show designer and he was apparently quite successful in what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">I did get in touch with him a number of times.</span> <span id="s353">There are many acquaintances that I have and had but we are so far apart that we didn't continue to cultivate each other because of the daily things that we had to do on our own and frankly I don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s354">There was one fellow who actually I got in touch a number of times Max ______________ who is in New York and he is retired now and so we are still in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q. Can you pick up the story being in Umberg working -- and that's in Bavaria and that's 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A. 1948, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q. And you were working as an interpreter for the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q.</span> <span id="s360">What happened there and if you can pick it up from there and you continued to get your life together?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A.</span> <span id="s362">The work in Umberg was very interesting work.</span> <span id="s363">Apparently this was my first work place that I experienced in fact it was.</span> <span id="s364">It was very nice surrounding.</span> <span id="s365">It was an office, obviously.</span> <span id="s366">I had an embassy office that we were processing the displaced persons, people who were trying to immigrate to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">I used to work for three -- I really don't know what was their title and I should know but I forget.</span> <span id="s368">But I used to call them Ambassador, there was Ambassador Mochay from Massachusetts, Ambassador Moody and I think Ambassador Frank and they were all nice gentlemen that I used to work for.</span> <span id="s369">In fact when I was about to leave the embassy and to immigrate to the United States all of them gave me a letter of recommendation for me to continue in my work and wished me a lot of luck.</span> <span id="s370">Especially William Mochay from Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s371">Then I tried to get in touch later on and was very unsuccessful, I couldn't find him.</span> <span id="s372">He was a very dear person.</span> <span id="s373">A very nice man.</span> <span id="s374">He was very sensitive and he was very a no nonsense person but he was very human and very reasonable to the all the applicants that he was processing.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q.</span> <span id="s376">What was the camp like?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A.</span> <span id="s378">It wasn't a camp.</span> <span id="s379">It was a place, a building a huge building probably one time a German court or a German building that certain processes were conducted and it was taken over by the displaced people and an embassy was erected over there and they were processing those displaced persons.</span> <span id="s380">Thousands and thousands of those applicants were going through.</span> <span id="s381">For one thing, the regulations that were prevalent at that time that no person who was illiterate must enter the United States.</span> <span id="s382">The people who were actually in good standing without any conviction, who were not convicted and people who were able to work were eligible to enter the United States.</span> <span id="s383">It goes without saying that the people had to be healthy and had to go through certain physical examinations and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">These were the requisites and one of the requisites of course as I mentioned before is that they had to be literate and speak at least one language and must read that language.</span> <span id="s385">This is where I interpreted some of those regulations.</span> <span id="s386">Those applicants had to read in their chosen language and understood so that they could be productive citizens in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">There was one Jewish family that I recall that applied for United States and the way they were reading those regulations was suspicious by Mr. Mochay and he whispered to me saying that he doesn't think that they are reading those regulations and he was right.</span> <span id="s388">When I looked at them before they were sitting right in front of Mr. Mochay's desk, there were more fearful than anything else but they were not reading the regulations and I asked them in the Polish language whether they read the regulations in Polish and they say no.</span> <span id="s389">And I said well what language do you read and the woman said they don't read any of those that we have prepared for them.</span> <span id="s390">Then I turned some of these papers and some of the regulations that I wrote were actually in Yiddish which had also Hebrew lettering but they were in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s391">I was sure that they would read that and to my surprise they were looking at it and they didn't read that.</span> <span id="s392">So, they were -- it proved to me that they were illiterate.</span> <span id="s393">I looked at Mr. Mochay and I said I don't think that those people read any of those papers because they are unfamiliar with those languages, although they speak them, they don't read them.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Then I asked this woman what do they read and she said none of them and I looked at this man who had a beard and he appeared to me as a pious man and I asked him do you know how to ___________, which means do you know how to pray, in Hebrew, and he says yes.</span> <span id="s395">At that point I ran out of the office and looking for a Hebrew prayer book, whether or not he'll be able to read that.</span> <span id="s396">I open up the section where they have big lettering of _____________ and I brought this over and I showed it to him and I said read this.</span> <span id="s397">Do you know how to read this?</span> <span id="s398">And he says ____________.</span> <span id="s399">He read by heart rather than by the contents in the seder, the prayer book.</span> <span id="s400">When I went back to my ambassador Mr. Mochay, he said they don't speak any of those languages but they read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s401">And they did.</span> <span id="s402">He knew everything by heart and he passed the test.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q. And he went to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A.</span> <span id="s405">He was processed.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q.</span> <span id="s407">The whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A.</span> <span id="s409">The whole family because he was the household member and he was the one who would take care of the household family.</span> <span id="s410">There were some other acquaintances that I made in that embassy that I didn't know where they went.</span> <span id="s411">It was a short episode.</span> <span id="s412">It was a memorable episode.</span> <span id="s413">It was nice to work with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q.</span> <span id="s415">What were your goals at this point?</span> <span id="s416">It was 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A.</span> <span id="s418">It was 1948 and I kept on going, and now the goals that I had somehow to move out of Germany.</span> <span id="s419">The question is where do I go and obviously there is one possibility of us to go to Palestine which I got in touch with my cousin on my mother's side and he felt that the time was very bad at that time because the war was going on between the Israeli Jews and the Arabs.</span> <span id="s420">Another time that I felt that I may want to go possibly to Australia or United States but Mr. Mochay felt that I would have a good opportunities here in the United States.</span> <span id="s421">His name was Bill and occasionally I called him Bill but mostly Mr. Mochay.</span> <span id="s422">A very nice person, and he actually convinced me to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q.</span> <span id="s424">How did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A. I really don't know what he talked a lot, he talked a lot about the United States.</span> <span id="s426">That was his favorite topic and he also got in touch with a Jewish agency for them to sponsor me to come to the United States and that's what he did.</span> <span id="s427">The Jewish Agency actually sponsored me at his intervention I suppose because I never made that attempt, but he did.</span> <span id="s428">And so the papers went through without any problems and that year that was in '49 that I got my papers and Mr. Mochay interviewed me for this exit and it was a memorable day.</span> <span id="s429">I felt very good about it and I left and that was something in October 1949 that I left Umberg and all my acquaintances for Homburg and I boarded on a ship called General Hosey.</span> <span id="s430">It took us about 11 days, two stormy days and the ocean was kind of stormy but we finally arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s431">The process of entering as I recall was very simple.</span> <span id="s432">I didn't have any complications.</span> <span id="s433">My papers called for my name Willy Loew.</span> <span id="s434">That was the day when I went on a bus from New York port of entry and I arrived in New Jersey in Lindon New Jersey.</span> <span id="s435">There was two ladies that welcomed me from the Jewish agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">One of the ladies was named Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Slesinger and they were very nice ladies and they knew that I did not finish my schooling.</span> <span id="s437">They knew that I have some electronic background because of my schooling in Germany and the one thing that they wanted to make sure that I get a job and be on my own.</span> <span id="s438">That's exactly what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">It was that I joined a family in Roselle New Jersey, their name was Kohn and I tried to get a job immediately and I got a job as an electrician, as an assistant electrician and to work my way out and I was getting paid I think 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s440">That apparently was a good pay.</span> <span id="s441">So, by the time I finished a week I would getting paid like $25.</span> <span id="s442">I had to pay $25 to the Kohn family and that's what I got.</span> <span id="s443">I got paid $34.75.</span> <span id="s444">I owed them every week like a quarter.</span> <span id="s445">So, I didn't have any money per se and I asked Mr. White who was the owner of this electrical company if I could work some overtime to get some extra money, which he did and I worked there for a number of weeks.</span> <span id="s446">But there was a time where it was still difficult to work on those wages because I had to pay the $25 to that family of Kohn and I didn't want to be behind and I didn't have any extra money for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">So my goal at that point in time was first of all get a better job, or a little bit more money and then go back to school.</span> <span id="s448">Now, I used to live in Lindon, New Jersey and the colleges, there was one Rutgers University, and Newark College of Engineering.</span> <span id="s449">Newark College of Engineering also changed recently to New Jersey Institute of Technology but at that time was still Newark College of Engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">I inquired what are the prospects of me finishing my degree.</span> <span id="s451">They were good prospects but then I had to either go to school on a full time basis or go to school night time.</span> <span id="s452">So, it was obvious I had to go at night time and I could possible transfer all my credits from Germany onto this Newark College of Engineering which I wouldn't have had any problem of transferring those credits.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">But there again, it was tough for me because that was back in 1951, beginning of '51 that my health actually was again questionable.</span> <span id="s454">So, I went back to sanitorium.</span> <span id="s455">Again my health wasn't in good shape so I stayed there again for another few months before I regained my health.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">During that time again I was preparing myself to go back to school.</span> <span id="s457">New Jersey is a very good state.</span> <span id="s458">They picked up the tab of the hospital.</span> <span id="s459">They knew I didn't have any money and it was in the sanitorium ___________ in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s460">When I got out since I had some electrical background, I joined a company called American Company and they were dealing with television installations.</span> <span id="s461">That was the time at first, that was 1950 and '51 that was when a television became very popular and I joined them and I had a very good prospect of livelihood.</span> <span id="s462">At that time they offered me $1 an hour and that was pretty good in view of the fact that the expenses were high but I could live on that and I was saving some money, whatever I could to purchase a car because I needed a car to get places and also to go back to school.</span> <span id="s463">That was my goal.</span> <span id="s464">The goal was clearly defined that I needed to get to school and lived in New Jersey from Newark it was about maybe ten miles or more so the transportation with the bus would be very difficult and I felt that I needed to save on my health rather than on anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">So, I saved the money to purchase a car.</span> <span id="s466">I purchased a car, called Hudson.</span> <span id="s467">It was a low gravity car.</span> <span id="s468">It was built like a tank.</span> <span id="s469">It was guzzling a lot of gas but it was good.</span> <span id="s470">It was a nice car and then I was still looking for more of a challenge for myself in terms of finding work that would pay me more but more related to engineering because at that time even working for the ACE which is the American Company of Electronics, I think that's what they called themselves, the owner's name was Gene Brown.</span> <span id="s471">Although they gave me work basically installing antennas on a roof which was okay at the time, but I couldn't see a future in that and I told them so that I would like to work on a bench repairing television sets, which he did eventually and I was repairing television.</span> <span id="s472">It came in kind of easy for me.</span> <span id="s473">I was able to fix television reading on my own the technology of television.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Then I befriended a fellow who was already also a refugee but met him through another acquaintance.</span> <span id="s475">He used to work for General Instrument.</span> <span id="s476">General Instrument was a company that was building and designing television tuners, which is directly in the line I would have been for me working in an engineering atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">I took an entrance exam with that company and I passed and I was assistant engineer to a man who was designing television receivers, television tuners and shortly after I was in charge of television receivers and television tuners evaluating and testing them.</span> <span id="s478">While I was there, that was 1952 and 1953, I applied for admittance for Newark College of Engineering and while I was working during the day, I was able to go at night to school to complete my engineering degree.</span> <span id="s479">In 1955 I got my degree in engineering and from there on I was working with General Instrument.</span> <span id="s480">A very fine company in engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">I made very good friends there, in fact, friends that we are still together.</span> <span id="s482">Ron ______________ that later on from General Instrument from Elizabeth New Jersey we moved out to Newark New Jersey and I met him over there in this company which was a part of General Instrument and Sid ____________ who was a mechanical engineer.</span> <span id="s483">Sylvan __________ was an electronic engineer, Sid was a mechanical engineer.</span> <span id="s484">I myself was also an engineer working with them together designing television tuners.</span> <span id="s485">Well, they're all retired now and after four years of communication we're still together and occasionally get together on special events, mostly weddings and occasional visits from them and we visit them occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">The time flies back in a hurry because it's when you work for a certain company you continue, you need to expand your experience and I worked for General Instrument since 1952 until 1960 I think and at that time I recall that I got a call from a friend of mine who joined the Ford company in Philadelphia and he told me that there is an opening for a project at the Ford Company to do some design work and I felt that this would be an opportunity for me to join that company plus gaining some more experience in electronics.</span> <span id="s487">And I moved at that time from New Jersey to Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">This was a contract by Ford Company by the government, Spread Eagle, that's what they called it.</span> <span id="s489">That's how they had to hire so many people for this particular project.</span> <span id="s490">It happened so that the Ford Company lost the contract for a reason that I don't know and I felt that I'm not going to wait for another project.</span> <span id="s491">But that Ford Company and I was looking for another job and another opportunity came in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s492">In St. Louis a company called Emerson Electric were designing fire control systems for B-58.</span> <span id="s493">So they were recruiting engineers and I applied for that position and I worked there in Emerson Electric for a number of years.</span> <span id="s494">At least three years I think.</span> <span id="s495">This was '59 to 1962.</span> <span id="s496">And I gained a lot of experience there.</span> <span id="s497">And the engineers at that time were known as the gypsies because they were moving from place to place and I was offered another position in Indianapolis in Indiana to work for the Mallory Company.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">They were building at that time in Mallory batteries and components for electronic systems.</span> <span id="s499">They wanted to go into a new business which is called microelectronics dealing with minute elements of components like resisters, diodes and so on and they needed an engineer to organize that part.</span> <span id="s500">They selected me and I joined them and worked out the discreet components and not only was I working on the design for it, but I also miniaturized electronic systems using those components for the micro elements that the industry was going in that direction.</span> <span id="s501">Everything had to be miniaturized.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Of course in any attempt of miniaturization the transistors and microchips surfaced all of a sudden and the diodes, the chips themselves, although they were in minute form a tremendous progress was shown at that time that those chips will take hold in the electronic industry and would take off in a hurry.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">It was at that time that Mallory had to make a decision whether of not to go into micro electronics for the discreet components, investing a lot of money of abandon this completely in view of the fact that the chip companies especially IBM and other Intel and other companies are coming out with micro electronics that could easily compete with the discreet components.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">So, I had to make a decision at that time which way to go and again I was called -- I got a call from General Instrument, my old company, would I like to join them and that company then was not in Newark New Jersey, but they expanded and they had some other outlets in design engineering in Massachusetts, Chicapa.</span> <span id="s505">that is the place where they recruited me to work on new designs on television tuners and that is not only very high frequency tuners but also the ultra high frequency tuners.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">That was a time when I wa pretty much comfortable that I could help them out and I joined them again.</span> <span id="s507">But prior to that, before I joined them, I met a lovely lady, Lois, and I met her and I married her in Brown County in ___________.</span> <span id="s508">She was at that time a working psychologist.</span> <span id="s509">She finished her degree and she has her masters in psychology and she wanted to continue in the psychology discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q.</span> <span id="s511">What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A.</span> <span id="s513">This was in 1962.</span> <span id="s514">We married -- a lovely lady -- glad to have met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q. And you have been married how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A. We've been married since 1962 so -- it seems like we've been married so long but it's been a breeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q. Do you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A.</span> <span id="s519">We had three children.</span> <span id="s520">The oldest is Jennifer.</span> <span id="s521">The middle one is Amy and the youngest is Karen.</span> <span id="s522">They all are married, happily married.</span> <span id="s523">Jennifer is married to a very nice young man, Daniel Mendleson.</span> <span id="s524">Jennifer is working for the Holocaust Museum in the information part of the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s525">Denny is a consultant in health issues.</span> <span id="s526">Amy is a school teacher and she has her own degree also as a consulting person for the school system.</span> <span id="s527">She also has her master's degree.</span> <span id="s528">She's married to a very nice young man, Steve Litman, he's going to be a CPA.</span> <span id="s529">He's an accountant now.</span> <span id="s530">They have two children, so I am a grandfather and I have two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s531">The youngest one is Karen married to a very nice young man Steve Boden and he's a teacher in auto mechanics, very resourceful and a fine young man.</span> <span id="s532">So, we have a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q. I'm curious about how you told your children and your grandchildren if you've talked to them about your experience about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A. No, I never mentioned anything to my grandchildren, well first of all the grandchildren are tiny.</span> <span id="s535">They youngest, Alex, is only over a year old so he's got a wonderful -- End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q. -- and a very happy young fellow.</span> <span id="s538">And Rachel, she's three years old so she wouldn't be able to understand that.</span> <span id="s539">But to my own children, I never talked to them about my experiences.</span> <span id="s540">Every so often only I'll just flash through some event that I recalled and I will tell them that, and they would be very much interested in that, but I would stop at that point.</span> <span id="s541">I just wouldn't elaborate on that.</span> <span id="s542">There's no reason for it, for me to go through and frankly I'm not that comfortable in disclosing everything that was through my life, my past life.</span> <span id="s543">There was no reason for that and they should know it -- well, they know it now.</span> <span id="s544">I made that information available to the Holocaust Museum and if they are interested in it, they could view it, they could read it and they know it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Those events that I flashed through my lifetime, everything had its own point that they could actually combine it together, so they know it pretty much what I went through and they're curious and rightly so.</span> <span id="s546">If they ask questions about a specific event I could tell them, and I will tell them, and I told them, but I don't elaborate on that point.</span> <span id="s547">I'm not reluctant but I'm not enthusiastic.</span> <span id="s548">So, whatever they ask questions I do it.</span> <span id="s549">I'd rather live the present life rather than my past life.</span> <span id="s550">There's no glory in that, in the past.</span> <span id="s551">The only time that you want is to know that things are not forgotten, but it mustn't be prolonged.</span> <span id="s552">There's no need for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q.</span> <span id="s554">You mentioned earlier about when you get tired at a certain point you remember that march from __________ on the way to Dachau.</span> <span id="s555">Are there other things in your life that trigger memories, music or smells or anything from the Holocaust experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A. Yes, there are many unpleasant memories that would trigger me but I would never relay that to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q. Not necessarily to my family but to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A. Yes, there was the time when I recall when I was on the train from Auschwitz to apparently I finally wound up in Flosenberg and on my way -- again, two events that come to my mind is the one that we were actually in open carts on the train and it was a very freezing day.</span> <span id="s559">It was the winter time.</span> <span id="s560">It was in January, and when they were making stops at certain stations, I recall that they would pull out the dead bodies out of those cars and some of them and they were piling them up on the side of the tracks.</span> <span id="s561">Some of them were still alive and there was one that I recall that he would be shooting them and they're alive.</span> <span id="s562">Maybe this is a better way to die than to suffer in a pile of bodies.</span> <span id="s563">That was one of the events.</span> <span id="s564">Well, those stops were more frequent and those piles were also more frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">We went through also Czechoslovakia in open carts and as we were traveling through Czechoslovakia I recall in those open carts people were standing on the overpass and they were throwing bread into the open carts and I thought this was a nice gesture from the Czechoslovakian people, whatever they could offer us, and they did.</span> <span id="s566">This was a little happier event.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q. Do you ever have nightmares about your experience in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A. I used to.</span> <span id="s569">I used to and I don't have them any more.</span> <span id="s570">Every so often I would, but I did have a lot of nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q.</span> <span id="s572">What were they of?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A. Well, they were horrible feelings.</span> <span id="s574">You would try to get away and you cannot get away.</span> <span id="s575">You run and you feel like you're being trapped and you cannot get away.</span> <span id="s576">It's a terrible feeling.</span> <span id="s577">Occasionally I would wake up and it was much better then.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">But those feelings, those nightmares, I don't have them anymore, at least I don't know, at least I don't dream that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q.</span> <span id="s580">You were on the run for quite a while when you left your village and before you ended up getting caught.</span> <span id="s581">How long did it take for you to feel as though you weren't running anymore after the war was over.</span> <span id="s582">Do you still feel like you're running?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A. Well, the feeling of running was constant event with me.</span> <span id="s584">As long as you were in a strange country, as long as you were on false papers, say in Budapest which supposedly is a free country, but I was on false papers.</span> <span id="s585">I arrived in Budapest for example in January and it wasn't occupied at that time by the Germans, but I think in February they occupied.</span> <span id="s586">So, until February I felt safe even though I was on Gentile papers.</span> <span id="s587">But in February when they occupied the country, again, we were in a dire situation that you had to start running again, and where do you go.</span> <span id="s588">There was very little you could do.</span> <span id="s589">You were in Hungary, you were closed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">I wasn't free because first of all I didn't know the language.</span> <span id="s591">So, you're always on the run.</span> <span id="s592">So, from Hungary my next bet was to run away from Hungary and the thought came to me many times to reach Turkey.</span> <span id="s593">That was the only free country you could possibly go, but to reach Turkey, you had to go to Rumania or some other country, or to go to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s594">Yugoslavia was a bad country because there was a war going on between the Yugoslavians and the Germans.</span> <span id="s595">So, it was a bad choice to go to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s596">The only way is to go to Rumania.</span> <span id="s597">And to go to Rumania you had to have connections.</span> <span id="s598">I didn't have the connections but since I joined the underground they had the connections.</span> <span id="s599">That's how I went to Rumania in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q. Yes, you had explained this in the video.</span> <span id="s601">I don't want to take up too much time asking you again, but I guess the question was more, even after the war, because of all the running you were doing, did you feel as though part of your life you were still running?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A. No, it wasn't that kind of feeling of running away from your life per se.</span> <span id="s603">The only time, the reason that I was moving from place to place here in the United States, it was on my own free will, and I was already an engineer with my degree and I could improve my status and to gain more experience, and this was the beauty of this country, that you could do so much with your own abilities without asking for any permission from anyone else.</span> <span id="s604">That's the beauty of it.</span> <span id="s605">There was no feeling that I'm running away, it was going to get some more experience and to see all the beauty of the United States.</span> <span id="s606">That is the nice part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q.</span> <span id="s608">You mentioned earlier that I think before we started recording, that you thought your experience during the Holocaust -- I think you said this and maybe you explain it -- made you want to be more successful.</span> <span id="s609">Somehow made you more aggressive in your pursuit of your goal.</span> <span id="s610">Can you talk a little bit about how your experience affected the decisions you made and the goals that you set?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A. Well, I felt that I met many survivors in my life time and every survivor that I met was to me at least a special person.</span> <span id="s612">I don't know that I could define a survivor but to me a survivor is a person who's got a will to live.</span> <span id="s613">He's a special person because he wants to live.</span> <span id="s614">But also, in order to live you have to live well.</span> <span id="s615">You have to acquire certain skills to do that.</span> <span id="s616">I have met yet a survivor that isn't doing that well.</span> <span id="s617">All of them that I knew is fairly well.</span> <span id="s618">He's not a person who would be willing to go on welfare.</span> <span id="s619">I know of that.</span> <span id="s620">He's a person who either acquires some education or some profession or goes into some kind of business.</span> <span id="s621">He's a person who's got a drive.</span> <span id="s622">Maybe he acquired this during the days that he had to survive.</span> <span id="s623">I'm not saying this because of my own goals that I have set for myself, but I know a lot of survivors that they do have that kind of drive.</span> <span id="s624">They want to live well and they want to make up for the time that they have lost during the time when they were forced to lose the time.</span> <span id="s625">I know that from myself.</span> <span id="s626">I want to live well, but I work hard for that.</span> <span id="s627">It's good to work hard.</span> <span id="s628">You know, my family was in a honey business in Poland.</span> <span id="s629">We used to have a brewery, a honey brewery and we used to make honey wine.</span> <span id="s630">In fact the business that my parents used to have, it wasn't only my parents but all my uncles were in this kind of business because it came back for generations that we had established back in 1870s those breweries.</span> <span id="s631">So, the business was since 1870 that generation after generation was going on and everyone was in this kind of business.</span> <span id="s632">That was kind of inspiring to me.</span> <span id="s633">Although during the time that I was in my engineering profession, it was kind of questionable why am I in this kind of business in engineering rather than in the wine business.</span> <span id="s634">When I realized that to be in a wine business it would take a tremendous effort on my part to get acquainted with that part of the business, first of all I wasn't prepared for it and second of all it was just a flashing thought on my part, to think about it.</span> <span id="s635">But I discarded that, being in that kind of business because first of all I was still pretty much involved in my engineering profession and at that time when that flashing thought came about I was in the ___________ administration working on extradition problems that we here had with the television products.</span> <span id="s636">Television products at that time and for a number of years emitted some x-rays out of the ________ tubes and that was the time when in 1975 when I gained that position with the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the industry so that the manufactures of the television product would comply with our regulations.</span> <span id="s637">I did work for FDA a number of years since 1975 all the way through 1990 when I retired and in those times I worked not only for regulating the television product but also working on medical devices working with the manufacturers making sure that they complied again to their own standards and their own specifications on certain products that was offered to the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">It was during that time that flashing point of going into the kind of business that became more a reality to me because I already started to make wine at home even before that time for our own consumption.</span> <span id="s639">Mostly honey wine.</span> <span id="s640">The honey wine that I recall, that certain taste that still haunts me over the years and to duplicate that wine from my parents and from the family just in general since they'd been marketed back in Poland.</span> <span id="s641">Apparently we used to export it to different countries, it was a special taste.</span> <span id="s642">A taste I'll never forget, although I try so many times to duplicate it, I just cannot duplicate that.</span> <span id="s643">There were certain ingredients in that recipe that was never given to me, for obvious reasons I never inquired for that.</span> <span id="s644">I was too small, too young to realize how important that is.</span> <span id="s645">It is now that I remember that I feel that it was so important because it was a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s646">Ever since that time since I started to make wine I tried to duplicate that and I say maybe next year I'll try to find it.</span> <span id="s647">I never found it yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">But I wanted to start somewhere and I wanted to begin some experience in wine making in general.</span> <span id="s649">I bought a piece of land in Frederick County back in 1982 and my wife Lois and myself and my kids were planting year by year a new vintage, new vines and at this point in time since 1982 we have 5 1/2 acres of grapes that combines not only __________ grapes but French hybrid grapes, two distinctive varieties that you make different wines which have different palates but equally good, could be good if made right.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">All this time back in 1989 when I started to make some honey wine for the market, every year I would be producing a different wine hoping to find my recipe of the family and some disappointment in it because I cannot duplicate it and I still experiment but any wine that I make, the honey wine that is, people like it and it's being sold on the market.</span> <span id="s651">I still hope that I will find that recipe.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q. I want to ask you when you first met your wife Lois -- she's American?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A.</span> <span id="s654">She is.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q.</span> <span id="s656">When did you tell her your experience in the Holocaust and when you did what did you tell her?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A. Well, Lois she knew that I'm from Europe.</span> <span id="s658">I told her so.</span> <span id="s659">Besides my accent she didn't ask a lot of questions about my past because she felt if I wanted to talk about my experiences I will and if I wouldn't want to talk obviously there was a reason I wouldn't want to talk.</span> <span id="s660">So, she wasn't pressing on that point.</span> <span id="s661">She's good about it.</span> <span id="s662">She only presses on certain questions if she misunderstood me, then I would try to explain it.</span> <span id="s663">Yes, I told her about some of my experiences.</span> <span id="s664">In fact, I make a point whenever a certain flashing event comes to my mind I would tell her right away, something flashed in my mind and I want to share this with you, and I would tell her that.</span> <span id="s665">At that point, if she's more inquisitive of that event, I would probably explain it or we would just end it at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">As I mentioned before I don't live in the past so I'm not taken by that.</span> <span id="s667">I live by the present and I live for the future and I'm basically programmed to that.</span> <span id="s668">I don't have any guilt feelings and if I do I just bury it.</span> <span id="s669">There's no reason to go on with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q. Guilt feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A. Guilt feelings that I'm the only one who survived and sometimes that is very difficult to justify.</span> <span id="s672">Sure, there is some guilt feelings.</span> <span id="s673">My brother Eli could have survived too if he would have been as lucky as I was.</span> <span id="s674">I tried to rescue him, went to ghetto, tried to get him out.</span> <span id="s675">I was too late.</span> <span id="s676">But it would be nice if someone of my family would have survived with me, but that's the fate.</span> <span id="s677">That's the way we keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q. Were there periods before you were married and after the war where it was lonely because you didn't have any family?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A. Of course, that's obvious that you don't have any family you're on your own and that's something that any person who is by himself he tries to seek a new family.</span> <span id="s680">It's something that in order to continue with your life, continue with your tradition, it's something that you need to take some steps.</span> <span id="s681">I married a wonderful woman, who gave me wonderful children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s682">We have a family and what I lost before I have regained and we have a future.</span> <span id="s683">The family is a wonderful family and they basically live in the tradition of my past family.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Now, I want to touch base a little bit about the vineyard that I have established with my wife back in 1982 that I felt back in 1982 when I purchased that piece of land I wanted to make sure that this is my place where I wanted to experiment in wine making in a place where I could retire.</span> <span id="s685">That was on my mind, that was goal, and that's what I started.</span> <span id="s686">After -- here we are in 1995.</span> <span id="s687">I retired back in 1990 and in that year we broke the ground and built a house here at the vineyard.</span> <span id="s688">It's a beautiful house, spacious, overlooking the vineyard.</span> <span id="s689">The point that I'm making is that whatever the goals you have set for yourself, things are achievable.</span> <span id="s690">You can do it if you're persistent.</span> <span id="s691">You can do it if you work hard.</span> <span id="s692">You can do it if you have support from your family, which I do, and my wife is wonderful in that area.</span> <span id="s693">Kids, my children are also supportive in many ways.</span> <span id="s694">They're proud of what we do, what we have, what a tradition is, what we anticipate to do.</span> <span id="s695">Anything in a project that we make they're very supportive.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q.</span> <span id="s697">How much -- it's a hard question I think to answer but how much of that persistence that you have, that optimism that you have do you think was there when you were born and how much did the experience during the Holocaust affect how you contribute to that desire to succeed and achieve goals?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A. Frankly, I don't think that the Holocaust was the prime motivator to my goals.</span> <span id="s699">I'm a man who sets the goals and tries to achieve them.</span> <span id="s700">The only thing that would be a certain motivation to set my goals would be my upbringing, my family.</span> <span id="s701">Back in Europe where I was always proud of them, we were always hard working people.</span> <span id="s702">Not that I knew at that time what a goal is, but I saw things around, being surrounded with the every day task that stood before us.</span> <span id="s703">My brother, the oldest brother Abe, he was a physiologist and he gained his master's degree in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s704">I recall that he wasn't prodded at all by my mother to gain his profession.</span> <span id="s705">He was willing to do it by himself.</span> <span id="s706">We had to support him because he was away from Lamberg, many miles away from us, so we had to support him.</span> <span id="s707">That is, my mother used to support him.</span> <span id="s708">My father died when I was four years old.</span> <span id="s709">So, he died, so I knew him very little, but he was the one who actually established the winery.</span> <span id="s710">So, were his brothers, my uncles, they all had wineries.</span> <span id="s711">Either they had wineries or they worked for one of our uncles.</span> <span id="s712">So, it was a family enterprise, as I mentioned before since 1870.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">As I said before I don't think the Holocaust did anything to my character.</span> <span id="s714">My character apparently was already established way back and the only thing that I had to do is to persist that I stay alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q.</span> <span id="s716">What influence do you think it ultimately had or that period in your life when you were between 15 and 20, how did it influence you?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A. Well, sheer stubbornness that my life was all of a sudden interrupted and interrupted in a vicious way.</span> <span id="s718">Taken away from my being all the things that I loved.</span> <span id="s719">Now, you could imagine that a young boy who is trying to remember all those good things from home all of a sudden doesn't have anything and I wasn't about to let go.</span> <span id="s720">I persisted that I do whatever I had to do what my parents would expect me to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">So, Holocaust was a crucial terrible time that what it did to my family and to me, but it couldn't break me, and wouldn't break me as long as I lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q. Do you think it made you more optimistic or less optimistic about life other than your optimism because you seemed optimistic, hopeful.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A. Well, I was always hopeful with one exception of the time in Flosenberg where President Roosevelt died, so I -- the only thing that comes to my mind was a sheer stubbornness.</span> <span id="s724">I wasn't about to give up on things that were against my will.</span> <span id="s725">Very important part of your character because those people who were not stubborn enough gave up their life.</span> <span id="s726">And it doesn't take too much for anyone in those situations that I was in to give up their life.</span> <span id="s727">It was easy.</span> <span id="s728">It's to fight against terrible elements without having hope.</span> <span id="s729">It's easy to succumb to those pressures.</span> <span id="s730">I was stubborn.</span> <span id="s731">And it is a good situation and it was worth it every bit of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q.</span> <span id="s733">Now you were talking about how the Holocaust experience made you more stubborn.</span> <span id="s734">Do you think it made you more aggressive towards the pursuit of your goals?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A. I don't know about that.</span> <span id="s736">I feel that to claim that the Holocaust made me more stubborn in a certain way, I don't know.</span> <span id="s737">I feel that it's more a character of a person that becomes motivated in certain way.</span> <span id="s738">My motivation was to achieve certain goals in my life.</span> <span id="s739">You could probably project yourself, which direction you want to live, in what way.</span> <span id="s740">In my case, it was a matter of first getting an education after what I have lost and live the kind of life I would be comfortable with and second it seems to me that once you have achieved that goal, you cannot project yourself too much far ahead.</span> <span id="s741">You have to accept things as they come and make changes and be willing to make changes if it's necessary.</span> <span id="s742">In my case, I did make some changes in my life especially not continue to be in the engineering profession but something to pick up the roots of my family, namely wine making, and have fun.</span> <span id="s743">This is what we have it now and I feel very comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s744">As long as I can do it, I will do it.</span> <span id="s745">And if I cannot make it anymore I cannot do it because my age or my physical needs will require me to do something else, I don't know.</span> <span id="s746">I cannot project it at this point in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q.</span> <span id="s748">You had mentioned the problem with your feet because of the frost bite when you were being transported.</span> <span id="s749">Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A. Well it was a passing episode because the frost bite that I got on my feet it was unfortunate at that time because I had to be strong enough to walk and I couldn't fake too well, by walking straight when I couldn't.</span> <span id="s751">I happen to have shoes at that time and the blisters that I got on my feet they wouldn't fit in my shoes and that was very painful.</span> <span id="s752">But ever since that time, everything got healed and there were no distortions on my toenails or anything else.</span> <span id="s753">It was just one of those things that it persisted.</span> <span id="s754">Since my evacuation from Auschwitz all the way through to Flosenberg, it seems to me it healed in Flosenberg so I was okay afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">When I left on that trip from Flosenberg I have not limped.</span> <span id="s756">It appears to me that I was okay at that time so evidently I got healed because I was strong enough to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q. Do you have any problems now these days?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A. No, no, I'm fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q. Physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A. Physically I'm very strong.</span> <span id="s761">Physically I'm very healthy and I make sure that I maintain my body in a healthy way.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q. I wanted to ask you one other thing about what you said in a video interview that sometimes when you hear a knock you'll jump a little bit these days still.</span> <span id="s763">Can you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A. Yes, this is something that one of the remnants that I have from the Holocaust especially when I used to live in Budapest.</span> <span id="s765">I used to live different places in Budapest and especially at night the only thing that was dreadful after the German occupation that some of my friends or acquaintances in Budapest were kind of disappearing one by one for no reason.</span> <span id="s766">Later on I found out that they were already imprisoned, some were.</span> <span id="s767">At that time ____________, which is a political prison where I actually wound up when they caught me on Rumanian border, that was the place where some of my friends were and I couldn't find them then, but living in different apartments in Budapest it was the night that was so dreadful because you heard this knocking at the door.</span> <span id="s768">And that's the time when any knock would scare me because that was the time I would think they came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s769">Ever since that time, that kind of persists and today someone knocks at the door I have a heartbeat much louder than I would want to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">But we have now a doorbell.</span> <span id="s771">It sounds much softer.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q.</span> <span id="s773">One other thing that I picked up from your video interview was during the time that you were on the run, you had to trust a lot of people.</span> <span id="s774">You had to have faith in them that they wouldn't inform or turn you in or betray you.</span> <span id="s775">Do you think that had any effect on your outlook afterwards, that you were more trusting or less trusting?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A.</span> <span id="s777">The trust that you are talking about is being so called free and that was everything took place in Budapest.</span> <span id="s778">This was the only place after I escaped from Poland the only place that I felt semi-free and being a free man walking on the streets without any armbands, identified as a Jew, because basically I was a Gentile on the false papers, and the freedom was basically a superficial freedom.</span> <span id="s779">If you cannot identify yourself who you actually are, that's no freedom.</span> <span id="s780">You're basically a fugitive and if you're a fugitive you have to confine yourself to someone or not to confine yourself so living in those apartments in Hungary that I did, I always had to tell them who I am that I am a Polish refugee.</span> <span id="s781">In order to convince them that I am a good practicing catholic I would go to them to church.</span> <span id="s782">That was to convince them that I am in good standing with them, but I would never claim that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s783">So, there was no trust in that other than I had to survive the way I had to survive.</span> <span id="s784">They don't have to know about those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">It was experience.</span> <span id="s786">I could talk to you now because I'm free, but there was no freedom at that time.</span> <span id="s787">I had to deny my own religion for something I hated to do that but life goes on and things have passed.</span> <span id="s788">I could talk about it now in a more leisurely way.</span> <span id="s789">Thank God for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q. I think I pretty much covered all the territory that I wanted.</span> <span id="s791">Is there anything you'd like to say that I haven't asked you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A. I don't know what to add to my testimony more what I had.</span> <span id="s793">There were maybe some more incidents, more events that I haven't covered.</span> <span id="s794">Maybe there were some important things, I don't recall.</span> <span id="s795">The only thing I could recall is a flashing point that I could recall that one event triggers another event and obviously I may have left many events because if you are talking about events since the Holocaust back in 1941 when they took away my brother Abe and all the way through my life and living among those 40 Jews in ________________, every day living with those people was an event by itself.</span> <span id="s796">Because these are horrible days, you live not from day to day but from minute to minute.</span> <span id="s797">Everything depends -- End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A. -- determination by some assessment in ________________ because we could be picked up at that time almost any time.</span> <span id="s800">So, the life was horrible then.</span> <span id="s801">It would have been nice if some of the people would have been survived, I don't know.</span> <span id="s802">I don't know if any of them --.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">There are many events that I could probably recall, under proper circumstances I could probably disclose them, but I don't know it now.</span> <span id="s804">The life now is very good, wonderful.</span> <span id="s805">The family is wonderful.</span> <span id="s806">I'll leave it at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q.</span> <span id="s808">You don't seem to have any bitterness?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A. No, no bitterness, maybe some sorrow, but this is the least I can endure.</span> <span id="s810">This is at least I could -- that doesn't have to make me angry because anger doesn't solve anything.</span> <span id="s811">I am emotional and it comes at times especially at the times when the flashbacks come in but they go away as soon as they come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q.</span> <span id="s813">How often do you have those flashbacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A. Quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q. Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A. No, I don't count them.</span> <span id="s817">I don't know when they come, they just come.</span> <span id="s818">Not necessarily every day.</span> <span id="s819">Something has to trigger that flashback it seems to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q. Do you know what it is that triggers it?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A. No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s822">It's part of a life cycle I suppose.</span> <span id="s823">Everyone has some recollections of their childhood and that's part of the process I suppose.</span> <span id="s824">Some are very happy events.</span> <span id="s825">Some of these flashbacks are very happy, some are very bad.</span> <span id="s826">I don't know which type of flashback I have.</span> <span id="s827">I never counted them.</span> <span id="s828">I never tried to separate them.</span> <span id="s829">They come quite naturally and they go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q.</span> <span id="s831">How long do they last normally?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A. Just a flashback.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q. Just a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s835">Just a flashback and the flashbacks actually could be interpreted later on.</span> <span id="s836">I could interpret what that flashback is.</span> <span id="s837">I could probably ask myself what happened.</span> <span id="s838">It could be a very happy event.</span> <span id="s839">And of course it could be a very sad event.</span> <span id="s840">Probably there are more happy events that surface to me than the bad events, which is good in a way because the happy events mostly tie in with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q. What's a typical flashback?</span> <span id="s842">Do you have a recurring flashback from the Holocaust that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A. No, I have just occasional flashbacks from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s844">As I said there are more happy events than bad events.</span> <span id="s845">Maybe for very good obvious reasons, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s846">Maybe I want to remember those good events and they're happy or interesting and you could stay with them a little bit longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">So, it's those flashbacks will remain with me, not that I plan on them but they come when they want to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q. And you're not sure of a particular thing that triggers them?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A. Right.</span> <span id="s850">I don't know how they come in nothing seems to trigger that flashback.</span> <span id="s851">They come naturally.</span> <span id="s852">Apparently there's a file in my head that opens up when it wants to open and it closes when it wants to be closed.</span> <span id="s853">I'll have to ask my wife, who's a psychologist how that works.</span> <span id="s854">It must work that way somehow.</span> <span id="s855">It's something -- an intermittent event.</span> <span id="s856">Maybe that's the way it works, intermittently.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q. I want to thank you very much for talking to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A. Thank you very much for interviewing me.</span> <span id="s859">I appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Conclusion of Interview William Loew page \* arabic56</span></p></body></html>
