know, first of all, I thought about my parents.</span> <span id="s28">We didn’t have our parents, we were alone, my sister and I and her husband.</span> <span id="s29">And then, you know, the relatives which we didn't know who survived and who not, who were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s30">And it -- it was just a wonderful feeling, but we were also very sad because we didn’t have our parents and other relatives, but it was still a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s31">And I -- I -- I can’t really explain it, ho-how wonderful it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: When

were with the army, we were not alone when they announced that the war was over, because my sister got married on March 31st, 1945 with a Czech officer, a Jewish Czech officer, and we were with him.</span> <span id="s36">We were with the army.</span> <span id="s37">So when the army announced that the war is over, for me the war was over.</span> <span id="s38">And that was mar -- May 9th, 1945 when I heard that the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: So you were with the Czech army?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: With the Czech army I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: How

were under Nazi control?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I was under -- I was in -- that was 1945 and we left -- ’44, when we left Russia.</span> <span id="s45">In Russia we were not under the -- we left in, I think it was in ’43, we left under the Nazis and we came to Russia.</span> <span id="s46">And we were in Russia and from Russia we left.</span> <span id="s47">It was o-on -- I know exactly, on December 24th, we left Russia.</span> <span id="s48">And we ended up in Poland, then in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s49">And that was the last time I was under the -- in -- in ’43 I was the last time under the -- you know, under the Nazi occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And you mentioned that you went from Russia to Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes, that’s exactly right.</span> <span id="s52">We went with the Czech army and we actually went with the -- i-it was a convoy of tractors.</span> <span id="s53">And we went with the tractors to Poland, and from Poland we escaped because where we were left was not a good place to be, we found that out very soon.</span> <span id="s54">And we ran away and we a-again got hold of a Czech army -- not any more the no -- what we were before, with a tractor of -- not tractor, with a -- a -- with just a car we got -- we got to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: You mentioned before that you were with your sister and her husband, who was a -- a Czech officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s57">That was after -- after the march when she got married to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: When where I was living?</span> <span id="s60">When I left -- when I left Czechoslovakia -- I mean, when I left Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: No, when -- when you realized the war was over, where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Oh I -- w-we -- we were with the army, you know, wherever the army gave us a place.</span> <span id="s63">He had a place, my brother-in-law and I was -- I was the addition when he got married, I got married too, to him.</span> <span id="s64">No, I -- I’m just kidding.</span> <span id="s65">No, he took me too.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you and your sister do any work to support yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: We -- we did some, you know, we did some in -- in Czechoslovakia, matter of fact.</span> <span id="s68">We did also some -- my sister did all along in Russia.</span> <span id="s69">I did in Russia some work too.</span> <span id="s70">I went to school but I also did work.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: What kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I worked in a hospital.</span> <span id="s73">I checked -- in ladies who were pregnant, came to check in, and I checked them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: When the war was over, did you make any efforts to find missing loved ones and friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: We didn’t have any opportunity to make any pra -- a-any kind of inquiry until the war was completely over.</span> <span id="s76">And then only -- really we couldn’t go anywhere, but our husbands went.</span> <span id="s77">You know, I was, in the meantime I got married and our husbands went, we couldn’t even go.</span> <span id="s78">Because it wasn’t -- it -- it still was not -- you couldn’t go as a ci-civil person you couldn’t go to any different country.</span> <span id="s79">And we had to go to a different country.</span> <span id="s80">So our husbands went and they got our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Okay, let me ask you about your husband.</span> <span id="s82">How did you meet him and what were the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: My husband I met when my sister married her husband.</span> <span id="s84">He was the best man.</span> <span id="s85">He was a very, very nice gu-guy, and when I met him, my brother-in-law said, you can ask him if you want to ride the horse.</span> <span id="s86">He can get it for you.</span> <span id="s87">And he was 10 years older than me and he just put his hands on my cheek and he said, oh you are a nice little girl.</span> <span id="s88">I had braids and I really looked like a little girl in comparing to him.</span> <span id="s89">And anyway, that’s how I met him, and then, in th -- when my sister got married and all, once he sent my brother-in-law and my sister away and he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s90">I was in the Czech army.</span> <span id="s91">Every officer had a spoika.</span> <span id="s92">A spoika means a helper, and I was left in the place with a spoika.</span> <span id="s93">And when my late husband came to visit me, he told the spoika that he cou -- has off.</span> <span id="s94">And he wanted to kiss me and I wouldn’t allow him, I really hit him, you know?</span> <span id="s95">And then he didn’t come any more and then he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s96">And when we went -- it was after the war and when we went to get married, I couldn’t because I was too young.</span> <span id="s97">So we didn’t get married.</span> <span id="s98">But then he was transferred to a place and he became them -- their -- he -- he was -- I -- I don’t really know how you say it in English.</span> <span id="s99">He was a biggest man the army had in that town.</span> <span id="s100">And that was the town where was a German -- lot of Germans lived, and they were transported away, to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s101">And this is where -- where we came, and he was the big shot there.</span> <span id="s102">We have number one, that we was the first ones to get married in that little town and nobody gave us a hard time.</span> <span id="s103">I had -- of course, I had to get -- what do you call it, somebody to take care of me because I didn't have my -- my parents, and my sister couldn’t -- couldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s104">You know, you have to have a -- l-like your father, you know, who would give you permission.</span> <span id="s105">And my late husband had an uncle and gave me permission and we got married there, in that little town.</span> <span id="s106">This was Freiwaldau in -- in -- in the czechoslo -- in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s107">And that -- that happened only on August 28, 1945.</span> <span id="s108">The -- first we wanted to get married in June, when I turned 17, but we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s109">So then when he got transferred and all, and then, you know, when he got there he had us come and we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: His name was Robert Kauder, R-o-b-e-r-t K-a-u-d-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So all in all, how long did you know him before you married him?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I knew him from March until I married him, until I -- I married him in August.</span> <span id="s114">You see, you have to understand.</span> <span id="s115">When they came back, there was no Jewish girls, you know, there were no Jews when they came back.</span> <span id="s116">He had an aunt there and that -- that’s a whole story in itself you -- you know, she was at home and her husband was in -- in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s117">He was in the camp the whole time, and he came back.</span> <span id="s118">But when he went to see his aunt, he found out that his mother and his sister were taken to Auschwitz and that -- that they died.</span> <span id="s119">And he was extremely sad.</span> <span id="s120">And then he wanted to get married, when he found out that he doesn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s121">And there really -- there really was nobody, we were -- it was very easy, really, to get married tha-that time, you know, I mean, it -- you didn’t have anybody, like we didn’t have our parent, and I married him.</span> <span id="s122">I didn’t know that my parents are alive.</span> <span id="s123">Even so, the war was over in May.</span> <span id="s124">We still had no idea until -- I was married already to him when we found out where they are.</span> <span id="s125">That was through the Red Cross, cause we had no idea where my -- we didn’t have any idea if our -- my parents are alive.</span> <span id="s126">And we did not find them where we left them, we found them in Bukarin, which is a capital of Romania and we left them in the Bukovina, completely different place.</span> <span id="s127">But my uncle -- my father had three brothers in the United States and only one really cared to si -- send letters and checking if we are alive.</span> <span id="s128">And the first one they found was me, and I got a letter and there was 25 dollars in it.</span> <span id="s129">And then my sister, I think got it, and then somehow we got to know that our parents are in Romania, and then when our husbands went to get.</span> <span id="s130">That must have been someplace either end of ’45, or beginning of ’46 because it was cold outside when they came.</span> <span id="s131">But I -- I don’t know the exact date when they came, I really can’t remember.</span> <span id="s132">But I know I was married and I got married on August, like I said, 28, 1945.</span> <span id="s133">So they weren't there.</span> <span id="s134">When they came, I was married, you know, so it could have been end of the ’45 or beginning of ’46, I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: At the age of 17, did you feel you were ready for marriage?</span> <span id="s136">A: I had no idea what marriage is.</span> <span id="s137">I had absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s138">I remember what I -- I didn’t have anything, and my late husband, a-and -- it was hard, you know, to buy something, and he wanted to make a me a dowry.</span> <span id="s139">And all I wanted was a -- a nightgown from flannel, because I never, ever wore a -- a nightgown.</span> <span id="s140">So I thought that’s what I need is a big, long nightgown.</span> <span id="s141">That’s what I want.</span> <span id="s142">And he did ge -- get -- you -- you know, a dowry for me, because I didn’t have anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s143">I didn’t have nothing, just what I wore.</span> <span id="s144">And go -- he got me whatever, and my -- my brother-in-law got some lace and his sister, who came back from Auschwitz, she was actually an -- you know, she used to make clothes.</span> <span id="s145">And she didn’t have a machine or anything.</span> <span id="s146">And she made me a gown for my wedding.</span> <span id="s147">It is a short gown.</span> <span id="s148">It was a short -- wasn’t enough material.</span> <span id="s149">And I don’t think I -- I -- I don’t know, I don’t feel I have -- I don’t have a picture here, but it’s very funny the way -- it looks nice.</span> <span id="s150">It’s -- it was nice.</span> <span id="s151">It was really ve-very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: You mentioned a few moments ago that your husband was the -- the big boss in --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: The big boss, yeah, in -- in Freiwaldau, in Grafenberg-Freiwaldau it was called, where we were.</span> <span id="s154">Freiwaldau was the city and Grafenberg was a -- i-it was there an institution for people who have troubles with their brains.</span> <span id="s155">It was at Grafenberg.</span> <span id="s156">And we lived actually on the way up Grafenberg.</span> <span id="s157">We had a beautiful house, but we -- we -- i-it was a beautiful, beautiful house, and we lived there.</span> <span id="s158">And in 1997 I went with my granddaughter to see the place, I went back.</span> <span id="s159">And there lived -- there lived some people.</span> <span id="s160">And I said -- it was raining outside, and I have there a cousin and she took us.</span> <span id="s161">And when I rang the bell I said, I used to live here.</span> <span id="s162">He said, you couldn’t have lived here.</span> <span id="s163">Here lived a young girl who is a chief of the army.</span> <span id="s164">I said, that was me.</span> <span id="s165">And he let us go in.</span> <span id="s166">Was nice.</span> <span id="s167">It was really nice.</span> <span id="s168">I had my granddaughter.</span> <span id="s169">Was very nice to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Do you remember your husband’s military rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: It -- here it was a -- a -- a captain or a -- a -- a major.</span> <span id="s172">I think he got the major after, I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s173">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s174">It was not [indecipherable] he was not -- I think he got -- he was a major.</span> <span id="s175">He was a captain when I met him, and I think then he got -- he got a major.</span> <span id="s176">I’m not hundred percent, I think that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: When you got married and lived in this house that your remember so fondly --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: -- how were you treated by the -- by your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: You know, I did not associate, actually, with the neighbors, only with the military.</span> <span id="s181">And we -- but what we did have was a maid.</span> <span id="s182">And she was a Czech and she was nice.</span> <span id="s183">I had no problem, and her husband did in the garden.</span> <span id="s184">We had a beautiful garden with the pool and everything was very nice, very, very nice.</span> <span id="s185">I had no -- no problems really.</span> <span id="s186">A matter of fact I had a lot of fun because when the -- when one of the soldiers would come to us with something for my husband, and if I would go to the door, if I would open the door, they always wanted to make a date with me, because I still had the braids, I still didn’t cut my braids, and they didn’t think that -- that I am the wife of -- of the -- of the velitel.</span> <span id="s187">Velitel, I don’t know how you say it.</span> <span id="s188">Yeah, the big shot, whatever.</span> <span id="s189">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s190">Very nice life there, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And what exactly were his duties and responsibilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: I really don’t know exactly his duties, but they were -- they -- they had to get rid of the Germans, which y-you know, take me away from there.</span> <span id="s193">It was the Sudetenland where we were, you know, traveled over the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s194">He did that, and whatever else he had to do.</span> <span id="s195">I-I really never -- I never discussed it.</span> <span id="s196">I never discussed it.</span> <span id="s197">I -- what -- what we did first, before we did anything was we were trying to -- we went to Freiwaldau and we also were trying to think that I will go back to school, because I didn’t finish school.</span> <span id="s198">But then they told me that I won’t have any children.</span> <span id="s199">I didn't know if I could or I couldn’t, I mean I had no idea.</span> <span id="s200">And when I heard no children, how could I be without no children, I always wanted 12.</span> <span id="s201">So I went from one doctor to another, and that was when I was already -- when I was in school already when I found out.</span> <span id="s202">And I started to go to medical school.</span> <span id="s203">I had no problems.</span> <span id="s204">I took a test and I started to go.</span> <span id="s205">But then there was one time, the first time where we had an autopsy.</span> <span id="s206">It was a newborn baby, and when they took the [indecipherable] they cut the head, I started to m-move around a little, and professor said, Miss Kauder, will you please stand up straight?</span> <span id="s207">And I couldn’t, because I wa-wa-was already crying when I w -- w-when I just tried to stand up.</span> <span id="s208">And he said, are you a -- a -- what do you say, a -- a cry -- an hysterical woman, or -- or what -- wh-what’s wrong with you?</span> <span id="s209">I said, I’m a mother.</span> <span id="s210">I was pregnant already.</span> <span id="s211">And then I did -- the first semester was over, and I didn’t go then back.</span> <span id="s212">Also my husband got sick and I didn’t go back to school.</span> <span id="s213">But I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Why did you think you couldn’t have children?</span> <span id="s215">A: I didn't know.</span> <span id="s216">It was the first time I went to a doctor, I had some problems.</span> <span id="s217">You know, i-i-i -- I just had some problems and my husband wanted me to go, so I went.</span> <span id="s218">And we didn’t want to have any children.</span> <span id="s219">We had no problems with having children or not having.</span> <span id="s220">We didn’t -- because we said, first I’ll finish school and then we’ll have a family.</span> <span id="s221">But when they said I can’t have any children, I don’t have to worry about that, I th -- to me that was a very big worry.</span> <span id="s222">I -- and I went from town to town until I got a very old doctor and he said, you are so young.</span> <span id="s223">He says, the only time you can have it is now.</span> <span id="s224">And that was true because then I had -- after my daughter was born, I had a -- two miscarriages, then I had my son.</span> <span id="s225">It’s almost six years different between my daughter and my son.</span> <span id="s226">And when I had my son it was really very -- they told me that the only way I can have him, if I am going to lie quietly until I feel him, and then, you know, I could get up.</span> <span id="s227">And the doctor who knew me, h-he says, you know, you can do that.</span> <span id="s228">I said, of course I can do that.</span> <span id="s229">And I did it.</span> <span id="s230">I didn’t move until I felt him, and I had him.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: You also mention that your husband was having health problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: My husband got the -- was wounded in 1944 at Dukla, that was in Russia.</span> <span id="s233">And when he was -- when he was -- it was so sad, his whole -- his whole wounding was a very sad thing.</span> <span id="s234">They had what they called spoika, which meant that a soldier had to go and tell another soldier that something is not right, you have to be careful.</span> <span id="s235">And the soldier who was to go was Max Weiss.</span> <span id="s236">And he couldn’t -- he couldn’t, he -- he just collapsed.</span> <span id="s237">And the officer who was surrounded, wherever he was, was my late husband’s best friend.</span> <span id="s238">So he started to go, but he didn’t have to go, he was the adjutant to Swoboda.</span> <span id="s239">He didn’t have to go nowhere, and they said, don’t go.</span> <span id="s240">You know, the general told him, don’t go.</span> <span id="s241">And he d -- he saw that yo-you know, Max Weiss couldn’t go, he completely collapsed.</span> <span id="s242">So he run and when he ran, they say, crawl.</span> <span id="s243">H-He was very tall, he says, you crawl.</span> <span id="s244">They -- when they ho-hollered at him and he -- he started to crawl, fell in -- in the -- in the bunker where his friend was and all, and he did tell them what happened.</span> <span id="s245">But then they didn’t have any x-ray and what they looked was that he was wounded in the kidney.</span> <span id="s246">But the kidney wasn’t touched, it looked fine.</span> <span id="s247">So they just sewed him up.</span> <span id="s248">And that was in ’44, and in ’46 he started to have problem, and he had terrible problems til the day he died.</span> <span id="s249">He had eight operations.</span> <span id="s250">He had -- they didn’t have at that time like now, you know, that they can give you -- I forgot what it’s called.</span> <span id="s251">He had artificial kidney and it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s252">And he finally, you know, died only -- it was in 1957.</span> <span id="s253">It was a terrible, terrible time.</span> <span id="s254">But he was good.</span> <span id="s255">He went in the hospital, he was in the hospital a month or whatever.</span> <span id="s256">Came home, the first thing he did is made -- made ar-arrangements and we went to the -- to a show, or whatever.</span> <span id="s257">Never, every complained.</span> <span id="s258">Never complained that he had to be in the hospital, that it -- at one time he had to have, you know, to wear a thing, and nothing bothered him.</span> <span id="s259">But he couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s260">I always said to the doctor.</span> <span id="s261">You just do what you can do, he’ll do what he can do.</span> <span id="s262">And they couldn’t -- they -- they just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s263">He was -- one time -- my son, unfortunately inherited what my husband had -- had.</span> <span id="s264">And he was a year old when he was taken to the hospital, and he had two stones.</span> <span id="s265">And he was breastfed.</span> <span id="s266">He was 13 months old and then, six months later, he was taken again and they had to enlarge him the passage from the kidney to the bladder.</span> <span id="s267">And the operation was taking about four and a half hour.</span> <span id="s268">It was a very, very big operation.</span> <span id="s269">And he still has to go for -- you know, and he was, in 1949 -- ’89, I was very ill and he had to go to the hospital too, he had problems.</span> <span id="s270">My son.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: I’m a little confused about something.</span> <span id="s272">Did your husband die as a result of this -- of being wounded, or did he have another medical condition, or was it a combination?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No, he died of -- of his wounding.</span> <span id="s274">When they opened the -- the kidney, you know, that happened in 1947, when they opened it.</span> <span id="s275">In ’46 he started to have problem, and when the couldn’t find anything and they couldn’t see anything, they opened him and the kidney was a piece of pus.</span> <span id="s276">And the other kidney was already attack, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s277">If they would have taken out the kidney in Russia when he was wounded, nothing would have happened.</span> <span id="s278">He lived -- we -- I also live with one kidney.</span> <span id="s279">He could have lived the longest time for -- with one kidney.</span> <span id="s280">I wanted to give him my kidney.</span> <span id="s281">I didn’t know that I -- eventually I myself had kidney problems and I lost a kidney, I didn’t know it then.</span> <span id="s282">But then I wanted to give him the kidney -- in France they had just made -- had a ki -- a case with twins, they gave from one twin to the other, and they didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s283">And they wouldn’t do it because at that point, you know, I had already my daughter, I didn’t have my son yet, but they would not do that, they would not take my kidney and give it to him.</span> <span id="s284">And they couldn’t do it -- they didn’t do it because the only case they had was at that time in -- in France and it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s285">What they didn't have is the -- what do you call -- I -- I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s286">I’ll remember maybe in the course of th -- I will tell you what it’s called.</span> <span id="s287">What -- his -- his case was called -- he had cystenuria.</span> <span id="s288">That -- that what this stones were, cysten stones.</span> <span id="s289">But that was caused.</span> <span id="s290">They could -- they also didn’t have any relatives of his to check if, let’s say there was something in the family, but they don’t know about anything.</span> <span id="s291">So they only -- they -- their case is that he died from the wounding.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: I had asked you before if you had much contact with your neighbors and you said no, but did the people of the town know that you and your husband were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: You know, I -- I was thinking about it.</span> <span id="s294">I really don’t know if they knew.</span> <span id="s295">There was no -- in that little town, there was no temple or anything, and you couldn’t really do there anything.</span> <span id="s296">Whatever you did, you did in the house.</span> <span id="s297">I mean, the -- the maid could have known, but I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s298">I really have no idea.</span> <span id="s299">I do -- I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Were there other Jews in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No.</span> <span id="s302">There were no -- except my aunt.</span> <span id="s303">We -- we took my aunt and my uncle, because my uncle, like I said, he was in -- in the camp, he came back to on -- that was not -- they were living in Ostrow, not where we lived.</span> <span id="s304">So my husband took them to Freiwaldau and he kept them there.</span> <span id="s305">But they -- he wasn’t Jewish, her -- her husband, she was the one who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s306">And in 40 -- in ’28, or when they got married, he converted.</span> <span id="s307">He also was circumcised.</span> <span id="s308">So -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: I’m going to pause and change the tape.</span> <span id="s310">Just one minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Erika Eckstut.</span> <span id="s313">This is tape number one, side B. And I wanted to ask you about the state of your health at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s314">Did you have anything that happened to you during the war, any illness or accidents or any kinds of problems that presented you with any health issues at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I -- I was beaten at the place where we were taken when we were supposed to go to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s316">And my back was always in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s317">It still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Did you get any medical care, either during the war or immediately after the war for your back?</span> <span id="s319">A: No, I didn’t get any -- any medical care and one of the reasons was that really and truly I-I -- very, very early after we got married, my husband got sick.</span> <span id="s320">And I was so worried about him that I just -- and I was young.</span> <span id="s321">And I just said ah, I’ll make it, I’ll make it and I never -- I never really did do anything about it.</span> <span id="s322">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s323">No, as we get older, it gets worse, but I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: You also mentioned that there were Germans in the town and part of your husband’s responsibility was to get -- get them out of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Did you personally witness any acts of retribution or retaliation against collaborators or any Germans that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s328">I just heard from -- fro -- oh, you all right?</span> <span id="s329">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s330">My husband was -- was not telling me really, but his friends who were there, some wanted to -- to do something to them.</span> <span id="s331">And my husband wouldn’t even touch them, and would not allow that anything -- y-you know, he -- he’s just wouldn’t even touch them.</span> <span id="s332">He was so mad that he wouldn’t touch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: You also mentioned before about attempts to find your parents, you didn’t know where they were and they -- you left them in one place and they ended up in another place.</span> <span id="s334">Did you put your name on a list of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s336">I didn’t put my name any place.</span> <span id="s337">That da -- that what -- was what my uncle did.</span> <span id="s338">H-He had here three brothers, but only one did it.</span> <span id="s339">He -- he put all our names down.</span> <span id="s340">My father’s, my mother’s, my sister’s and my -- m-my and myself, and my name.</span> <span id="s341">Of course, his parents too, but they -- they were unfortunately, you know, they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Are you telling me that he put down your names that he was looking for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yeah, after the war, you know.</span> <span id="s344">He did that.</span> <span id="s345">I didn’t have anything to do with it, I just got a letter with 25 dollars.</span> <span id="s346">That’s all I got from my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: What was your reaction, you and your sister, when you heard that your parents were alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Oh, wa-wa-what should I tell you?</span> <span id="s349">We started to dance and we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s350">We were ready to go right away, but we couldn’t, and our husbands went.</span> <span id="s351">You know, they -- they were both in the uniform, they was -- were still, you know and they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you have any correspondence with your parents before your husbands went to -- to collect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s354">I really don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s355">I don’t remember having any because right away they went.</span> <span id="s356">And you see, when they came back, the house where I told you we lived -- my sister was with me that time, and -- and we were waiting for our parents to come.</span> <span id="s357">And we lived on a hill up, and it’s a -- we heard the car coming.</span> <span id="s358">And our -- our top was like a -- ju-just a plain top and we saw the car way down.</span> <span id="s359">So I started to run down and I ran three steps I took at once and my sister went slower.</span> <span id="s360">And I was there before my sister.</span> <span id="s361">And when the car didn’t even stop when my father came out.</span> <span id="s362">And my father was wounded in the first World War, and he walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s363">And I heard my mother say den stock, den stock, the cane.</span> <span id="s364">And he didn’t take it.</span> <span id="s365">He was in my arms, I was in his and we were just holding.</span> <span id="s366">And he never took the cane again.</span> <span id="s367">But unfortunately, he didn't live too long, you know.</span> <span id="s368">He died when he left Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: That was in 1949 -- fo -- no, 40 -- ’49 in -- yeah, ’49 in March, I think it was.</span> <span id="s371">Yeah.</span> <span id="s372">’49 or ’48, I don’t know if it was ’48 or ’49, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s373">Either ’48 or ’49, because they were looking for it -- the reason my parents had to leave, my sister had left.</span> <span id="s374">But my parents had to leave because they were looking for a German baron and he looked like my father, and my father, who knew the policeman who came to us, he says, you know me.</span> <span id="s375">He says, you know my -- my parents.</span> <span id="s376">You -- you know me, I’m not from no baron.</span> <span id="s377">He says, all I have to do is take my pants down.</span> <span id="s378">He said not with the Russians, you don’t.</span> <span id="s379">He said, because some, you know, had it done too, you know to -- so my -- they gave my father a diplomatic passport and he left for Vienna.</span> <span id="s380">And five weeks later he died.</span> <span id="s381">And when he died he had the same thing which he -- which he had two times before.</span> <span id="s382">Once when he left our little town, first -- he had the first heart attack.</span> <span id="s383">Then he had one in Prague where I came.</span> <span id="s384">And the third one he had, he said my sunshine is not here.</span> <span id="s385">He says, don’t call anybody and sure enough he -- he didn’t -- he didn't have --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And who was his sunshine?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I was.</span> <span id="s388">I was both times with him and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did your parents say anything to you or make any comment about the fact that their sons-in-law came to pick them up, they didn't even know that you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah, oh did they make th -- did they make comments, of course.</span> <span id="s391">And their first comment to me was that he has to announce the weddings.</span> <span id="s392">I mean, it’s not a wedding.</span> <span id="s393">He says, you know cannot say -- how can you take anybody else if your parents are alive?</span> <span id="s394">You know, I had a formant -- what -- what do you c -- I -- I don’t know what you call it, formant, you know, somebody who talks for me.</span> <span id="s395">But you had to -- probably you had to say.</span> <span id="s396">I -- I didn’t fill out any papers, my husband did.</span> <span id="s397">I don’t know what he said there, that I don’t have my parents.</span> <span id="s398">They had to be dead, you had to have -- and my father was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s399">He says, you know, I -- I’ll have that done in no time.</span> <span id="s400">But he loved my husband, but -- and I said, but I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s401">I really don’t want it, and anyway he didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s402">But then he w -- he -- he did one thing, which was so nice, when he, for me when I was 18, he aw -- w-went to court and he initiated the case that they should forgive me my age and give me -- because we had still ta -- we got food on ration, because there was not food.</span> <span id="s403">And I got children’s ration.</span> <span id="s404">I had already a daughter, I was breastfeeding.</span> <span id="s405">So -- and I couldn't go with them anywhere for drink or anything.</span> <span id="s406">When they went I had to stay out [indecipherable] outside.</span> <span id="s407">So he -- he did that.</span> <span id="s408">I have that document.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: When did you realize the full extent of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I -- I really realized that, I think very early, my sister and I.</span> <span id="s411">We never talked to our parents what we went through.</span> <span id="s412">We never told them, they never told us how come that from the Bukovina they ended up in -- in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s413">How did they get to Bucharest?</span> <span id="s414">Why did they g -- were they there.</span> <span id="s415">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s416">Neither does my sister, we never, ever talked about it.</span> <span id="s417">I think we all knew what happened.</span> <span id="s418">We all knew exactly what happened and we didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s419">We just didn’t.</span> <span id="s420">We just tried hard to make life as possible like other people.</span> <span id="s421">It wasn’t easy, you know, it’s very, very hard.</span> <span id="s422">And e-even when you ask me when I was 17 if I knew what the marriage was, I had no idea what the marriage was, absolutely none.</span> <span id="s423">And we just wanted to be loved.</span> <span id="s424">And we tried to make life as best as we knew how.</span> <span id="s425">But I never talked to my parents about it, never, and neither did my sister.</span> <span id="s426">Neither did they ca -- talk to us about it at all.</span> <span id="s427">And I know it was only because we knew what happened.</span> <span id="s428">I mean, at that point of course we knew what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: How did you know what had happened?</span> <span id="s430">A: From -- from what I went through, I -- I knew that.</span> <span id="s431">I -- I mean I knew what -- what went on all along.</span> <span id="s432">I mean, I was there, it’s not that I didn’t -- if I would have been hidden or something they wouldn’t have known, but I was exposed to it, and I -- so I knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Had you heard during the war about Auschwitz and some of the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Auschwitz I never heard.</span> <span id="s435">I -- I don’t -- I don’t think I her -- but I knew that there were camps and I knew it was bad.</span> <span id="s436">Why did I run to Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Were you aware of any deaths of Jews, survivors, after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: After the war was over, yes, I remember too, was -- I heard that some people who came back and they didn’t find anybody, they committed suicide.</span> <span id="s439">And yeah, it w -- it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s440">It’s -- yeah, I heard some people, you know they -- they commit, you know, was -- it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s441">It was awful, I remember.</span> <span id="s442">Some of the -- yeah, my father came in ’46, because in ’46 was the first time we had Passover in our house, and the soldiers which work with my -- they -- they were officers, you know, were in the same thing with my husband.</span> <span id="s443">They all came to our house, because we were the only ones who had parents.</span> <span id="s444">And my father was, of course, in -- in charge of the Passover.</span> <span id="s445">We -- he really -- och, tha-that was -- we have two people who were with -- with us when my father conducted the Passover, and th-they are in New York.</span> <span id="s446">That was so nice, that was so nice, my father conducted -- that was in -- in ’46.</span> <span id="s447">Oh, that was such a nice Passover.</span> <span id="s448">Was very, very nice, and we had -- i-it was -- I don’t even remember how many people were there, but there were all, you know, his friends and all, they all came to us.</span> <span id="s449">He was the only one who could make a Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: You mentioned they were your husband’s friends, they were the officers --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes, [indecipherable] officers from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Were there many Jewish officers in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah, there was, because they -- they were about -- at least six or seven came.</span> <span id="s454">At least.</span> <span id="s455">I-I -- I really don’t remember how many there were, but there were a -- there were a lot, and they were talking about it for years to come and today if you talk to him, he w -- he will tell you, you know, he was at -- for Passover, you know, at Neuman’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You were one of the few to have parents that come back.</span> <span id="s457">And you mention that you did not speak about the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: -- with your parents.</span> <span id="s460">But did your parents offer you any guidance or any words of wisdom to help you rebuild life after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I -- I think, you know in their -- th-th-they were extremely loving and giving people.</span> <span id="s462">And they gave you a lot without even you realizing.</span> <span id="s463">Th-They did help you, without you being aware of it, because I remember things, you know, where -- where they would -- li-like for example, I remember when my daughter, she wouldn’t eat at all.</span> <span id="s464">And I would sit there and sit and everything would fly.</span> <span id="s465">I would bake all kinds of things and she wouldn’t eat -- she would put it in one cheek and the other cheek.</span> <span id="s466">And when I hold her nose she spit it out.</span> <span id="s467">And I was sitting there and sitting and in one time, you know, when she spit it out, I just slapped her, you know, on the face.</span> <span id="s468">And my father went white.</span> <span id="s469">I mean, he went white.</span> <span id="s470">I have never seen him like that, and he walked away.</span> <span id="s471">And then later on he took me aside and he says, where did you ever see touching a child?</span> <span id="s472">I said, but she doesn’t -- she doesn’t swallow.</span> <span id="s473">And my father, you know, had a very long talk with me.</span> <span id="s474">And then the other long talk we had was when he realized that I did not speak German to my mother.</span> <span id="s475">And my mother, unfortunately didn’t speak much Czech, she was not Czech and we never spoke Czech in the house, we always spoke German.</span> <span id="s476">And he sat me and my sister down and he had a talk with us.</span> <span id="s477">And he says, you can’t be the way you are.</span> <span id="s478">Why don’t you speak with your mother the way you always spoke?</span> <span id="s479">And I said, I have nothing what to say in -- with my father I could speak Czech, because he spoke Czech very well, too.</span> <span id="s480">And I said, m -- I -- I don’t have anything to say in German, what -- why should I speak German?</span> <span id="s481">I don’t want to speak German.</span> <span id="s482">He said, why don’t you want to speak German?</span> <span id="s483">I said, because I don’t like the language.</span> <span id="s484">He said, what did the language do to you?</span> <span id="s485">I said, I don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s486">He said, but I want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s487">I said, I don’t.</span> <span id="s488">He said, do you realize that if you hate, then Hitler won the war?</span> <span id="s489">He says, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s490">The language didn’t do anything to you.</span> <span id="s491">And he talked to us.</span> <span id="s492">My sister was always smarter than I, she was also older, and she got it before I got it.</span> <span id="s493">And one time I was very bad, because he wouldn’t let loose.</span> <span id="s494">My sister wasn’t like me, she also spoke to my mother.</span> <span id="s495">And I g -- I just got up and left.</span> <span id="s496">And my mother immediately came to me and says, would you please go back and apologize?</span> <span id="s497">I said no.</span> <span id="s498">She said, will you go back and apologize?</span> <span id="s499">And I did go back and apologize, and I did si -- it took me awhile, and I started to speak to my mother in German.</span> <span id="s500">And it -- th-that was the only time that we spoke about the war, and my father made sure that I have no hate in my heart, and I still don’t.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t know what it is to really hate.</span> <span id="s502">I don’t hate anybody.</span> <span id="s503">I never did and I can’t hate.</span> <span id="s504">I don’t like what happened.</span> <span id="s505">I am not, you know, the person who can forgive anything.</span> <span id="s506">I’m not such a big person, I don’t like what happened.</span> <span id="s507">But I don’t hate.</span> <span id="s508">And I tried to prove it to my father, too.</span> <span id="s509">He wasn’t here any more, and I st -- always try to do the right thing.</span> <span id="s510">I have always tried -- the first time that I came across a German girl in the school, I -- I did everything I had to do for her.</span> <span id="s511">And then she invited me to go to her wedding, and I went.</span> <span id="s512">But I said, Daddy, I’m doing this for you, and anyway -- it wa -- they -- they were both very, very loving, my parents.</span> <span id="s513">They were su -- such nice, easy people to get along with.</span> <span id="s514">Very, very nice people, very loving, very loving.</span> <span id="s515">That was very nice.</span> <span id="s516">Where am I now?</span> <span id="s517">Where was I really when I told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: In addition to the advice that your parents gave you after the war, did your parents -- you mentioned something about going back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yeah, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Tell me where, exactly, you went back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I went back to school in Prague, because that was, you know, we left Prague, I think it was in December or whenever, whenever he was -- he -- he was already in Freiwaldau, we got married in Freiwaldau, but I was still -- you know, I was with him, and we -- I had -- just I took the test, you know.</span> <span id="s522">And the end -- the -- it started in September, started to school.</span> <span id="s523">And I went to school in Prague and I went to school, you know, I continued.</span> <span id="s524">I was with my sister, she was in -- in Prague, I was with her.</span> <span id="s525">And I went through the first -- the first part, and then I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s526">And the professor I took where -- I mean, I took [indecipherable] I had, he came once to Prague -- to New York.</span> <span id="s527">A neighbor of ours was waiting for a niece who came from Prague, she was my friend.</span> <span id="s528">And he never knew her, he knew her as a little girl.</span> <span id="s529">And she came with her husband and her son.</span> <span id="s530">And he wanted me to go with him if I would recogni -- of course I recognized him.</span> <span id="s531">So I went with him and as we were standing upstairs and the people go out -- come out, you know after they go through the -- the -- wh-whatever they have to go when they come from a --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Customs.</span> <span id="s534">So I said, here she is.</span> <span id="s535">And right behind her was a man with a -- wi -- li-like a moustache, and I look and I -- I know the guy.</span> <span id="s536">I mean, I know him.</span> <span id="s537">He is a professor I had years ago.</span> <span id="s538">So I was waiting, and when she came out her uncle went t-to her and my aunt was there and all.</span> <span id="s539">And I went over to the guy and I asked him in Czech if he is Czech.</span> <span id="s540">He says, of course I am, he says, how do you know?</span> <span id="s541">I says, I’m your pupil.</span> <span id="s542">He said, I can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s543">And then, you know, he -- slowly he remembered me and he went to Chicago.</span> <span id="s544">And I said, could you come and stay with us after you are finished?</span> <span id="s545">He went to a lecture.</span> <span id="s546">He said, I would love to, but I have no money.</span> <span id="s547">I said, doesn’t matter, I says, I’ll give you some money and you’ll come and stay with us.</span> <span id="s548">And he came and he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s549">He was in my house and I was already married to my husband, but my husband didn’t have a job yet, you know, that’s a long story.</span> <span id="s550">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: This is with a different husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: It’s a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: -- you’re -- you’re jumping a little bit ahead of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Did you want to stay in Czechoslovakia after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: I had no choice, because my husband was very ill.</span> <span id="s557">I could not have gone anywhere.</span> <span id="s558">Because also what I didn’t tell you, in -- in December of ’44 -- ’45, a cousin of my late husband came to Freiwaldau where we were, and he wanted to take ma -- he had every documents for my husband to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s559">And at that time he wasn’t ill yet.</span> <span id="s560">And my husband said he won’t go, he won’t leave me.</span> <span id="s561">He says, you don’t have to leave her.</span> <span id="s562">We’ll -- we -- you’ll divorce her and I’m going to marry her, or my chauffeur is going to marry her, just you know, for formal.</span> <span id="s563">And we go to -- they were in, I think in Belgium they were stationed.</span> <span id="s564">And my husband said, I am not going to divorce her and nobody is going to marry her but me.</span> <span id="s565">And he wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s566">And he didn’t go.</span> <span id="s567">I would have liked to go out.</span> <span id="s568">My sister left, my parents left.</span> <span id="s569">I was the only one l-left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: You told me how your father left and went.</span> <span id="s571">What about your sister, when did she leave, an-and under what circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: My sister -- my -- my brother-in-law actually deserted the army, he was in the army and he just left to Israel to help with the Haganah.</span> <span id="s573">And of course that’s also another story.</span> <span id="s574">When he came to Israel they wouldn’t take him.</span> <span id="s575">He was 15 years older than my sister, he was 38 or 39 when he came there and he didn’t speak any Hebrew.</span> <span id="s576">And he had a very hard time learning a language.</span> <span id="s577">He was from Czechoslovakia from the mountains, and he spoke Hungarian and Czech.</span> <span id="s578">We never spoke Hungarian, we were not from that part.</span> <span id="s579">And he couldn’t learn right away the Hebrew, so he had also problems in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s580">What -- they left right when -- when the communist came, because the o -- the other reason they le -- he left also was that a lot of Jewish officers were killed right after the communists took over.</span> <span id="s581">Not only Jewish, but some were Jewish, you see, quite a few.</span> <span id="s582">Was right in there and o-other, you know -- then Morovitz was there who was killed, he was married to a Jewish lady who was pregnant when she -- when he got killed.</span> <span id="s583">It was terrible, because Swoboda did not go with -- with -- with the communists, he didn’t do anything to help them, and the army didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s584">The army was already, I mean they could have taken them on.</span> <span id="s585">They were still in -- in gear.</span> <span id="s586">But they was -- so everybody who could, left.</span> <span id="s587">Because the officers who left didn’t have no permission, they didn’t leave from the army, they just left.</span> <span id="s588">You know, not legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: I’m not sure I understood all that you just said.</span> <span id="s590">When the communists came --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: -- some of the Czech officers were -- were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: All the [indecipherable] were killed.</span> <span id="s594">Some of the Czech officers were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Why?</span> <span id="s597">They said they are against th-the prolat -- proletariat.</span> <span id="s598">They are against the Russians, or whatever, to -- you know, whatever they had -- whatever reason they had, they -- they didn’t -- they didn’t like them and they killed them.</span> <span id="s599">It was, you know, they always -- they had a reason, you know, they said they were against -- I mean, it -- it was absolutely insane, what they did.</span> <span id="s600">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s601">I mean, these were all officers which were in Russia and fought with the Russians.</span> <span id="s602">And they were not communists, they said.</span> <span id="s603">Now, not all were, but I mean they -- it -- it was a terrible time for us.</span> <span id="s604">A terrible time.</span> <span id="s605">My -- my husband was at that time already sick.</span> <span id="s606">So they were, wh-what are we going to do with him, you know.</span> <span id="s607">They didn’t expect him to stay alive as long as he did, you know, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s608">So that was one of the reasons they didn’t do anything for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: How did your life change, aside from your husband being sick, but when the communists came, how did that change your life, yours and your husbands?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: It-It changed a lot.</span> <span id="s611">My husband had to leave the army, because he also was sick, you know, a lot.</span> <span id="s612">Then he had a very big problem getting a job.</span> <span id="s613">And finally he got a job.</span> <span id="s614">But you see, when he was -- when he got the job, he was not a communist, you know, because a lot of them were in the, you know, a lot of them were really, you know, communist wi -- and he was not.</span> <span id="s615">And there were others who were killed who also were not, you know, communists.</span> <span id="s616">They were not really -- really communists.</span> <span id="s617">And they took him there and he had -- they asked him how come he doesn’t read the Ruda Pravel.</span> <span id="s618">And he said he was wounded, he can’t hold the paper, it’s too big to hold.</span> <span id="s619">And anyway, he didn’t make to enter, so they always gave him a postponement.</span> <span id="s620">And then finally he got a job in Kovo -- th-that was in -- in a job which had to do with -- th-the -- the -- it has to -- had to do with other p-places, you know, you had to go to Bulgaria or whatever, you know, in -- in the -- in the area of the Russian things, he had to travel there, too.</span> <span id="s621">So he was -- he was working until he died in that job, kovo, it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: What exactly was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Kovo -- kovo is not a -- a name of anything, you know, it’s not that I can tell you it was kava or -- I mean, coffee or anything.</span> <span id="s624">It was a sort -- a sort of something, you know.</span> <span id="s625">I-It wa -- it was the import and export of a -- or tha-that’s what it was, it was the import and export of some foods.</span> <span id="s626">And you know, wherever there was, you know, the most of the food went to -- to Russia.</span> <span id="s627">And whatever you could, you have for the -- for the Czechs, you know, and you went also -- he went to Bulgaria -- to Bulgaria he went.</span> <span id="s628">And then he had to go to Germany for -- for being a -- what do you call it, a witness, you know, so -- so he went to Germany.</span> <span id="s629">And then he had to go -- th-they also asked him if he would go to America.</span> <span id="s630">He said no, why would he go to America?</span> <span id="s631">They said, you have a mother-in-law there.</span> <span id="s632">Course my mother, that’s ano -- another story.</span> <span id="s633">My mother ended up in the United States after my sister already left Israel, she came there too.</span> <span id="s634">And he said he would never take his mother-in-law instead of his wife.</span> <span id="s635">He liked his wife.</span> <span id="s636">He was bad, he really was bad.</span> <span id="s637">But he was so wounded they didn’t -- you know, he was every year at least two months in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: You mentioned he was called to Germany to testify.</span> <span id="s639">Would you explain that?</span> <span id="s640">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s641">He wa -- he was called to Germany to testify to be a witness for -- i-it was for Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s642">For Nuremberg he was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Do you know any of the particulars of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No.</span> <span id="s645">I don’t remember anything, I only know he went.</span> <span id="s646">I know he was there -- I had some pictures -- I don’t have that, where he was we saw all the people sitting there, but I don’t have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Did he actually testify or was he just there in case they needed him to testify?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s649">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s650">I really don’t know if he testified or he was jus -- he was there in that whole thing when it was, but if he testified I don’t know.</span> <span id="s651">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s652">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: I’m going to have to pause to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: -- of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Erika Eckstut.</span> <span id="s656">This is tape number two, side A. And you have been talking to me about the Nuremberg trial and you said that your husband had been called to -- to be there at Nuremberg --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: -- an-and you did say that you don’t know exactly -- was he already sick at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yeah, h-he was six from -- sick from ’46 and he went, but I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s660">And I know he talked probably about it when he came home.</span> <span id="s661">I really don’t remember much about it.</span> <span id="s662">I know he went, I know he had a picture from all -- I saw all these people there.</span> <span id="s663">I know he wasn’t very happy about a lot of things, but I really don’t remember what.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Do you remember reading about the trial and -- and the verdicts and everything?</span> <span id="s665">Did you feel that justice was done there?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: I don’t remember, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s667">Because you know, you have to understand, I really and truly had my hands full.</span> <span id="s668">I had my kids, my husband, and it was -- oh, you know, I -- I -- I’m sure at the time I did, but I don’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You also talked about the political changes going on around you when the communists came.</span> <span id="s670">And I wanted to ask you about anti-Semitism in the period after the war and before the communists came ov -- over.</span> <span id="s671">Did you notice any anti-Semitism around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: No, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s673">I lived in a building in Prague, and I really don’t remember any anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: And after the communists came, did you notice any anti-Semitism, either within the government or just around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: No, I -- I really don’t, but iv -- as long as my husband was alive, I didn’t work.</span> <span id="s676">I was home, and I didn’t have any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s677">We lived in a building where there lived a lot of Jews and non-Jews so you know, you should have.</span> <span id="s678">And I have -- my kids, you know, were friends with Jewish kids and with non-Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s679">No, I don’t remember to have any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s680">At least I didn’t come across any.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Were you aware of the events surrounding the partition of Palestine?</span> <span id="s682">Were there any news reports, or did the Jewish community around you say anything about the partition in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No, I don’t remember anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: You said that while your husband was still alive, you did not work.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: And you have two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Can you tell me the years that your two children were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: My daughter was born on September 16, 1946.</span> <span id="s690">My son was born March 13, 1952.</span> <span id="s691">It’s almost six years difference between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: My daughter’s name is Elishka.</span> <span id="s694">It was Elise -- I mean, it was Elishka, not Elise.</span> <span id="s695">Now it’s Elise, now it’s Elise.</span> <span id="s696">And my son is Michael.</span> <span id="s697">It was Misha, but here it’s Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Tell me about your circumstances, your family, when your husband passed away and -- and what you did immediately after.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: You see, I had there lots of friends.</span> <span id="s700">I really didn’t have any relatives.</span> <span id="s701">This one relatives which we had in [indecipherable] my uncle came, my aunt never came.</span> <span id="s702">And one of the cousins, there were four children, one came.</span> <span id="s703">And I had a ver -- like a mother there.</span> <span id="s704">It was the daughter of that lady who was a friend of my late husband, they went to school together.</span> <span id="s705">And they took us in like we were family.</span> <span id="s706">And she did more than I ever did anything.</span> <span id="s707">I was very quiet.</span> <span id="s708">I didn’t -- i-it was a military funeral.</span> <span id="s709">I was there, but I really didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s710">I didn’t talk to anybody and I didn’t just do anything.</span> <span id="s711">And they used to come to my house, you know, the doctors who were -- some of them -- my late husband was a medical student before he went to the war.</span> <span id="s712">And one of the doctors was a friend of his, they went to same medical school.</span> <span id="s713">And he came over and they were trying to -- when I had coffee, Babi would make coffee, or si -- mother, you know.</span> <span id="s714">And he would say do -- don’t you want to break the cup?</span> <span id="s715">He says, we’ll have some noise.</span> <span id="s716">I didn’t want to do nothing.</span> <span id="s717">I didn’t talk to them, nothing.</span> <span id="s718">They came, they left.</span> <span id="s719">And then one day -- and I didn’t take care of the kids, Babi took care of the kids.</span> <span id="s720">Never asked about the kids.</span> <span id="s721">And one day I -- every day around five o’clock I used to go for the walk, for a long walk, after my late husband died.</span> <span id="s722">And Babi always went with me.</span> <span id="s723">One day when I went to the door to go, she said, I’m not going with you.</span> <span id="s724">And if you go yourself, she says, I’m going put the children in a -- in a home for -- you know, without the -- for children without parents.</span> <span id="s725">I hesitated just a second, and I left.</span> <span id="s726">Wa -- when I walked, I said to myself, she’s not my mother.</span> <span id="s727">She is a strange woman.</span> <span id="s728">She doesn’t care for my children.</span> <span id="s729">She will put my children in a home [indecipherable] from home, because she doesn’t care.</span> <span id="s730">And I went home, I didn’t say anything to her and I went into my daughter’s.</span> <span id="s731">My son was only five at the time.</span> <span id="s732">And she cried and I cried, and it really, you know, broke everything between me and my children.</span> <span id="s733">My son was really too -- too young for it.</span> <span id="s734">And then the doctor came and he talked to me.</span> <span id="s735">I didn’t talk to Babi at all, I -- I just didn’t pay attention to her.</span> <span id="s736">And he came and he told me that if it wasn’t for Babi, that time when I walked out by myself, they were all around me, they didn’t know what I’ll do, and they were ready to put me away in Freiwaldau, you know, where I told you we were?</span> <span id="s737">And Babi said no, let me do it one more time.</span> <span id="s738">And she had called and she said that I went to Elise and everything is all right between my daughter and me.</span> <span id="s739">But otherwise I -- I just wasn’t, you know, anything.</span> <span id="s740">And when I heard that, I went to Babi and I apologized.</span> <span id="s741">You know, it was so bad wha -- what I did to her.</span> <span id="s742">And then I went to work, and -- and then came the time when I -- I immediately applied to go to the United States and I was told immediately that I will not go, that they will not let me go.</span> <span id="s743">That the children from a Czech officer will not be beggars on Broadway.</span> <span id="s744">I didn’t understand what that meant, but it was something it meant.</span> <span id="s745">And then -- then wa -- one t -- when I got the refusal that I’m not going to go, I went back one time.</span> <span id="s746">I asked again.</span> <span id="s747">And the guy there said, I told you, you’re not going to go.</span> <span id="s748">He says, what do you do -- lose, a man?</span> <span id="s749">He says, you don’t look so bad, you can get a man.</span> <span id="s750">And I got so mad.</span> <span id="s751">I got so mad, and I said, if it wasn’t for my husband, you wouldn’t be sitting here, and how dare you talk to me like that?</span> <span id="s752">And I said, and I am going to the president.</span> <span id="s753">And I was with my little boy, he didn’t go to school yet, and I went to the president.</span> <span id="s754">When I came there, there was the soldiers and they put the bayonet, they didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s755">And I said to my son, I said, you stay right here.</span> <span id="s756">I said, if one hair is going to be crooked on this kid, I says, I cut both your heads off.</span> <span id="s757">And I went between the guns and I went in.</span> <span id="s758">They didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s759">I -- I made one step -- I went in and there was another guy.</span> <span id="s760">He says, can I help you?</span> <span id="s761">I said yes, I want to speak to the president.</span> <span id="s762">He says, do you have an appointment?</span> <span id="s763">I said, I thought the president is for the people, and I am a people and I wanted to talk to him.</span> <span id="s764">I have a grievance and I would like to tell him.</span> <span id="s765">He said okay and he took me in, and when I walked in, the president walked out.</span> <span id="s766">I said, he’s leaving.</span> <span id="s767">I was all excited.</span> <span id="s768">I saw him and he’s leaving.</span> <span id="s769">And the lady says, don’t worry, he’s here.</span> <span id="s770">He -- she says, you just come in and we’ll talk.</span> <span id="s771">And I complained to her and all and she says, do you need more money?</span> <span id="s772">Because I had a pension and my children had a pension because we had military, you know.</span> <span id="s773">And I said no, I have money enough, I -- what could I have bought?</span> <span id="s774">There was nothing left to buy anyway.</span> <span id="s775">I said, I just wanted to see my mother, I says, I haven’t see her.</span> <span id="s776">We went through the war and now I’m not going to see her any more if I don’t go now.</span> <span id="s777">She says, I can’t promise you to get -- go to the United States, but I can give you some more money.</span> <span id="s778">And I left and I never, ever a-asked again to go until it was three years later I got the letter that if I want to go I have to give up my pension and everything, and I can go.</span> <span id="s779">You know, it was so unfair to take the pension away from me, but I had to -- I had to sign away my pension, my -- everything I had, and I could -- I could go.</span> <span id="s780">And then when we -- before I went I had to go to court to sign for the children.</span> <span id="s781">And when I was ready to sign, a woman got up and she says she has a grievance.</span> <span id="s782">She says, how can I sign away the things for the children?</span> <span id="s783">I got up and I had with me one of the officers who -- who was a lawyer and he said, shut up and sit down.</span> <span id="s784">I said, who is that woman?</span> <span id="s785">How dare she tell me I can’t sign for the children?</span> <span id="s786">Where was she all this time?</span> <span id="s787">Did she go with Mike to the hospital -- you know, my son wa-was sick, you know.</span> <span id="s788">And anyway, that was -- wh-which I didn’t know, but my kids had s -- whatever they took out, she was the guardian for my children.</span> <span id="s789">So anyway I signed and -- and we left.</span> <span id="s790">But it was -- it was a terrible thing, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: I have a few questions about what you just said.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: You said you went to work.</span> <span id="s794">What kind of work did you do after your husband died?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: I was on the -- on the main street like -- what is here the main street?</span> <span id="s796">I don’t know where the main street.</span> <span id="s797">Like on s -- Fifth Avenue, in Prague [indecipherable], it was a bookstore for books.</span> <span id="s798">And all I had to do is take an exam for -- for books for -- children books, medical books, whatever.</span> <span id="s799">And for poetry and all that.</span> <span id="s800">So I took it.</span> <span id="s801">My daughter was an ardent reader, so the children’s books I have had all color.</span> <span id="s802">Then I had a friend, she was a lawyer, she gave me all that.</span> <span id="s803">And I made it except poetry I wasn’t very good, I -- I couldn’t remember who wrote “The Raven” from all the things.</span> <span id="s804">But I made it and I worked -- it was military, Nasha Voisko.</span> <span id="s805">And I

permission to leave, they said the children of an officer would not be allowed to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Be allowed to be beggars on -- on Broadway, I never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Were they saying that you could go without them, or were they stop --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah, oh yeah, they said it clear.</span> <span id="s811">They said it clearly.</span> <span id="s812">If I want to go, she said, I can, but she can’t let the children go.</span> <span id="s813">I said forget it.</span> <span id="s814">I’m not going anywhere without my children.</span> <span id="s815">And then I was scared for a long time, you know, until I got this letter and I went there -- my sister, you know, arranged that.</span> <span id="s816">My sister and

she says, bring Mrs. Pietnik, who was my maid, and when my late husband died I wanted to get rid of her, but I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s827">She said she is not going to leave me.</span> <span id="s828">She is not going to leave me, and she stayed, and I had problems because of her.</span> <span id="s829">Because she would call to -- to -- I -- I -- she would call to the office and say, you know, can she speak to her [indecipherable] that’s to my lady.</span> <span id="s830">And they said, who is that?</span> <span id="s831">I said, that’s my aunt.</span> <span id="s832">She said she said she wants to speak.</span> <span id="s833">I said, she’s nuts, I said.</span> <span id="s834">She used to be a maid, I said, but now she doesn’t know what she’s talking about.</span> <span

before I even opened my mouth to speak.</span> <span id="s837">My brother-in-law, he shook me, he says, don’t worry, no communists came with you, you can talk here.</span> <span id="s838">I says, there is nothing what I can talk about.</span> <span id="s839">He says, you -- are you going talk to me or aren’t you?</span> <span id="s840">I was so scared.</span> <span id="s841">I was so scared you can’t even imagine, because you know, there was -- there -- there was also a widow, like I was, she was put away in -- in a jail and they took her kids.</span> <span id="s842">I don’t know what she did, but oh, I was so scared, don’t ask.</span> <span id="s843">Was terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s844">But I wanted to go back to Czechoslovakia the first year.</span> <span id="s845">I --

could get.</span> <span id="s853">I was -- I got -- once I met a ch -- Czech girl and she says, I can get you a great job, she says, you’ll be a -- a waitress.</span> <span id="s854">I says, fine.</span> <span id="s855">She says, but not a regular waitress, they have Bar Mitzvahs and so.</span> <span id="s856">You are just going to serve liquor.</span> <span id="s857">She says, you don’t have to speak English for that.</span> <span id="s858">I says, how do I know what to do?</span> <span id="s859">She says, don’t you know what whiskey is?</span> <span id="s860">They say whiskey, you give them whiskey.</span> <span id="s861">So what do I know?</span> <span id="s862">Came a -- everybody was very happy.</span> <span id="s863">They gave whiskey, I gave whiskey.</span> <span id="s864">I never gave water.</span> <span id="s865">I didn’t even know what water meant.</span> <span id="s866">And -- and the -- the owner came over and he said, you’re going go, he says,

mother put me in a school without asking me, to go -- you know, I -- I had one semester of medical school, so she put me in a school I should learn about technology.</span> <span id="s873">And I went -- I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s874">So, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s875">So I says, how am I going to do that?</span> <span id="s876">She says, you write as you hear it.</span> <span id="s877">You come home Beatrice will put it into English.</span> <span id="s878">The way I wrote there were no words which I wrote in any dictionary.</span> <span id="s879">You couldn’t make out the words.</span> <span id="s880">Oh, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s881">But by the time my sister finally got something out, I had to rewrite it.</span> <span id="s882">And then I typed it the nice up, I -- I liked it should be neat.</span> <span id="s883">And by the time I was done I knew it by heart.</span> <span id="s884">I knew it also how to write it because I had it.</span> <span id="s885">You know, it was all there.</span> <span id="s886">So I -- I actually beat the system.</span> <span id="s887">I had the best mark of all the girls.</span> <span id="s888">And you know, you had to take the test for the school and for -- for the state and for the medical -- for the -- for the medical, or whatever.</span> <span id="s889">For three places I had to take the test, you know, you took.</span> <span id="s890">And the school sent a note to please excuse my -- my -- my writing.</span> <span id="s891">And it came back I had no mistakes.</span> <span id="s892">And they called me, they said, how come you didn’t make mistakes?</span> <span id="s893">I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s894">I says, I guess I typed it -- I did it right.</span> <span id="s895">I knew it by heart and I didn’t make, and I had the best mark.</span> <span id="s896">And I worked for Gillette for almost 19 years and before I was in New York, but here.</span> <span id="s897">No, that’s too far, I go -- I come to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: You told me how difficult it was to get out of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Did you have any problems coming into the United States?</span> <span id="s901">Did you have to take any tests, any intelligence tests, any medical tests?</span> <span id="s902">Anything like that to come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No, I had the only problems with my -- with my back, because you see, when I was beaten, yeah a -- I was beaten on -- on the one side.</span> <span id="s904">And the scar I have, it is a scar -- so-some kind of a scar, it’s like I -- I had there something.</span> <span id="s905">I -- I -- it was just from beat -- beating.</span> <span id="s906">And the doctor wanted to give me his wife’s x-ray, I said absolutely not.</span> <span id="s907">And he gave it and he explained that that was done by beating.</span> <span id="s908">I was never -- I never had TB or anything.</span> <span id="s909">And when I came I had to go for the x-ray, you know, so they took an x-ray of me because that was that.</span> <span id="s910">But -- but when I came, I saw that was really America.</span> <span id="s911">Because I thought -- God bless America, when I came I didn’t see my mother, I didn’t see my sister, I didn’t see my friend from -- that was a soldier who I also knew.</span> <span id="s912">I -- I didn’t see anybody but men.</span> <span id="s913">All I saw were men, so many men, and I said God bless America, they knew the widow is coming.</span> <span id="s914">I was already three years a widow, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s915">And they were -- and they wanted to talk to me, I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s916">So they wanted to an-another language.</span> <span id="s917">That time I spoke Ru-Russian fluently and Romanian and German and Czech.</span> <span id="s918">They wanted German, but I didn't talk.</span> <span id="s919">I was too a -- too afraid to talk.</span> <span id="s920">And -- but I realized, they didn’t come for me.</span> <span id="s921">But I was in every newspaper in the United

you?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I was the first one to come out behind the Iron Curtain from -- from any -- any -- far.</span> <span id="s935">Nobody came out at my age.</span> <span id="s936">I was 30 and my daughter was what -- 13.</span> <span id="s937">And my son was almost eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Was it because you came out or because you came out with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: With my children and me, I was young.</span> <span id="s940">There was me came, two people from Slovakia, you know, I mean now ch -- Czechoslovakia were the

expectations about America?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I really didn’t know what to expect, you know, from America.</span> <span id="s947">I expected more than what I got, you know, actually, because -- I mean, not what I got, I didn’t expect to get anything.</span> <span id="s948">But my -- actually no, I did -- I didn’t even -- tha-that wasn’t really th-the -- the thing.</span> <span id="s949">When -- when I came, my sister just moved in in her first house.</span> <span id="s950">My sister was here when I came here.</span> <span id="s951">She is here, I don’t remember how many years longer than me.</span> <span id="s952">I think five, six, whatever.</span> <span id="s953">You know, they both worked, and they finally got themselves a house.</span> <span id="s954">But I couldn’t get the house, yi -- I couldn’t get no-nothing, I didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s955">So I stayed with my sister for a year and it was really hard because the house was very nice.</span> <span id="s956">My sister, my brother-in-law, they would have lied down, you could have walked on them.</span> <span id="s957">But they -- it was only a three room house.</span> <span id="s958">So she had to put two of her kids together and put two in -- my kids there.</span> <span id="s959">Then I slept in the living room.</span> <span id="s960">And it wasn’t very comfy, you know, what you call.</span> <span id="s961">But she didn’t want me to leave.</span> <span id="s962">In a -- in a year I left, I got an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Besides having all the men greet you --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: -- what other impressions did you get when you first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: That was one -- one big thing.</span> <span id="s967">Then, of course, I saw my mother and my sister and my friend came, the one I knew.</span> <span id="s968">He brought me the biggest candy box I’ve ever seen.</span> <span id="s969">It was like half the -- I -- I’ve never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s970">That was -- and then the ben -- the newspaper came.</span> <span id="s971">My mother got a -- a letter from a rabbi that he would marry me, with my children.</span> <span id="s972">I think that was fantastic.</span> <span id="s973">I didn’t go to him, but he wanted to marry me, but I didn't -- I didn’t take him up on it.</span> <span id="s974">My brother-in-law said I can’t because he’ll never be a rabbi [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: When exactly did you arrive in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I arrived on -- 1960 on -- on April 11th.</span> <span id="s977">It was the first day of Passover.</span> <span id="s978">And my mother came to see me.</span> <span id="s979">My mother was remarried too, my mother was 49 when my father passed away.</span> <span id="s980">And I -- I -- I was so shocked.</span> <span id="s981">She came to see me, she took me to my sisters and my sister was there and everybody was there.</span> <span id="s982">And then my mother left because my mother left with her husband to a place, because she didn’t make no -- no holidays, you know.</span> <span id="s983">So they left for their place.</span> <span id="s984">And I was so shocked that she left when I came.</span> <span id="s985">But she had it arranged beforehand.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Did she marry an American or another survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: American.</span> <span id="s988">An American, he was the owner of Hanes stocking.</span> <span id="s989">I had a lot of stockings, yeah.</span> <span id="s990">He -- he actually sent -- sent for me, you know, when we -- when I came, he was the one who sent the money, because my sister didn’t have any money and my mother didn’t have any money, so was Mr. Brand.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: How were you able to support yourself when you -- you finally -- you mentioned you had some jobs, but when was the first job that you had that really worked for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: The first job I really had which worked for me was as a technician.</span> <span id="s993">But that was about -- about -- you see, I was supposed to go two years to school, I went one year and I made it, you know, I -- I really took everything double and -- and so and I -- I really went out for it.</span> <span id="s994">I had a job right away, I was -- I took a job as a baby nurse.</span> <span id="s995">I -- I had no problems taking that test, except when they said, a baby you -- when a baby cries, what do you do?</span> <span id="s996">I said, you know, you check it and it’s -- and everything’s all right, if it’s not wet or it’s not hel -- health-wise alright, then you just, you know, let it cry until it goes to sleep.</span> <span id="s997">They said that’s not like that, you walk it around on your shoulder, it’s a shoulder baby.</span> <span id="s998">I didn’t know what a shoulder baby is.</span> <span id="s999">So that part what I -- I made it anyway, I answered all -- all their questions and I -- and I had the -- I got a job as a -- as a nurse.</span> <span id="s1000">And I would go for a week and be home or whatever, and then I would get another job.</span> <span id="s1001">And I did that until I -- until I became a technician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Did you live with the family that you cared for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1004">That was the bad part, you know.</span> <span id="s1005">Then -- then I had -- I -- I usually was only one week with whoever I was.</span> <span id="s1006">Then I got a job with a Dr. Greebo.</span> <span id="s1007">I am still in touch with them.</span> <span id="s1008">And the boy I had is here, he’s a lawyer, Howard.</span> <span id="s1009">I -- I went there and I was there nine months.</span> <span id="s1010">I was already in school, and when I finished school I had his job in his office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Two questions.</span> <span id="s1012">One, where exactly did you go to school?</span> <span id="s1013">In what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: In New York.</span> <span id="s1015">In -- in New York on 59th Street, on [indecipherable] whatever school it was, I have it written down.</span> <span id="s1016">I have a paper from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And who took care of your children while you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: My sister.</span> <span id="s1019">That’s what happened, I -- I couldn’t have taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: And you mentioned she had children.</span> <span id="s1021">Were they about the same age as your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes, it’s -- my so -- my older nephew and my daughter are three months apart.</span> <span id="s1023">And my younger son and her son area also -- are one year apart.</span> <span id="s1024">And her s -- older son is Milan and her younger son is Alan.</span> <span id="s1025">And my children, I gave you my -- the age, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Did your children have any trouble adjusting to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s1028">Very much.</span> <span id="s1029">My daughter had a lot of trouble with my nephew.</span> <span id="s1030">My -- then -- my nephew, I mean, he was really a little boy, too, I mean, even if he was 13.</span> <span id="s1031">He was just after his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1032">He had Bar Mitzvah in -- he was born January second.</span> <span id="s1033">So he had sometimes in January and we -- we came that same April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: I’m sorry, I have to interrupt you cause we’re running out of tape.</span> <span id="s1035">Just one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Erika Eckstut.</span> <span id="s1039">This is tape number two, side B. And I’m sorry I ran out of tape at the end of the last --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: You were telling me about your -- your children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: My children, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: -- adjusting, and you mentioned a Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: The Bar Mitzvah, my nephew was just Bar Mitzvah in January and we came here in April.</span> <span id="s1045">And he had to, of course, give up his room and be with his brother and my children had the other room.</span> <span id="s1046">And then when they went to school they went to the same -- same grade.</span> <span id="s1047">And my son also, you know, he went to the first grade.</span> <span id="s1048">First or second, I don’t remember what he went.</span> <span id="s1049">I think he went to the second grade.</span> <span id="s1050">He was a -- he was coming in the sec -- he went to the second grade.</span> <span id="s1051">And you know, he -- my nephew, the oldest -- wh-when they went to school -- I have to ge -- start -- when they went to school I wanted to give my daughter money, you know, for lunch.</span> <span id="s1052">And my brother-in-law said absolutely not, that’s my -- my job.</span> <span id="s1053">And he gave each one 50 cents or whatever.</span> <span id="s1054">And when they came to the bus my nephew would say to my daughter, you give me some money, that’s my money.</span> <span id="s1055">And she never said that to me tha-that -- I her -- heard that many, many years later, that she never had lunch, you know, because he wou -- he would take her money, you know, I mean he -- he -- it -- it was understandable.</span> <span id="s1056">My son was -- also had problems because he -- he’s a year older than the other kids and I said, don’t you dare touch him, you know, don’t -- don’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1057">And my daughter cr -- told me once, she says, you better tell him that he can touch him, because he is really and truly taking advantage of him and you told him don’t touch, and he doesn’t.</span> <span id="s1058">So I took care of that situation too.</span> <span id="s1059">And then my brother-in-law, he a -- what happened was with our crates what we took with us, one crate was broken or -- or wasn’t there and tha-that was the toys from my son.</span> <span id="s1060">And he had a train and whatever, and it was all gone.</span> <span id="s1061">So my brother-in-law said all the toys should be for the little -- little kid.</span> <span id="s1062">And his older brother said to him, don’t you dare touch anything, that’s all ours, not yours.</span> <span id="s1063">So I didn’t know about that either, of course.</span> <span id="s1064">So then one day my daughter says, why don’t you ask Mike what he’s doing when he comes home from school.</span> <span id="s1065">So I asked him, I said, what are you doing when you -- he says, I do my homework.</span> <span id="s1066">I says, and afterward?</span> <span id="s1067">He says, I do my homework.</span> <span id="s1068">I said, don’t you go outside and play?</span> <span id="s1069">He said, I have nothing left to play with, I have no toys.</span> <span id="s1070">So anyway, so I took my nephew aside one time and I told him, I said, look, I know it’s not easy for you and it’s not easy for us.</span> <span id="s1071">I says, your parents, I don’t know if they’re not aware of it or whatever happened.</span> <span id="s1072">I said, but one thing I can tell you.</span> <span id="s1073">Don’t do that to my children.</span> <span id="s1074">I said, don’t do that, because you’ll be sorry.</span> <span id="s1075">I’ll beat the living daylights out of you if you ever do it again.</span> <span id="s1076">It took me years before I got him out of his -- oh, he was really scared of me.</span> <span id="s1077">But I would have never done it, but -- but anyway, and my son also got better.</span> <span id="s1078">It -- it wa -- it was hard for them to adjust, it really was.</span> <span id="s1079">They had a completely different life, you know, and they had also a completely different life.</span> <span id="s1080">It was just as bad for them as for my kids, you know, they -- they weren't used to that, a whole family moves in.</span> <span id="s1081">So anyway, that’s how -- and then we finally got our o-own apartment and that was -- that took care of -- th-that -- we were good -- we had -- we had a really nice apartment.</span> <span id="s1082">It -- it was a bachelor’s apartment, but it was nice.</span> <span id="s1083">My s -- my daughter -- I had two jobs, I worked as a technician and my daughter was the one who took care of the shopping, you know, I mean, in the meantime she was already 14, and she was already a big girl.</span> <span id="s1084">I never had a babysitter for my children when I had my own apartment, I never.</span> <span id="s1085">But I had an apartment in the building where there was a porter, you couldn’t get in there.</span> <span id="s1086">That -- that’s all I wanted really.</span> <span id="s1087">And my -- then we got a -- an uncle of -- of mine gave me a dog, and oh we were so happy we had the dog, but I -- that -- these were apartments only for people with -- with jobs, who are -- with [indecipherable] jobs.</span> <span id="s1088">So I had a job, I had no problem, but I couldn’t have the kids.</span> <span id="s1089">So I took my daughter, she was almost as tall as I, you know, it was fun, it was no problem.</span> <span id="s1090">But Mikey started to cry, he wanted to come home too.</span> <span id="s1091">So I took him too, and I had the dog too.</span> <span id="s1092">So -- so one day he came and he said, who is that, to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1093">I said, that’s my sister.</span> <span id="s1094">He says, and who is the little boy?</span> <span id="s1095">I said, my son.</span> <span id="s1096">He said, and she’s your daughter?</span> <span id="s1097">I says yes.</span> <span id="s1098">I says, now I have to tell you a secret.</span> <span id="s1099">He says, you know it doesn’t go here, he says, but one thing -- he was also European, he says, one thing I tell you.</span> <span id="s1100">Your kids behave, they can stay, but something has to go, either the kids or the dog.</span> <span id="s1101">So I let the dog go.</span> <span id="s1102">But he was funny, we had -- he was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: When you came to this country, did the Americans that you met ask you about your life under communism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yeah, well, they ask me about communism, but that’s about all.</span> <span id="s1105">They were never interested if I went through a Holocaust, and if I wanted to say something -- if I wanted -- you know, I didn’t really want to, but if I wanted, they said they are really not interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: You came in this -- to this country around the time of the Eichmann trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did you know enough English to follow what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: No, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1110">I -- I -- I mean I -- I will -- I knew the English I learned in school, you know, but I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: You -- basically you learned English in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Of course, I -- when I finished school I went to a -- to a school, to a regular high school to learn English.</span> <span id="s1113">And at that point they wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1114">They said I know too much English and I never really learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: What about your children, how did they learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: They learned English, you know, time -- my daughter I took a -- a -- a girl, my son I didn’t take anything, they learned English in no time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: You mentioned awhile ago another husband.</span> <span id="s1118">Can you tell me how you met your current husband and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: I met my current husband in 19 sif -- seve -- 62.</span> <span id="s1120">The way I met him is through a friend who was here, actually one of the friends what I mentioned that her husband was killed.</span> <span id="s1121">She was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1122">He was killed when the communists took over Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1123">She had a sister here, and her brother-in-law was a -- a doctor and he got me, actually, the per -- first job.</span> <span id="s1124">And she came to visit, they lived on Fifth Avenue in an apartment, one floor was their apartment.</span> <span id="s1125">She had her own room, her own bathroom, everything.</span> <span id="s1126">And she came to visit me and she wanted to stay with me.</span> <span id="s1127">I had one room, one.</span> <span id="s1128">In that one room there was a tiny little kitchen, a tiny little refrigera -- everything miniature and with a curtain.</span> <span id="s1129">And then I had there two beds and a couch, and my son slept on the couch and Elise and I had a bed.</span> <span id="s1130">And we had a table and chairs and that was it.</span> <span id="s1131">There was no room really for much more to go.</span> <span id="s1132">And then, anyway, when we bought the piano we had it -- you know, when you walked in there was a square and that’s was a piano there.</span> <span id="s1133">We were very crowded, actually in the -- in our apartment.</span> <span id="s1134">And she wanted to go to Atlantic City.</span> <span id="s1135">And I really didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1136">I was busy, I had two jobs.</span> <span id="s1137">And she said you can take one weekend, all you do is work.</span> <span id="s1138">I said, doesn’t matter, I said, and I don’t have where to leave the kids and I am not going.</span> <span id="s1139">She says, your sister will be happy to take the children.</span> <span id="s1140">I said I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1141">And anyway, I said, you can’t sleep here either.</span> <span id="s1142">You have plenty of room where you are.</span> <span id="s1143">So she said, can’t I sleep once with you here?</span> <span id="s1144">I says, yo-you know, I -- you -- you don’t realize it, I’m already a widow for three years, I says, if I sleep with anybody, you are the last person I’d like to sleep with.</span> <span id="s1145">I said, I don’t want to sleep with you.</span> <span id="s1146">She says, sleep with your daughter and then give me her bed.</span> <span id="s1147">Anyway, I slept with my daughter, I gave her ma -- the bed, and then we did go.</span> <span id="s1148">And I-I-I was so bad th-those days, really I was so bad.</span> <span id="s1149">I didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s1150">I would take the money and give my daughter, you know, I mean she has to shop and do everything.</span> <span id="s1151">So anyway, we went, th-that’s how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1152">We went to the -- on the beach and I told her that I want to sleep, you know, that I’m really very tired.</span> <span id="s1153">I didn’t -- I never realized how tired I was until I really got there.</span> <span id="s1154">And so I went to sleep, and then she woke me, she says, can you show me how you use your lighter.</span> <span id="s1155">I used to smoke.</span> <span id="s1156">And I showed her and she says, you’re so stupid, I have here such a nice guy, she says, he’s looking at you all the time, but you thi -- never look.</span> <span id="s1157">I said -- I didn’t look, or I didn't open my eyes, I just showed her how and I kept sleeping.</span> <span id="s1158">And then I hear a voice, you know, in English telling me, can I please, you know, ask you a question?</span> <span id="s1159">Could -- could -- I would like to take you and your friend out tonight.</span> <span id="s1160">I says, you can take my friend out, not me, but you can take her out.</span> <span id="s1161">Tell me where, I’ll bring her.</span> <span id="s1162">She didn’t speak any English.</span> <span id="s1163">She spoke a little Jewish and he speaks a little Jewish and so they got along.</span> <span id="s1164">So he gave me his address, I said I’ll bring her there and we brought her there, my friend where -- she had a friend in Atlantic City, that’s why we went there, I knew I won’t have to pay hotel or anything.</span> <span id="s1165">And when we came there we couldn’t him, I mean, I didn’t know how he looks and she couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s1166">Then she saw there is five dollars minimum.</span> <span id="s1167">She says, can I go in?</span> <span id="s1168">I said, no you can’t.</span> <span id="s1169">It’s five dollars minimum, that’s not in my -- my thing to -- to spe-spend.</span> <span id="s1170">So anyway, we went away and next day, Sunday when we came we saw -- I saw a guy and she said, that’s him.</span> <span id="s1171">And he looked good.</span> <span id="s1172">Boy, did he look good.</span> <span id="s1173">He had a head of curls, you know, bl-blonde curls and he was slender, you know, I -- he was really very slender and looked very good.</span> <span id="s1174">I said, I wouldn't even spit on him, I says, not -- I said he’ll [indecipherable] come.</span> <span id="s1175">She says oh, don’t be like that.</span> <span id="s1176">And he came over to me and he says, you know, I really and truly like you.</span> <span id="s1177">I liked you yesterday and I like you today.</span> <span id="s1178">I -- and I said, before you go any further, I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1179">I says, you just met a widow with two children, and that -- one of the women who have the least money in the United States, that’s me.</span> <span id="s1180">And I am not interested in anybody.</span> <span id="s1181">Not in you and not in 10 like you.</span> <span id="s1182">I said, I don’t -- I’m not interested.</span> <span id="s1183">So we went back, we sit down and then he says, will you come to my parents, my parents are here.</span> <span id="s1184">And so I -- I was sleeping and she says, come on, let’s go over.</span> <span id="s1185">I can’t speak to hi -- his parents are from Russia and his mother really spoke some Russian, you know, and Kira spoke Russian, too.</span> <span id="s1186">So we went over there and we met them.</span> <span id="s1187">And then Monday when I came home from work the phone rang and my daughter answered the phone, sh -- she says, it’s for you.</span> <span id="s1188">I says who?</span> <span id="s1189">She says a man.</span> <span id="s1190">I said, what kind of man is for me, I don’t get no man calls.</span> <span id="s1191">And I went to the phone, it was him.</span> <span id="s1192">I said what are -- what do you want?</span> <span id="s1193">I said, how did you get my number?</span> <span id="s1194">He says Kira gave me your number.</span> <span id="s1195">So -- and then he wo -- said, can I come on the weekends?</span> <span id="s1196">I says, you can.</span> <span id="s1197">I won’t be home, but you can come.</span> <span id="s1198">And he used to come and my son really fell in love with him, because he thought that ma -- it was somebody just for him, you know.</span> <span id="s1199">He was never married before.</span> <span id="s1200">And he would come and come, I never saw him, once maybe I saw him, or twice.</span> <span id="s1201">And then a -- then I think Christmas it came, and then, you know, he started if I would marry him.</span> <span id="s1202">And I said, why would I marry you?</span> <span id="s1203">I do -- I -- I really don’t know you, you know, I -- I don’t want to get married.</span> <span id="s1204">And my daughter says to me, Mommy, you have to marry him.</span> <span id="s1205">I says, why do I have to marry him, I don’t even love him.</span> <span id="s1206">She says, you don’t have to love him, Mike loves him.</span> <span id="s1207">I says, Mike loves him, let him marry him.</span> <span id="s1208">And I got married.</span> <span id="s1209">She says I have to marry him, so I marry him.</span> <span id="s1210">He -- I love him now.</span> <span id="s1211">I didn’t love him then, but I love him now, he’s a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: His name is David.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: I got married on January 5th, 1963.</span> <span id="s1216">It was n -- 39 years that I am married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: And what does he do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: He used to work for the government, he was an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your children’s education?</span> <span id="s1220">What kinds of education were they able to get?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I’d be very happy.</span> <span id="s1222">I was waiting that you -- I was hoping you’ll ask me.</span> <span id="s1223">My daughter who is older, she is a teacher.</span> <span id="s1224">She has not one, but two Master’s.</span> <span id="s1225">She has a Master’s in -- in Spanish and a Master’s in English.</span> <span id="s1226">And my son skipped school and he went to Rensselaer for five years, got his Master’s in chemical engineering and he went to -- to Harvard and got -- and got the MBA in finances, in -- also for -- for banking and everything.</span> <span id="s1227">And he’s doing very well and so is my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: You said he skipped what -- did he skip grades?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: He skipped -- he skipped grades, yes.</span> <span id="s1230">When we moved -- when I married my husband then, you know, he got a job in Saint Louis, Missouri.</span> <span id="s1231">And when we went to Missouri they put him back.</span> <span id="s1232">He had skipped in New York and they put him back and then we went back to New York and he -- he had his skipping, you know.</span> <span id="s1233">He is doing very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Do you talk to your children about your -- when -- especially when they were growing up, did you talk to your children about your Holocaust experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Oh yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1236">My children actually asked us if we will talk to them.</span> <span id="s1237">And one day my sister and I sat down and I wished we would have had a tape and we talked about it.</span> <span id="s1238">We talked to each other.</span> <span id="s1239">And I -- we -- we couldn’t -- we couldn’t really believe that we went through everything which we went through and we talked to our children.</span> <span id="s1240">We didn’t talk then -- we didn't do it again, but my children knew how much the whole thing meant to both of us.</span> <span id="s1241">And when they started with the building of the museum, I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1242">I got, in 1989 I had cancer of the -- of the kidney and I had lung cancer and I was [indecipherable] and by a sheer miracle I really made it.</span> <span id="s1243">I was on a -- I we -- I went on a -- y-you know, no hospital could help me because when you have kidney and lung cancer, you can’t have no -- no -- no-nothing really is -- is there for them.</span> <span id="s1244">And was in the GW and they told me that I -- they can’t do anything any more for me, and that I had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: G.W. is George Washington University Hospital, is that what you’re trying to tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1247">And so tha -- so my -- lucky for me my friend was with me, I worked at the [indecipherable] at that time.</span> <span id="s1248">No, no, I -- I had just stopped; we -- we were let go.</span> <span id="s1249">But anyway, my girlfriend was there and she wanted I should go to Mount Vernon, because I had heard that in Mount Vernon is a -- is a place where they do the same thing like they do at -- at -- in -- here in Washington at what -- what do you call?</span> <span id="s1250">The -- the guy who was my -- my -- in college it’s -- it’s a hospital, told my husband that he called di -- W -- G du -- he called the place in New York, you know, Sloan Caterer, he called the hospital in Baltimore, you know, John Hopkins and the -- and here also, in Washington, and nobody would take me.</span> <span id="s1251">They couldn’t take me, they were right, because I had no life left.</span> <span id="s1252">I had less than 25 percent of breathing, and there was nobody to take, you know, I -- it really wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1253">My girlfriend, she knew -- I had told her about Mount Vernon.</span> <span id="s1254">What happened was Dr. Rosenberg was in together with a Dr. Ayliss.</span> <span id="s1255">And this Dr. Ayliss had something with -- wi-with Rosenberg, whatever happened, it wasn’t all right, and he got the grant in Mount Vernon and he had one floor there where he di -- did the same thing they did at GW, and she wanted to take me there, and she took me there.</span> <span id="s1256">And I ha -- I was in a wheelchair, I couldn’t walk or anything.</span> <span id="s1257">And we went in, and he didn't want to take me, but he did examine me and he says he can’t take me, you know, it’s not even legal and he can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1258">So we left, my husband and I, and Diane, my friend, stayed there.</span> <span id="s1259">So, it was in August and I was very, very hot, and I knew that I have a few hours to live.</span> <span id="s1260">I wanted to call my children and everybody, my sister and you know, at least to see them.</span> <span id="s1261">And I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s1262">And my husband said, I can’t, you know, Diane is not here, she doesn’t have a car, because she came with us.</span> <span id="s1263">So he got out of the car to go and get her and that she came out with the doctor and with the wheelchair, not to take mine and they took me in.</span> <span id="s1264">And it took them three weeks to wa -- I didn’t weigh enough, you know, I had to weigh at least, I think 98 or a hundred pounds and I weighed like 95.</span> <span id="s1265">And they brought me up two pounds I was, I think two -- I still didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1266">And they ga -- put me o-on the study.</span> <span id="s1267">And I was on the study and I was the only one left.</span> <span id="s1268">There was a lady left which came later on, she didn’t have what I had, she had melanoma.</span> <span id="s1269">And she survived, but for my tho -- who was with me, nobody survived.</span> <span id="s1270">There were 75 people, I was the only one who made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: I’m not sure I understand tha -- did you participate in a research study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: In a research study, yes.</span> <span id="s1273">I signed up for it, I -- for me it was no problem.</span> <span id="s1274">I mean, nobody else wanted me anyway, I couldn’t do anything but the research study, not a regular study.</span> <span id="s1275">I had th -- that’s terrible.</span> <span id="s1276">Wh-What do you call this -- I can’t even remember now, can you believe it?</span> <span id="s1277">I have that paper.</span> <span id="s1278">Two -- two medications they gave me, I can’t remember now what it was, but I couldn’t take the one, I had a lot of problems with it and he took me off that and left me only on one medication.</span> <span id="s1279">And then one day I said I -- I can’t take this any more.</span> <span id="s1280">I became so weak from the one medication and I stopped it too.</span> <span id="s1281">And then I -- I made it, until now, I have with the knees.</span> <span id="s1282">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: So you -- you’re the only one in this research study to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1285">Except the other lady who had what do you call it, the melon -- melanoma.</span> <span id="s1286">Melanoma, you know, it’s a skin cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1288">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: [laughter] You didn’t expect that.</span> <span id="s1290">I never talk about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: I-I’d like to take you back to some of the changes that occurred in this country.</span> <span id="s1292">Now, you came out of a communist state, so I’m very curious to see what thoughts you had at the time about some of the events that happened in this country.</span> <span id="s1293">You were here when the United States became involved in the war in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1294">Did that -- did that touch your life in any way?</span> <span id="s1295">Did you have any impressions about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: No, I -- I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: What were your thoughts about the c -- the Cold War, the conflicts the United States had with the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I actually was al-all for it because I thought wherever is against the communist is good.</span> <span id="s1299">You know, I -- I like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: So you felt the United States was justified?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: What about the Civil Rights movement?</span> <span id="s1303">You saw some changes, some social changes here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: You know, when the -- when that occurred, I was very, very busy, but I did follow it and I was happy with what a -- with what occurred.</span> <span id="s1305">You know, that they got something, you know, and very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: You also saw changes in -- in women’s rights.</span> <span id="s1307">How did you feel -- you’re smiling -- how did you feel about those changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Good, very good.</span> <span id="s1309">It was good to get -- I mean, you know, I -- I am a European, you know, and -- but I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s1310">I liked that they should get some rights, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: You were here for the assassination of the Kennedys and some of the other political assassinations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Oh, that was terrible.</span> <span id="s1313">That was the worst time be -- for me in the United States.</span> <span id="s1314">I worked in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1315">God, that was bad.</span> <span id="s1316">That was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1317">That was the worst thing, I was so upset about it, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s1318">I -- I really liked President Kennedy a lot.</span> <span id="s1319">Was very upset about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Were there any other things that you saw happening in this country over the years that you were here, especially those first years, in the 60’s, was a very turbulent time.</span> <span id="s1321">Sixt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Yeah, I was -- was -- it was a turbulent time here, too, you know, and I really and truly could not take in everything the way I should have, because like I told you before, I had problems with my kids, I had problems with jobs, I had problems, and I really and truly could not give it as much time as I would have liked to.</span> <span id="s1323">I just didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1324">I worked like y-you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s1325">In my second job there I worked, I was usually finished by 10 o’clock and 10:20 because I worked two jobs.</span> <span id="s1326">That was in the even -- at night I worked.</span> <span id="s1327">And when I came out, usually I had a bus, but sometimes, you know, I had to work til 10:30 or til 11:00 because you can’t leave a b -- a hospital without somebody else being in the lab.</span> <span id="s1328">And one day was s -- sn -- s -- raining, and I would always call, you know, that they should get me a cab.</span> <span id="s1329">And the girl calls me back, she says, I can’t ge-get [indecipherable] she says, anything, you can’t get anything.</span> <span id="s1330">She says, but you know you can sleep here.</span> <span id="s1331">I said, I can’t, I have two kids alone home.</span> <span id="s1332">So I says, call the fire department or the police.</span> <span id="s1333">She says, we don’t call no fire department and police for somebody to go home.</span> <span id="s1334">I said, then I’ll call, and I called the police and I told them.</span> <span id="s1335">But I told them that I have the two kids home, but didn’t bother them.</span> <span id="s1336">It wasn’t like today, I would have been probably in jail if they know I have two -- I mean, my daughter was 14 or 15 already at the time.</span> <span id="s1337">But anyway, I told and the guy said, you stay right where you are, I’ll be right there.</span> <span id="s1338">And he took me home and before I got in the building he says, I’ll go just before so nobody sees you with the police, and I’ll watch you go in.</span> <span id="s1339">Now I -- I -- I was -- I -- I was so busy, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1342">I had an -- a -- I -- I think I -- you know, I ch -- I looked for a job and it was all the nuns, and they want -- they -- when I filled out the papers for the job, they had there religions, so I put in Hebrew, you know?</span> <span id="s1343">And -- excuse me, they wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1344">They wouldn’t take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: And what kind of institution was it, was it a hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: A hospital.</span> <span id="s1347">They wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1348">And when I asked why, because my -- I had very good credentials, they said, I don’t think you are cut out, we are very religious here and we don’t want no Hebrews here.</span> <span id="s1349">So, I mean, I -- I had -- I had a few times, you know, not bad, but I had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: What is your reaction to the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1351">In the last decade or so there’s been a revival of interest in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1352">Do you have a reaction to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: I am very much interested in it and what I didn’t t-tell you actually is my son knew also what the Holocaust meant for me, and he never told me, but you see, when -- when the Holocaust started in ’88 - ’89, that’s when I started to -- to have my problems, you know, and I was sick til ’63, til the museum was built.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: You’re talking about the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: The Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1356">What I found out was that my son gave for bi -- the building fund.</span> <span id="s1357">When I came back I found out that he had pledged 50,000 and he play -- paid it out.</span> <span id="s1358">And he paid it out for the living.</span> <span id="s1359">You know, I mean he had to put in, I guess, whatever.</span> <span id="s1360">He said it was for me and Beatrice.</span> <span id="s1361">I couldn’t have done it, but he could.</span> <span id="s1362">I couldn’t have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Can you tell me about the work you do for the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I -- I work once a week, every week I work at the donor’s desk.</span> <span id="s1365">It’s for donor, whoever wants to become a member or a donor or whatever.</span> <span id="s1366">And then I work with the -- with the speaker’s bureau.</span> <span id="s1367">I go and I speak.</span> <span id="s1368">Not now, now I am incapacitated, but otherwise I go and I speak a lot.</span> <span id="s1369">And otherwise, whenever they need somebody, you know, at the museum, they always call me and I speak for -- for the people who start to work there, the new people, or -- so I speak to them.</span> <span id="s1370">And wherever, whoever asked me, I go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: You mentioned you’re incapacitated, I -- since they can’t see you on the tape --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: -- would you tell me why you’re incapacitated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yeah, I had just a new knee, and it’s -- it’s a little bit not very comfortable to walk around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: I think I’m going to stop now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: -- and change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: And we’ll have now lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Erika Eckstut.</span> <span id="s1381">This is tape number three, side A. And I had been asking you about your work at the Holocaust Museum and you told me that you do some public speaking.</span> <span id="s1382">How do you -- how do you respond when you hear Holocaust deniers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: How do I respond to hol -- Holocaust deniers, there is really nothing to respond to, because there is nothing you can tell them.</span> <span id="s1384">I-It’s ridiculous even, in my opinion to even talk about deniers, what do you mean deniers?</span> <span id="s1385">Who can deny it?</span> <span id="s1386">I mean, don’t you have enough proof?</span> <span id="s1387">You know, I -- I mean, to me it’s -- it’s almost a -- yo-you know, I mean i-i -- I -- I don’t di -- di -- I don’t talk about it very well.</span> <span id="s1388">When -- when I come across a denier, all he had to do is just go and take the papers from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1389">You don’t even have to go any further, and you got everything you need.</span> <span id="s1390">I mean, it was so clear.</span> <span id="s1391">How can anybody be a denier?</span> <span id="s1392">I can’t -- I -- I -- I have nothing left to say for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: In your opinion, do you think American Jews might ever be in danger from neo-Nazis or skinheads?</span> <span id="s1394">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1395">I -- I believed that when I came here and I still do.</span> <span id="s1396">I hope not, but I do believe that they can -- I do believe they can, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Have you gone back to your hometown since you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yes, I have.</span> <span id="s1399">I have been there twice or three times.</span> <span id="s1400">I -- three times, I think.</span> <span id="s1401">I went in ’97 with my granddaughter when I took her when I jumped, I told you I -- I took her there.</span> <span id="s1402">And then I went -- before that, I went in ’93, when I was so sick and I couldn't walk yet, I was in a wheelchair, and my granddaughter took me because my husband was very much against it, my sister was against it, everybody was against it except my oldest granddaughter wasn’t against it.</span> <span id="s1403">If Omi wants to go, she says, then I’ll take her.</span> <span id="s1404">And she took me, and we went together.</span> <span id="s1405">We were there one week, but we were there.</span> <span id="s1406">I didn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1407">I really couldn’t very well manage to go, but I was back, and it -- it did me very good to go back.</span> <span id="s1408">And then I went again because they had a -- I -- I didn’t go after until ’64 or ’65, they had a -- all the officers, you know, who were in the army, whoever got something, you know, my late husband got four medals.</span> <span id="s1409">So we were there and they gave us the medals.</span> <span id="s1410">My brother-in-law got two medals, my -- in -- in retrospect, or wa -- and the -- there -- there were, from all over the world they were there, from Australia, from whoever.</span> <span id="s1411">Whoever was in the army came, and we were all there.</span> <span id="s1412">Then we went one more time -- no, was three times I went, was three times I was in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1413">In ’63, in ’64 and in ’67.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: ’63?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: I mean, no, na -- ’93.</span> <span id="s1416">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Have you ever been to Israel?</span> <span id="s1418">A: Twice.</span> <span id="s1419">I would have gone again if I could.</span> <span id="s1420">Tw-Twice -- three times now.</span> <span id="s1421">Three times, I was there last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: And what was that experience like?</span> <span id="s1423">A: Oh, that was a excellent experience, I loved going to Israel.</span> <span id="s1424">I love Israel.</span> <span id="s1425">I -- i-i-if -- if it would have been differently, I would have gone to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Have you ever regretted not going to Israel?</span> <span id="s1427">A: No, I haven’t regretted, I mean it -- it -- it’s no -- no use even s-spending time on regretting, you know.</span> <span id="s1428">But I would have gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s1429">I like to go there.</span> <span id="s1430">If -- if I am all right this year, we ha -- I have there a cousin.</span> <span id="s1431">And he was just now in a -- he was actually in the “Time” magazine.</span> <span id="s1432">He -- he is not in the army, but you know, whoever is in the army is being called.</span> <span id="s1433">He is 25, or 26 years old, and he went to somewhere and they -- they attacked him i-in na -- just now, it was about two weeks ago.</span> <span id="s1434">And he -- there were two officers and I don’t know how many, you know, soldiers were with them.</span> <span id="s1435">And the one officer was killed.</span> <span id="s1436">And he w-was wounded and still with the one hand he killed another Arab, or two Ar-Arabs, whatever, and he got out of it.</span> <span id="s1437">But he had 15 little shrapnels, but they couldn’t take them all out, you know, because it would have been dangerous th-the way they are.</span> <span id="s1438">And he is supposed to get married in August.</span> <span id="s1439">If I could have my two knees done, I would have gone too, if I could.</span> <span id="s1440">It all depends, because this knee is still swollen.</span> <span id="s1441">But if I could have both done, I would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: How has your Holocaust experience influenced the choices that you’ve made over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: You mean wha -- how a -- had the Holocaust, as such --</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Your experiences at -- how -- how did -- how do you feel that your experiences made an impact on some of the decisions that you made, some of the choices that you made over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: I really couldn’t tell you, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1446">I guess my whole life, you know, is involved with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1447">My whole life is the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1448">You know, I mean it’s -- it’s in there, you can’t get rid of it ever.</span> <span id="s1449">You know, I am a product of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1450">So maybe whatever I did had to do with whatever I went through, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1451">I really couldn’t answer you that question very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Did your view of Judaism change after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: I don’t think it really changed.</span> <span id="s1454">You know, m-maybe a little bit, but not really much.</span> <span id="s1455">I don’t think it changed much, maybe a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: When you look back upon yourself as a parent, do you think the Holocaust had any influence on the way you raised your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: I was asking that myself, and I really can’t give you an answer.</span> <span id="s1458">I -- I hope I didn’t -- I -- I tried not to do it to my children.</span> <span id="s1459">I really did try very -- I -- I was thinking about it, because don’t forget, I was very early, mother and father to my children.</span> <span id="s1460">And even when my husband was alive, I was also always there for them.</span> <span id="s1461">And I was very, very worried I shouldn’t make the wrong decision because of.</span> <span id="s1462">And I hope I didn’t, but I really couldn’t, with a good conscience say I -- I did or I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1463">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Do you think you would have done anything differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: I don’t really think so.</span> <span id="s1466">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1467">I don’t know how my life would have been if I didn’t go through it.</span> <span id="s1468">I -- it would have been a completely different life if we didn’t have to go through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: You mentioned also that you have grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yes.</span></p>

was always so afraid that if I write, and somebody sh-should come one day, if something could happen.</span> <span id="s1524">And then when I was here, I had no more time.</span> <span id="s1525">And then as time went by, you don’t feel it so strongly, so you don’t, but I should have written about it.</span> <span id="s1526">It was so bad, you can’t even imagine.</span> <span id="s1527">It really was worse than anything you can ever imagine.</span> <span id="s1528">After the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1529">It was a bad time, a very bad time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Can you give me some examples?</span> <span id="s1531">A: Examples, examples was that you didn’t have any -- any freedom at all.</span> <span id="s1532">You had to go and clean the streets.</span> <span id="s1533">You had to go and do whatever they wanted you to -- to do.</span> <span id="s1534">I mean, it was -- a-and you were never sure that the person you really knew, that he is a person you didn’t -- you do know.</span> <span id="s1535">He could have gone and say that you are a spy, or whatever i-it -- it was his -- his thing he would have said.</span> <span id="s1536">It -- it was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1537">Really not a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: What has been your biggest disappointment in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: You know what was the biggest disappointment for me in America?</span> <span id="s1540">Is divorces.</span> <span id="s1541">Because my daughter and my son they both divorced.</span> <span id="s1542">And that was my biggest disappointment, how many divorces are here.</span> <span id="s1543">That’s my biggest disappointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: How has September 11th of this past year impacted you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: I -- I was extremely upset about that.</span> <span id="s1546">Now, this was something which really and truly was -- that was the biggest disappointment actually of America, that -- because you see, when America was attacked first, and nothing was done, I was very disappointed when the Marines were shot.</span> <span id="s1547">280 or how many did they shot that time?</span> <span id="s1548">Who-Who -- who is the other things which happened?</span> <span id="s1549">Nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s1550">But you see, when I talked about it, you know, like my husband, he’s not -- he’s not a survivor.</span> <span id="s1551">He couldn’t understand that I can’t understand that it doesn’t add up for the Americans, because in America nothing can happen.</span> <span id="s1552">That is when you ask me if the Jews from -- can be attacked, sure they can.</span> <span id="s1553">If you let it happen, it will.</span> <span id="s1554">Because you are practically very sure of yourself, and you can never be sure, never.</span> <span id="s1555">It doesn’t work that way, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1556">And tha-that was a terrible thing, I can’t even tal -- wha-what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1557">I was very, very -- I am still very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1558">I am still very worried, you know, I don’t know who is good and who is bad.</span> <span id="s1559">It’s -- it’s really something which should have never happened.</span> <span id="s1560">That should have never happened here, never.</span> <span id="s1561">And now with this war, th-this guy, you know who was -- the American who was there, och, it’s -- it is just too much.</span> <span id="s1562">It’s just too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Is there anything about the American reaction to the events of September 11th that has either upset you or -- or given you hope about this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: You know, you always like to look for hope, you know.</span> <span id="s1565">You never look y-y-you know, with the bad, you always try to look for the good.</span> <span id="s1566">And I think, you know, what it gave me is a lot of confidence the way the Americans behave, you know.</span> <span id="s1567">And I hope that it really w -- is work -- worth it, you know, that -- that’s all I can say, I -- I hope that it’s really meant the way it’s said.</span> <span id="s1568">I mean, you see the flags outside, it’s not just for show, but they really mean it, you know.</span> <span id="s1569">I -- I have nothing else I can say about it, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: What’s next in store for you?</span> <span id="s1571">What would you yet like to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I don’t think -- I don’t think I want to accomplish anything.</span> <span id="s1573">I think whatever I could, I accomplished.</span> <span id="s1574">I have really and truly beautiful children, they are very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1575">I don’t like the idea that they both got divorced, that wasn’t in my book.</span> <span id="s1576">I -- I -- it’s -- it’s something I can’t understand very well, but they are otherwise beautiful children and they both remarried and now everything -- but that’s something which, you know, bothers me a little.</span> <span id="s1577">But just -- just -- i-it should be peace in America, it should never happen anything again, and I should be able to have both my knees working because they -- they don’t work for the last four or five years, and I -- I -- I’ll just be happy.</span> <span id="s1578">I -- I don’t think I want to accomplish anything any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: I

under communism or in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Under communism didn’t exist anything, I couldn’t have gotten anything.</span> <span id="s1586">When I came here I got a letter from Germany that they were looking for my in-laws, for my -- for the Kauders.</span> <span id="s1587">And I didn’t have money to go or do anything, so I didn’t do anything.</span> <span

id="s1595">I never got anything but the 3,000 dollars my mother gave me when I came.</span> <span id="s1596">If it was for me or was her money, I don’t know, but she gave me the 3,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1597">That’s all I had from reparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: You also mention in your interview, the -- the ship, the Patria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A:

Czernowitz, and I only know that the ship went to America.</span> <span id="s1602">I know that all boys went, no girls, and they wanted my father, who was very, very active in it, he was a big Zionist and he was very active and they wanted to take one of his children, the older one.</span> <span id="s1603">Sh-She should go because he -- he did a lot of work and he didn’t really have any children.</span> <span id="s1604">But he didn't want it because it wasn’t fair.</span> <span id="s1605">You know, there were no girls, they were all boys.</span> <span id="s1606">That’s all I know about.</span> <span id="s1607">I don’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s1608">Of course later on I found out, God knows when, that it never made it.</span> <span id="s1609">That it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Do you remember what year all this was taking place?</span> <span id="s1611">A: No.</span> <span id="s1612">Must have been in ’41 - ’42 when we were in -- when we were in

experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: That’s a very good question, what would I like them to know?</span> <span id="s1615">Well, I would like to leave for everybody who ever reads anything or anything I ever said, or read, or wha-whatever I left behind, that you should never hate.</span> <span id="s1616">You should always try to love instead of hate, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1617">And that I was happy to be here, and I hope it takes awhile before I go.</span> <span id="s1618">And that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Is there anything else that you’d like to add before we conclude?</span> <span id="s1620">Is there anything that we haven’t discussed that you’d like to bring up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Yeah, I would like that the United States should stay safe, nothing should happen to them ever again, and it should just be a good world for all of -- of the people, all my children who’ve stayed behind.</span> <span id="s1622">Everybody should be well, and everything should be fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: I want to thank you for doing the interview with me today.</span> <span id="s1624">And you’re sure there’s nothing else
