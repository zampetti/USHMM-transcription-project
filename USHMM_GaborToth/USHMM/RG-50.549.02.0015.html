Leibmann in her home in Bayside, Queens, for the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s13">And the interviewer is Joe Richmond.</span> <span id="s14">Let’s start -- let’s start going all the way back, just talking about your family a little bit.</span> <span id="s15">Just tell me briefly who was in your family, your -- Hanne Leibmann: In my family at what time?</span> <span id="s16">At what point of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Before the war, when you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">HL: When I was growing up, okay, how far do we go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: As far as you want to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">HL: Well, I was born in 1924 and you have that on some of the tapes already.</span> <span id="s21">And at the time I was born, I obviously had a mother.</span> <span id="s22">I had a father, I had a brother three and a half years older.</span> <span id="s23">However, my father died in 1925, about three months after I was born, so I grew up in a one parent household, okay?</span> <span id="s24">My fath -- my mother maintained my father’s business, which was a photo studio, okay.</span> <span id="s25">At the time my father passed away, we still had an art gallery as well, which my mother gave up around 1926, because she could not maintain a business and an art gallery and two children and everything else.</span> <span id="s26">Besides, at that point in Germany, after the inflation, the art business was not the hottest item anyway.</span> <span id="s27">So I grew up like any other child, okay.</span> <span id="s28">My mother had several sisters.</span> <span id="s29">She had three that lived in the city where I was born.</span> <span id="s30">She had a -- equally a brother who lived in Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s31">She had a sister in Switzerland, she had a sister in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s32">On my father’s side, I had an uncle who lived in Munich, who was a photographer and auctioneer.</span> <span id="s33">I -- and a brother who lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s34">He was an agent for artists for movies, opera, concerts, that was his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Did you mention your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">HL: My brother -- I had only one brother, three and a half years older, as I said and well, we grew up like all children do, I suppose.</span> <span id="s37">I remember the rise of Hitler, I remember the street fights in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s38">Our place was next to a left wing newspaper and there were a lot of street fights and shootings and flag burnings.</span> <span id="s39">And these are some of my earliest childhood memories.</span> <span id="s40">Included in that is the people who came begging for food to our apartment door.</span> <span id="s41">Carts going through the street, horse drawn carts going through the street, collecting clothes for the poor.</span> <span id="s42">It was a very, very bad time in Germany.</span> <span id="s43">Hitler came to power, I remember April one is the boycott.</span> <span id="s44">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s45">Went to school, public school.</span> <span id="s46">There was some harassment, obviously there was harassment of a -- of us kids in the street.</span> <span id="s47">I did not have Gentile girlfriends, probably, after 1935, because it became too dangerous for them, as well as for us.</span> <span id="s48">And my mother had Gentile friends t-to the very end.</span> <span id="s49">Til the day we were deported, we had Gentile friends who came to our house at night, in the dark, when it was, you know, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s50">Brown out here?</span> <span id="s51">Black-out?</span> <span id="s52">Black-out, really.</span> <span id="s53">And school, of course, for us Jewish kids, we had to leave public school in 1936 and go to an all Jewish school.</span> <span id="s54">Many of the larger cities already had established Jewish schools -- long established Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s55">Karlsruhe did not, so we had to start a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s56">I do not remember how many children we were, probably two - 300, I would say, at the beginning.</span> <span id="s57">And with parents emigrating, it became, of course, a smaller and smaller school.</span> <span id="s58">We were first located in a public school building, actually.</span> <span id="s59">We had one or two floors in that public school building.</span> <span id="s60">The other floors were for retarded children.</span> <span id="s61">And eventually we had to get out of there, too and have the school in community -- in the community building.</span> <span id="s62">I remember No-November 10th very well.</span> <span id="s63">I remember the synagogue being vandalized and whatever.</span> <span id="s64">Actually, a friend and I went into the synagogue a couple of days later to see what we could save.</span> <span id="s65">And since the community building was adjacent to the synagogue, we literally watched the destruction of the synagogue as it was being torn down.</span> <span id="s66">The community sold the real estate where the synagogue was standing on, because they needed that money to feed the families who no longer could make a living.</span> <span id="s67">Things became very, very tough and we had a lot of Jewish people who no longer could afford to feed themselves, so the community had a soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s68">And they needed this money to feed all these people and take care of whatever needed to be done.</span> <span id="s69">1940, I was for [inaudible] June, July -- five months in the area of Hannover, in the north of Germany, in a place called Arlem.</span> <span id="s70">It had a Jewish agricultural school, and -- long established school, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s71">This school did not only teach agriculture, it also taught homemaking and all sorts of other things.</span> <span id="s72">And since my mother didn’t know what to do with me and I was hanging around the house, she sent me up there for several months.</span> <span id="s73">Beginning of 1939, actually, the three sisters of my mother moved in with us, because end of ‘38 we could not have businesses any more.</span> <span id="s74">We were deprived of our livelihood and in order to save funds, we all moved together.</span> <span id="s75">It also meant that no other Jewish family could be moved in with you if you had a lot of -- if you had a large apartment.</span> <span id="s76">They had a large apartment, we had a large apartment, so it was -- also my grandmoth-mother had moved in with us.</span> <span id="s77">She was a very elderly lady of 90, maybe she was only 80 - 89 when she moved in with us, whatever.</span> <span id="s78">So that the household consisted actually of six women.</span> <span id="s79">My brother left Germany in 19 -- s-summer of 1937, to come here to America.</span> <span id="s80">He was first with a half brother of our father.</span> <span id="s81">That didn’t work out too well, then he was down in Atlanta, at the university to study whatever.</span> <span id="s82">I think he studied radio technology or something like that.</span> <span id="s83">He got a -- a scholarship.</span> <span id="s84">And actually, when he left in ‘37 was the last time I saw my brother.</span> <span id="s85">He eventually joined the American army and was killed in the Battle of the Bulge in January of 1945.</span> <span id="s86">We ourselves were deported in Oc --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Let me sto -- w-what was your brother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">HL: My brother’s name was Alex. His full name was Alexander.</span> <span id="s89">Okay, but he was referred to as Alex.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And your maiden name was Hiss -- Hiss --</span></p> <p><span id="s91">HL: Hirsch, yeah.</span> <span id="s92">October 22nd we were deported.</span> <span id="s93">We were the second deportation out of Germany, the first one having been from Stettin to Lublin in February of 1940.</span> <span id="s94">Of course, previously, in ‘38, the Polish - Jewish people who had lived in Germany had been deported to Poland.</span> <span id="s95">And that was this miserable situation, they did not have a qua -- they didn’t have -- they had not acquired German citizenship and the Polish government said, “No, we don’t take them back,” and so on and so forth, which by the way, was the official reason for the pogrom in 19 -- on November 10th.</span> <span id="s96">The German took this incident in Paris, where this young fellow, Grynszpan, murdered miss -- consular employee vom Rath, because he was so angry that his parents had been deported out of Germany.</span> <span id="s97">This is the official story.</span> <span id="s98">I know a book has been written about it.</span> <span id="s99">I have not read the book.</span> <span id="s100">There might have been other reasons for the shooting, but this was the official version.</span> <span id="s101">And this brought about the government organized pogrom of November 10th, what you call here Crystal Night, or Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s102">It was a frightful time.</span> <span id="s103">In any case, we were deported in October of 1940.</span> <span id="s104">We were deported to France.</span> <span id="s105">French did not know who we were, or whatever and simply sent us in the unoccupied zone of France.</span> <span id="s106">Or the Germans actually sent us in the unoccupied zone of France.</span> <span id="s107">And the French sent us all the way down south -- southwest, to Gurs, a camp called Gurs, it’s spelled G-u-r-s.</span> <span id="s108">It’s very close to the Spanish border, only about 40 kilometers to the Pyranees in the Spanish border, and here we were in a camp.</span> <span id="s109">Not a nice place to be, it was awful.</span> <span id="s110">The trip was awful.</span> <span id="s111">My grandmother, at this point over 91 years old, lost her mind on the train.</span> <span id="s112">On this paper here, you have the name of Weil?</span> <span id="s113">This Mr. Weil was with us in the same car when we were deported.</span> <span id="s114">He also was a very elderly man and he as well, lost his mind, as did my grandmother.</span> <span id="s115">Became totally confused, was totally out.</span> <span id="s116">Okay, so we had two in one car, it was -- it was a horrible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Did you know at that point on the train, did you know -- did you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">HL: Where we were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Where you were going, what was happening, [indecipherable] be?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">HL: Not at all.</span> <span id="s121">Most people did not know.</span> <span id="s122">My mother and I knew that we were going to the south of France.</span> <span id="s123">And we knew, because the morning of the deportation, my mother sent me to a Mrs. Fite, okay?</span> <span id="s124">These were very decent people.</span> <span id="s125">And my mother was friendly with them to the very last.</span> <span id="s126">And she told me to bring them certain items from our household which they very much liked.</span> <span id="s127">It was Bohemian glass, it was very -- a crystal, it was very beautiful stuff.</span> <span id="s128">And she said, “Go over there, bring it to them and come right back.”</span> <span id="s129">And so I did and when I came to Mrs. Fite, she told me, “My husband said you will be going to the south of France.”</span> <span id="s130">But of course we didn’t know, what does it mean the south of France?</span> <span id="s131">Where were we going to be, right?</span> <span id="s132">And I came home and told my mother and she said, “You crazy.”</span> <span id="s133">Okay?</span> <span id="s134">Because she fully expect to be -- expected to be taken to a concentration camp in Germany or even to Poland, because we knew already from the people who had been deported from Stettin, that they were taken to Lublin.</span> <span id="s135">So our expectations were not the south of France and my mother said, “You’re [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s136">We did go to France, but what was going to happen to us -- I mean it was very obvious once the train went, you know, was set in motion and we were going west, that we were not going to go -- let’s say Dachau, which is in Germany or any of the other camps, right?</span> <span id="s137">And indeed, we were taken to France.</span> <span id="s138">And on the train we were allowed to take with us 100 marks.</span> <span id="s139">Our money was changed into French francs.</span> <span id="s140">We got 2000 French francs for the 100 marks, which was a pittance.</span> <span id="s141">So the trip took three days and then we found ourselves in Gurs.</span> <span id="s142">And Gurs -- I don’t know, have you heard about Gurs?</span> <span id="s143">Have you read about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Most of what I know is from your -- is from your interviews.</span> <span id="s145">So tell -- so tell me in your -- in your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HL: My experience, well, like everybody who got there, six and a half thousand people got there, was utter confusion.</span> <span id="s147">Totally -- most of the people were totally traumatized.</span> <span id="s148">Understandably so, right?</span> <span id="s149">First of all the three -- three day trip.</span> <span id="s150">Then we were taken off the train in open trucks, in pouring rain.</span> <span id="s151">From the railroad station in Orlong San Marie, to Gurs is about 15 kilometers.</span> <span id="s152">Not terribly far, right?</span> <span id="s153">But enough to be thoroughly soaked.</span> <span id="s154">The camp itself was built on a land that had been completely deforested.</span> <span id="s155">There were no trees.</span> <span id="s156">There are trees today, but that’s 50 years or 60 years later.</span> <span id="s157">And the ground was mud.</span> <span id="s158">It was real mud, like -- clay-like sort.</span> <span id="s159">And of course, with the rain, this became an impossible situation.</span> <span id="s160">So here we came to the place already, we stepped right into the mud, right?</span> <span id="s161">The barracks were totally empty.</span> <span id="s162">They were wooden structures, only tarpaper, no windows.</span> <span id="s163">There were no windows.</span> <span id="s164">We had flaps that could be opened, but you had to prop them up.</span> <span id="s165">Now if you opened the window -- so-called window, right, it would rain in.</span> <span id="s166">You closed it, you were without air and light.</span> <span id="s167">Had a door on each end -- at each end and -- there comes my husband -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: I’ll stop the tape for a -- we’re back.</span> <span id="s169">So yeah, just the -- the daily life and the conditions [indecipherable] talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">HL: The daily life -- daily life was very hard.</span> <span id="s171">The first night we got there, we were given some straw and not sufficient for everybody.</span> <span id="s172">That for days people were really lying on the wooden planks.</span> <span id="s173">There were no cots, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s174">Eventually we were given blankets, we were given straw, we were given those cotton -- something like a sack to put the straw in, make something similar to a mattress, right?</span> <span id="s175">The food, like in all concentration camps, was -- I guess almost everywhere the same.</span> <span id="s176">We got something that resembled coffee in the morning, half a pound of bread, it was our daily ration.</span> <span id="s177">We got a watery soup at lunchtime with some vegetables in it.</span> <span id="s178">Mostly root vegetables, turnips, carrots, things like that.</span> <span id="s179">It had also some chickpeas and occasionally a little meat.</span> <span id="s180">Our meat ration per week was about four ounces.</span> <span id="s181">A good sized hamburger, okay?</span> <span id="s182">For the whole week.</span> <span id="s183">Evening was the same thing.</span> <span id="s184">Life was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s185">No one who ever was in Gurs will forget the mud we had to live in.</span> <span id="s186">No one will forget the rats, the mice, the fleas, the lice and the bedbugs.</span> <span id="s187">There were no beds, but we had bedbugs.</span> <span id="s188">And I think this was the most -- the constant dampness in winter, the constant rain, the constant dampness.</span> <span id="s189">Being cold all the time, even though we had our own clothes.</span> <span id="s190">They did not take our clothes away.</span> <span id="s191">We were constantly cold and damp.</span> <span id="s192">And heat, yeah, there was in every barracks was a stove.</span> <span id="s193">But we very rarely had even two pieces of wood, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s194">We had electricity, contrary to some reports that I have read, we did have electricity.</span> <span id="s195">We had two lightbulbs in each barracks, small ones.</span> <span id="s196">We did not have to work, we were not forced to work.</span> <span id="s197">People created their own -- in that they started handicrafts.</span> <span id="s198">A cultural life was born.</span> <span id="s199">My husband, by the way, participated in that.</span> <span id="s200">Music was made.</span> <span id="s201">The Y provided instruments.</span> <span id="s202">You have to understand that in France the camps were just a little different from what you usually hear, in that social service agencies could function in the camp.</span> <span id="s203">And so we had the Young Man’s Christian Association.</span> <span id="s204">We had the Crakas, which is an American organization.</span> <span id="s205">We had the Swiss Red Cross -- children’s division, or children’s aid.</span> <span id="s206">It was ch -- first the Children’s Aid Society and then they combined it with the Swiss Red Cross, because otherwise they could not have functioned.</span> <span id="s207">We had them and we had Catholic and Protestant agencies and most of all we had the OSE, which is a ch -- Jewish child welfare organization in France.</span> <span id="s208">And OSE did tremendous work.</span> <span id="s209">Absolutely tremendous work, their social workers were far superior to anyone you can find, really and truly.</span> <span id="s210">And more oft -- most of these social workers, if not all, were Jewish.</span> <span id="s211">And so they really took a lot of chances and faced a lot of dangers helping us in the camp and taking children out of the camp, to place them in their children’s homes.</span> <span id="s212">Because they had to travel, they were on the road, they had to -- you know.</span> <span id="s213">And even in unoccupied France, things became evermore difficult.</span> <span id="s214">So they did a tremendous job.</span> <span id="s215">The Swiss Red Cross brought in some food for the most desperate.</span> <span id="s216">And they would feed young people in the morning and it went in rotation and then in the afternoon, day or something, they fed adults who really had nothing at all.</span> <span id="s217">We could receive money in the camp.</span> <span id="s218">We also could write letters and receive letters.</span> <span id="s219">So, these are things that did not exist in other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s220">It was most helpful.</span> <span id="s221">The money we could receive, well it created a black market of phenomenal, you know, prices.</span> <span id="s222">This was possible because we had a lot of Spanish people with us, who came to this camp, 1939, from the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s223">These were refugees from the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s224">For them this was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s225">For them it was a place where they could live.</span> <span id="s226">So-called, right?</span> <span id="s227">But they could go in and out of the camp.</span> <span id="s228">They had special -- that was a completely separate situation.</span> <span id="s229">These people brought in food, as much as they could get from the farms around or wherever and then, of course sold it at tremendous prices in the camp.</span> <span id="s230">That was their way of making a living.</span> <span id="s231">So the prices went up and up and up til one day we ourselves decided this can not go on because not everybody can really participate in this thing and a lid was put on the amount of money you could get each month.</span> <span id="s232">It was something we instituted ourselves, we kept an account for everyone, right?</span> <span id="s233">And out of this account, twice a month, you got a certain amount of money, several hundred francs.</span> <span id="s234">But that meant that you no longer could pay total fantasy prices, and it curbed this thing.</span> <span id="s235">We also instituted -- you could say it -- almost self help, in the following way.</span> <span id="s236">If people got money that was sent to them from wherever, they had to pay a certain percentage into a fund.</span> <span id="s237">This fund was used to help the people who received nothing at all, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So -- so, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">HL: I don’t think there are many camps or you have ever heard that people would -- sometimes it was a struggle to get people to really pay up, you know, their -- whatever percentages it was, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: So it was sort -- it was a self government, essentially.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">HL: It was -- a c-certain amount of it was self-government, definitely.</span> <span id="s242">Each block -- now the camp had -- was divided by one main road on each side of the main road, where wooden -- the wooden barracks subdivided into blocks.</span> <span id="s243">Each block, of course surrounded by barbed wire and a ditch and a gate with a ga -- military guard standing there or whatever.</span> <span id="s244">And -- and a rifle.</span> <span id="s245">Little did we know they didn’t have ammunition.</span> <span id="s246">But we could not circulate between the blocks.</span> <span id="s247">We had to invent a system by which the men and the women were separated, so that was a great hardship, because husbands and wifes could not talk to one another.</span> <span id="s248">They could not see one another.</span> <span id="s249">So the first thing that happened is then, when people died, all right, they would go to the funerals, because we did have funerals.</span> <span id="s250">And they would meet at the cemetery so they could talk to one another, right?</span> <span id="s251">And that was one way in the beginning.</span> <span id="s252">And people died very, very soon.</span> <span id="s253">Very quickly.</span> <span id="s254">Dysentery broke out.</span> <span id="s255">Meningitis had broken out.</span> <span id="s256">There were a number of -- you know, diseases that very rapidly spread and so many -- especially the elderly, died very quickly.</span> <span id="s257">I can show you the list of the people who passed away.</span> <span id="s258">I have one.</span> <span id="s259">And eventually we instituted a system with little tickets that were given out for an hour’s visit or else in the men’s block, so the wi-wife’s could go to the husbands and then the husbands would get a ticket to come another day to see the wife.</span> <span id="s260">But this of course also went, you know, in rotation.</span> <span id="s261">Not everybody could go every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And you said -- you said, “We instituted this system.”</span></p> <p><span id="s263">HL: We instituted that system.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Again that was -- that was a system that -- that you had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s265">HL: Yeah, but this -- this system had to be approved by the administration.</span> <span id="s266">On holidays, when there was a holiday, you could -- could get out of your block and circulate and there was no problem.</span> <span id="s267">But this was a holiday treat.</span> <span id="s268">But for the rest, this was instituted with the approval of the French administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So you describe an admin-administration that was fairly hands off, that just</span></p> <p><span id="s270">HL: It was not entirely hands off.</span> <span id="s271">When it came to cultural things they -- they were all with it, because that’s the way the French are, right?</span> <span id="s272">There was no problem.</span> <span id="s273">You have to ask my husband, because he worked more in the office than I did.</span> <span id="s274">I worked in the office in our block.</span> <span id="s275">But he was -- in his block he also worked in the office, he was more involved than I was.</span> <span id="s276">My job was more of giving out the mail, running, you know, giving out the mail that came.</span> <span id="s277">Run the errands, do some statistical work, things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s278">Anyway, life in camp was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s279">I would not say it was life like you hear about from Auschwitz or any of the other camps.</span> <span id="s280">No, that it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s281">It was tough, nevertheless.</span> <span id="s282">Once you are a prisoner, you’re a prisoner.</span> <span id="s283">So we didn’t have to stand in formation, okay?</span> <span id="s284">This did not exist.</span> <span id="s285">We were counted, however, in the morning.</span> <span id="s286">There was a woman who came through the barracks every morning to count us.</span> <span id="s287">God forbid if she overlooked a small child, because we had some small children with us and you know how it is, children go always under the blanket, right and she didn’t see them.</span> <span id="s288">She was miscount and then she was -- she was just horrible, you know.</span> <span id="s289">Screaming, stamping her feet and -- I mean it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s290">Totally unnecessary.</span> <span id="s291">There were some escapes.</span> <span id="s292">Some were on -- people were unfortunately caught and brought back.</span> <span id="s293">Others made it, that depended on if you had contacts outside, if you spoke the language, if you had money, you knew where you were going.</span> <span id="s294">Most of us -- only some young people tried from our group, I think .</span> <span id="s295">The group of German Jews that came from Barton and the Polatinate were an overaged group of people.</span> <span id="s296">Very -- percentage-wise very few young people and children.</span> <span id="s297">It was mostly 50 and up.</span> <span id="s298">So 50 and up, people are not quite this adventurous any more, you know.</span> <span id="s299">And they were all traumatized and in shock and it took a long time before people started to function.</span> <span id="s300">The ones who functioned from the beginning were the young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Did you live with your mother at that time and other relatives [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s302">HL: In -- in Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: In Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">HL: Yes, with my mother and my three aunts.</span> <span id="s305">The first few months I think we were in the same barracks and then my mother and I were shifted over to another barracks, but we were just a couple of -- what, maybe 50 meters, you know, something like that.</span> <span id="s306">So that was not a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: And communication an-and information?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">HL: Between us?</span> <span id="s309">Between the people in each block?</span> <span id="s310">Constant communication.</span> <span id="s311">What did people have to do other than talk?</span> <span id="s312">I mean, let’s face it.</span> <span id="s313">My cousin was in the same block, my -- that was the daughter of my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s314">Her mother was in the same block.</span> <span id="s315">Cousins of my mother were in the same block, right?</span> <span id="s316">As long as they were female.</span> <span id="s317">The males were all in separate blocks.</span> <span id="s318">So there was constant communication between us and the other people.</span> <span id="s319">Also many times fights.</span> <span id="s320">Bread -- distributing the bread.</span> <span id="s321">Cutting it into portions, because you got the whole loaf, usually was the flashpoint for a fight.</span> <span id="s322">Some people were very good at it, some were not.</span> <span id="s323">And when the bread was cut in portions, everybody watched, obviously, that none should get even one millimeter more.</span> <span id="s324">And there were some women who were not as good at it and bingo.</span> <span id="s325">My mother did it, it went in rotation, to make it, you know, equal.</span> <span id="s326">My mother did it, there was never, never a question, it was very funny.</span> <span id="s327">Never.</span> <span id="s328">There were some other people doing -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Okay, this is side B of tape one, interview with Hanne Leibmann.</span> <span id="s330">Okay, you were saying about the social service agencies?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">HL: Do you know my name is misspelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Oh, it’s misspelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">HL: It’s L-i-e.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">We’ll -- we’ll fix that on here.</span> <span id="s336">It’s spelled about three different ways on these forms so, we’ll make sure it’s the right one.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">HL: Possibly with a P too.</span> <span id="s338">The social service agencies were very helpful to us.</span> <span id="s339">And indeed one day a social worker came to my mother and asked me whether she would let me go out of the camp to a village called Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s340">And by now you must have heard about Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s341">There was a concerted effort to get the children and young people out of the camp and they started with the younger ones first, because they were in greater danger.</span> <span id="s342">Danger of malnutrition, danger of -- you know, I mean the whole thing.</span> <span id="s343">So this y -- young lady from the OC came around and asked whether she would let me go to that village, that there was a minister there by the name of Trocme and they wanted to take some young people out of the camp.</span> <span id="s344">And my mother left the decision to me and I decided that I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s345">And so after quite some time, actually, maybe six, seven weeks, we were finally told we would leave.</span> <span id="s346">And we were seven young people -- seven teenagers all together, to leave for Le Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How long had you been in the camp at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">HL: At the point I left -- well, we got to the -- we were arrested on the 22nd of October and arrived in Gurs on the 25th, 1940.</span> <span id="s349">I left the camp on the seventh of September, 1941.</span> <span id="s350">So, 11 months, little more than -- whatever.</span> <span id="s351">More or less.</span> <span id="s352">We were four boys and three girls to leave and we came to Le Chambon and that was the most marvelous experience anyone could have had, ever.</span> <span id="s353">I don’t know if you have seen the documentary, “Weapons of the Spirit”?</span> <span id="s354">Well, you have to see it to understand what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s355">We were placed in a home that was run by the Swiss Red Cross, children’s division.</span> <span id="s356">We were quite well taken care of, under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s357">France was very hungry, they had very little to eat and even so, we were in the country surrounded by farmers, these farmers were very poor.</span> <span id="s358">We had enough to eat, with the exception of one or two of the boys who were growing like weed and you know how teenagers can eat, like non-stop, 24 hours.</span> <span id="s359">However, we were free.</span> <span id="s360">We were in wonderful surroundings, people who appreciated us.</span> <span id="s361">It was a flip-flop from Germany.</span> <span id="s362">It was a total flip-flop from Germany.</span> <span id="s363">After having been persecuted, discriminated against, segregated out of society, right?</span> <span id="s364">We now where the people -- that we are wanted, right?</span> <span id="s365">And no difference was made between the French and us, right?</span> <span id="s366">Whether in the children’s home, in the group home or anywhere.</span> <span id="s367">Obviously, we were foreigners, obviously we did not speak French or not a good French.</span> <span id="s368">Obviously, we were dressed differently.</span> <span id="s369">I mean, we were very obvious in the village, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s370">And there was -- we were just always appreciated.</span> <span id="s371">People always helped us.</span> <span id="s372">There came the moment when we had to be hidden.</span> <span id="s373">The farmers took us in and hid us, at their own risk, I mean, the risk of their own lives and the family, right?</span> <span id="s374">Even so, til 19 -- what was it, 1942, the unoccupied zone became totally occupied, right?</span> <span id="s375">All of France was occupied.</span> <span id="s376">The danger of -- for the farmers to be arrested, why -- because they were hiding us -- had they found us, was real.</span> <span id="s377">And they shared their bread with us -- shared it with us.</span> <span id="s378">They had children to feed.</span> <span id="s379">And yet, there never was a question.</span> <span id="s380">If fact, in one of the farms where I was hidden -- I was hidden on two different farms, in a four week period.</span> <span id="s381">Both farms the police came to search.</span> <span id="s382">On the second farm, the police asked the farmer, “Are you hiding anybody?</span> <span id="s383">Are you hiding any Jews?”</span> <span id="s384">And we could hear this upstairs in our hiding place.</span> <span id="s385">And the farmer was very calm, answered, “Not hiding anybody and I don’t know what Jews look like.”</span> <span id="s386">And after a little pause, he said, “Would you care for a glass of red wine?”</span> <span id="s387">Our hearts sank to our feet, believe you me, thinking that this guy is now going to accept and stay, right?</span> <span id="s388">We have to stay in our hiding place, being scared to death, right?</span> <span id="s389">And then we could hear, “No thank you.</span> <span id="s390">I am on my way.”</span> <span id="s391">But this farmer was so calm about it, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s392">Just with a few words he finished the whole thing, “I’m not hiding body and I don’t know what Jews look like.”</span> <span id="s393">Well, no Jewish person had ever lived in Le Chambon, except for a few years, a Mr. Sesh lived there maybe a few years before the war.</span> <span id="s394">They had never known Jewish people.</span> <span id="s395">They knew the Jewish people only from the Bible.</span> <span id="s396">That was enough.</span> <span id="s397">They were the chosen people and you helped them and you took care of them.</span> <span id="s398">Being Huguenot, they knew their own history of persecution.</span> <span id="s399">They knew what this was all about, because, like the Jews, they always talk about their history.</span> <span id="s400">And so there was never a question.</span> <span id="s401">So this whole Chambon, their whole attitude, everything was the total flip from what we had experienced in Germany.</span> <span id="s402">I was in Chambon til February of 1943.</span> <span id="s403">In ‘43 I went to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And before you went, how many Jews do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">HL: Live in Chambon today?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: No.</span> <span id="s407">Were there at that time?</span> <span id="s408">How many were being hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">HL: The official number is 5000 people.</span> <span id="s410">Among the 5000 were Christian people who were persecuted, okay, for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s411">Being that they were German Gentiles who had fled into France because of political reasons.</span> <span id="s412">People who had become Protestant but were of Jewish background, they had become or were baptized at birth -- we had a friend like that.</span> <span id="s413">She was in Le Chambon and she was in a Protestant home.</span> <span id="s414">We had all sorts of people.</span> <span id="s415">The number of 5000 is the accepted number today by the papers, the false papers that were issued in the village and the surrounding area.</span> <span id="s416">People came, stayed, got their papers, went on.</span> <span id="s417">Because once they had the false identification papers, especially with the French Jews, could maneuver, okay?</span> <span id="s418">So, if you figure 5000 people, or approximately 5000, to a popu -- equal population of about 5000, this is a tremendous amount of -- of people saved.</span> <span id="s419">Or given an opportunity to survive.</span> <span id="s420">It’s tremendous.</span> <span id="s421">There were no 5000 people surviving in hiding in Germany, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s422">I think the number is 2000, but I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s423">So think of what one village did or one village and the surrounding villages, what they did in comparison to others.</span> <span id="s424">It is enormous.</span> <span id="s425">I must tell you that in the summer of 1942, I went back to Gurs to see my mother, because she had been very ill.</span> <span id="s426">I was promised a week’s stay and they would let me go.</span> <span id="s427">That was the arrangement that was made for me, through the various social service agencies.</span> <span id="s428">And I went.</span> <span id="s429">About a week or 10 days before I went down to Gurs, my husband -- then boyfriend, was able to leave the camp and he was placed on a Jewish boyscout farm outside of Lyon.</span> <span id="s430">Now in order to go from Le Chambon down to Gurs, you have to come down from Chambon, go to Sentatien, go to Lyon, because that’s the way the train would go, and he was outside of Lyon, so I stopped there first to see him.</span> <span id="s431">Then I went on to Gurs.</span> <span id="s432">And he told me, because he had been working for sometime in the so-called hospital in Gurs, that the ambulance comes through Orlong at such and such a time, such and such a -- blah blah.</span> <span id="s433">And when I asked, when I arrived in Orlong and asked for the ambulance from the camp, they said ambulance had not come for several days.</span> <span id="s434">So this already didn’t sound too good.</span> <span id="s435">So I went by bus to the camp.</span> <span id="s436">And when I came to the camp I could not enter, I was not allowed to enter.</span> <span id="s437">And then I found a room in a nearby village, in an inn, very simple inn, but it was fine.</span> <span id="s438">And within -- I went -- saw my mother, because she was notified that I’m there.</span> <span id="s439">Saw my mother through many layers of barbed wire, great distance away and it was sort of shouted conversation like if I shout from here, across the street to the other house, okay?</span> <span id="s440">From the road.</span> <span id="s441">And they did chase me, police would come and chase me, I would go back.</span> <span id="s442">And then, within two days, I think, I was told that the first deportation trains would leave.</span> <span id="s443">And my mother was on the first train out.</span> <span id="s444">I was given permission to see my mother at the railroad station, the freight yards.</span> <span id="s445">And I believe the people were loaded on the trains during the night.</span> <span id="s446">And I was told that I had to be there very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s447">So went to Orlong -- back to Orlong, slept in the street, between two houses.</span> <span id="s448">Was at one time asked for my papers, which then were still my real papers, not phony papers -- by the police and after that they left me alone.</span> <span id="s449">I explained to them why I was there.</span> <span id="s450">And as soon as day broke, I went to the rayer -- rail yards -- freight yards and found my mother, with the help of a French policeman, actually.</span> <span id="s451">He was sort of keeping himself separate from the rest and he asked me why I was there and I explained it to him and he found my mother for me, because I didn’t know in which -- which car.</span> <span id="s452">And so he also offered me -- five thirty in the morning, a drink of alcohol from hi-hip -- his hip flask.</span> <span id="s453">And I said no, thank you.</span> <span id="s454">I wasn’t used to drinking at five thirty in the morning.</span> <span id="s455">And I spent probably an hour or an hour and a half with my mother.</span> <span id="s456">And then, of course, the trains were closed and locked and the train pulled out.</span> <span id="s457">On my way back, I went to see my boyfriend again and told him what happened and at that point, when I was there, I heard the first time, round ups for the people who lived free.</span> <span id="s458">And when I came back to Le Chambon, I told some of his friends who were in a American funded student home -- and told them -- told my friends that we had no longer any parents, that they were taken away.</span> <span id="s459">It was a horrible job.</span> <span id="s460">It was a horrible mission, really.</span> <span id="s461">The whole situation was incredible.</span> <span id="s462">And I told some of his friends, “We have to leave.</span> <span id="s463">We have to ma-make our way into Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s464">And they looked at me and said, “You’re crazy.”</span> <span id="s465">I said, “Okay, then I’m crazy, but that’s where I’m going to go.”</span> <span id="s466">Guess who went first?</span> <span id="s467">The ones who called me crazy.</span> <span id="s468">They went way before I did.</span> <span id="s469">I only went in February of 1943.</span> <span id="s470">I told my husband at the time I saw him, on that boyscout farm, Jewish boyscout farm, run by two rabbis incidentally, that if he felt he was not safe there, to come to Le Chambon -- which he did, together with another young fellow.</span> <span id="s471">And I took him to Madame Philip, the wife of André Philip, who was the right hand man to General DeGaulle.</span> <span id="s472">And she asked me only one question, “Can we trust him?”</span> <span id="s473">And I said, “Of course you can.”</span> <span id="s474">And by evening he had been hidden away.</span> <span id="s475">He was hidden away for four weeks.</span> <span id="s476">He didn’t know if anyone remembered where he was, he will tell you himself.</span> <span id="s477">And when he came back he was given false papers and together with some others and a guide, he was taken to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s478">So this village has done more in every way, than anyone else that I know, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Before we talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Your -- your -- about going to Switzerland, tell me h-how you met your husband.</span> <span id="s482">You met in -- in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">HL: We met in the camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s485">What hap -- do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">HL: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s487">Well, his mother worked in the office in the block where we were.</span> <span id="s488">She worked there -- everybody, you know, there was no pay involved or anything.</span> <span id="s489">But she spoke a fluent French.</span> <span id="s490">And we needed people in the office who spoke French in order to understand the orders that came from the administration.</span> <span id="s491">The statistics that had to be done and all of that.</span> <span id="s492">All right, you had to have people could communicate.</span> <span id="s493">And I happened to be helping in this office and he would come and see his mother and that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s494">Very simple.</span> <span id="s495">Very simple story.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: How did you maintain a courtship, though, in that situation like that, in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">HL: How -- courtship.</span> <span id="s498">I don’t even think it was a courtship.</span> <span id="s499">It was a friendship, really.</span> <span id="s500">You know young people are sort of drawn together -- yes I fell in love with him, of course I did.</span> <span id="s501">I would be foolish to say not, that I didn’t, right?</span> <span id="s502">But it was a totally platonic thing.</span> <span id="s503">There was very little privacy, right?</span> <span id="s504">Most of the time people saw us with his mother.</span> <span id="s505">Some even thought we were brother and sister.</span> <span id="s506">You know, I mean it -- s-some others, maybe they found some privacy or were looking for it.</span> <span id="s507">We weren’t.</span> <span id="s508">And -- you know, I speak -- I speak in schools and colleges to the students about this time.</span> <span id="s509">And I mention my boyfriend became my husband.</span> <span id="s510">And not too long ago, in one class at Queensboro Community College, one girl in the question and answer session said, “I don’t know how you could look for a man under these circumstances.”</span> <span id="s511">I corrected her that I was not looking for a man, that is was totally platonic, which she couldn’t understand, right?</span> <span id="s512">It was almost funny, you know.</span> <span id="s513">So -- we kept a cor -- kept up a correspondence after I left.</span> <span id="s514">It’s as simple as that.</span> <span id="s515">I always knew where he was, when he left the camp, where he was, that’s why I could go visit him, right?</span> <span id="s516">Once he left Chambon and went to Switzerland, as soon as he came into Switzerland, he let me know where he was, right?</span> <span id="s517">And we kept on corresponding.</span> <span id="s518">There was no problem corresponding between France and Switzerland at the time.</span> <span id="s519">After all, it was supposed to be neutral, right?</span> <span id="s520">We know a little differently today.</span> <span id="s521">Let’s see, we even -- maybe we always knew.</span> <span id="s522">There -- there was not a problem, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: I guess the wi -- in a situation like that, you think that there are both advantages and disadvantages to -- to having a new relationship, whether it’s a friendship or a boyfriend -- to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s524">HL: Or a girlfriend, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Or a girlfriend, you know, to hav -- that there -- you know, there are certain advantages in having a close companion and certain fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">HL: There is an advantage to having someone, yes, especially if you’re in the same situation, because you’re each other’s support.</span> <span id="s527">The same as when you’re a group of people.</span> <span id="s528">Like we were seven young people, right?</span> <span id="s529">We were each other’s support.</span> <span id="s530">There is no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s531">And it made things easier for us, right -- than being alone.</span> <span id="s532">If you’re totally alone, without having this support, right -- it is much more difficult.</span> <span id="s533">One of my friends, who came from the camp with me, eventually, after I had left, split from the group.</span> <span id="s534">I’m not quite sure why she split.</span> <span id="s535">We assume she had a boyfriend somewheres.</span> <span id="s536">And she split from the group.</span> <span id="s537">And I think she -- in that time that she had left the group, until the end of the war, she suffered more psychological damages than any of us did.</span> <span id="s538">Because all of a sudden she no longer had the support group -- of the group -- of the group who was in the same situation, you know.</span> <span id="s539">But she’s -- you know, she’s suffered really psychological damages to this day.</span> <span id="s540">And she’s now in her 70’s.</span> <span id="s541">She cannot deal with it.</span> <span id="s542">She lives in -- outside of Washington and to this day she has not gone to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s543">She cannot deal with it.</span> <span id="s544">Her mother was deported, her father was deported.</span> <span id="s545">Her brother was deported, he lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s546">And she just cannot.</span> <span id="s547">And I feel it’s very much the time that she segregated herself from this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Did you maintain, or do you still maintain contact with other people in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">HL: All of them.</span> <span id="s550">All -- all but -- well, one lives in Brazil, I don’t actually have contact with him, but with his twin brother in Paris.</span> <span id="s551">One -- we know he came here to this country and we have lost track of him.</span> <span id="s552">And all the others, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s553">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Can you say -- can you say some of their names, just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s555">HL: Well, there is Elizabeth Koenig, nee Kauffman, she was with us.</span> <span id="s556">She did not come from Gurs, but she came to us in Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s557">She was, by the way, the chief librarian of the Holocaust Museum, til she became too ill and had to retire.</span> <span id="s558">There is Wiltrud Lavell, nee Eanee.</span> <span id="s559">She lives partly here in the States and partly in Spain.</span> <span id="s560">There is Jack Lewin, who lives right here, out in Long Island.</span> <span id="s561">There is Rudy Appel, who was not originally from Gurs, but came from Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s562">The Atlas boys.</span> <span id="s563">Yeah, we all have contact with one another, absolutely.</span> <span id="s564">And we wouldn’t miss it for the world.</span> <span id="s565">It took us a long time to even get together, because somewheres along the line we lost each other, because everybody -- you know, after they emigrated here, we didn’t all come at the same time.</span> <span id="s566">Jack Lewin, yes, he was in Switzerland, he also fled into Switzerland, I had contact with him.</span> <span id="s567">But then he came, I think before we did and somehow we didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s568">So it took years and years and years to find him.</span> <span id="s569">But eventually we fo -- he -- we found each other again.</span> <span id="s570">So we are really in constant contact, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Let’s come back to that a little bit later.</span> <span id="s572">L-Let’s keep going on talking about y-you made -- how you made it into Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">HL: How I made it into Switzerland?</span> <span id="s574">I went on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: And -- and -- and -- and why?</span> <span id="s576">You -- you -- you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s577">HL: I just felt -- well, there were two reasons.</span> <span id="s578">First of all, Max had gone there, he was there already.</span> <span id="s579">I had made up my mind after I saw my mother being deported that I was not going to stay in France, no matter how safe in Chambon.</span> <span id="s580">I just felt -- and I had family in -- in -- in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s581">So my -- I was focused on Switzerland.</span> <span id="s582">One of my friends who lives out in Palo Alto, who came with Max from the Jewish boyscout farm outside of Lyon, we had arguments.</span> <span id="s583">He said, “You go to Switzerland, you go in a mousetrap.</span> <span id="s584">Something happens, you are lost there.</span> <span id="s585">Come with me, we go to Spain.”</span> <span id="s586">I said, “I’m not going to Spain, I go to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s587">So we had arguments back and forth.</span> <span id="s588">He went exactly to Spain, with the help of the French underground, Madame Philip.</span> <span id="s589">His way was Spain, North Africa, England, joined the French army in England and came marching back into France.</span> <span id="s590">He then lived again for sometime in France and then came here to the United States.</span> <span id="s591">So, yes we did have arguments whether we do go to Spain.</span> <span id="s592">And from there on, or to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s593">So I chose Switzerland.</span> <span id="s594">And my trip to Switzerland, well, I went on my own.</span> <span id="s595">I went alone from Chambon, which I left on foot to go to the next village, because I did not want anyone in the village to see me take the train.</span> <span id="s596">This way I just disappeared.</span> <span id="s597">I stayed one night with the minister in Toanse, which is the next little town.</span> <span id="s598">And the -- in the morning I took the train, from there to go to Sentertien and from Sentertien you have to change to go to Lyon.</span> <span id="s599">Then you go from Lyon to Anmass, Anisee, Anmass and Geneva.</span> <span id="s600">And I did all that, it was not easy, it was not a joy ride.</span> <span id="s601">I was stuck in Lyon at the railroad station for a long, long time because there was no train going -- to wait for hours.</span> <span id="s602">At this point, in 1943, all of France was occupied.</span> <span id="s603">The railroad stations were full of German military.</span> <span id="s604">So I put myself in the waiting room, bought a magazine, right?</span> <span id="s605">Pretended to read this magazine, watched what was going on, right?</span> <span id="s606">Was as invisible as possible.</span> <span id="s607">I had bought my ticket, right -- and when the time came, I just walked quietly to the train -- to the pier -- to the platform.</span> <span id="s608">And took the train.</span> <span id="s609">Trains were overcrowded at that time.</span> <span id="s610">Stood a long time in the -- no, what do you call it, you know they have compartments in [indecipherable] and there’s this -- it’s like a corridor that runs along.</span> <span id="s611">I stood there for a long time and I put myself right next to a policeman.</span> <span id="s612">I figured if I stand right next to him, he won’t know that I’m scared to death, right?</span> <span id="s613">I did not start a conversation with him, he didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s614">But I figured, if I stand close to him, he will not think even to ask me for my papers.</span> <span id="s615">And that was exactly right.</span> <span id="s616">Took a long time before I found a seat.</span> <span id="s617">And there were three people -- funny enough, a lot of people must have gotten off.</span> <span id="s618">I found a seat, put myself in the corner, pretended to sleep.</span> <span id="s619">And these three people were talking about work in the resistance, which was a terrible mistake, because I could have been anybody who is going to denounce them.</span> <span id="s620">And in Anmass I got off and I -- no, Anisee, Anmass [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s621">Got off in Anisee.</span> <span id="s622">Was supposed to go to an orphanage, a Catholic orphanage.</span> <span id="s623">Who -- and the man on the train, who was in this compartment said to me, “Do you know where you are going?”</span> <span id="s624">I said, “Yes, I have to go to the orphanage.”</span> <span id="s625">“Do you know the way?”</span> <span id="s626">I said, “I will find it, thank you.”</span> <span id="s627">“I will take you there.”</span> <span id="s628">I said, “Thank you, I will find it.”</span> <span id="s629">Well, he insisted on taking me there.</span> <span id="s630">Turned out not to be too far from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s631">We came there, nobody would open the door.</span> <span id="s632">So he said, “What are you going to do now?”</span> <span id="s633">I said, “Well, I guess I have to find a hotel.”</span> <span id="s634">I had very little money.</span> <span id="s635">And he said, “Okay, I will find one for you.”</span> <span id="s636">Well, what he found was a very simple place and downstairs was some sort of a bar type thing.</span> <span id="s637">And there were a lot of people in there, some of them from North Africa and I had never experienced that.</span> <span id="s638">And I got a room and I made sure I locked that door very tightly.</span> <span id="s639">I gave them a totally phony address.</span> <span id="s640">I gave them the name as it’s my -- in -- in my identification paper and as an address, I gave an address in Lyon.</span> <span id="s641">Every town, every city in France has a rue -- oh God, I can’t think of it just now.</span> <span id="s642">Rue Garibaldi.</span> <span id="s643">Doesn’t exist a town that doesn’t have a Rue Garibaldi.</span> <span id="s644">Such and such a number Garibaldi, Lyon.</span> <span id="s645">They didn’t look too closely, di -- neither did they care.</span> <span id="s646">And in the morning I paid and I left and I went back to this orphanage and then I could get in.</span> <span id="s647">They simply did not answer bells at night, for security reasons, obviously.</span> <span id="s648">And they gave me a little breakfast and told me how to go on.</span> <span id="s649">Which bus to take, where I had to walk, what I had to do.</span> <span id="s650">And so I made my way to Anmass and from Anmass I walked to another little place and on the way was a customs office.</span> <span id="s651">And I figured customs office, it’s war time, there’s no trade, what -- what customs office?</span> <span id="s652">And I walked by.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Okay, this is tape two, side A, interview with Hanne Leibmann, once again.</span> <span id="s655">So we’re talking about your escape into Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">HL: My escape into Switzerland -- as I walked along the road, I saw this custom’s office, as I mentioned before and I walked past and the officer called me back and asked for my papers, which I gave him.</span> <span id="s657">And he looked at them and then out of the blue came, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s658">Question I was not prepared for at all.</span> <span id="s659">And just as quickly, I answered, in good Nazi propaganda -- and don’t ask me where it came from, I simply said, “I have nothing to do with this dirty race.”</span> <span id="s660">And he sort of had a ha-half smile on his face and said, “Okay, you can go.”</span> <span id="s661">Whether he believed me or not, I don’t know, but he let me go.</span> <span id="s662">And I walked on and made my way to the priest of the village, the Catholic priests, which was one of my contact points.</span> <span id="s663">And he told me to what house I had to go to meet the man who would help me cross the border.</span> <span id="s664">This man was hired by my relatives in Switzerland to cross me over.</span> <span id="s665">He was paid for the job.</span> <span id="s666">There were a family there with two boys and later on a single young man whom they had found in the church [indecipherable] the story was and he wanted to cross over into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s667">So this night he crossed over six people.</span> <span id="s668">He took us -- actually, he was very close to the border.</span> <span id="s669">What he did was carry across -- carry us across the water.</span> <span id="s670">There was a little stream.</span> <span id="s671">He carried us across so we wouldn’t get wet.</span> <span id="s672">Told us exactly what direction to walk -- now please, this isn’t -- during the night, in the dark.</span> <span id="s673">In what direction to walk to get the street car that would take us into Geneva.</span> <span id="s674">Now, you know what streetcars do?</span> <span id="s675">They have the overhead electric wires and it sparks when they hit the connections.</span> <span id="s676">So you see this and you get confused.</span> <span id="s677">And we walked and came exactly back from where we had started.</span> <span id="s678">So then we knew a little better what we had to do, but it was a very anxious moment.</span> <span id="s679">This man was a widower, he had six children, teenagers and up.</span> <span id="s680">At one point, several months later, he took 40 people across the border, was caught and shot.</span> <span id="s681">So, it’s a very sad story.</span> <span id="s682">That left all of his children without parents.</span> <span id="s683">Yeah, he was paid for it, but, you know, what good?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">HL: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s686">If I ever really knew it.</span> <span id="s687">Or if I knew a name, it might not have been his real name, I mean you had to have lots of safeguards.</span> <span id="s688">In Anisee when I got off the train, I had to show my papers, right?</span> <span id="s689">And police looked at it and said, “Go on.”</span> <span id="s690">You know, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s691">There were a lot of people and [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s692">We reached a street car -- we had a few Swiss coins, which the man had given us -- the passeur had given us and he told us where to get off, and there would be a person standing there waiting for us, taking us to a little hotel for the night.</span> <span id="s693">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s694">We got off at that point.</span> <span id="s695">I don’t remember what the station was from the streetcar.</span> <span id="s696">There was a young lady standing there and she took us to this hotel, which didn’t ask for any registration or anything.</span> <span id="s697">They must have been, obviously, paid off.</span> <span id="s698">And in the morning she came and picked us up, took us to her house -- to her apartment, gave us a breakfast.</span> <span id="s699">And I had asked her, as soon as I got off the streetcar, I said, “Please call my family immediately.”</span> <span id="s700">“Oh, it’s 11:30 at night.”</span> <span id="s701">I said, “Please, call immediately.”</span> <span id="s702">And she did and my aunt came the next morning to pick me up.</span> <span id="s703">Around 11 o’clock or so, she was in Geneva to come and pick me up.</span> <span id="s704">Now, my entry into Switzerland was easy, compared to other peoples.</span> <span id="s705">Also, once I was on Swiss soil, I was legal, because my family had obtained an immigration visa for me.</span> <span id="s706">So only my crossing was -- in a way, illegal, right?</span> <span id="s707">But once I was in Switzerland, I was a legal whatever you -- immigrant, okay?</span> <span id="s708">While all the others, like my husband, were illegal immigrants, right?</span> <span id="s709">They were refugees -- illegal refugees.</span> <span id="s710">I lived with my family from March first til Decem -- 1943, til -- 24th of December, 1944.</span> <span id="s711">Much too long.</span> <span id="s712">My relatives did not understand what I had experienced.</span> <span id="s713">They had no understanding -- even so, my aunt had lost her sister.</span> <span id="s714">She could not accept that my mother w-was dead, til I flung it in her face one day.</span> <span id="s715">They just never understood.</span> <span id="s716">My uncle was a very Victorian man.</span> <span id="s717">Very Swiss, very Victorian.</span> <span id="s718">I was 18, he was in his 70’s, right?</span> <span id="s719">I mean, this alone, right?</span> <span id="s720">And there were a lot of frictions.</span> <span id="s721">A lot of frictions also because I felt that he was a well-to-do man and he did not do enough.</span> <span id="s722">Did not do enough for the family, to save them.</span> <span id="s723">Two sisters of my mother were able to leave Gurs to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s724">My grandmother died in Gurs.</span> <span id="s725">My mother’s oldest sister died in Gurs, okay?</span> <span id="s726">And there was my cousin, who was a young woman of 35.</span> <span id="s727">There was a lot to be done and he could have done better.</span> <span id="s728">And the answer I got from him one day was, “I cannot eat my bricks.”</span> <span id="s729">He had several houses and the answer was, “I cannot eat my bricks.”</span> <span id="s730">And it was just so outrageous, you know.</span> <span id="s731">My aunt could be speaking about her brother that was lost, right, with his wife, daughter, son-in-law.</span> <span id="s732">And sees a stain on a little tablecloth with red wine and she became totally upset about this stain, while talking of her brother who died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s733">She didn’t know about Auschwitz at the time, but she knew these people were lost.</span> <span id="s734">So you can see that they had absolutely no understanding.</span> <span id="s735">And the fact that I wanted to get married, well that was altogether outrageous.</span> <span id="s736">How can you get married to someone who has nothing -- who is nothing?</span> <span id="s737">You have to have at least -- all this was too much.</span> <span id="s738">And I must say that if I ever came close to a nervous breakdown, it was in my family -- in my aunt’s and uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s739">And one of my cousins didn’t help the situation at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Let me just go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: You said that you had found out that your -- your mother had died.</span> <span id="s743">When did you find out and how did you find out after [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s744">HL: Look, when my mother was deported and we had this hour or so together, she -- my mother was a realist.</span> <span id="s745">She told me she would never come back, that this was the last trip, that they were certainly going to be taken east and somehow people had a sense for what was going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s746">And so, you know, news filtered into Switzerland in ‘43, slowly and surely and there was no doubt in my mind that this is what happened.</span> <span id="s747">Besides, my mother had diabetes and I never even thought she would make it as far as -- as Auschwitz, which she did, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s748">In this case, unfortunately [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s749">So, to me it was a sure thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Were you ever able to find a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s751">HL: Also, a woman of 52 and the strain and stress and the deprivation of everything, right?</span> <span id="s752">And sick.</span> <span id="s753">How long can you last?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So you felt that whole time that --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">HL: That my mother was lost, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Were you able later on to find out any information about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">HL: She was indeed -- she made it as far as Aus-Auschwitz and she was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s758">Because I looked into the Gedenk book, you know what that is?</span> <span id="s759">That’s a memorial book that the German government publishes with all the names of German Jews that were killed.</span> <span id="s760">There’s some mistakes in the book, however, essentially, you can find what you need to find.</span> <span id="s761">You can -- the museum has the book.</span> <span id="s762">You ask for it up in the library, they have it.</span> <span id="s763">So, to me, that -- there was -- we knew.</span> <span id="s764">There was no doubt in our mind, especially people of a certain age.</span> <span id="s765">When I saw my mother last, she had already lost so much weight.</span> <span id="s766">I’d never seen my mother that skinny in her whole life.</span> <span id="s767">So how much resistance was there left?</span> <span id="s768">So living with my relatives was not a good experience, not at all.</span> <span id="s769">I left them on December 24th and I mention that date because my uncle was Protestant, my aunt always remained Jewish and was a member of the Jewish community, but he was Protestant, and so Christmas, of course was celebrated because their sons were raised as Protestants.</span> <span id="s770">And my cousin, her middle son, threatened her that unless I was out of the house, he would not come for Christmas.</span> <span id="s771">And I had already been in negotiations with Geneva, where Max was taking a social service course -- to get a job there and the only job I could get was as a maid.</span> <span id="s772">And Mademoiselle DeMomela was the one who negotiated that deal.</span> <span id="s773">And I got a job with a very nice Bulgarian family.</span> <span id="s774">He was secretary at the Bulgarian consulate and resigned because of the Bulgarians being so German friendly, okay?</span> <span id="s775">He opposed the Germans with everything.</span> <span id="s776">So, I worked for them for several months.</span> <span id="s777">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s778">I worked hard, but they were very nice to me, very understanding.</span> <span id="s779">And in the mornings he would come and tell me, “I listened to the radio last night.”</span> <span id="s780">The broadcast, the clandestine broadcast from Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s781">“They shot that friend of mine and they shot this friend of mine,” and I got an up to date report every day of what was going on in Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s782">He associated with a lot of people that worked for various resistance groups all over.</span> <span id="s783">And they were really very nice.</span> <span id="s784">And I worked for them til the day we got married, which was the 14th of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s785">And then I asked for voluntary internment, so I could be with my husband.</span> <span id="s786">Because as an immigrant, I was to be free.</span> <span id="s787">So I asked for internment and the Swiss government said, yes, I could do that.</span> <span id="s788">And so we lived in various refugee homes.</span> <span id="s789">Now, Max had been in a work camp at one time.</span> <span id="s790">And we hear a lot about these things and is all so distorted.</span> <span id="s791">Some people like to say they were slave labor camps.</span> <span id="s792">These were not slave labor camps, they were work camps.</span> <span id="s793">They lived like all the military did, right?</span> <span id="s794">We got the same rations the Swiss got.</span> <span id="s795">We were paid a small sum of money every 10 days for the work we did.</span> <span id="s796">We could go out.</span> <span id="s797">There was never a fence, there was never anyone to say you cannot, you know, leave the house.</span> <span id="s798">Yeah, they had to do their work for certain hours and then they could do what they wanted.</span> <span id="s799">Weekends they could go in the village, go to the movies or to -- to local inn or whatever they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s800">And every six weeks we got a pass for the railroad, to go anywhere we wanted in Switzerland, provided someone was good enough to take a refugee in for a two or three day pass.</span> <span id="s801">So it was nothing at all like what you read today in the papers.</span> <span id="s802">It’s -- it’s -- it’s sad.</span> <span id="s803">I mean, the Swiss did a lot of dirty things.</span> <span id="s804">What went on during the war, you know, it was immoral, it was terrible, but people will do things -- terrible, immoral things, in order to stay independent.</span> <span id="s805">And I cannot even fault them for that.</span> <span id="s806">Because, had they not done that, you and I wouldn’t be talking to each other.</span> <span id="s807">Germany would have gone in there, right?</span> <span id="s808">And you and I wouldn’t be talking.</span> <span id="s809">Had the Germans gone in there, those 28,000 Jews that were in Switzerland, would not be.</span> <span id="s810">Surely Switzerland was wrong in sending back 30,000 Jews to their death.</span> <span id="s811">This was as immoral and as unnecessary as can be.</span> <span id="s812">There was room for these people.</span> <span id="s813">But the things Switzerland did after the war, with the gold, and not paying out the moneys that people were entitled to and denying them what was rightfully theirs, this is what I resent.</span> <span id="s814">We didn’t expect anything from the Swiss.</span> <span id="s815">We were glad to be there, we were glad to be safe.</span> <span id="s816">As long as they were safe, we were safe.</span> <span id="s817">Yes, there was harassment, yes we were the dirty refugees.</span> <span id="s818">Yes, we were the unwanted guests, right?</span> <span id="s819">But we survived and the name of the game was survival.</span> <span id="s820">Harassment?</span> <span id="s821">We had been harassed before, right?</span> <span id="s822">That they are anti-Semitic, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s823">There’s no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s824">But the name of the game was survival.</span> <span id="s825">I must tell you that Max and I were in three different homes.</span> <span id="s826">One of them, the woman who ran it -- the Swiss woman who ran it was not a nice person.</span> <span id="s827">She was a small, petty soul, who now had power over people and she let them know it.</span> <span id="s828">So this was not a nice place.</span> <span id="s829">We had mostly Dutch people in this home, who came from Theresienstadt and they were mostly elderly people, very few young people among them.</span> <span id="s830">And she was not nice to them.</span> <span id="s831">We then asked for a transfer, after the -- the Dutch went home very quickly after the -- after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s832">Within a few weeks they went back to Holland.</span> <span id="s833">We then got a Russian group of people.</span> <span id="s834">These people were probably Ukrainian, possibly slave laborers, possibly all the people who had volunteered to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s835">Okay?</span> <span id="s836">We never knew the full story, except that they were Russians.</span> <span id="s837">And we -- they were a rough bunch.</span> <span id="s838">Most of them were pretty rough.</span> <span id="s839">And we asked for a transfer to another home, because Max worked in the office, so he had connections.</span> <span id="s840">He asked for a transfer and we went to Cloastuss, which is a lovely place.</span> <span id="s841">And there the Swiss management was just the nicest, really the nicest people.</span> <span id="s842">This house -- this home burned down -- this home burned down after the -- we first had Polish people there, Gentile people and then we had also again Russian people.</span> <span id="s843">And the Russian people, that was a very dirty story, what happened to them.</span> <span id="s844">What happened was that Switzerland did not have diplomatic relations with Russia, since 1917.</span> <span id="s845">Now, they were itching to re-establish this after the war and what better thing to do than to sell out these Russian people?</span> <span id="s846">And they were the only group of people who were forced out of the country.</span> <span id="s847">The Russian military came and picked them up.</span> <span id="s848">And you saw it, when they came.</span> <span id="s849">All of a sudden, this house was Russian property.</span> <span id="s850">This was the way they behaved.</span> <span id="s851">We had a hundred people in Cloastuss in this home.</span> <span id="s852">Four of them hid in the woods and did not go back.</span> <span id="s853">We later on found out from someone in the government in Switzerland that this whole transport of Russians, was killed in Austria by the Russian military, including the infants, and we had infants.</span> <span id="s854">So this was a group of people sold out in order to get diplomatic relations.</span> <span id="s855">Amoral?</span> <span id="s856">You better believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: When -- when and why did you decide to -- to leave Switzerland and come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">HL: Switzerland made it very clear to you that you better go on.</span> <span id="s859">My husband had a cousin in Switzerland, had a clothing factory for men -- men’s clothing.</span> <span id="s860">And he could have used him very much, to help him in the factory, in the office and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s861">And so he asked for permission for us to stay, for him to work.</span> <span id="s862">And so the little village said, oh well, if the contone, which is like the state, right?</span> <span id="s863">We’ll go along with that, this is fine.</span> <span id="s864">Then the contone said well, if the federal government will permit it.</span> <span id="s865">And the federal government turned around and said, when the -- if the contone will permit it.</span> <span id="s866">And wa -- you know what it became?</span> <span id="s867">A catch 22.</span> <span id="s868">And I said, “Forget it, we go to America.”</span> <span id="s869">I had family here, right?</span> <span id="s870">Max had family in Israel, however this was not an option for us.</span> <span id="s871">And s --</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">HL: We just felt we didn’t want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s874">We just felt that was not the place we would want to be.</span> <span id="s875">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: W-W-Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">HL: I don’t know whether it actually had to do something with his aunt -- it prob -- aunt and uncle, really, because they were not willing to -- to do anything for him, even before we were deported.</span> <span id="s878">You have to ask him exactly what went on.</span> <span id="s879">And they were not particularly helpful during the time that his mother was in Gurs.</span> <span id="s880">His father took an entirely different route.</span> <span id="s881">They were not willing to help him either.</span> <span id="s882">And so we probably felt we better, you know, it was not the place we wanted to be.</span> <span id="s883">Later on relations straightened out, but it took a long, long time.</span> <span id="s884">In any case, our chance of coming here was probably also better.</span> <span id="s885">And so we came here in February of 1948.</span> <span id="s886">No, actually beginning of March.</span> <span id="s887">The first day in our -- in this country was our daughter’s second birthday.</span> <span id="s888">Our [indecipherable] was born in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s889">And I tell you, we were in a refugee home in Taratae where the woman who was in charge was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s890">We had approximately 30 infants in that house, many of them born in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s891">No infant, no baby could have been better taken care of anywhere, than our children were.</span> <span id="s892">Each mother took care of her baby.</span> <span id="s893">We had a whole floor with nothing but babies, okay?</span> <span id="s894">A whole floor.</span> <span id="s895">Separate kitchen.</span> <span id="s896">Two pediatric nurses to supervise the whole thing, okay?</span> <span id="s897">I mean, these kids were so well taken care of, it wasn’t even -- and I -- I mean it was really exceptional.</span> <span id="s898">If anyone says the kids weren’t taken care of, it’s not true.</span> <span id="s899">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s900">We had older children with us, they went to school.</span> <span id="s901">One of the refugees was a doctor from Yugoslavia who had -- was with the Hungarian group, was in Bergen-Belsen and was brought out and came to Switzerland, this group of people, I don’t know if you heard about them.</span> <span id="s902">And he was a terrific doctor and a specialist in pediatrics.</span> <span id="s903">So our children couldn’t have had it better.</span> <span id="s904">And she was just two years old when we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And what happened when you first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">HL: When we first arrived, my family had arranged for us to stay at the Steven Weiss home.</span> <span id="s907">Steve -- Rabbi Steven Weiss was running a -- a house on 70th Street, it was in the 70’s on the West Side.</span> <span id="s908">And there were a lot of refugees in this house.</span> <span id="s909">We had a room to ourselves, large room for the three of us.</span> <span id="s910">And, it was -- we had breakfast, lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s911">And the first week our relatives paid for us, I think it came to 30 dollars for the three of us.</span> <span id="s912">And it was really a very good set up because I could go down in the kitchen and get for the baby what I needed, you know?</span> <span id="s913">And so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s914">And then we wanted some help from some organizations here and my uncle, who was a brother to my father said, “Let’s go down.”</span> <span id="s915">I think they went to the HIASs.</span> <span id="s916">And Max and he went and I stayed back with the child.</span> <span id="s917">And down at the organization they told him, “Well yeah, but -- we can help you, but only if you move out of New York.”</span> <span id="s918">And Max said, “Well, where do you think I should be going?”</span> <span id="s919">And he said, “Well, go to Peoria, Illinois.”</span> <span id="s920">So he asked, “Well, what’s in Peoria, Illinois for me?”</span> <span id="s921">“Well, go to the library and look it up.</span> <span id="s922">And the first thing you have to do is move out of the Steven Weiss home and move into the Hotel Marseilles on 100 Street and Broadway.”</span> <span id="s923">And that was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s924">So we did and then we thought about all of this and it was a ridiculous idea.</span> <span id="s925">I have family in New York, I have family upstate New York.</span> <span id="s926">I have family in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s927">Why should I go -- be going out to -- to Illinois?</span> <span id="s928">I know -- don’t know anybody, right?</span> <span id="s929">So, about 10 days or 12 days after we came here, Max found a job and very soon after that we moved into a s-single room occupancy situation and chugged along as best we could.</span> <span id="s930">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Wh-What was his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">HL: He worked in an office for an importer - exporter.</span> <span id="s933">Oh, some stuff.</span> <span id="s934">You have to ask him exactly what they were doing.</span> <span id="s935">Unfortunately I was sick.</span> <span id="s936">I spent some time in the hospital.</span> <span id="s937">My daughter went upstate to my cousin.</span> <span id="s938">And Max had a problem with his knee, he also had to stay in bed for several weeks.</span> <span id="s939">And it was a very rough beginning.</span> <span id="s940">After all, this was straightened out, we found a little place in Flushing, because we didn’t want to be in Manhattan with the child and also the rents were much too high, we couldn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s941">If I had walked into a place with a tiger on a leash, I probably would have found an apartment, but not with a child.</span> <span id="s942">Nobody wanted a couple with a child.</span> <span id="s943">And in Flushing we found something, it was very bad, but we had two rooms, a kitchenette, you know and we could sort of almost afford the rent.</span> <span id="s944">Not really.</span> <span id="s945">And we lived in that house til we had the house condemned, for the unsanitary conditions in the house.</span> <span id="s946">And then we found an apartment in Astoria with a very nice landlady who wanted someone with a child.</span> <span id="s947">And we -- that was a partly furnished apartment and it was very nice.</span> <span id="s948">And we just sort of got our feet on the ground when disaster struck.</span> <span id="s949">And disaster struck one night when I was coughing and first [indecipherable] really kind of funny.</span> <span id="s950">Then I was coughing again and then, by then I knew I better get up.</span> <span id="s951">And I went in the bathroom and I coughed up blood.</span> <span id="s952">Now, nobody had to tell me what happened, okay?</span> <span id="s953">My aunts, who went to Cuba from Gurs, had arrived in the States few weeks after us, so I had my two aunts here and of course they were no help to me because one had Parkinson’s, the other one was even older, why not sick, but an aunt with Parkinson’s is -- is enough -- [indecipherable] to tell them.</span> <span id="s954">And went to the hospital and they diagnosed the obvious, I had TB.</span> <span id="s955">And that was in 1950.</span> <span id="s956">Now we came in ‘48, this was the fall of 1950.</span> <span id="s957">My uncle had died, s -- maybe six weeks before that and then of course they took x-rays of my husband and of the child.</span> <span id="s958">And Max was equally sick with TB.</span> <span id="s959">The only one not sick, like a miracle, was the child.</span> <span id="s960">So we first had to send her up to my cousin to be taken care of, because she was not to [indecipherable] with us any more.</span> <span id="s961">And we then were placed in sanitorium, in Bedford Hills, which is Westchester County.</span> <span id="s962">Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, had a sanitorium up in Westchester County and we were placed there.</span> <span id="s963">We were there -- Max probably 18 months and I was there 21 months.</span> <span id="s964">Our daughter had to come back from upstate New York in order to be placed in a foster home.</span> <span id="s965">I could not leave her with my cousin.</span> <span id="s966">I cannot ask someone to take care of a child, a two year old -- a four year old at this point -- or four and a half, without being able to compensate them in some way.</span> <span id="s967">It is a [indecipherable] responsibility.</span> <span id="s968">And she came back to New York and she was placed in a foster home out on the island with a very wonderful person, who had been taking in foster children for many years.</span> <span id="s969">And there were other children in this house and she was very well taken care of.</span> <span id="s970">I mean, very well taken care of, but still knowing that her parents were someplace else.</span> <span id="s971">And it left it’s mark on the long run.</span> <span id="s972">The woman was very good, she had great understanding for children.</span> <span id="s973">And she was away from us for -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: This is tape two, side B, interview with Hanne Leibmann.</span> <span id="s975">And you were just talking about -- h-how long were you sick for, actually, with TB?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">HL: Well, from October 1950, til I came back, which was in fif -- about September 1952.</span> <span id="s977">Something like that.</span> <span id="s978">Must have been around that.</span> <span id="s979">And then of course, you’re not supposed to work, you’re supposed to blappa -- you know, take it easy, because at this point you are only arrested, it takes five years to be cured, okay?</span> <span id="s980">So it was felt that it’s enough if you have -- if I t-take care of the child and my husband and the household, that I couldn’t possibly go to work.</span> <span id="s981">He went to school.</span> <span id="s982">He went for accounting.</span> <span id="s983">He finished a course in nine months that usually takes two years.</span> <span id="s984">And we actually lived on welfare.</span> <span id="s985">We had to go on welfare, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s986">We got a s -- apartment eventually.</span> <span id="s987">When we first came out we had -- we subleased a room -- Max subleased a room in someone’s apartment.</span> <span id="s988">And then after we got clearance from the government -- because we were not citizens, we got an apartment in Brooklyn, in the 14 section.</span> <span id="s989">There’s a housing project, the 14 houses.</span> <span id="s990">And we got an apartment there and the minute we got the apartment, we could take our daughter home.</span> <span id="s991">And eventually, as soon as he finished school, he went to work.</span> <span id="s992">And we took it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: How old was your daughter when you -- when she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s994">HL: Came back?</span> <span id="s995">Almost seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: So that must have been very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">HL: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s998">You have to find your way back.</span> <span id="s999">It’s really -- you know, a relationship has been -- not totally cut of course, but still -- we could see her -- after the first year we could see her every three months, I think.</span> <span id="s1000">But a couple of hours is not much, right?</span> <span id="s1001">We would call her every Sunday, 12 o’clock sharp.</span> <span id="s1002">She knew 12 o’clock on Sunday, there’s a telephone call from her parents.</span> <span id="s1003">We wrote her, we sent her stuff.</span> <span id="s1004">I would knit for her or crochet for her, do things, you know.</span> <span id="s1005">A cousin of Max would go and see her all the time.</span> <span id="s1006">This woman worked, she couldn’t take the child, she had to support herself.</span> <span id="s1007">She went out to the island, almost every weekend.</span> <span id="s1008">But you have to find your way back.</span> <span id="s1009">We would do anything and everything to -- you know, make this again a family.</span> <span id="s1010">And yet, after maybe two years, maybe less, she threw at me one day, “You got sick on purpose, both of you, so you could get rid of me.”</span> <span id="s1011">This is a child’s thinking, a child’s imagination, a child’s reasoning.</span> <span id="s1012">A child doesn’t know you don’t get sick on purpose, right?</span> <span id="s1013">And when I told our pediatrician, the very man who was -- who saw her born, practically, in Switzerland, he then said, “Well, maybe she should have some psychiatric care.”</span> <span id="s1014">And I figured that’s going a little far, I think she will outgrow that.</span> <span id="s1015">Well, she did not outgrow certain aspects.</span> <span id="s1016">She realized, yes we didn’t get sick on purpose, when she was older, but there were certain aspects that she did not overcome.</span> <span id="s1017">And so she ended up with many years of psychiatric care.</span> <span id="s1018">She’s now the most level-headed, wonderful human being that you -- you know, not because it’s my daughter and I’m prejudiced in favor of my daughter, but she really is, you know.</span> <span id="s1019">And she is very understanding of other people.</span> <span id="s1020">So it really has done what it was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1021">I mean she had to deal with another situation several years later when I got sick again -- again with TB, in 1961.</span> <span id="s1022">So that was something that was just -- you know, a repetition, even so, this time I didn’t have to go to a sanitorium, I was home.</span> <span id="s1023">And she was already a teenager.</span> <span id="s1024">But it certainly upset her greatly, you know.</span> <span id="s1025">Said here again, mother is sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: How did -- how did your experiences during the war affect the way that you sort of saw yourself as -- as a mother or an -- an -- you know, here in the United States, how did -- how did that -- you know, color the way that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">HL: You mean, did our daughter know what happened to us, did we tell her what happened to us?</span> <span id="s1028">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s1029">Well, she asked me one day, “Why don’t I have grandparents?”</span> <span id="s1030">And she must have been about 10, something like that.</span> <span id="s1031">And that was an unexpected question really, because I’d never thought of it.</span> <span id="s1032">And I told her, “Your grandparents were killed in a concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s1033">Now that was a little much for a child, I know that now.</span> <span id="s1034">I didn’t realize it at the time.</span> <span id="s1035">And then she didn’t say anything any more.</span> <span id="s1036">And my two aunts were sort of stand in grandmothers, right?</span> <span id="s1037">She heard us talk about Gurs, definitely.</span> <span id="s1038">She heard me talk to my aunts when we were talking about things in the past.</span> <span id="s1039">So she always knew this, but we didn’t push it.</span> <span id="s1040">We did not say to her, like I know from other mothers, “You have to be very good, because of what happened to us.”</span> <span id="s1041">Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1042">We did not say, “You cannot go here or there,” right?</span> <span id="s1043">“You cannot have this or that, because we didn’t have that you can be without.”</span> <span id="s1044">You know.</span> <span id="s1045">She wanted to go out as a teenager or when she went to college, she went to Adelphi.</span> <span id="s1046">And she wanted to go at night to the city, on Saturday night like all young people.</span> <span id="s1047">We never said, “You cannot do that.”</span> <span id="s1048">I know parents who would not let their children do that.</span> <span id="s1049">Simply because they felt, “We didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1050">We had to do without that.”</span> <span id="s1051">They had no understanding for a normal life of a teenager, right?</span> <span id="s1052">And they wouldn’t let their children have it.</span> <span id="s1053">And they really -- a lot of these second generation have a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s1054">And I think that’s one problem our daughter did not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And why do you think they have these problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">HL: Because of the parents, really because the parents were overprotective.</span> <span id="s1057">I have friends who outright say, “Yes, we were overprotective of our children.</span> <span id="s1058">We wouldn’t let them do this and that and the other thing and we always worried where they were and what they did.”</span> <span id="s1059">And we just didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1060">Or if we worried, we didn’t tell her, and let her -- you know.</span> <span id="s1061">One night my husband and I had a terrific fight.</span> <span id="s1062">Why?</span> <span id="s1063">Because Evelyn decided, with her girlfriend, to go to the city to a hangout.</span> <span id="s1064">And this hangout was perfectly fine, there was nothing wrong, but it was snowing.</span> <span id="s1065">It was snowing very heavily.</span> <span id="s1066">And he -- she wanted to go with the car, obviously, from Jackson Heights.</span> <span id="s1067">I said, “Go take the car.</span> <span id="s1068">Go.”</span> <span id="s1069">And he was upset that in the snow I let her drive and go to city.</span> <span id="s1070">“This is too dangerous,” this is this, this is that.</span> <span id="s1071">I said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1072">She wants to do it.</span> <span id="s1073">If she gets stuck, she has to find a way to come home.”</span> <span id="s1074">She did.</span> <span id="s1075">I didn’t say you can’t go, it’s too dangerous, or this or that or the next thing.</span> <span id="s1076">We let -- I let her go, he was -- he was upset about it.</span> <span id="s1077">But I felt that, she’s a young person, she has to find out what she can do, what she can not do.</span> <span id="s1078">And we never stopped her from whatever she wanted to do because maybe we’re too afraid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: When she got older, did you talk to her more and more about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">HL: Well, she always knew some of them and eventually -- when we gave the interview to the museum, I think it was, she listened to the tape.</span> <span id="s1081">I said, “Well?”</span> <span id="s1082">She said, “Well, I always knew the story.”</span> <span id="s1083">That was the answer, I always knew the story.</span> <span id="s1084">Because she heard us talk.</span> <span id="s1085">Mostly with my aunts, or with friends or other people and there was never -- but there was never this emphasis on you cannot do this or you cannot do that or you have to be good because of what we experienced, which is a stupid thing anyway.</span> <span id="s1086">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Do you think that you felt differently or taught her differently about things like religion or being Jewish, based on your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">HL: She had -- she went to Sunday school for a year or two.</span> <span id="s1089">We are not a religious home, right?</span> <span id="s1090">We are more cultural Jews than religious Jews.</span> <span id="s1091">Yes, we do observe the holidays, right?</span> <span id="s1092">We will have Passover and we will have people here for Passover or -- for Passover or for Rosh Hashanah or whatever, right?</span> <span id="s1093">Yes, we had Hanukah but we are not, as such, religious people.</span> <span id="s1094">She knows very well where she belongs, okay?</span> <span id="s1095">There’s no question about that.</span> <span id="s1096">But to me, you know, it is by far more important that someone is a good human being, over being very religious and maybe not such a good person.</span> <span id="s1097">One doesn’t exclude the other, but you know, to me it’s more important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: What -- what do you think may have -- what do you think’s been changed by your experiences during the war in terms of that -- in terms of the way you see religion or being Jewish?</span> <span id="s1099">I mean, is th -- are there things that you can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">HL: I have never been ashamed of being Jewish, I was always so proud of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1101">I would never have entertained the thought of conversion of any kind.</span> <span id="s1102">And by the way, in Le Chambon, there was never an attempt by anyone to convert us, right?</span> <span id="s1103">That was an absolute taboo.</span> <span id="s1104">Would have been very easy for these people to persuade us, right?</span> <span id="s1105">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1106">I have asked many of my friends how they felt about it and it was the same opinion.</span> <span id="s1107">Yeah, I have my quarrel with what is known as God, right?</span> <span id="s1108">How could you not after what you experienced?</span> <span id="s1109">And if you ask survivors, you will find that some of them became very religious or remained their religiousness and others who turned away.</span> <span id="s1110">So, we’re here somewheres in to -- in between.</span> <span id="s1111">Which is a cop-out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Have you gone back there at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">HL: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: To either France or Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">HL: Oh, to the village?</span> <span id="s1116">To Le Chambon?</span> <span id="s1117">Many times.</span> <span id="s1118">And I must tell you that when I go there, I feel very much at home.</span> <span id="s1119">I know few people, right, as such.</span> <span id="s1120">The people that I sort of knew have all passed on.</span> <span id="s1121">But there’s just something about the place that -- well, I feel very much at home.</span> <span id="s1122">We have not gone back to Gurs, no.</span> <span id="s1123">By the way, there is nothing standing of the camp, there is only the cemetery, which has been totally redone, partly or entirely with money from Germany.</span> <span id="s1124">And moneys that were raised otherwise, I suppose, but it’s totally redone, it doesn’t look anything like what it originally was.</span> <span id="s1125">It’s like -- now like a nice military cemetery.</span> <span id="s1126">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: You were talking about this group that you were -- that you were with there and then you sort of maintained contact with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: -- over the years.</span> <span id="s1130">When you first came to the United States, was that important, to find people who had been through the war and had similar experiences?</span> <span id="s1131">Or has it been more important [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">HL: Well, we found many of our friends here, again, friends from before this total experience, you know, having be deported, Gurs and so on.</span> <span id="s1133">Most of them, my husband’s, some mine.</span> <span id="s1134">Yeah, it was important to find our friends again.</span> <span id="s1135">That was definitely important to us.</span> <span id="s1136">Many had other experiences.</span> <span id="s1137">I have friends who went into England with the kinder transport and I found them here again.</span> <span id="s1138">Others came directly from Germany to here.</span> <span id="s1139">Others had been in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1140">Yeah, it’s important to have your friends and friends with whom you share a past.</span> <span id="s1141">There is sort of an unspoken, you know, connection.</span> <span id="s1142">You know, you don’t have to explain to this person how you feel about a certain thing or a situation or in -- what it was in the past.</span> <span id="s1143">You don’t have to do that, they know.</span> <span id="s1144">The ones who don’t know, are the ones who don’t even want to know.</span> <span id="s1145">Or didn’t want to know when we first came.</span> <span id="s1146">When we first came, we were with one of my husband’s friends and they said something and Max says, “Well, I had to go across the Alps -- not the Alps, but through the mountains.”</span> <span id="s1147">And the way we came here and so on and [indecipherable] so he sort of made a funny joke about a very sad situation and they really didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s1148">And this is the complaint of all survivors, that the people really didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s1149">And then I come across American Jewish people, “Oh, we didn’t know what went on.”</span> <span id="s1150">“You didn’t know what went on, when it was daily in the newspapers?</span> <span id="s1151">Didn’t you read them?”</span> <span id="s1152">I mean there -- we have volumes of paper clippings from the New York Times, over here at the Holocaust center.</span> <span id="s1153">Day by day where something has been reported about the Holocaust and the conditions in Germany before 1940.</span> <span id="s1154">And people didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1155">Kind of strange, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1156">So I have -- we have a problem.</span> <span id="s1157">I mean, when people come and -- one of my friends, a survivor, told me and said they were invited somewheres, family, American, you know, extended family, when they came here and the woman said, “Well, tell me, did you get orange juice for breakfast?”</span> <span id="s1158">Where?</span> <span id="s1159">In Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1160">I mean the questions are so absurd.</span> <span id="s1161">They were so absurd that the survivors just shut up and weren’t talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: That one of the reasons that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">HL: The survivors did not talk for so long.</span> <span id="s1164">They couldn’t and they knew that other people had no -- no understanding, didn’t really want to know.</span> <span id="s1165">I spoke in a school in Staten Island several weeks ago.</span> <span id="s1166">Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1167">Not a yeshiva, but a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1168">On the line of maybe Hamas.</span> <span id="s1169">You know Hamas school?</span> <span id="s1170">They are a wonderful school, Jewish school in the middle of the city, have highly intelligent children there and a wonderful staff of teachers.</span> <span id="s1171">And this is run -- there are boys and girls, so it’s not, you know.</span> <span id="s1172">But we wear long skirts and long sleeves and -- religious.</span> <span id="s1173">I was over there and I spoke to about 100 children.</span> <span id="s1174">And then I asked, “How many of you have grandparents that are survivors?”</span> <span id="s1175">And I would say 70 percent of the kids there had grandparents that were survivors.</span> <span id="s1176">And I asked them, “What did your grandparents tell you?”</span> <span id="s1177">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1178">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1179">“My grandparents don’t talk about it.”</span> <span id="s1180">I said, “Go back to your grandparents, make them talk to you and tell you.”</span> <span id="s1181">I said, “If you are supposed to remember the Shoah, commemorate the Shoah, then you have to know why.</span> <span id="s1182">So go and talk to them.</span> <span id="s1183">Make them talk.”</span> <span id="s1184">They don’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Why do you think the grandparents aren’t -- aren’t telling their story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">HL: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1187">They should tell their grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1188">You have this opposite, the ones who don’t talk and the others who pile it on.</span> <span id="s1189">Literally.</span> <span id="s1190">And put a great burden on these children.</span> <span id="s1191">It is almost a burden the way they do it.</span> <span id="s1192">So you have these two opposites.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Do you feel like your experience has been different as a survivor, having been married to another survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">HL: You will find most survivors being married to other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: But in your case, you actually had such similar experiences all the way through -- through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">HL: Yeah, and many people met in the DP camps in Germany or even knew each other at one point or another in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1197">Many of them got married in the ghetto, were lucky to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Can you explain in your experience why that -- why that’s been so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">HL: I think again because people were comfortable with each other, not necessarily because they were terribly in love, but because they wanted someone, right?</span> <span id="s1200">Someone with the similar experience who understands what this was all about, right?</span> <span id="s1201">And because they wanted a family.</span> <span id="s1202">And I don’t think there were many divorces among these survivor marriages.</span> <span id="s1203">Many of the people already had lost a family.</span> <span id="s1204">Had lost a wife or a husband and children.</span> <span id="s1205">You know, so they were looking to establish again, a family.</span> <span id="s1206">I think most survivors are married to other survivors.</span> <span id="s1207">At least most of the ones I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Is there anything else that you want to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">HL: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Post war experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">HL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">HL: Not really.</span> <span id="s1214">At war’s end -- when the war was over.</span> <span id="s1215">The day it was announced on the radio and I listened to the speech of King George and I just understood enough English to understand what he was saying.</span> <span id="s1216">We were in a refugee home in Shesare, where we had this horrible woman in charge of the home.</span> <span id="s1217">I must tell you, I felt totally drained.</span> <span id="s1218">It was a beautiful, sunny day.</span> <span id="s1219">And here were the Alps in full sunshine and I felt totally drained.</span> <span id="s1220">It was not hooray the war was over.</span> <span id="s1221">We had lost everyone and everything.</span> <span id="s1222">The last one to die was my brother in 1945 in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1223">So we felt drained.</span> <span id="s1224">There was no jubilation.</span> <span id="s1225">Not a -- for any of us.</span> <span id="s1226">You would think people would have been totally happy and s -- no.</span> <span id="s1227">Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1228">In fact, we have a picture somewheres -- this woman in that home, in that refugee home, found it in her heart to say, “Well, the war is over, let’s have in the afternoon, something special.</span> <span id="s1229">Let’s have some coffee and cake outdoors on the verandah.”</span> <span id="s1230">And so we did, and picture was taken and everybody looks glum.</span> <span id="s1231">That was the hooray, hooray, you know.</span> <span id="s1232">So, I think maybe you would want to speak to Max.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: I would like to speak to Max.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">HL: But life, the beginning in this country was not easy, it really wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: But, recent years has been easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">HL: Recent years have been good, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Well, thank you so much --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">HL: Eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: For talking, it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">HL: Eventually I did go to work, but I cannot [indecipherable] that officially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Shall I turn this off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: -- tape three, and the beginning of the interview with Max Leibmann.</span> <span id="s1245">And the interviewers name is Joe Richmond.</span> <span id="s1246">So let’s start just -- let’s review your childhood that -- talking about your brothers and sisters, their names and ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">ML: I -- no, I don’t have brothers and sisters, I was an only child.</span> <span id="s1248">Was born in Mannheim, Germany.</span> <span id="s1249">I had a perfectly normal, middle class childhood and I started school in -- after [indecipherable] 1928.</span> <span id="s1250">I switched schools in 1932, meaning that in Germany you normally completed either f-four years of public school and then went into high school, or if you did not qualify for high school, you continued for four more years of public school, then became an apprentice and went to school twice a week in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1251">So I switched schools.</span> <span id="s1252">After four years I went into the -- a high school called Grayagunasium, which meant that in the first year we had Latin, and Latin continued of course, throughout school.</span> <span id="s1253">In the third year we added French.</span> <span id="s1254">So we had Latin and French and in the fourth year we had Latin, French and English.</span> <span id="s1255">The difference between my high school and a gimnasium was, that in the gimnasium, you would learn Latin first, then they would add Greek and as a third language I think they added French.</span> <span id="s1256">But the Greek was meant particularly for students who would become either lawyers or doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: In your -- in your upbringing, though, you -- was it a religious household, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">ML: No.</span> <span id="s1259">We were not -- we were not religious.</span> <span id="s1260">I mean, we knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1261">My father was very active in the Jewish community, in fact he was an elected official to the -- let us call it lower house.</span> <span id="s1262">And he was requested, I think in 1935 or 1936 to join the executive branch of the Jewish congregation, which he declined because he felt he was not religious enough.</span> <span id="s1263">But he was active in a Jewish choral society, which after -- where he was the secretary, since the end of World War One.</span> <span id="s1264">And this choral society, eventually, after we were excluded in Germany from cultural life, was converted into what was called cooltupunt, meaning we were, in our city, the cultural organization.</span> <span id="s1265">We pr-produced concerts, we produced opera, as -- when this -- when we were excluded, we added a -- an orchestra, a string orchestra And th-thus we were able to perform all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1266">I was in this orchestra by the time I was about 15 or 16.</span> <span id="s1267">In 1935 or 1936, I joined the orchestra and this went on until Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s1268">Now, it should -- I have to emphasize that I was permitted to stay in school and not change to a Jewish school, because my father was a front line war veteran.</span> <span id="s1269">And the children of Jewish front war -- war veterans, had the privilege -- some privilege -- of -- of remaining in school til Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s1270">However, I did not stay in school after December 1937.</span> <span id="s1271">I had decided by then that enough is enough.</span> <span id="s1272">I could never go to the university in Germany, so it made no sense to stay in s-s-school, learn Latin -- continue with Latin and I switched from a -- from the high school, to a private commercial school where I -- with an emphasis on languages, but where I continued French and English studies.</span> <span id="s1273">I also learned some steno -- German steno.</span> <span id="s1274">Why I learned this I will never know, because I knew I would never use it.</span> <span id="s1275">This brought us to Kristallnacht, which was on -- during the night of November ninth and November 10th.</span> <span id="s1276">I went innocently to school on November 10th in the morning, not knowing about anything.</span> <span id="s1277">And my mother called me on -- around nine o’clock, nine thirty, I should leave the school now and go to Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1278">Heidelberg was a smaller city which was -- is quite famous all over the world -- and I should go in the woods and stay there until the evening and call her again.</span> <span id="s1279">Which I did.</span> <span id="s1280">And on my way from the private school where I was, to the railroad station, which was about a 10 minute walk, I finally understood what was going on in the city, because I saw swonkrauts clustered around houses where I knew there were Jews living and furniture flew out of the windows, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1281">My father left Germany in March, 1938.</span> <span id="s1282">He was offered by the firms he represented.</span> <span id="s1283">He was a representative of textile goods, to go to Greece and start -- try to start selling there on their behalf and thus create a new existence which would -- should permit us eventually to follow him to Greece.</span> <span id="s1284">This did not really work out.</span> <span id="s1285">The competition became aware of his activities when he started to sell goods.</span> <span id="s1286">And the competition managed to get him expelled in 1939.</span> <span id="s1287">My father went to Italy.</span> <span id="s1288">And from Italy, just before the outbreak of the war, illegally went to France, where he was first arrested, put i-into jail for six weeks and then lived a precarious life until he was caught in 1940 in Nice -- until he was caught by accident in a raid and was deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1289">My mother’s w -- remained in Germany.</span> <span id="s1290">By the way, she -- she saw my father for the last time in August of 1939 and came back, instead of calling me and telling me to come down to Italy, because we all had passports, and that’s -- my mother and I were trapped when the war broke out and we never saw my father again.</span> <span id="s1291">And then we were deported on October 22nd, 1940, to Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: [inaudible] And how old were you when -- when you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">ML: I was deported -- when I was deported in ni -- October 1940, I was 19.</span> <span id="s1294">By the way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: What can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">ML: Slow.</span> <span id="s1297">Let’s step back first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">ML: Let’s go back to Kristallnacht first.</span> <span id="s1300">We had moved, in order to preserve money, because no inco -- there was no more income, we had given up our own apartment and moved in-into the apartment with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1301">My grandmother happened to have been a French citizen.</span> <span id="s1302">And the house my grandmother owned had a ba -- a loft in the back, where there was a Jewish firm which sold electrical fixtures.</span> <span id="s1303">On Krist -- on -- on -- not on Kristallnacht -- during the day when they started smashing everywhere, they also came into my grandmother’s house and went into the back in the loft and had a field day with smashing all these electrical fixtures which were stored [indecipherable] hanging, etcetera, but my mother had enough presence of mind to call the French consulate.</span> <span id="s1304">Because, after all, this was a Fr -- a French possession, this was not German property.</span> <span id="s1305">And the consulate called the police and within 10 or 15 minutes after these hoodlums had entered th-the loft, there was a uniformed brown shirt, who pulled everybody out and stood guard the whole day so that nothing would -- would happen to my grandmother’s apartment, because after all, she was a foreign citizen.</span> <span id="s1306">That’s -- our apartment was -- was whole, was never smashed.</span> <span id="s1307">When the war broke out, of course, with mobilization, we also had to report to the military, but we are immediately discharged as not fit for service as being Jews.</span> <span id="s1308">Mustered out.</span> <span id="s1309">And the next thing we knew is I was drafted for the first type of forced labor.</span> <span id="s1310">We were sent to east -- to the eastern part of Germany, fairly close to the Polish border, to help harvest potatoes, sugar beets, red beets -- because of other people were drafted right away when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1311">And I was somewhat more lucky than some others I know of, because when the harvest was over, I was permitted to come back to -- to the -- the city where I lived, while others were not permitted.</span> <span id="s1312">I know of other people who also were from my city, who never were permitted to come back home.</span> <span id="s1313">So when I came back home, my mother saw to it that I was able to work starting January first, 1940, in the equivalent of Hiyas in Germany, which was centrally administered by the G-German Jewish administration in -- in Berlin and for the next 10 months, I served as a secretary in what was called in g -- what we called in Germany, histroin and we devoted the ent -- our -- all -- all our efforts, his whole office was devoted to helping people emigrate.</span> <span id="s1314">And the -- the one benefit which came out -- I got a pocket money, I didn’t get a full salary, I got a small pocket money, a monthly pocket money.</span> <span id="s1315">The one benefit which came out of this was that on October 21st, in the morning, the telephone rang and we were permitted to keep the telephone, which in the -- in -- in the office of the Jewish community, but we were not part of the Jewish community as such, because we reported to Berlin, to the central administration.</span> <span id="s1316">And the head of my office, who was at the same time the contact person between the Gestapo and the Jewish community, was called down to the Gestapo and they told him that we would be deported the next day, to France.</span> <span id="s1317">Unfortunately -- and we closed the office and I went home, unfortunately we could not publicize this because Ger -- the German Jews were deprived of their telephone when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1318">When I came home on that day, I told my mother that we would be deported the next morning, she didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s1319">So I started to pull out former sandalbags from my father and started to pack.</span> <span id="s1320">And she finally -- I finally convinced her that I’m not kidding, since it’s not a joke, that we really would be deported.</span> <span id="s1321">So, by the time the Gestapo came the next morning to arrest us, at least we had reasonably packed what we could carry.</span> <span id="s1322">We had wa-warm clothes in, we had the right shoes.</span> <span id="s1323">We had the blanket.</span> <span id="s1324">So when they told us this -- this you can take, we were all ready, which we didn’t tell them.</span> <span id="s1325">And this was how the deportations started.</span> <span id="s1326">Then we were taken by the police, to the railroad station, where there -- there were -- once we were asse --enough people were assembled, we were loaded into very old passenger cars, which, you know, in Germany, you had four classes, originally.</span> <span id="s1327">But the time we left, there were only three classes, but they used the old fourth class passenger cars to load us and send us to -- to France.</span> <span id="s1328">We were permitted to take along, besides food, which we were told, 100 marks and with -- we were told, if you take more and we find it, you will be shot.</span> <span id="s1329">So we took, like good Germans, fo -- each 100 marks, which on the train were exchanged by the SS against 2000 francs.</span> <span id="s1330">French francs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">HL: I forgot to mention what suitcase [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: You can speak up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">HL: Oh.</span> <span id="s1334">I can?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">HL: The other things we could take along, or were permitted to take along, was one suitcase as long as we could carry it, a blanket, a set of cutlery per person and what else?</span> <span id="s1337">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">ML: And we were told to take food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">HL: Food for a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">ML: For a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: So you knew that you were being deported the next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">ML: I knew, but I were -- we weren’t -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Did you know anything else?</span> <span id="s1345">Did you know where you were going to go, how [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">ML: No, all -- all we knew is that we would be sent away to France.</span> <span id="s1347">That’s all we knew.</span> <span id="s1348">Now, the Gestapo, or rather the SS, left the trains at the so-called demarcation line.</span> <span id="s1349">The demarcation line was that part of France which was occupied and th -- and the -- the other part was unoccupied.</span> <span id="s1350">The -- the -- the Germans left, the train went on to Lyon and I happened to have been in the first train which went to France.</span> <span id="s1351">There were seven trains all together, I was the first train -- in the first train with my mother.</span> <span id="s1352">And it so happened that in my car was a former German officer of World War One and somehow or other he caught the attention of the SS and they came to him and said, “You are the transport chief.”</span> <span id="s1353">He didn’t ask for it, he didn’t want it, but you are the transport chief.</span> <span id="s1354">So when the -- when we arrived in Lyon and the French gendarmerie, the French police wanted to know who’s in charge, so he descended, he said, “I am in charge.”</span> <span id="s1355">And since he didn’t speak French, I came along as a translator.</span> <span id="s1356">And what was interesting was, we talked to a colonel of the French gendarmerie, which is the -- more or less the equivalent of what we have here as state police, but on the national scale.</span> <span id="s1357">These people didn’t know who we were.</span> <span id="s1358">They were told there are Alsatians coming -- or Lorraines coming, who don’t want to stay under German occupation, which was not true.</span> <span id="s1359">They were not prepared for us, they didn’t know who we were.</span> <span id="s1360">And so we first had to cue him in who we were.</span> <span id="s1361">Though I believe that while we were talking with this man, the -- the people on the train got a soup by the French Red Cross and possibly some bread.</span> <span id="s1362">We were eating -- we were fed, it was my first experience in Swiss paté.</span> <span id="s1363">We had paté and we had with -- they gave us some bread and something to drink.</span> <span id="s1364">Then we went back on the train and these trains then went on, very slowly [indecipherable] south.</span> <span id="s1365">I think we were on the train at least two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">HL: Three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">ML: Or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">HL: On the 22nd to the 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">ML: The 22nd to the 25th.</span> <span id="s1370">We arrived at the railroad station which was close to c -- the camp, which was called Conde Gurs, which incidentally was built by the Spanish when the Spanish Republicans lost the war in -- the civil war in Spain and came across the border.</span> <span id="s1371">We arrived there on -- on October 25th, in a downpour which was unparalleled.</span> <span id="s1372">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">HL: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">ML: And from the -- the train -- we were taken in trucks to the camp.</span> <span id="s1375">It was about 10 or 15 miles.</span> <span id="s1376">The tr -- the trucks were -- were operated by the Spanish internees who were in the camp, who had many more privileges than we ever got.</span> <span id="s1377">And since it was night, there was nothing -- we had absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1378">There was straw which I think we got the next day and it was very primitive.</span> <span id="s1379">And so eventually they issued covers to -- to stuff the straw in so that we had some kind of mattresses.</span> <span id="s1380">And this is how we began in -- in the camp.</span> <span id="s1381">Each block had about 30 barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">HL: 25</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">ML: 25 barracks.</span> <span id="s1384">The barracks were built from wood, flimsy wood and were covered with tarpaper.</span> <span id="s1385">There were no windows, you just had wooden flaps, which in order to have some light you had to open.</span> <span id="s1386">There were two lights in the barracks, one at the beginning, one at the end and one stove, which gave a little heat when we had wood in winter.</span> <span id="s1387">It was -- it was brutal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Were you able to maintain contact with your mother at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">ML: Yes, we were able to con -- to maintain contact -- con -- contact with our relatives.</span> <span id="s1390">There was a system where the so-called block administration was issued little tickets -- I don’t remember how many -- which permitted you to go to visit, maybe one hour every so many days.</span> <span id="s1391">I don’t recall the details.</span> <span id="s1392">I was somewhat more fortunate because I had office skills, so I very soon made my way into they office and I worked in the office.</span> <span id="s1393">So I had privileges.</span> <span id="s1394">I could go more often to my mother and then eventually we were also able to obtain musical instruments and we started a string quartet.</span> <span id="s1395">And once we started with the string quartet and began to concertize in each block, we were given camp passes.</span> <span id="s1396">So I could circulate in camp day and night.</span> <span id="s1397">I visited my mother every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">HL: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">ML: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1400">That’s how I met my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: T-T-Tell me how you met your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">ML: My wife was a runner in the block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">HL: [inaudible] message.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">ML: A messenger where my mother worked in the office.</span> <span id="s1405">She was the principle -- my mother was the principle clerk in -- in the block where she was located and my wife served as a messenger.</span> <span id="s1406">There was mail to be distributed, there was mail to be picked up, so the youngsters, you know, th -- see u-us youngsters adapted much better to these brutal conditions than the -- the -- the -- the grown-ups.</span> <span id="s1407">And you have to visualize that the so-called streets within the blocks were earth, and when it rained hard -- and it rained hard there very often in this region, it was tho -- for -- about 25 miles or 20 miles north of the Spanish border.</span> <span id="s1408">Sees -- the ground turned to mud.</span> <span id="s1409">Now you have to realize, I had riding boots and with my riding boots when it rained, I would sink in almost up to the top of the riding boots, into this mud, which meant that we had at least one or two deaths of pe -- old people who had to go to the latrines at night, fell and couldn’t get out -- and couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s1410">Was one -- I think it was one woman.</span> <span id="s1411">The food we got was between four and 600 calories a day.</span> <span id="s1412">Not only was it very limited, but it was also established later that a lot of the money which was assigned to the camp for provisions was stolen.</span> <span id="s1413">So we got even less than we would have normally gotten.</span> <span id="s1414">And we soon had all kinds of problem in the camp with starvation signs.</span> <span id="s1415">People collected water in their legs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">HL: Malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">ML: Due to malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1418">It was called udame.</span> <span id="s1419">I don’t know what you call this in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">HL: Edema.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">ML: Edema.</span> <span id="s1422">This was the condition in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: You both talked a little bit about how it was [indecipherable] a self government -- government system --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">ML: Well, each block --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: H-How did that work, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">ML: -- each block had a so-called blo-block aldist, a vice block aldist and an office.</span> <span id="s1427">You know, in -- in every o -- camp, you have to keep track of numbers, you have to keep -- for food rations, you have to do your own cooking in so-called field kitchens, whatever we got.</span> <span id="s1428">We got -- we got -- the bread was assigned so we had to count.</span> <span id="s1429">There were constant reports to be made, that’s why there was an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">HL: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1431">I mentioned before there were constant statistics to be made.</span> <span id="s1432">You have to report the people who die, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">ML: And we soon had deaths, because the old people died like flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">HL: Just a moment.</span> <span id="s1435">I brought you here what I usually take to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">ML: I mean I think my wife gave you much more detail about -- about the camp, because she is talking about it constantly, while I am out of this since I -- since I’m working at the American gov -- with the American [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1437">We started speaking together at the time, when it started, but when I joined the American [indecipherable], I stopped speaking.</span> <span id="s1438">I speak here and there, once in awhile, but not through a great extent, so you forget some of the details.</span> <span id="s1439">You know, I would have to refresh myself by reading and doing.</span> <span id="s1440">We have the literature here to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: You’re still remembering good details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">ML: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Tell me how you -- how it came about that you left the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">ML: Well, let’s finish with the camp first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">ML: Eventually, and I’m sorry to say this, it became evident to the French su-supervisors that the so-called two block aldist of our camp were more corrupt than other block aldist.</span> <span id="s1447">And so one day they decided to dissolve our block, to stage an example for the others.</span> <span id="s1448">And while this was going on, one day, shortly before the exodus started, where people were distributed to the other blocks.</span> <span id="s1449">And actually, they probably did this also because they had moved a certain amount of people, transferred a certain amount of people to other camps.</span> <span id="s1450">So one day, the supervisor of our block stood in front of me and said, “I want you to do something for me.</span> <span id="s1451">I want you to do the inventory of what you are giving back to us.”</span> <span id="s1452">You know, blankets, etcetera, kitchen stuff.</span> <span id="s1453">So I did this.</span> <span id="s1454">Was be a lot of work.</span> <span id="s1455">Was my first experience with what you call inventory.</span> <span id="s1456">And after all, I’d never worked commercially.</span> <span id="s1457">And so, when we were all finished, I was about the last one to be transferred out.</span> <span id="s1458">The supervisor said to me, “Now look, I will put you in another block, but you will hear from me as a thank you.</span> <span id="s1459">I will find something for you.”</span> <span id="s1460">Well, he found something for me a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s1461">I didn’t believe any more.</span> <span id="s1462">Fortunately I still had my pass, I could circulate.</span> <span id="s1463">By that time I didn’t play any music any more, but I had a p -- a pass and I could go in and out.</span> <span id="s1464">And one day the man stands in front of me.</span> <span id="s1465">“I have something for you.”</span> <span id="s1466">And what he had for me was really something extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1467">He transferred me to the hospital, the camp hospital.</span> <span id="s1468">Which meant I lived in a halfway decent barracks.</span> <span id="s1469">I shared one room with hospital beds and a stove, where we go -- for which we had wood, in the barrack where the personnel was partially sleeping.</span> <span id="s1470">And I ran the office of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1471">In the meantime, there were social workers at work, who were very busy to find places for the -- the younger generation, under 21.</span> <span id="s1472">My wife left -- she wasn’t my wife then, she was my girlfriend, left after 11 months in camp.</span> <span id="s1473">And I was in camp much longer, I was in camp 21 months, but one day I also was approached, “Would you like to get out?”</span> <span id="s1474">And my mother of course said, “Yes, let him go.”</span> <span id="s1475">So, I was -- and we have the documentation for that -- I was let out of camp on July 25th, 1942.</span> <span id="s1476">Had I been there one week longer, you wouldn’t be talking to me, I would have been deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1477">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Wh-What happened one week later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">ML: One week later they closed the camp.</span> <span id="s1480">They surrounded it with the gendarmerie and people were simply taken from the camp into -- via trains to Drancy, which was a -- a inderin camp outside of Paris and from there there were regular transports, like clockwork, with about 1000 people per train, to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">HL: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1482">Drancy was what is generally referred to as an umschlatblats --what the Germans called an umschlatblats.</span> <span id="s1483">This was a camp or place where transports arrived, people were taken off the train and a day or so later, new transport trains were put together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">ML: And these transports went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1485">So I was taken out of camp on July 25th, 1942 and I was taken to a farm in Tareai, that is a village outside of Paris, where there was a farm operated by the Jewish boyscouts.</span> <span id="s1486">Boyscouting in France was run along religious lines, so there were -- there was regular farm, which had about 50 or 60 young people, all foreign -- foreigners -- foreign Jews, who lived there in what -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: This is tape three, side B, continuing the interview with Max Leibmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">ML: Yeah, the -- the -- this facility was run by a French chemist and two rabbis who had managed to get from the -- the camp where I was in Gurs, to this farm.</span> <span id="s1489">And unfortunately for me, it was an orthodox -- it was run along very Orthodox lines.</span> <span id="s1490">The chemist, a -- a Frederick Hammer -- or Hamel was Orthodox, as were the rabbis.</span> <span id="s1491">So I was in this farm August, September, about three weeks, four weeks.</span> <span id="s1492">Were -- were -- how long was I in Tareai, three or four weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">ML: Yeah, about.</span> <span id="s1495">And my wife came by.</span> <span id="s1496">She had been -- obtained permission, and you heard the story from her and on her way down to -- to Gurs to visit her mother, she -- we saw each other and then she came on the way back again, to tell me what had happened in Gurs.</span> <span id="s1497">And at that time, we arranged that should I get into trouble, for whatever reason, I should try to get up to her village, because while she didn’t know what was really going on there, she felt they would help.</span> <span id="s1498">Little did I know that I would run -- within the week after she had left, into the worst kind of religious bias you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1499">There was one Friday evening for the Shabbas meal, an announcement that on such and such a date, a week from now, there will be a raid on the farm, but don’t worry, we’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1500">Only when the ta -- the time came to take care of us and to distribute us, to hide us, there was room for everybody but four of us.</span> <span id="s1501">A fellow who came with me from Gurs and two young Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1502">We were the four non-religious ones and for us we couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1503">You’re on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Because you were not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">ML: Because we were not religious.</span> <span id="s1506">And so the young fellow was much yo -- was a few years younger than I and I -- I said to him, “I’m going to join Hanne or to try to find Hanne,” and so the next morning we set out and went up to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s1507">We arrived at -- Hanne had told me how to get there, so that was not a problem.</span> <span id="s1508">And the problem was that in -- I arrived there in the middle of the night, it was at 10 or 11 o’clock, now where am I going to find my girlfriend?</span> <span id="s1509">So we came somewhere, which turned out later to be a tennis court, in -- in -- in what looked to us like a wood and we both had sleeping bags and the next morning we got up at -- at daybreak.</span> <span id="s1510">And lo and behold, shortly thereafter, we heard girl’s voices.</span> <span id="s1511">There was a group of girls passing by.</span> <span id="s1512">Amongst them Hanne.</span> <span id="s1513">They had camped out from where they normally slept to avoid arrest in a possible, potential rape -- ah, raid.</span> <span id="s1514">So we -- she -- my -- Hanne took me to Madame Philip.</span> <span id="s1515">Madame Philip was the wife of what was after the war the first Finance Minister -- Minister in DeGaulle’s cabinet after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1516">At the time she took me there, Madame Philip was alone because her husband was already in England with DeGaulle.</span> <span id="s1517">And from what I understand, Hanne was asked, “Can we trust him?”</span> <span id="s1518">So she explained that, “Yeah, he is my boyfriend, he comes from Gurs like I did,” and th-they put me up for the next night in the villa.</span> <span id="s1519">People were very nice, they fed me.</span> <span id="s1520">And the following evening, I was taken to a farm somewhere in the outreaches of Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s1521">I don’t know to -- to this day the name of the farm family who took me in.</span> <span id="s1522">These farm houses are very small.</span> <span id="s1523">They had -- this farm house had only two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1524">So the farmer put me up in the grange.</span> <span id="s1525">So I was sleeping in the hayloft.</span> <span id="s1526">And the man was very practical, the first thing he did was, he took his saw and he cut a hole into the floor and the other end from the -- of the hayloft, so that I had a toilet.</span> <span id="s1527">This -- the -- below where he cut the hole, were the animals.</span> <span id="s1528">So this was my toilet.</span> <span id="s1529">And I was there -- must have been there about two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1530">And I thought already they had forgotten me.</span> <span id="s1531">I co -- was well fed.</span> <span id="s1532">I ate the same food the farmer ate and this gave me some of the vigor back, which I needed when the underground -- the resistance movement in -- in the village when I came back, helped me to get out of France and into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1533">Now, I have details is -- in -- in the video for a -- for a long time.</span> <span id="s1534">We were given false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Before you go onto that, at this time, y -- did you know -- first of all, did you know where Hanne was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">ML: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: And did you have any sense of how often these raids would come [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">ML: No, we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1539">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1540">Hanne was somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: You -- you had to stay hidden the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">ML: I was hidden two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1543">And -- but they took me back.</span> <span id="s1544">The first thing they did is they photographed me.</span> <span id="s1545">They explained to me, “We will get you false papers now and then we will help you to escape to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s1546">And I think there were four of us who went to -- who were helped escape to Switzerland, I think we were the first group, because we went by railroad from Le Chambon to a village in the French Alps.</span> <span id="s1547">I believe it was a sta -- I don’t remember the station where we went to, but I believe it was the station one station before Seshaway, which to this day is a major vacation point in -- in the French Alps.</span> <span id="s1548">And there there was a 10 year old who picked us up.</span> <span id="s1549">He knew we were coming apparently, his father sent him.</span> <span id="s1550">He took us to the house of his father, where we stayed overnight and we met there also a young, French pastor who would go with us part of the way the next day, because he was supposed to learn how to get people across into the mountains and into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1551">He didn’t know the way, he’d never done it.</span> <span id="s1552">So the next morning, early on, we had breakfast and we set off, into the mountains.</span> <span id="s1553">Our guide was a 10 year old.</span> <span id="s1554">And we climbed all day.</span> <span id="s1555">Became night and it started to rain and we f -- and we found, fortunately an overhang of rock where we could duck under and that’s where we spent the night, fairly dry because it was big enough through -- to be not in the open.</span> <span id="s1556">The next morning at daybreak we started again.</span> <span id="s1557">And we climbed most of the morning.</span> <span id="s1558">And then around 12 o’clock the boy stopped and said to us, “Now look.</span> <span id="s1559">You go down here.”</span> <span id="s1560">Now, you must understand, we were very high in the mountain, well above the tree line, there was nothing but rock, was totally open.</span> <span id="s1561">There was nothing but rock and we had to climb to get down there, which was a tough job, because we didn’t have the right or proper equi -- no -- we had no equipment and not the proper shoes.</span> <span id="s1562">And my shoes went to [indecipherable] in about an hour or two as we were going down these rocks.</span> <span id="s1563">And fortunately somebody had another pair of shoes which fitted me, otherwise I would not have made it.</span> <span id="s1564">And so we climbed pretty much the whole afternoon.</span> <span id="s1565">We were about at 12,00 feet, we had to come down.</span> <span id="s1566">And so eventually we ended up on a small -- on a road which was driveable by a car, was narrow.</span> <span id="s1567">And we walked and we came to a tunnel and all of a sudden we heard steps behind us, halt.</span> <span id="s1568">And whom did we face when we turned around and looked?</span> <span id="s1569">A f -- a Swiss military patrol, who told us we have been following you for hours with our binoc-binoculars.</span> <span id="s1570">They took us to a mountain hut.</span> <span id="s1571">Switzerland has -- we have it here too in the mountains, a -- a -- a facility which is quite primitive, but where there are dormitories where you can sleep.</span> <span id="s1572">Where you can get some food and that’s where they took us, that was a command post.</span> <span id="s1573">And we found when we got there that there were about 30 or 40 people which have been caught in -- over the last 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1574">So we were able to buy -- buy some food, even though we had no rationing c-coupons and swi -- Switzerland was strictly rationed.</span> <span id="s1575">And breakfast the next morning the same way, I still had just enough money to buy breakfast and this -- the commander of this platoon of soldiers told us we are going to be returned to France.</span> <span id="s1576">You’re not going to permitted to come in.</span> <span id="s1577">And so we started up -- back up into the mountains, to a point which was called no man’s land, it was between France -- between Switzerland and France.</span> <span id="s1578">But on the way up the mountain, something very strange happened and that was a non-commissioned officer of this platoon, started to -- to speak to me or yell at me in a very loud voice.</span> <span id="s1579">And he enumerated very clearly what I am not supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1580">I am not supposed to come back to fr -- to -- to Switzerland, I’m not supposed to do this, I’m not supposed to do that, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1581">It went on for about five or eight minutes and it dawned on me after a -- a few minutes that that man is giving you a message, what is that message?</span> <span id="s1582">And the message was -- he didn’t say so, but what was really happening is, that if I took out the don’t, I had been instructed how to get back to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1583">So when the platoon stopped and told us, “Now you go down there and we go back and don’t you dare to come back.”</span> <span id="s1584">We went on further down and when I was sure that they couldn’t see us any more, I stopped the whole group and explained to them what had happened there.</span> <span id="s1585">There were 40 people, I was one of the youngest.</span> <span id="s1586">And nobody understood what was happening -- going on.</span> <span id="s1587">They all heard the same thing, you know, the man that was speaking loud enough that you couldn’t miss it.</span> <span id="s1588">And so we -- we spoke, we argued, we discu-cussed this for half an hour.</span> <span id="s1589">I finally found one guy who fol -- who understood my argument.</span> <span id="s1590">We have nothing to lose, we can only gain.</span> <span id="s1591">If we make it, we can -- we will be in Switzerland and we’ll be safe.</span> <span id="s1592">If we don’t make it, we have lost the day.</span> <span id="s1593">So I went back, toward Switzerland, I had -- I -- I looked at the map in this mountain facility and I knew approximately where I was.</span> <span id="s1594">And lo and behold, we found our way and we came out on a -- in a village in Farro.</span> <span id="s1595">And, when we left Chambon, we were given ins --explanations that we should find Protestant ministers.</span> <span id="s1596">If you can’t find the Protestant minister, go to the Catholic local priest.</span> <span id="s1597">So I went to the church.</span> <span id="s1598">Yarma -- the moush -- the -- and I was told by the housekeeper, “He is down in the villa -- in the valley.</span> <span id="s1599">He is not here today.”</span> <span id="s1600">So we went down, because I didn’t want to stay there overnight, it was too big.</span> <span id="s1601">And eventually, as it became dark, we came into -- I don’t know if it was a village.</span> <span id="s1602">There were some houses along the -- the -- the way where we walked and I picked one because I didn’t want to stay out overnight.</span> <span id="s1603">Besides, we had no food and my sugar was running out, which was what sustained me on the way up the mountain and down the mountain.</span> <span id="s1604">So I knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s1605">They took me -- they took us in.</span> <span id="s1606">We explained we are refugees.</span> <span id="s1607">They took us in, they fed us, they gave us a bed.</span> <span id="s1608">They gave us breakfast the next morning and they explained to us where to go and where not to go.</span> <span id="s1609">For instance these people told -- were nice enough to tell us not to go to the next big village because it was a big military assembly point and there would be a lot of military police who would stop us.</span> <span id="s1610">So we went to the next village, all the way down into the -- into the Rhone Valley, where, since I had no more -- I had no more Swiss money, we went to the -- we went to the local Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s1611">He fed us and he gave me enough money to buy a train ticket to Lausanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: You were traveling by yourself at this point, or still with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">ML: No, I was -- had -- this -- with this other fellow.</span> <span id="s1614">And so he cautioned us, “Don’t go into an express train, because the express trains are being patrolled by a military police.”</span> <span id="s1615">So we took a local train, it wasn’t that far, into Lausanne and in Lausanne I went -- after some moments of hesitation, I didn’t know where to go, I said to myself, “You are a Jew, go to the Jewish congregation.”</span> <span id="s1616">There I went to a telephone, looked up the address of the Jewish congregation of Lausanne, which was -- which happened to be within half a block of the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1617">And then we went there and when we explained to them that we -- we are refugees, just came into Switzerland, they told us, “Look, welcome to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1618">We have to turn you over to the military, but we can promise you that you will not be returned anywhere.”</span> <span id="s1619">We didn’t tell them that we were already once returned.</span> <span id="s1620">And this is how I got first into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1621">So, they picked the -- somebody came with a car, I think and picked us up and took us to one barrack in the park in -- in -- in a suburb of Lausanne, where we spent the night.</span> <span id="s1622">We were interrogated there.</span> <span id="s1623">And fortunately the interrogator was a Swiss -- a Swiss speaking fren -- a French speaking Swiss -- Switzer -- Swiss military who did not understand German, so I translated for the other guy, who didn’t speak French -- for my companion.</span> <span id="s1624">And I translated the way I wanted to translate, not what he necessarily had said.</span> <span id="s1625">And from there we were taken to a so-called quarantine camp in Moudon, which was a very primitive set up in the school, where we were in the gymnastic hall, where they had set up some kind of possibility to sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s1626">And there we had to fill out a questionnaire of 36 or 40 pages.</span> <span id="s1627">And eventually -- by the way, I arrived in -- in Switzerland on September 22nd, 1942.</span> <span id="s1628">And eventually I was transferred -- not with the fellow I came with, I was transferred -- because, after all, since there was at one time an application made for a visa for me to come to Switzerland, they were able to establish who I was very rapidly.</span> <span id="s1629">And the -- I was transferred to a -- another quarantine camp the other end of Switzerland in the Cantone of Appensel.</span> <span id="s1630">We were -- were quartered, I believe in a village inn -- again in the ballroom, which was set up as a -- a -- a quarter where you could sleep, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1631">And there we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: Okay, when you say quarantine, do you -- were these -- were these like DP camps, were they interment camps?</span> <span id="s1633">Were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">ML: No, no.</span> <span id="s1635">That was -- everything in quarantine was military control.</span> <span id="s1636">We were guarded by military personnel and this is the first -- where we first -- and everything in Mouton where I was and then in Appensel, this was military control.</span> <span id="s1637">Everything was military.</span> <span id="s1638">Btu the military -- that was now German Swiss, not French Swiss any more, they took us out every day on a walk.</span> <span id="s1639">With the gun -- bayonet on the gun, you know.</span> <span id="s1640">And we started an argument with the company commander or the platoon commander -- we explained to him there is absolutely no reason to guard us with guns, because where does he think we can go?</span> <span id="s1641">Does he think we are escaping Germany or escaping elsewhere?</span> <span id="s1642">We cannot go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1643">So w-we eventually prevailed and this -- the Swiss soldiers walked with us, without any arms.</span> <span id="s1644">On December 22nd, I was handed a ticket -- a railroad ticket to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1645">Again it’s the French part of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1646">All alone.</span> <span id="s1647">And I want to emphasize this because there was -- there was all kind of ouhaha about how badly we were treated in -- in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1648">Even the quarantine camps never had barbed wire or anything of this nature.</span> <span id="s1649">Yes, in the -- in -- in the quarantine camp we were guarded by -- by Swiss troops.</span> <span id="s1650">But I was given, when I -- when I was transferred to a labor camp, I was given a ticket, go there, alone.</span> <span id="s1651">I went s-strictly on my own.</span> <span id="s1652">There was nobody with me.</span> <span id="s1653">I was the only guy who was transferred on that day.</span> <span id="s1654">And when I arrived in the afternoon in this labor camp, the director of this camp looked at me like if I’m a ghost.</span> <span id="s1655">“What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1656">It was the 22nd of December, the camp was closed.</span> <span id="s1657">There was not a soul in the camp besides the camp director, who had a ba -- a military barrack, which was outfitted as an apartment, where he lived with his wife and his daughter.</span> <span id="s1658">Everybody else was on leave.</span> <span id="s1659">So the next question was, “Do you have relatives here?</span> <span id="s1660">Can you go somewhere?”</span> <span id="s1661">I said, “Yes, I have a cousin.”</span> <span id="s1662">So I called my cousin and he said, “All right, come on.”</span> <span id="s1663">So I was handed another ticket and I was told, you be back on such and such a day, the day after Christmas.</span> <span id="s1664">And I went right back, practically the way I came from, because I was in Appensel, and my cousin lived in -- in s -- in a -- in a village in Saint Garron.</span> <span id="s1665">So I spent Christmas 1942 with my cousin, who was married to a Gentile woman and then I started my career in the Swiss labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Now at that point, did you entertain thoughts about not reporting to the -- to the labor camp?</span> <span id="s1667">Did you have any sense of what the labor camp would be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">ML: I had no sense of anything and where would I go?</span> <span id="s1669">Where should I have gone?</span> <span id="s1670">Switzerland is a small country, you can’t hide.</span> <span id="s1671">You know, I mean it would have been futile.</span> <span id="s1672">Never occurred to me, either.</span> <span id="s1673">I mean, you know, if you were brought up in Germany, you thought like a German in th -- in that you follow orders.</span> <span id="s1674">So I went back to the labor camp and by the time I came back there was a few feet of snow.</span> <span id="s1675">And the first thing we as -- we are supposed to do is clean the access road from the highway to the camp.</span> <span id="s1676">The camp was in Seeare and it was -- oh, maybe a mile and a half or two miles to the access road, which you walked and then you walked the access road to the camp.</span> <span id="s1677">The camp was put there in order to clear land.</span> <span id="s1678">But the first thing of course we had to do is clear the access road.</span> <span id="s1679">And I didn’t like that kind of physical work, so I made it my business to get into the office within a week.</span> <span id="s1680">And now, let me explain, the labor camp had barracks -- had military barracks.</span> <span id="s1681">They were no better, they were no worse, they were identical military barracks which were used by the Swiss military.</span> <span id="s1682">We had barracks which had bunk beds and we were given mattresses, I don’t remember with what they were filled, but we had ma-mattresses.</span> <span id="s1683">It was a two-tiered affair, you slept either high or low and there was a barrack for -- for dining.</span> <span id="s1684">There was a latrine.</span> <span id="s1685">There was an office barrack.</span> <span id="s1686">There was another barrack where there was a sick room -- a sick bay where the Swiss personnel who helped run the camp lived -- I think we had one or two people in addition to the camp director.</span> <span id="s1687">But there was not a single guard.</span> <span id="s1688">And there was, of course, no barbed wire anywhere.</span> <span id="s1689">It was open.</span> <span id="s1690">And in fact something very funny happened along the way.</span> <span id="s1691">In the morning you made a count.</span> <span id="s1692">So one day -- I was already long in the office, we made a count, everything s-seemed fine and we reported by telephone that everything is in order and within 20 or 30 minutes -- there -- there was a central office in Zurich which ran this -- all of these facilities around Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1693">We got a call back.</span> <span id="s1694">“How come you reported everybody is there, when we are holding a guy who belongs to you?”</span> <span id="s1695">What had happened was, that we had, apparently, a homosexual whose -- whose companion was somewhere in Zurich and he had gone to Zurich without our knowing.</span> <span id="s1696">And the -- my -- the man who was in charge of counting missed him.</span> <span id="s1697">He miscounted.</span> <span id="s1698">I mean nothing happened, but I mean, you know, they had caught him somehow.</span> <span id="s1699">We would never have known.</span> <span id="s1700">I was in this camp quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1701">I don -- I don’t have the exact dates any more, you can look them up.</span> <span id="s1702">The museum has my so-called Swiss identification book, where all the camps are listed and where -- you know, where -- it was ended when I was issued some shoe coupons or some shoes or whatever, clothing, because all that was rationed.</span> <span id="s1703">And eventually, once you are in these camp offices long enough, you know you are -- there are -- there is a three tiered payments -- by the way we were, in these camps [indecipherable] all Swiss internment facilities was [indecipherable] refugees.</span> <span id="s1704">There was number one, a thr -- a three tiered payment system.</span> <span id="s1705">There was rank and file, then there were two classes above, you know, supervisors above, who were paid somewhat more.</span> <span id="s1706">I mean, the maximum you could earn there was four francs a day.</span> <span id="s1707">And eventually I became on level up, and then I became two level up and I was very -- transferred a number of times from -- out of camp into so-called refugee homes, where I was running the office.</span> <span id="s1708">Because there was a lot of work in these -- in the offices, because everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s1709">You had to account for every meal, you had to account for every presence.</span> <span id="s1710">And that had to be done on the typewriter, that was a job you had to learn.</span> <span id="s1711">And there were all kinds of things to be done, so I was busy all day long in the offices.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: So the way you describe it, that there were no guards --</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">ML: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: You were getting paid, although a small amount --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: How was it different from maybe just having had a job?</span> <span id="s1717">I mean why -- what -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">ML: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: What made it feel like a labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">ML: Number one, in the labor camp you did physical work, or if you were in these refugee homes, the homes had to be maintained.</span> <span id="s1721">So I happened to be in the office, but the other people -- there were people that were working the kitchens, there were people who had to clean the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Were they -- were there bad conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">ML: No, there were no bad conditions.</span> <span id="s1724">Number one, in all of these facilities, every six weeks, we were entitled to a pass.</span> <span id="s1725">We would get a free railroad ticket anywhere you wanted to go, if you had some money to go, but the railroad ticket was free.</span> <span id="s1726">You had your pocket money.</span> <span id="s1727">The food was not luxurious and not -- not gourmet food, but it was totally adequate.</span> <span id="s1728">I mean you weren’t hungry.</span> <span id="s1729">Not withstanding what many people claim, that they were hungry.</span> <span id="s1730">There was always enough food.</span> <span id="s1731">There were some facilities who had Swiss personnel who stank.</span> <span id="s1732">Meaning mostly small, petty people who took their power out on -- you know, they felt the power of being a director of a camp and these lousy refugees now are going to do what I tell them to do.</span> <span id="s1733">And they made life -- could make life quite miserable.</span> <span id="s1734">There were some rotten apples among the Swiss personnel, there’s no question about.</span> <span id="s1735">As we had rotten apples among us.</span> <span id="s1736">I encountered some of these people.</span> <span id="s1737">But by and large, these facilities were adequate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Who was in the facilities?</span> <span id="s1739">Who were -- who were in the [indecipherable] was it mostly Jews, was it many refugees --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">ML: Th-Th-There were mostly Jews, but we were in some facilities later on, after I was married, where we had Gentile political refugees.</span> <span id="s1741">For instance, in the labor camp, we had a German doctor who was a political refugee.</span> <span id="s1742">And in fact, I got sick.</span> <span id="s1743">I had hepatitis and this man absolutely did not want me to go in the hospital because he didn’t trust the Swiss, that they would feed me properly, because I had to be on a diet.</span> <span id="s1744">In those days, you know, I could -- no -- ee -- I didn’t get any meat.</span> <span id="s1745">I was permitted bread, I was permitted a jam, I was permitted some cheese and liquids.</span> <span id="s1746">And he didn’t trust them to give me what I should have gotten because of rationing.</span> <span id="s1747">So, in the camp, it doesn’t matter if one person gets more from one thing and less from something else, so he kept me for two or three weeks in the sick bay, until was able -- until I was recovering and could back -- go back to work.</span> <span id="s1748">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Tell me how -- how you got back in touch with Hanne and how [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">ML: Well, look, once I was in Switzerland, Hanne and I corresponded.</span> <span id="s1751">And eventually Hanne came to Switzerland and even though that was the only time I ever had an extra sensory perception.</span> <span id="s1752">I knew that she was coming.</span> <span id="s1753">And then eventually she either called or wrote, “I’m with my relatives.”</span> <span id="s1754">And from then on, we were in regular contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: It -- it seems like it would have been difficult just to -- for her letters to find you and -- and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">ML: No, she knew where I was.</span> <span id="s1757">I wrote her immediately when I got to -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Okay, this is tape four, side A, we’re continuing the interview with Max Leibmann.</span> <span id="s1759">You -- we were just talking about getting back in touch with Hanne once you were in Switzerland in the labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">ML: That was not a problem, because we corresponded already when I was in the camp and she was still in France.</span> <span id="s1761">And the mail worked miraculously, quite well.</span> <span id="s1762">And once she was in -- in -- in Switzerland, I saw her every six weeks.</span> <span id="s1763">And now, you want me to go through this again, with -- with a -- all of it, because this is all on the [indecipherable] tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Yeah, well maybe -- let’s move ahead to what happened when -- when the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">ML: When the war was over, that was very simple.</span> <span id="s1766">We had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1767">We di -- we knew we didn’t want to go back to Germany, even though, I don’t know if Hanne mentioned that in her tape, I was released from the facility I was in, to participate in the social service course in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1768">And while I was in Geneva, one day, I was contacted by a -- a Mr. Bauer.</span> <span id="s1769">He would like to meet with Hanne and me -- we were not married yet, but Hanne happened to be in Geneva already and I was in Geneva, so he invited us one afternoon for a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s1770">And that was very in -- a very interesting conversation.</span> <span id="s1771">The -- I di -- wasn’t quite sure if the man was a left wing Socialist, or if he was really a Communist.</span> <span id="s1772">But the purpose of the conversation was to try to entice us to go back to Germany when the war was over, because it would people -- it wou -- they would need people like us to start building and by go-going back to Germany -- he meant East Germany and this was -- became a very interesting conversation, because I told him I am not interested in going to East Germany when the Soviets have camps like the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1773">I’m mentioning this simply because years and years later, while we were here already for a long time, we saw an obituary for this man, who had -- who was with the Russians eventually, who got into trouble with them, was sent to Siberia, which I mentioned to him, you know, I don’t want to be involved with a government which has Siberian labor camps, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1774">Was eventually released or exchanged, became a -- an aide to Mr. Willie Brunt, who was then the Chancellor of Germany.</span> <span id="s1775">And when he died, we discovered in the obituary that he was the man that we talked to.</span> <span id="s1776">And whatever I told him about the Russians, happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Wh-What was his name?</span> <span id="s1778">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">ML: Bauer.</span> <span id="s1780">I don’t know his first name.</span> <span id="s1781">So that was -- and after I finished his soci -- service calls, I went back to internment.</span> <span id="s1782">We got married at the same time in Geneva and then Hanne joined me in -- in camp.</span> <span id="s1783">I got permission to -- she got permission to come with me into camp, for which we had to pay, by the way.</span> <span id="s1784">They charged me the same amount of what the Swiss personnel had to pay.</span> <span id="s1785">And so we were in -- in Switzerland until we were able to obtain an -- an affidavit to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: What were the interment camps like at that point, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">ML: They had not changed.</span> <span id="s1788">That was -- we were -- I was not in a camp, I was in a home for families.</span> <span id="s1789">And these homes had not sh -- that were -- has not -- they did not change because the war ended.</span> <span id="s1790">As e -- maybe the conditions were slightly more friendly from -- from the top down, meaning from the government on down, but all they wanted in -- wanted us to do was get out.</span> <span id="s1791">The sooner the better.</span> <span id="s1792">In fact, I had a cousin in Switzerland, same cousin where I was when I first came, who would have loved to have me in his factory, to run the inside, so that he could go out and sell on the outside and this -- we ran into so much trouble with this that I decide -- that we decided it’s not worth to pursue and we are going to America, since we had a visa.</span> <span id="s1793">We had an affidavit and we are able to get the visa.</span> <span id="s1794">When we started to look at this, could we stay in Switzerland, the federal government said, “If the cantone government will accept you, it’s fine by us.”</span> <span id="s1795">The -- the cantone government said, “We are -- you are welcome to stay here if the local government will accept you and give you permission to stay.”</span> <span id="s1796">The local government said, “If the cant-cantone government says yes, we will say,” so it was a constant back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">HL: Catch 22, I told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">ML: Catch 22 and so we decided, to hell with it, we come here to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Were there other place you considered going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">ML: No, we had nowhere to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">HL: Well, excuse me, we were talking about Israel [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">ML: We were talking about Israel, but this was another sore point.</span> <span id="s1803">My parents -- I had an -- an uncle and an aunt who went in 1934 already, to what was then Palestine, with money.</span> <span id="s1804">They left Germany at the time because they -- their money basically was in Holland.</span> <span id="s1805">My -- my uncle was a -- a representative of Dutch tobacco firms.</span> <span id="s1806">And you know in -- in Germany one smoked cigars from here to doomsday, so he sold a lot of cigars and he also sold -- had a representation of a manufacturer of cigar boxes, which gave him such a nice income that the tobacco money stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s1807">And when the Germans pressured him to bring the money in from Holland because they need the foreign exchange, they emigrated to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1808">So in 1930 -- the end of 1938, my parents asked my uncle to take me to Palestine, so that I could go to the conservatory in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1809">And my uncle felt that he couldn’t take this responsibility, he didn’t have enough money and God knows what else.</span> <span id="s1810">So, as far as I was concerned, Israel, after the war was not an option.</span> <span id="s1811">I wasn’t interested.</span> <span id="s1812">So eventually we were obtaining -- we were able to get a -- somebody gave us an affidavit and we came here.</span> <span id="s1813">So we arrived here on March the third, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: Do you remember when you first got here, what -- what you -- what you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">ML: Well, it was, you know, we had to -- it was a strange country.</span> <span id="s1816">And we came with a t -- a two year old child, our daughter.</span> <span id="s1817">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">HL: What did we feel when we came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">ML: Bewildered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">HL: Bewildered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: I sh -- I wonder if you can move over a little bit, or -- and I could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">HL: I would say we were somewhat bewildered, maybe also the feelings that we had -- okay -- we were somewhat bewildered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">ML: Don’t forget --</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">HL: Also maybe the feeling that we’re finally at a place that’s going to be permanent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">ML: And not only this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">HL: That we’re not going to be chased from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">ML: And not only this, but it was also the first time that we were free.</span> <span id="s1828">Because, don’t forget, we were not free in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1829">This is something most people don’t want to understand.</span> <span id="s1830">We were internees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">HL: I mean, we -- in many homes is -- in most of the homes, life in the Swiss refugee homes and camps, it was bearable, okay?</span> <span id="s1832">Nobody expected any luxuries or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1833">We were satisfied with having a roof over our heads, a bed to sleep on a -- or sleep in and to have food in our stomachs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">ML: And, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">HL: We -- we didn’t demand anything, we didn’t expect anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">ML: And on weekends, you know, aside from going every six weeks, having leave for two or three days, on weekends we could go to the villages and based on my position, I was free in the offices, I was free to go -- to -- out any time I wanted to go out.</span> <span id="s1837">I didn’t even ha -- I didn’t have to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">HL: But Max, we could do that in Taratae as well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">ML: Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">HL: -- as long as you had done your -- your work or whatever your assignment was.</span> <span id="s1841">Nobody asked where you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">ML: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">HL: -- during the day.</span> <span id="s1844">You could go -- but still, you were not free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">ML: You were not free.</span> <span id="s1846">You had a reg -- you had a regulated life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">HL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">ML: Regulated by somebody other than yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">HL: You knew you were not -- you were not free and you knew you weren’t free.</span> <span id="s1850">And coming here was the first time since 1940 that we were free people.</span> <span id="s1851">So all of it was rather overwhelming and then of course comes the immediate worry.</span> <span id="s1852">Now what are you going to do, how are you going to support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">ML: We came here with 90 dollars and we were three people.</span> <span id="s1854">And the family had provided us with one week of -- of paid facility in the Steven Weiss house.</span> <span id="s1855">Rabbi Steven Weiss ran a house where refugees like us would stay for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">HL: For more, except that we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">ML: Fo -- We’d --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">HL: Because of the Hiyas or whoever it was at the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">HL: Told us we have to get out of there and go to the Hotel Marseilles --</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">HL: -- which they were running, in order to get any help, which eventually they didn’t give us anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">ML: There was no help and besides, within a week, I had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">HL: 10 days [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">ML: Within 10 days I had a job and I started to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Will you tell me about your first job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">ML: First job was f -- f -- with an --</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">HL: Import [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">ML: Import - export outfit and I worked in the office.</span> <span id="s1870">I didn’t know anything, my English was limited.</span> <span id="s1871">And I didn’t last there very long, they fired me pretty soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">HL: Uh-uh, you got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">ML: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">HL: That’s why they fired you.</span> <span id="s1875">You got sick with your knee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">ML: I’m -- I got sick with -- I had a problem with my knee, I couldn’t walk, so they fired me.</span> <span id="s1877">And I was in bed, I think 10 days or two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">HL: Whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">ML: Then I got another job.</span> <span id="s1880">And from then on I worked.</span> <span id="s1881">Until of course, in 19 -- in November of 1950, I got sick like my wife with TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">HL: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">ML: 50, that’s what I said.</span> <span id="s1884">I said ‘50.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">HL: Okay, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">ML: I -- I got sick in November of 1950 with TB and our daughter had to go to a foster home and we went into a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1887">And I was in there I think 18 months and my wife was in there 21 months.</span> <span id="s1888">And when I came out, I was on what was called half-time, meaning I had a work tolerance, supposedly, of four hours.</span> <span id="s1889">And we were not supposed to do more, because it -- one feared of a breakdown, that you would get sick again.</span> <span id="s1890">And at that time, the state of New York had a program where people who had TB could be retrained.</span> <span id="s1891">Now, th-this program I was able to go to a commercial school where, in how many months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">HL: Nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">ML: Nine months.</span> <span id="s1894">I took four years of college accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">HL: I thought it was two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">ML: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">HL: Four.</span> <span id="s1898">Sorry.</span> <span id="s1899">I underestimated your capabilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">ML: I took four years of college accounting and after that I had a profession.</span> <span id="s1901">And I started to work as a bookkeeper, you know, cut my teeth on this.</span> <span id="s1902">And from then on I worked, either as a bookkeeper, then an office manager, then controller -- in various jobs.</span> <span id="s1903">My last job was with a greeting card company - a national greeting card company, which was a public company where I was controller and vice president of operations in a -- in a division in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Tell -- tell me more about life in New York.</span> <span id="s1905">You -- I -- I know that you -- they had offered -- they wanted you to go -- to move to Iowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">ML: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1907">Not Iowa, Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Illinois, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">ML: They wa -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1910">And so when I was there -- when we went down to the Hiyas, they said, “Why don’t you go,” -- or it was Neeyana, I don’t know which wa -- one of these organizations who took care of new -- newly arrived refugees.</span> <span id="s1911">They said to me, “Maybe you should go to Peoria, Illinois.”</span> <span id="s1912">I said, “Who, what?”</span> <span id="s1913">And when I started to ask and who’s going to pay for it, they said, “Of course, your relatives.</span> <span id="s1914">We don’t have money.”</span> <span id="s1915">So I said, “Forget it.”</span> <span id="s1916">And then we walked out and I had my jo -- I had a job and this is how I started to work.</span> <span id="s1917">You know, you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">HL: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">ML: I -- I -- I mean the job I had was just enough to get by and the next job was a little better, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1920">So, you know, you eventually work yourself up.</span> <span id="s1921">And after we got sick and we got out, we went on welfare, until I was out of school.</span> <span id="s1922">First I was alone for three months and my wife came.</span> <span id="s1923">And then of course the o -- the only thing we had in mind was to get started to work again and so that we could take our daughter back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">HL: Well, it was also dependent on having an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">ML: Yeah, and we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1926">We had no apartment, we had no furniture, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1927">So the first thing we did is -- we got -- when I was permitted to work, I got a job and we lived in a city housing project.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">HL: Well, after the government just gave us [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1929">This I mentioned before, after the government gave us dispensation so we could move into public housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">ML: And the federal -- there happened to be a federal facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">HL: A federal housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">ML: In fort -- for housing, in Fort Green, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1933">With -- I started to work, I was working.</span> <span id="s1934">We were able to buy some furniture and but soon after I started working, I reached the upper limit of low income housing and Fort Green was low income housing, which meant we had to move.</span> <span id="s1935">So we moved into a so-called middle income housing in Astoria, which was a very nice apartment and our daughter started, I think s-school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">HL: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">ML: No, she start --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">HL: She went to school in Fort Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">ML: She went to school in Fort Green and then we -- when we moved, she went to school in Astoria.</span> <span id="s1940">And eventually, I think it was time for us to get out of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">HL: Public housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">ML: -- public housing, because the income was bigger than was ac-acceptable.</span> <span id="s1943">So we bought a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">HL: A co-op.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">ML: A co-op apartment in Jackson Heights.</span> <span id="s1946">And we lived there I think some 17 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">HL: 18 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">ML: 18 years.</span> <span id="s1949">In the meantime I [indecipherable] in my job and after 18 years, my wife wanted a house, which we should have bought much before, in -- in -- when we moved out of public housing, we bought a co-op, which was very cheap and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Do -- do -- do you want to hold on for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Okay, we’re back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">HL: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">ML: We have one, besides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: We’re back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">ML: Can we play back one minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Just to remind where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">ML: Yeah, where we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: [indecipherable] talking about buying a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">ML: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1961">So eventually, it became time to buy a house and we started to really scout around.</span> <span id="s1962">That was 22 years ago and you know, when you buy a house -- when you buy a house the first time, you have all kinds of ideas what you want and slowly, as you start shopping, you know what you don’t want.</span> <span id="s1963">So y-you go by elimination til you find something which you think is suitable.</span> <span id="s1964">So we ended up here, where we are now.</span> <span id="s1965">That was 22 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">HL: It’s 23 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">ML: 23 years that we have the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: So, we’ve talked -- Hanne and I have talked a little bit about just how your experiences during the war have sort of affected maybe the -- the -- the type of parents you’ve been and the type of people you’ve been in terms of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">ML: Well, look, we’ve --</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: -- and the kind of choices you’ve made.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">ML: We tried not to get our daughter into the refugee atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1972">We did not speak too much about where we were and what we have -- wh-what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">HL: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">ML: -- and we did not -- we did not, like many did, give her a guilt complex.</span> <span id="s1975">It was difficult enough for her to have been away from us while we were sick and that bothered her tremendously and eventually she needed psychiatric help -- much later, in order to get out of all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">HL: W-We tried not to -- really, as I mentioned, to make her think she has to do this or that because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">ML: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">HL: -- of what happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">ML: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1980">That we did not do.</span> <span id="s1981">In fact --</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">HL: We did not put this on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">ML: We did not put this on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">HL: She always knew the story, because she heard us speak about it -- she heard us speak about to my aunts and to other people, but we didn’t say you have to do this or that because.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">ML: And besides, until we discovered, in 1983 that we are considered Holocaust survivors, we really didn’t consider ourselves as such, simply because we always were under the impression that Holocaust survivors are only those who were in the east.</span> <span id="s1986">We were not in the east, we were on the west.</span> <span id="s1987">Even though we were deported, we were in camps, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1988">And in 1983 was also the time when we got involved with the Holocaust in some shape, form or manner.</span> <span id="s1989">We were invited to a -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">HL: Yeah, we were invited to a -- to an affair.</span> <span id="s1991">However, our involvement in all of this, started with the publication of a book, entitled “Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed.”</span> <span id="s1992">This book was written by Professor Hally, of the Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1993">And it dealt with Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s1994">And when I saw the book advertised in the book review, with a picture --</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">ML: It was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">HL: I said, “I know these people.”</span> <span id="s1997">ML: It was in the -- not the advertising, it was in the Time mag -- in Time magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">HL: In the book review --</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">HL: Of the New York Times, Max.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">ML: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">HL: Okay?</span> <span id="s2003">And I said, “I know these people.”</span> <span id="s2004">And so of course we bought the book and then I read it.</span> <span id="s2005">Then I wrote a letter to Professor Hally and this is how we slowly moved into this -- in this direction, because he used the letter that I wrote him and used it in many occasions in his lectures he gave or speeches he gave.</span> <span id="s2006">He then wanted us to come along with him repeatedly when he spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">ML: Which we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">HL: And so there was a slow progression of getting involved.</span> <span id="s2009">Our involvement with the museum in Washington came supposedly through the tape we made in 1990 -- ‘93, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">ML: [indecipherable] no, no, ‘90.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">HL: ‘90?</span> <span id="s2012">And Mr. Mead, apparently, the man who is in -- started or co-started the American gathering of Jewish Holocaust survivors, apparently saw the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">ML: He saw the tape in his capacity as a chairman of the contents committee of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s2014">This was before it was opened.</span> <span id="s2015">And then he contacted us and invited us to a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">HL: Fundraiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">ML: Fundraiser in Washington, to which we went.</span> <span id="s2018">We met with him and then he invited me to become a volunteer.</span> <span id="s2019">And eventually I did become a volunteer there and I’m there for the last seven and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Is there any reason why, before 1983 or before this -- this time period, that -- that you weren’t involved or maybe weren’t -- I mean, did you talk about it amongst -- amongst yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">HL: Ourselves to get involved, well our f -- as I mentioned, our first involvement came through the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">ML: Yeah, we looked -- we were, to start out with, busy making a living.</span> <span id="s2023">My wife worked, I worked.</span> <span id="s2024">Our daughter was growing up.</span> <span id="s2025">She eventually, in 1967 graduated -- no, in 1963 graduated high school and went to college.</span> <span id="s2026">So we were busy making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">HL: Just -- just like every -- just about everybody else, became really involved at the end of their career or when they retired.</span> <span id="s2028">Very few that were involved before that.</span> <span id="s2029">There were some, yes, like Mr. Chase in Connecticut who made an unbelievable amount of money in a very short time and was always involved from the beginning, helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">ML: He isn’t there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">HL: Well, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">ML: But I mean, you know, we were busy making a living and trying to li-li-live as normal a life as possible.</span> <span id="s2033">We have friends here, which go way ba -- fr -- on -- on both sides, for myself and for my wife.</span> <span id="s2034">Most of our friends -- our social friends -- I have music friends, that’s a different story, they are all mostly Americans.</span> <span id="s2035">But our social friends go back to our childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">HL: You see --</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Y-Your friend now and then, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">ML: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2040">The -- look -- bo -- some -- one of my friends I went to school with, started in second grade.</span> <span id="s2041">We are still friends.</span> <span id="s2042">Our wives got along when we came here, so we, you know, just continued.</span> <span id="s2043">There are people like this on -- on my wife’s side.</span> <span id="s2044">So, there was -- we have a -- a Gentile friend who once said to us, “You are an incestuous society.”</span> <span id="s2045">We mostly get together with -- with our friends from Germany and since I am working at the American gathering, of course, we have other -- we made other friends, which are all survivors.</span> <span id="s2046">And what was interesting is, I found when we talked for the first time to survivors, that in many things we thought alike.</span> <span id="s2047">We didn’t even know this.</span> <span id="s2048">And you know, survivors, m-mostly married survivors and -- like to congregate with survivors and speak about the times which were lousy and so slowly, you know, this is how this worked.</span> <span id="s2049">And when I retired and I ha -- I started to do a lot of music playing, but if you do a hobby on a -- on a daily basis, it soon becomes not a hobby and you are looking elsewhere, so when the opportunity came to -- to start working again, I said, “Yes, I will work.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">HL: On a volunteer basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">ML: On a volunteer basis, I said, “Yes, I will come one or two days.”</span> <span id="s2052">And on the first day I realized, I said, “I work full time or I don’t become a volunteer.”</span> <span id="s2053">Because there is nothing in between.</span> <span id="s2054">You -- I don’t -- didn’t want to s -- want to stuff envelopes and do things like this.</span> <span id="s2055">And that is what you do if you are a volunteer here and there.</span> <span id="s2056">So I started to work in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">HL: But you know, to come back to your question about our daughter.</span> <span id="s2058">When we first came here, we deliberately did not move up, let’s say, to the Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s2059">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">ML: A ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">HL: -- where all the German Jews had settled.</span> <span id="s2062">Like any immigrant [indecipherable] the Italians are in one place and the Jews are another place and the Irish are somewheres else.</span> <span id="s2063">We deliberately did not do that, because we felt that our daughter, growing up here in this country, has to know everybody, not just one group of people.</span> <span id="s2064">If I live in area where there are predominantly, let’s say German Jewish immigrants, the ch -- kids in school will be the offspring of these people.</span> <span id="s2065">So she is surrounded by the same atmosphere, right?</span> <span id="s2066">We did not want that for her.</span> <span id="s2067">We wanted her to grow up with everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">ML: As an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">HL: We still have our friends from Europe, we still have our friends from school days and even before, but I felt that she needed more than that.</span> <span id="s2070">She needed to know the whole spectrum of people and not just one group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">ML: And I mentioned before, very soon after I came out of the sanitorium, I started to play chamber music.</span> <span id="s2072">I played it -- I played [indecipherable] instr -- on the cello in -- in Germany and there is a whole group of people all over the United States who play chamber music, so eventually I found -- or they found me.</span> <span id="s2073">I started to play chamber music, which I have been doing all my American life.</span> <span id="s2074">And this is a totally different group of people.</span> <span id="s2075">We don’t mix those two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">HL: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">ML: We don’t really.</span> <span id="s2078">Music is music and social is social.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">HL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: When -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">HL: But we are friends just the same with all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">ML: Yeah, in fact --</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">HL: We have a vast circle of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">ML: We have a vast circle of friends and particularly when you sp-speak about people with whom you make music.</span> <span id="s2085">This goes over the c -- the cates</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">HL: The c --</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">ML: The -- the cates.</span> <span id="s2088">I s -- I p -- I pl-play with many of these people for 20 and 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: And how many of these people who -- who aren’t your survivor friends, how many of them know that you are a survivor [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">ML: Oh, I made no -- I made no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">HL: All of them.</span></p>

<p><span id="s2096">Q: And how -- how many of them are curious and ask you stories and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">ML: Well, if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: [indecipherable] converse with them about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">HL: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">ML: Very few.</span> <span id="s2101">Look, our -- those of -- of our friends who came here in the 30’s really didn’t want to know about our experiences either, when we came.</span> <span id="s2102">That was a taboo subject.</span> <span id="s2103">They didn’t want to know, they didn’t want to face it.</span> <span id="s2104">They were lucky, they came here in time.</span> <span id="s2105">And some of them to this day really haven’t ask us much about our experiences during this period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: How does that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">ML: Look, I have accepted this a long time ago and some people can’t cope with this, you know.</span> <span id="s2108">Or don’t want to cope with this -- don’t want to be burdened with the -- with it.</span> <span id="s2109">And you know, some of our friends classify us as we came here before the war, you came after the war, it -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">HL: There is a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">ML: There is a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">HL: There is a difference in understanding of certain things, which the people who came here before the war do not have.</span> <span id="s2113">They simply do not have the understanding.</span> <span id="s2114">There is a -- there is a lack of whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">ML: Comprehension.</span> <span id="s2116">I don’t think anybody who is not a survivor can comprehend what this was all about.</span> <span id="s2117">It just is not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">HL: It’s not the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">ML: You can’t comprehend it.</span> <span id="s2120">You might have heard a lot of stories, but you can’t comprehend it and nobody el -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: This is tape four, side B and we’re continuing the interview with Max and Hanne Leibmann.</span> <span id="s2122">We were just talking about the people who came before the war, how did they -- how they can’t comprehend these -- the -- the experiences of a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">ML: Look, basically those who came before the war, moved to America.</span> <span id="s2124">They didn’t have the experiences we had.</span> <span id="s2125">Most of them came even before Crystal Night and those who came after had a whiff of it but, you know, they were young.</span> <span id="s2126">They were teenagers.</span> <span id="s2127">And -- or younger and you look at it with different eyes as a t -- as a teenager or as a child, than you look at these things as an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Well, let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s2129">You said that -- that no one who didn’t go through those experiences can comprehend.</span> <span id="s2130">So, what do you then do?</span> <span id="s2131">Do you try to tell your story and make them comprehend --</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">ML: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: -- or do you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">ML: We have never -- we have never --</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">HL: Well, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Or -- or -- or, a-as it seems that you’ve done, you’ve -- you’ve -- you’ve preferred to -- to socialize with people who have those sort of experiences [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">ML: No, we’ve socialized with our

them to listen to our story.</span> <span id="s2140">They didn’t want to -- didn’t want to listen, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">HL: In the beginning, they didn’t want to listen.</span> <span id="s2142">They know now, some of the -- some of it.</span> <span id="s2143">It is really never a topic of conversation as such.</span> <span id="s2144">We might speak of the Holocaust in general, right?</span> <span id="s2145">But the personal thing never really becomes a topic of conversation, or very little.</span> <span id="s2146">The people who came here were Max’s, well they just moved here, yell -- yes, they moved here.</span> <span id="s2147">They had their own problems when they came here in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s2148">There was a depression.</span> <span id="s2149">It was hard to find work.</span> <span id="s2150">The women who had never worked in their lives and had maids in Germany and wherever, now became maids, right?</span> <span id="s2151">So they had a different set of problems.</span> <span id="s2152">An entirely different set of problems.</span> <span id="s2153">No, their lives were not threatened, they were not starving.</span> <span id="s2154">Anti-Semitism was great in this country, things like that.</span> <span id="s2155">They had their own set of problems.</span> <span id="s2156">Surely, in our eyes, or the eyes of a survivor who was in Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen or wherever, it is trivial compared to what they or we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">ML: And you will find that many survivors congr -- like to congregate with other survivors and they always speak of their experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">HL: Invariably.</span> <span id="s2159">It never fails.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">ML: It never fails.</span> <span id="s2161">This is a -- a good way of -- how would you call this?</span> <span id="s2162">It is mental therapy, for those who -- who are survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Has that been a part of your marriage, that sort of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">HL: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">ML: No.</span> <span id="s2166">It hasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">HL: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: So you don’t talk with each other about your stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">ML: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">HL: No, because the story’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: They were the s -- they were the same story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">HL: -- essentially identical, right?</span> <span id="s2173">With a little variation it’s identical.</span> <span id="s2174">So there is nothing to really talk about.</span> <span id="s2175">I had a cousin who lived in Prague.</span> <span id="s2176">And she and her husband were extremely lucky to survive.</span> <span id="s2177">They were in Auschwitz, they were in Theresienstadt, then in Auschwitz and in many other slave labor places.</span> <span id="s2178">And one of the cousins in Switzerland once said, “They never talk about it to each other.”</span> <span id="s2179">I said, “There is no need for them to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2180">They know each other’s story.</span> <span id="s2181">They lived through it.</span> <span id="s2182">They don’t have to go and say what happened in this place or what happened in that pla -- they know.”</span> <span id="s2183">So we don’t have to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">ML: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">HL: We know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">ML: No.</span> <span id="s2187">It’s -- it’s not necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Well, let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s2189">At -- at this point, you look back on that history and you have a -- you have certain stories that you know and that you tell, that you tell in schools or -- are there still times when you remember new things that -- that all of a sudden you’ll remember something or that isn’t part of the story that you usually tell?</span> <span id="s2190">You want to hold on for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">HL: Yes, the -- a few weeks ago -- you know, I speak in schools.</span> <span id="s2194">And I tell them of the day when we were deported and what went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">ML: And she speaks without notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">HL: And all of a sudden I realized something is missing in my story, but what is it that is missing?</span> <span id="s2197">And then I remembered that this morning a young girl was in our house, a Jewish girl, whose mouth was very loose.</span> <span id="s2198">I mean, she -- she’s a character.</span> <span id="s2199">She would say things that she shouldn’t say, right?</span> <span id="s2200">And the Gestapo came and arrested her in our apartment.</span> <span id="s2201">And we all thought, “Well, one more time she talked too much in the wrong place, and --” you know, that some -- they arrested her, before we were arrested, we didn’t know yet.</span> <span id="s2202">We just knew that that young lady, she was maybe a few months older than I, was arrested.</span> <span id="s2203">And that was the thing that had slipped my mind, totally and completely, til I realized there is something -- there is something in that story, what is it?</span> <span id="s2204">And then it finally came to me -- that she had been arrested before we were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: It was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">HL: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2207">Sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: She’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">HL: You know, sometimes there are small details that you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">ML: You miss.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">HL: -- you miss.</span> <span id="s2212">You miss them.</span> <span id="s2213">Sometimes it’s a manner of not having enough time to go into details when I speak.</span> <span id="s2214">Sometimes you really -- you know, like I did not tell you when you -- we were speaking here, when you interviewed me, about my grandmother on the train.</span> <span id="s2215">I mentioned that she lost her mind, that she was totally -- the kids would say she lost it.</span> <span id="s2216">So this -- this Mr. Wile that you have here on your notes, well, at one point, after the SS had gotten off the train in Shalons Urson, we were able to get the one doctor that was on the train.</span> <span id="s2217">He was the last doc-doctor in the city I come from -- from Karlsruhe, was a lot Jewish, was allowed to practice.</span> <span id="s2218">By the way, he couldn’t call himself a doctor any more, he was some sort of a healer.</span> <span id="s2219">And was able to come to our car and he took a look at my grandmother and he assessed the situation and gave me several sleeping pills for her, which I managed to get into her -- not a small undertaking without any water or anything.</span> <span id="s2220">And the intent really was clear, right?</span> <span id="s2221">Unfortunately and it sounds horrible, unfortunately they were not enough.</span> <span id="s2222">And so the poor woman had to suffer two and a half more months, okay?</span> <span id="s2223">This is a -- as you say, a detail -- not a small detail, but something that I didn’t mention when I was speaking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: [indecipherable] things that you even have forgotten about for 40 years yourself and then, you know, come back to you sort of later in life then as you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">HL: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">ML: Not really.</span> <span id="s2227">HL: Some people do say you have a marvelous memory, but I don't know whether it’s such a good memory as having absorbed everything, you know, that went on in -- or as much as I could absorb as a child.</span> <span id="s2228">Yeah, there are things like, I don’t usually talk about when one day in a nice summer day and the doors to the balconies in our dining room were wide open.</span> <span id="s2229">And in the street, a bunch of Hitler youths were marching and they were singing one of their horrible things, that when the Jewish blood jumps off the edge of the knife, things will be twice as good.</span> <span id="s2230">And my father got up and went out on the balcony and watched them marching by.</span> <span id="s2231">And I became totally hysterical, right?</span> <span id="s2232">Because I thought it was outrageous that he stepped out, that he shouldn’t do that, right?</span> <span id="s2233">Yeah, sometimes you forget to mention these things, but they don’t really slip out of your mind, you know.</span> <span id="s2234">You might temporarily when you speak not mention it, you know, because you’re involved in whatever you’re -- what else.</span> <span id="s2235">But it doesn’t really get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">ML: What -- what struck me is the first few times when we spoke, in that time, is we spoke together.</span> <span id="s2237">With a -- our first major effort in this respect, was an invitation by Princeton University.</span> <span id="s2238">And what struck me then was, we were in an academic surrounding, our audience was mostly intellectuals, lawyers and doctors.</span> <span id="s2239">And we got questions which were slanted to what they thought they would like to hear.</span> <span id="s2240">And you know, you had to knock this down.</span> <span id="s2241">It was na -- it struck me that some people -- Americans, have -- had preconceived notions and it was quite difficult to answer these questions in such a way as to make it clear to them that their notions are not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: What sort of notions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">ML: Well, you know the questions -- they wanted to hear certain things and we didn’t play ball with this.</span> <span id="s2244">There is always -- we had -- we had -- the only thing I can think of right now is -- and this has come again and again -- what -- what -- the questions was, “In Le Chambon, what prompted these people to help?”</span> <span id="s2245">And they thought this was -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s2246">And we tried to explain to them that when you -- when they helped, it was a spontaneous and they might not have known 10 minutes ago that they would help, because th -- th -- it’s a question didn’t come up.</span> <span id="s2247">You know, they did this for religious reasons, for moral reasons, but one didn’t know from the other, there was no organization in Chambon.</span> <span id="s2248">You know, you do this, you do that.</span> <span id="s2249">And the widow of the pastor who was pass [indecipherable] always said when she spoke to people, “If it would have been organized, it would have failed.”</span> <span id="s2250">The left hand did literally not know what the right hand was doing.</span> <span id="s2251">There might have been people in the house next to you and the people who lived next to it didn’t have no idea what these people were doing.</span> <span id="s2252">And maybe tomorrow they would take people and nobody else knew.</span> <span id="s2253">One didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s2254">It was spontaneous.</span> <span id="s2255">When the need arose.</span> <span id="s2256">And this was something very difficult to convey to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Did you go back and visit there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">ML: Oh yeah, we were there a number of times.</span> <span id="s2259">We even participated at their first symposium -- historic-historical symposium where they were trying to put things together in an orderly fashion, with historians and there was a controversy which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s2260">There was a historian who researched this, a young French Ph.D., who stood up and said -- there were 150 people -- 150 Jewish young people who were in this village.</span> <span id="s2261">The man was almost lynched, because what he found was, the 150 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">HL: [inaudible] it’s 50 - 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">ML: Oh, 50 people.</span> <span id="s2264">He found the 50 people are registered in -- in police documents who were officially registered as living in a forced residence in Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s2265">That there was something going on.</span> <span id="s2266">All along during the war where people came and went and were fitted with false papers, never entered his -- his brain.</span> <span id="s2267">The man was almost lynched and -- and was called a revisionist and God knows what.</span> <span id="s2268">Because he took the number -- he disputed, you know, that there were 5000 people who were helped.</span> <span id="s2269">And the 5000 number came from a man who forged papers.</span> <span id="s2270">He’s a doctor today in France, but at that time he was a teenager who knew how to forge papers.</span> <span id="s2271">You know, you get all kinds of crazy ideas.</span> <span id="s2272">The his-historian didn’t understand that if you are illegal, you cannot be counted.</span> <span id="s2273">You’re not there, officially.</span> <span id="s2274">When I was in Le Chambon, nobody knew I was there.</span> <span id="s2275">And the -- certainly not the officials or the police.</span> <span id="s2276">I came, I was hidden, I came back, I was fitted with false papers and I went.</span> <span id="s2277">And that happened before this man who -- who said he made at least 5000 false paper was ever in this village.</span> <span id="s2278">He came much later.</span> <span id="s2279">So you have all kinds of things where you have to dispute even historians.</span> <span id="s2280">I had a -- we had a confrontation at the occasion of the opening of the Research Institute in the US Holocaust Museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s2281">That was years after the museum was already open.</span> <span id="s2282">We had the confro-confrontation with a German professor who was considered the German authority on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2283">He never -- he -- he -- he stated in a speech, which he had prepared and which was slated for publication that the first deportations in Germany ha-happened in 1941.</span> <span id="s2284">Oh?</span> <span id="s2285">There was -- in March of 1940, there was Stettin, who were deported into -- somewhere into Poland.</span> <span id="s2286">Then there w-were we, with 6504 people who were deported to -- to France.</span> <span id="s2287">And there were of course the expulsions in -- in October of ‘38 of -- of the Polish Jews without proper Polish passports into no man’s land between Germany and -- and Poland.</span> <span id="s2288">Never mentioned it.</span> <span id="s2289">And he got so upset when we confronted him and told him that he’s revising history.</span> <span id="s2290">I’m talking about Professor Yecky.</span> <span id="s2291">So, you know there, we are trying to keep all of this historically correct.</span> <span id="s2292">And that is a big undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Did you ever think 20 years ago or however many years ago that you would be so involved with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">ML: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: -- doing that sort of thing now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">ML: Because we are so far removed from organized religion that it never occurred it -- to us.</span> <span id="s2297">And we were too busy.</span> <span id="s2298">We never belonged -- we belonged for three or four months to a Jewish congregation and our daughter went for a few weeks to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s2299">Other than that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">HL: She went two -- one or two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">ML: Other than that, we never belonged to an organized congregation or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">HL: We are not joiners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">ML: We are not joiners, we are not religious, we don’t practice.</span> <span id="s2304">That doesn’t mean we are not Jews.</span> <span id="s2305">I mean, we may not be Jews in the eyes of the Orthodox, the ultra-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s2306">But nobody ask us if we were religious or not religious when we were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: So why then do you think you’re so involved now with hearing people’s stories and -- and [indecipherable] and being part of the gathering and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">ML: That is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">HL: I think one has to give something back to society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">ML: To society, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">HL: I think it is necessary that the young people know about it.</span> <span id="s2312">That they understand what can happen when a dictatorship takes over.</span> <span id="s2313">When I speak to the kids, I always tell them that you have to do everything so democracy doesn’t get lost, because choice is zero after that.</span> <span id="s2314">That they have no future and no life in a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s2315">These are really some of the reasons.</span> <span id="s2316">So they know what has happened, right?</span> <span id="s2317">And that they can learn from the experience of others, what mankind can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">ML: Yeah, and the motto of the -- the basic motto of the American gathering is thekor.</span> <span id="s2319">In Yiddish, gdank and in English, remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">HL: Do you speak any Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Only a few words.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">HL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: But I wanted to show you this.</span> <span id="s2325">It’s the one -- the museum sent me this, which I thought was interesting, this is Netanyahu and he says, “This is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this.</span> <span id="s2326">That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">ML: Yeah, but this Jewish faith, of course is somewhat neb -- in my book nebulous because the ultra-Orthodox in Israel don’t serve in the army.</span> <span id="s2328">They don’t even recognize, per se, the state of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">HL: [indecipherable] Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">ML: [indecipherable] these people don’t want the state.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: But this is a st --</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">ML: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: -- a very specific sort of lesson of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2334">I wonder, you know, if you have your own sort of idea of what the lesson is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">ML: The lesson is remember, teach so that it will never be forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">HL: Teach tolerance.</span> <span id="s2337">Teach understanding.</span> <span id="s2338">This is what I ask of the children, to get to know each other.</span> <span id="s2339">To understand and respect each other.</span> <span id="s2340">Because if that all breaks down, then you get hatred.</span> <span id="s2341">And hatred, we cannot live with that.</span> <span id="s2342">Many times the children ask me, “Do you hate?”</span> <span id="s2343">And I will ask them, “Do you know what hate does?”</span> <span id="s2344">And they look at me.</span> <span id="s2345">I said, “Do you know who gets hurt first when you hate?</span> <span id="s2346">It’s you yourself, because your soul dies.</span> <span id="s2347">Before the other guy knows that you hate him, you are already destroyed.”</span> <span id="s2348">And they look at me and then they start thinking about it.</span> <span id="s2349">So I’m not only telling them what happened to me, but I’m trying to tell them what they have to do and what they have to learn and the consequences they have, you know, if things go wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">ML: And you know, one of the functions I have in the American gathering is I act, actually as an ombudsman on behalf of survivors, vis a vis of the claims conference.</span> <span id="s2351">Many people can’t get what they think they should get -- a pension, for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s2352">There are many restrictions why they cannot get it.</span> <span id="s2353">And the personnel of the claims conference, is basically Russian.</span> <span id="s2354">With a -- to us totally alien mentality, in Russia, I always say, in Russia, y -- a social service is -- is not social service, civil servants are not there for you.</span> <span id="s2355">You are there for civil servants.</span> <span
