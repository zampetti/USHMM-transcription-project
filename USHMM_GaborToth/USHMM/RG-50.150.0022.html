tell me a little bit about your education?</span> <span id="s5">In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I went to the usual school, after four years I went to the high school, I didn’t have to take any tests, my parents didn’t have to pay any money, we were not Germans.</span> <span id="s7">My parents were stateless.</span> <span id="s8">Even though I was born in Germany that does not make you a German citizen according to the German law it’s different here in America if you’re born here you are an American.</span> <span id="s9">Not in Germany.</span> <span id="s10">You are what your parents are.</span> <span id="s11">My parents were stateless.</span> <span id="s12">They were originally Russian.</span> <span id="s13">They left Russia for Germany in 1905 and we were quite a traveled bunch so to speak because in 1895 they lived in South America for five years and then from South America went back to Russia and then to Germany settled in Germany in 1905, I was born in ’18.</span> <span id="s14">I myself went to the schools, and then I studied music, went to the Conservatorium where I also made my teacher examination as a music teacher and that would be as far as education goes, I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: After you went to, through the regular school, the (sentence incomplete)</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Complete regular school.</span> <span id="s17">Was never thrown out on account of being Jewish, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s18">I guess that the time period was just right, I ended school in 1934.</span> <span id="s19">I did not go to the (sentence incomplete) I just went to the (sentence incomplete).</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And then you went to music school to continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I went to music school constantly I went to music school all my life, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What did you hope to do with your music education?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: What I hoped to do with it I don’t know.</span> <span id="s24">Actually it was chosen by my parents.</span> <span id="s25">I never wanted it in the first place.</span> <span id="s26">I wanted to go into medicine.</span> <span id="s27">Naturally why.</span> <span id="s28">My brother was a doctor so what do you aspire as a younger sister.</span> <span id="s29">The difference between the children in my family was tremendous...my brother was born in 1902.</span> <span id="s30">Between 1902 and 1918 was nobody...I was the one.</span> <span id="s31">The oldest one was born in 1883...I was what they called the baby, and always stayed that baby.</span> <span id="s32">A spoiled brat.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: But your parents chose music?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: But my parents didn’t like that idea.</span> <span id="s35">Then I said maybe I should become a nurse, and I was talking to a doctor friend of the family and he said I don’t think you should.</span> <span id="s36">Then I said maybe I should take gymnastics, and things like this, so my father didn’t like the idea very much, but he said all right.</span> <span id="s37">Try it.</span> <span id="s38">But I was always continuing in music.</span> <span id="s39">I was very gifted.</span> <span id="s40">I had good fingers.</span> <span id="s41">My fingers run by themselves.</span> <span id="s42">And my mother had the idea that her daughter’s name should be in big letters all over the world.</span> <span id="s43">Why she had the idea I don’t know.</span> <span id="s44">But then she also figured that the two other daughters were just ordinary people.</span> <span id="s45">They were shorthand stenographers, that the youngest one should be different.</span> <span id="s46">Alright.</span> <span id="s47">So I went to that gym class and all of my life never ever anything happened to me.</span> <span id="s48">There the first time I went on the rings, I jumped and fell down and my arm was broken and that took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: That took care of the gymnastics.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: So I stayed with music.</span> <span id="s51">Everyone said how can you bring your daughter up taking music, she should learn how to sew a dress.</span> <span id="s52">After all it’s immigration time.</span> <span id="s53">She should learn how to make a hat.</span> <span id="s54">But how can you?</span> <span id="s55">Well my mother could.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Were your parents in business in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My father was up to ’28 an accountant, then they dismissed him.</span> <span id="s58">Whether it was age or not I really wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s59">Then they started out in their own business.</span> <span id="s60">They had a, they were jobbers for a religious firm who manufactured soup cubes like they had them.</span> <span id="s61">Also some friends gave them kosher fat which my father also distributed to the different Jewish stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: While you were going to school, both the conservatory and the public school, did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes, very many.</span> <span id="s64">In fact they came and visited me after I finished school and moved away from that area, with my parents to be closer to the music school and it was nicer living there...They came and visited me even after the Nazi era was on.</span> <span id="s65">They called...Naturally I had many who were Deutsch national.</span> <span id="s66">I don’t know if you know that was very right wing and the usual saying was, but you are different, which at that time didn’t mean that much to me... I was more or less (sentence incomplete) I was blond, I had blue eyes, had a nice behavior.</span> <span id="s67">Had a nice way of getting along with people, so I was pretty much liked by the gentiles...</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Did your family and yourself go to many of the cultural events, the concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I certainly did go to concerts.</span> <span id="s70">I went to operas and when it wasn’t allowed any more I went to the (sentence incomplete).</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: When did you first become aware of any Jewish feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I personally in my own life was never aware of it.</span> <span id="s73">Now I’m talking about I myself.</span> <span id="s74">It went so far it must have been 1934 or 1935.</span> <span id="s75">When I was in music school one of the teachers went around at that time with an S.S. sign.</span> <span id="s76">The big sign that meant he was one of the big guys there.</span> <span id="s77">One of my teachers approached me one day and said “What do you intend to do?”</span> <span id="s78">I said I’m going to continue.</span> <span id="s79">He said, “But you should go to Kirshing or (sentence incomplete).</span> <span id="s80">But listen I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s81">That has nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s82">You can get in there with no doubt.</span> <span id="s83">That was one of the big guys.</span> <span id="s84">But as I said I never found it on myself.</span> <span id="s85">Just the contrary.</span> <span id="s86">When they were collecting in the streets, gifts for the Germans for this or that I’m not giving I’m Jewish they looked at me and just laughed.</span> <span id="s87">You just want to get away with it.</span> <span id="s88">So I never had that.</span> <span id="s89">Also I went to the Police Department.</span> <span id="s90">You had to register for the name Sarah.</span> <span id="s91">So I went in there and they said “here comes our blondest gretchen which means here comes our blond Margaretta.</span> <span id="s92">And I said no I came to register.</span> <span id="s93">He looked at me and felt very bad and said “But you know Sarah is a very beautiful name.</span> <span id="s94">Just think of Sarah Leander.”</span> <span id="s95">Which at that time was a very famous actress...Alright so I myself, never, but my brother refused to go with me in the streets.</span> <span id="s96">My brother looked very much Jewish and was very much afraid that anything could happen to me that he’s going with a gentile girl...So whenever we went together he walked a few steps ahead of me...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How did you feel?</span> <span id="s98">You made a point of saying that you were Jewish...This was in the conservatory and street and so on.</span> <span id="s99">Did anyone give you a hard time?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No.</span> <span id="s101">They never did.</span> <span id="s102">They just didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: How did it make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: They’re crazy.</span> <span id="s105">I laughed it off.</span> <span id="s106">I was just a child.</span> <span id="s107">Because if I were adult I never would have said a thing like this, because I had to realize that it could bring me into very big trouble.</span> <span id="s108">But I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: How did your family react at this time?</span> <span id="s110">Your father and mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: ...my father had died in ’36 unfortunately, because I imagine that if my father had been alive they would have tried to get back to South America I would imagine.</span> <span id="s112">But my father died.</span> <span id="s113">My mother was an elderly person.</span> <span id="s114">She must have been in her sixties at that time.</span> <span id="s115">My one sister was married to a gentile.</span> <span id="s116">So she would have liked to leave because she didn’t like the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s117">She didn’t feel very secure.</span> <span id="s118">It made life very difficult for her and she got pregnant and she was not allowed to have children.</span> <span id="s119">She would have liked to have an abortion, but nobody dared to do anymore at that time.</span> <span id="s120">She had many abortions in her life, but at that time nobody dared to do any any more.</span> <span id="s121">It was ’39 or end of ’38.</span> <span id="s122">She had to carry the child, and she died consequently in childbirth.</span> <span id="s123">My other sister was not married, and I would say that after ’38 after Crystal Night they would have liked to leave and they tried.</span> <span id="s124">Naturally being born in Russia the only place for them to go was America.</span> <span id="s125">My mother had a sister living in America at that time, or Bermuda.</span> <span id="s126">Maybe America.</span> <span id="s127">I think she was already in America.</span> <span id="s128">And she was trying.</span> <span id="s129">For me that was hopeless because I was born in Germany so I could never get under the Russian quota.</span> <span id="s130">I had a boyfriend at that time and we tried to go to different consulates.</span> <span id="s131">The nice ones like France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, you name them, we went there.</span> <span id="s132">We don’t need you.</span> <span id="s133">From England we got information that if I wanted to go as a housemaid I could go, but that was not my cup of tea.</span> <span id="s134">And then some friends approached my boyfriend and myself, and said of you want to tonight you have to stand in line, you can get passage to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s135">No questions asked, no nothing.</span> <span id="s136">Just bring the money.</span> <span id="s137">So we went to my mother and said look I’m going to marry your daughter and let’s go.</span> <span id="s138">Well my mother said okay, what could she say.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Let me ask you.</span> <span id="s140">Up to this time which was after Crystal Night, did you ever see any signs in the street (sentence incomplete) or were you ever stopped from going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I was never stopped from going anywheres.</span> <span id="s142">I would imagine in retrospect that most likely (sentence incomplete) was forbidden there for Jews.</span> <span id="s143">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s144">I can not actually say when I saw the last opera.</span> <span id="s145">I might be able to look it up.</span> <span id="s146">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s147">I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s148">As I said I had the (sentence incomplete) to take it’s place.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you attend performances regularly at the (sentence incomplete)?</span> <span id="s150">Did you participate?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No I didn’t participate.</span> <span id="s152">I was a member.</span> <span id="s153">Yes you could not perform as an artist, as a Jew in the outside world, but I don’t know when that law got into existence.</span> <span id="s154">I believe when I got my teacher’s certificate it might have been written there, for Jewish only.</span> <span id="s155">Just to be allowed to teach in Jewish organizations and Jewish schools, and things like that.</span> <span id="s156">Nevertheless I did teach gentile children come to think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Privately?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">My pupils were all gentiles when I taught in ’38 and ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did you, until 1938 ever consider emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s163">My parents were there at that time till ’36 my father.</span> <span id="s164">Where my parents are I am.</span> <span id="s165">So it was in their hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Do you remember any family discussions about what to do?</span> <span id="s167">In the event that Hitler would last?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: It wasn’t taken serious I would say.</span> <span id="s169">The only one who was serious in thinking of leaving was my brother who tried very badly, and he succeeded in ’39, end of ’39, because I left myself in ’39 and he left after me.</span> <span id="s170">He went to England and then from England he went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: The brother who’s a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s173">Which were the only ones to escape.</span> <span id="s174">My mother and my sister eventually went to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s175">Their papers came and they were not approved, and then they came again and for some reason they got lost.</span> <span id="s176">I never could find out what really went on there.</span> <span id="s177">There was some kind of hanky – panky.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: But they would have qualified under the Russian quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: When you say these people approached your fiance or your boyfriend was there any agency involved like the (sentence incomplete)?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No.</span> <span id="s182">That was just the traveling bureau, word of mouth.</span> <span id="s183">We have passage for Shanghai, we have a ship for Shanghai, so we stood in line.</span> <span id="s184">Our friends stood and we stood, and we left.</span> <span id="s185">We got out tickets...We stood in line from the night before, like you do when you go to a Horowitz concert here.</span> <span id="s186">We stood overnight.</span> <span id="s187">That’s what we did there.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: I just want to backtrack a moment.</span> <span id="s189">You said on Crystal Night you were not particularly affected.</span> <span id="s190">Where were you on Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Most probably I was home or at my boyfriend’s home.</span> <span id="s192">I don’t know, but I think the next morning, I was home naturally.</span> <span id="s193">We walked around.</span> <span id="s194">We were just stunned about the devastation...the broken windows, the burnt synagogues, and couldn’t grasp it somehow.</span> <span id="s195">It was just beyond imagination.</span> <span id="s196">I was warned to be careful.</span> <span id="s197">Naturally it went in one ear and the other one out...</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did it change your attitude at all, walking around that morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: ...I wouldn’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: You weren’t determined at that point to find a way out or?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: There was no way out at that time.</span> <span id="s202">According to all our information there was just no way...so if something comes up, fine, we’ll go...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you feel in fear of your life at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: ...I don’t think I did.</span> <span id="s205">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did you belong to a temple in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I wouldn’t know if we belonged or not.</span> <span id="s208">I know that my mother would always go to synagogue on the holy days like Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and there was a ticket for me too, which after a certain while I wouldn’t take part any more I would just decide, well sorry.</span> <span id="s209">I mean I would go and visit her, but that would be as far as I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: The only reason I ask that is I was curious if any of the rabbis or there was any attempt in the congregation....</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I would not know about that at all.</span> <span id="s212">As I said I was not active and I did not go and I could say if they even did say anything in their sermons...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: How did you feel about going to a place like Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: How I thought about the possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s216">When it was presented to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: It was the only way to get out, in other words you do not question it.</span> <span id="s218">That’s where you go...The time period was short...It was a decision that was done on one, two three, quick.</span> <span id="s219">Maybe two days or so, I don’t even recall any more.</span> <span id="s220">The departure was very fast after that also.</span> <span id="s221">It was just try to get your things together, and make sure you have what you need...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Where did you depart from?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Berlin.</span> <span id="s224">I mean we took a plane to Italy.</span> <span id="s225">We flew out of Berlin.</span> <span id="s226">Naturally examination in Munich.</span> <span id="s227">The plane had to land for examination.</span> <span id="s228">From Munich the plane left again for Milano.</span> <span id="s229">I think it was Milano, somewheres in Italy.</span> <span id="s230">We spent a day in Milano, a day in Venice, we went to Genoa from there, and then we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: You mentioned before that you had to register for the name Sarah, this was already in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, this must have been earlier.</span> <span id="s233">That was earlier than ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Was that in your passport that you had to register?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Why did you have a passport at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Stateless, as a stateless person you have to always have papers...I never was a German.</span> <span id="s238">I always had a status that had to be renewed every year.</span> <span id="s239">Which never gave us difficulties.</span> <span id="s240">In fact I remember my mother writing to me at Shanghai...”We don’t have to go every day to register at the police department because we are well known and so to speak bonofido residents...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Speaking of stateless.</span> <span id="s242">Did this ever give your parents or yourself any problems in Germany, before?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No.</span> <span id="s244">Nobody ever bothered with it...Nobody even questioned it.</span> <span id="s245">As I said, I went to high school, and the income of my parents was not sufficient so they asked for a reduction in the price of high school or completely, and it was taken care of.</span> <span id="s246">It had nothing to do with whether we were stateless or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Before Crystal Night when Greenspan killed van R?</span> <span id="s248">did that have any effect on your family because they were stateless?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s251">When you left that day, when you left on your way to Shanghai, how did you feel about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I guess my boyfriend was very smart.</span> <span id="s253">He took a plane.</span> <span id="s254">It was the first time I took a plane...I guess the excitement took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Do you remember, I guess the rest of the family was still in Germany, including the brother that emigrated afterwards.</span> <span id="s256">Was that difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Apparently not...First of all I had definitely the belief that nothing would happen number one.</span> <span id="s258">At least not to them.</span> <span id="s259">Number two, that they would get out in time.</span> <span id="s260">My mother and sister and brother most probably not to America because all of them were born in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: You brothers were also born in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: When you took the boat from Genoa, did it go straight from there to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: To Shanghai...The first ten days or fifteen days we were not allowed to leave on board.</span> <span id="s265">We landed in different ports, but we were never allowed to go off.</span> <span id="s266">Once in all that trip we were allowed to leave board.</span> <span id="s267">It was kind of like a cattle carrier.</span> <span id="s268">Naturally I had again my problems.</span> <span id="s269">Even though we had second class or whatever you wanted to call passage I was allowed to be in first class.</span> <span id="s270">I had my meals in first class.</span> <span id="s271">I walked around in first class and what have you...Playing the piano helps...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Did you have to leave with just ten Reichmarks?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I think that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s274">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Was this a German boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Italian.</span> <span id="s277">Julius Caesar.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Were there many other German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Only.</span> <span id="s280">I say cattle transport.</span> <span id="s281">I think the cabins which were meant for one or two were filled with three or four...And it was so hot in these cabins that most of us took our mattresses and slept outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: On the deck?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: No, in front there were always these passageways so we were outside sleeping.</span> <span id="s284">On the deck chairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Was this originally a passenger boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s287">But as I said it was most probably a cruise ship for two or for one.</span> <span id="s288">Whoever had heard of four people in a cabin...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: How would you describe the mood or the morale on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Joyous...We all enjoyed it I think.</span> <span id="s291">At least I had a good time.</span> <span id="s292">I was with my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s293">I was young.</span> <span id="s294">I had lots of friends on the ship.</span> <span id="s295">I made friends every day.</span> <span id="s296">In the evening we went to the cabin of one of the navigators.</span> <span id="s297">He was very interested in music himself.</span> <span id="s298">He had a lovely record player.</span> <span id="s299">He had beautiful records.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: So you were able to make a good trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: ...I mean you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: When you.....</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: The only thing that bothered us was too many people.</span> <span id="s304">Too many kids crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: When you arrived in Shanghai, what were your impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: What kind of a thing is that.</span> <span id="s307">Especially the welcome.</span> <span id="s308">We were met and we were put in an open truck with baggage and all.</span> <span id="s309">Oh maybe fifty people in a truck or what have you.</span> <span id="s310">And the first accommodation was in a community place which slept maybe thirty, maybe forty, maybe fifty in one room.</span> <span id="s311">You know like a dormitory...I only lasted for two days because then my boyfriend said, “Look that’s not for us.</span> <span id="s312">Get out of here.”</span> <span id="s313">We rented a room.</span> <span id="s314">And we stayed in that room for about a month and then we took an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: When you say the community house was that the Hyam?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Something like this...I don’t remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Who was in charge of meeting you at the boat and taking you to these accommodations?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s319">They had a special Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s320">I don’t know the name any more...I have it somewheres...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: That’s alright.</span> <span id="s322">You mentioned.......</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: They were very helpful they saw that you had food and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: After two days you left.</span> <span id="s325">Where did you have an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: In the same neighborhood there were rooming house, what you would call it at that time.</span> <span id="s327">Apparently immigration had been flourishing pretty much for that particular district and anybody who had a head on his shoulders rented rooms.</span> <span id="s328">They were not much to speak of.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t think we stayed in that room longer than two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: In “the Japanese, Nazis, and Jews” they talk about rooms on two lanes, was this what...”</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Ours was not a lane.</span> <span id="s332">Ours was on a main street.</span> <span id="s333">By lanes I don’t know what he meant but in Shanghai the houses are built...You see this here was a main street, and then it goes in here like a little nice village.</span> <span id="s334">Which is nothing wrong with it, very lovely homes in that lanes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: When you say you rented an apartment, when you came there both of you had come basically with the ten Reichmark, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No...No.</span> <span id="s337">The man that I married later on here in America.</span> <span id="s338">His mother had sent some money over to Shanghai waiting for us...Also family relations from my boyfriend had sent money over for us.</span> <span id="s339">In Italy we had found money.</span> <span id="s340">And we had valuables which we could sell or pawn.</span> <span id="s341">He took his accordion along, and I imagine he pawned it to get some money, or maybe he sold it...I don’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s342">I had heavy silver napkin holders.</span> <span id="s343">We were allowed to take out up to forty grams of silver, or something like this...So, I sold it or pawned it I really don’t know, because I don’t know where they are now, so maybe I sold them...</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So you were able to use this money to rent the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Right.</span> <span id="s346">And very soon my boyfriend got himself a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How was he able to get a job in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Due to the fact that...Now what did he do first?</span> <span id="s349">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s350">He got that job in a (words missing) bus company.</span> <span id="s351">He was basically by profession an accountant.</span> <span id="s352">He had his doctor in economy in Germany.</span> <span id="s353">And he got that job in the bus company.</span> <span id="s354">I don’t know what he did before.</span> <span id="s355">Maybe he got it so very fast.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: When you say he got a job in the bus company, well who owned the bus company?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I would imagine a conglomerate.</span> <span id="s359">It was probably American, English.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Not native Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Where was he driving, I mean you were new in Shanghai, how was he able to drive this bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">: He didn’t have to drive it.</span> <span id="s364">He was an accountant.</span> <span id="s365">He was inside in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s367">Was this job enough to meet your expenses?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: How long did you anticipate staying in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Tomorrow.</span> <span id="s371">Tomorrow.</span> <span id="s372">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s374">And after tomorrow didn’t come?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Came tomorrow and another tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: But had you applied at this time for re – emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No.</span> <span id="s378">For what.</span> <span id="s379">Where to?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Well I thought maybe you had applied to America as a..</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span> <span id="s384">I never did.</span> <span id="s385">First I was there and I was in the hands of my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s386">Let him take decisions.</span> <span id="s387">In a very old fashioned upbringing the man takes it.</span> <span id="s388">He does.</span> <span id="s389">Fine.</span> <span id="s390">He took care of me...No he was very interested that I pursue my musical career...Concertize So I wasn’t allowed to do anything, just play the piano.</span> <span id="s391">We had a maid who cleaned, who cooked, who shopped.</span> <span id="s392">Just play the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: How did you get the piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: He had his own brought in.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s396">He had his own brought from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: He had a lift.</span> <span id="s398">The music was there, the piano was there.</span> <span id="s399">There was other things we had...Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: How did you adjust?</span> <span id="s401">As time went by how did you adjust to life in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: It was a very nice life.</span> <span id="s403">I mean we lived very comfortably.</span> <span id="s404">We had a very lovely two room apartment.</span> <span id="s405">Not a kitchen.</span> <span id="s406">We went out to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Was that common not to have a kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No, people had kitchens, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s409">We were in a private house and it was, well it is not a suburb, it belongs to Shanghai, but it was in the end of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s410">Very close, I don’t know if you read the book I don’t know if it was mentioned or not.</span> <span id="s411">It should have been mentioned.</span> <span id="s412">We lived close to that park which was a very very big park like Central Park, and there was a University there.</span> <span id="s413">And it was a private house that belonged to a Russian lady who lived there with her daughter, and the second floor she had another lady living, and there were two rooms and your own bathroom naturally.</span> <span id="s414">Those were big rooms which we had rented from her.</span> <span id="s415">And we stayed there for about a year and after a year we took our own apartment...No it wasn’t our own apartment.</span> <span id="s416">We sublet it from an Austrian refugee.</span> <span id="s417">They had there three rooms, but it just was laid out like two kitchens if you remember here in America you have two kitchens, a big kitchen and a little kitchen so to speak, an (word missing) room, a preparation room.</span> <span id="s418">This apartment was laid out the same.</span> <span id="s419">It had a big kitchen and in the front was a little kitchen.</span> <span id="s420">They made a little kitchen so they could sublet.</span> <span id="s421">I had my own refrigerator, my own sink, everything our own.</span> <span id="s422">In that apartment we had our own bathroom, we had two bathrooms in that small apartment.</span> <span id="s423">We had our own bathroom and our own big room.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you have any connection at all in Shanghai with the Japanese or the Chinese population?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Well number one the Japanese only started in ’41.</span> <span id="s426">When I came to Shanghai in ’39 we met Chinese people definitely.</span> <span id="s427">First of all through the business my boyfriend was working in.</span> <span id="s428">We were invited and we met them.</span> <span id="s429">No they were not Chinese, yes they were, but the majority were British which we met through the company where he worked, and we met the other refugees which we were friendly with.</span> <span id="s430">And there were concerts given, we went to concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Who set up the organization of the concerts?</span> <span id="s432">Or any cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: We had our own orchestra concert, their own symphony in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s434">It was led by an Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: When you say their own?</span> <span id="s436">You mean made up of...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Shanghai musicians, English, American, French what have you, They had newspapers, foreign newspapers, critics.</span> <span id="s438">The French critic was G (words missing) a famous guy out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Were you able to attend these concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s441">And they also had concerts in the summer months outside in the (words missing) Park, with the mosquitoes, but they went around and gave you mosquito candles.</span> <span id="s442">You have them now here...I don’t know if you ever saw them or not.</span> <span id="s443">But they were coils, not candles, green coils.</span> <span id="s444">They are very good.</span> <span id="s445">In case you ever want to sit out there in your garden, you don’t have to be bothered.</span> <span id="s446">Buy the mosquito coils.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Oh, alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I’m very serious, and they have a little...they break very easily, and it takes a long time till it runs down.</span> <span id="s449">It has kind of an annoying smell, but the mosquito won’t bite you.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: That’s what they had in Shanghai?</span> <span id="s451">Did you perform at all in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Now my boyfriend wanted very much that I should play with the orchestra and he approached the conductor, and he said yes, let her play for me which I did.</span> <span id="s453">Naturally what he wanted was to get some money, and maybe he wanted something else, but I was too naive and too stupid, anyway I didn’t get along with that.</span> <span id="s454">Didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s455">Okay so that was taken out of our reach.</span> <span id="s456">Then we decided I should better play my own recital, so I prepared for it.</span> <span id="s457">Naturally for things like this you need a lot of money.</span> <span id="s458">So we tried to present it to someone who had the money.</span> <span id="s459">Who had the money?</span> <span id="s460">The Jewish organizations had the money.</span> <span id="s461">So we approached the Jewish organizations and I was very friendly with one of the big shots of the Arabian, whatever Jewish people there, a mister Allis Hayim.</span> <span id="s462">No Arabian, Egyptian, whatever.</span> <span id="s463">He was very wealthy, and very well known, and he was number one, and sort of the right hand of Sir Victor Sassoon.</span> <span id="s464">I knew Allis Hayim and I was invited to him and so on.</span> <span id="s465">And we approached him and he said yes it was a good idea and do it.</span> <span id="s466">And I was very much inclined to give it in aid for the old people, and this was refused and he said in aid of the European emigrants.</span> <span id="s467">That recital was on the twenty fifth of November in 1941.</span> <span id="s468">It took place, for some unforeseen reason the heating didn’t work, sitting there cold, the lighting didn’t work, something went wrong I don’t even remember what it was, but the recital took place and everything was fine and good and the critics were very helpful and what have you, but as you know on December seventh the war broke out and then we buried all of that.</span> <span id="s469">Before I played over the radio and I played for little things.</span> <span id="s470">I don’t know if I have them here you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: When you played this concert on November 25, where did you play it?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: In a big concert hall, The Lyceum called, where all the symphony concerts took place, and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Was most of your audience of the European refugee community?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No.</span> <span id="s475">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Mixed audience?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Very mixed audience.</span> <span id="s478">I was introduced to Shanghai through these Hayims.</span> <span id="s479">Mrs. Hayim gave a tea in honor of me before the concert where everyone was invited who had something, in other words all the big shots.</span> <span id="s480">I have the list here somewheres.</span> <span id="s481">The ambassadors, and you name it.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: In other words you were really introduced into the Shanghai society?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Unfortunately it didn’t last long because they all had to go to concentration camps later on.</span> <span id="s484">So there was only a few French ones left...I eventually gave lessons in French to French ambassador people.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: When you say the war broke out in December 1941, how did this affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I affected me greatly because everything was again destroyed.</span> <span id="s487">Whatever was built up was destroyed at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: In what way do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Musically.</span> <span id="s490">In other words here I had given my recital hoping to get something out of it.</span> <span id="s491">And it could never be much realized because there was nobody there anymore to support it or who would be interested in things like this...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: When you say there was nobody there to support it.</span> <span id="s493">How was this different after the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Number one.</span> <span id="s495">Allis Hayim was taken away, and soon everyone else was taken away.</span> <span id="s496">They were all British citizens.</span> <span id="s497">They came into a concentration camp so to speak.</span> <span id="s498">Internment camps.</span> <span id="s499">All of them.</span> <span id="s500">There were Speilmans, there were (words missing), there Elias, you name them, they all had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: They were all men who were mentioned, that’s why you should read that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: That’s why I want to read it.</span> <span id="s503">They’re all in here too.</span> <span id="s504">They all subsidize that thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: How did this affect not only you, but how did this affect the refugee community in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well let’s do that very slowly.</span> <span id="s507">In ‘41 when the Japanese came in, as I said before, I lived very nicely out of that district.</span> <span id="s508">Now, I also was not a German citizen.</span> <span id="s509">Most of the refugees were either German, Polish, Czechoslovakian or what have you.</span> <span id="s510">I myself also tried at that particular time to maybe get Russian citizenship.</span> <span id="s511">I went to the Russian consulate, which naturally didn’t bring me to anything.</span> <span id="s512">It was just an empty gesture.</span> <span id="s513">But I went nevertheless.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Why did you even think of doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I thought it might give me some sort of protection.</span> <span id="s516">My boyfriend being a German national and all these people who did not live in a certain area.</span> <span id="s517">Shanghai became occupied by the Japanese who had their own rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s518">One of them was that all the Jewish people had to go into a designated area.</span> <span id="s519">This designated area was the least built up area, the least friendly area.</span> <span id="s520">It was overcrowded already without these people who came from the settlement area.</span> <span id="s521">Shanghai had settlements, French settlements, British settlements, American settlements etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Who lived in this particular area?</span> <span id="s523">that was designated for the district?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: It was predominately Chinese people living there, and refugees who came and were settled there in the beginning, because that’s where we were taken, that is the place where I was stating in the dormitory, and the ones who had big ambitions moved out very fast, and the rest stayed on.</span> <span id="s525">But now they all had to go back there.</span> <span id="s526">It became very, very overcrowded and rooms were at a premium.</span> <span id="s527">Toilet facilities were horrible, kitchen facilities were awful.</span> <span id="s528">It was just a horror actually, to live there, I will say that.</span> <span id="s529">But again, I didn’t have to go because again I was lucky, Number one.</span> <span id="s530">I was stateless I don’t know if that alone would have helped me, but one of my friends had married a Chinese gentleman, and this Chinese gentleman was very nice and very helpful and introduced me to Japanese people and I went a few times to the Japanese consulate and to the Japanese offices somewheres.</span> <span id="s531">I got my bill of health, stay where you are.</span> <span id="s532">That was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Now this district, was this the Hong Que?</span> <span id="s534">Where the Jewish people had to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Basically you were one of the few then?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I wasn’t one of the few.</span> <span id="s538">There were a number of them that got away with it.</span> <span id="s539">In other words a doctor would have gotten a permission, maybe he paid.</span> <span id="s540">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s541">Quite a few stayed out too.</span> <span id="s542">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s543">But as a rule they had to go.</span> <span id="s544">I was one of the few.</span> <span id="s545">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: You were living then in the French settlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No, it was called the extra territorial settlement, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: After all these people had been taken, the Kadurys, the Hayims and so on had been taken because of their British citizenship how were you able to get along living outside of Hongque district?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well number one at that time all of these Chinese guys got me piano lessons with Chinese and Korean pupils which paid very handsomely.</span> <span id="s550">I do believe that the Jewish refugees supported me also to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s551">I’m not sure, but they might have given me a certain amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Were the students able to come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No.</span> <span id="s554">I came to them.</span> <span id="s555">They could have come to me too, but I went to them.</span> <span id="s556">By the way I did not have the piano at a certain time, because my boyfriend had to move and he took the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: He had to move into the district you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes he had to move into the district.</span> <span id="s559">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s560">By that time we had made up our minds that we would not get married anyway.</span> <span id="s561">But he had to move into the district.</span> <span id="s562">And I gave piano lessons to Chinese, Korean, French, Germans.</span> <span id="s563">And then my boyfriend got himself involved with some people who had a store.</span> <span id="s564">And they most probably had to live in Honhque also.</span> <span id="s565">They most probably had to give up everything and move there, but the store was kept up because maybe it was necessary.</span> <span id="s566">People got permission to work outside the district also.</span> <span id="s567">He had the store and he approached the guy and said, well you know I would like to go into dealing in music, there’s a great demand for it, buying old music, selling it, and he got involved in that.</span> <span id="s568">I helped him with that also, at a certain time, and I got into German circles, now real German circles and gave lessons there again.</span> <span id="s569">And he made money by selling these music books.</span> <span id="s570">Oh no, first it was in a bookstore.</span> <span id="s571">That’s right.</span> <span id="s572">That was a bookstore, and we got Hynaman involved with the music, and we carried that together, that took care of that.</span> <span id="s573">Hynaman had to move into the district, but he kept his business outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: And he had permission to?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: When you say you gave lessons to all these nationals, and German nationals, did you have any difficulty with the German nationals?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No.</span> <span id="s578">In fact the Germans were very helpful to us.</span> <span id="s579">I mean to my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s580">I met most of the Germans through my boyfriend who met them through the bookstore and through Hynaman.</span> <span id="s581">And we were invited to their house and it was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Did you ever have any discussions about...?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No I don’t think we did.</span> <span id="s584">Why should we trample on each other’s feet.</span> <span id="s585">They were diplomatic in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: How did you make yourself understood with all the other nationals?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: They all spoke English.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Did you speak English when you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s590">I didn’t speak it, but I had six years of school English.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So that you felt that you could make yourself pretty much understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I guess in the years you learn anyway.</span> <span id="s593">Even after six years you have a certain working knowledge of the language.</span> <span id="s594">I read a lot of books.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: I was going to ask, did you ever have any moments when the language or lack of language was embarrassing or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I don’t recall because as I said I visited Allis Hayim and I apparently was not tongue tied.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: When the Hongque ghetto was established, was there any feeling either to you or that you knew of among the refugee community of being threatened by the Nazi, you know the Nazis were allies?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: At one time there was talk that they were afraid of yes in fact there was talk at one time that the Japanese had certain gas pellets somewhere stored away and wanted to get away from them I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s599">I don’t know how much, but I heard about it, yes.</span> <span id="s600">The Japanese were kind of cruel to the people.</span> <span id="s601">I mean my boyfriend naturally tried to stay out as long as he could, and he did and he was caught I think for one day he was imprisoned, something like that.</span> <span id="s602">A lot of people got sick due to this very drastic measures, they, the prisons were not exactly hotels.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: What about life within the Hongque ghetto after the Japanese had restricted?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: I don’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s605">They had to be in there at a certain time.</span> <span id="s606">They had to show their passports when they went in and out.</span> <span id="s607">I could go and visit freely anytime I wanted to and I guess Jewish refugees organizations took care of their needs as far as food was concerned, clothing and whatever.</span> <span id="s608">They all took little jobs, they all helped each other.</span> <span id="s609">I think they kept their spirits up.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Were you able to do anything in the way of performing in the ghetto area?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: When you came into the ghetto, what kind of living conditions did you find there?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: As I said, when I visited it was terrible.</span> <span id="s614">Very primitive for the most people.</span> <span id="s615">Their cooking facilities were very often on open fires.</span> <span id="s616">Just very small rooms, and washing dishes you would wash dishes in the bathroom because it was the only sink you had, so to speak.</span> <span id="s617">Toilets were usually community toilets, I mean you had a rooming house where maybe there were ten or twelve families lived, and you can maybe compare it to Harlem if you want to.</span> <span id="s618">The conditions you read about there, it was there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: When you came into the ghetto, how would you describe the morale?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Well you must realize one thing, that the people I visited were people who were more or less were through it and together after so they were all a little bit downcast, but the other hand they were all allowed to work outside, so it wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s621">They tried to improve their living conditions, I mean they were little holes they lived in most of them, I mean the single people I know, it was just was not pleasant to live there, no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: How would you compare, or how would you say that the refugee community associated with either the well the Japanese after the war, with the Chinese people, the local Chinese people?</span> <span id="s623">Any communication?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I couldn’t say.</span> <span id="s625">I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q; Was there between you and the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Was I was naturally, the pupils I had I was invited to their houses.</span> <span id="s628">And when there was a party they were very generous and helpful and also through that Chinese husband of a friend of mine I was always at their parties.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Having come from Europe, having come from a very different culture, how did this affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: It didn’t affect me.</span> <span id="s631">I was in a cocoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Do you think that was true of most of the refugee community too?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s634">I can’t say.</span> <span id="s635">That’s why I say I have so little to add, so little to give, somebody who really went through the mill could really say more.</span> <span id="s636">I don’t consider myself having gone through the mill.</span> <span id="s637">I was just damn lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: When you were in Shanghai did you have access to radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes we had radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did you know what was going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s642">Yes.</span> <span id="s643">Yes we heard radios, we knew about it and I always was under the impression that Hitler never will win, no matter what somebody else said.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No.</span> <span id="s646">No.</span> <span id="s647">No.</span> <span id="s648">I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: How did the end of the war change things for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: End of the war.</span> <span id="s651">Well number one the Americans came into Shanghai.</span> <span id="s652">We opened a certain kind of a sales organization.</span> <span id="s653">They called it a P.X. And the Americans came and they were selling there mostly Chinese silks, jewelry, and what have you.</span> <span id="s654">And I was selling there.</span> <span id="s655">I got myself a job there.</span> <span id="s656">I met a lot of Americans.</span> <span id="s657">One of them I was trustworthy enough.</span> <span id="s658">I gave him a few scarves to send over to my future husband which they delivered.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: When you say your future husband, had you met him in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No.</span> <span id="s661">My future husbands, I say husbands, it happened I married two brothers.</span> <span id="s662">The first one died in ’58 and then I married the other one in ’63.</span> <span id="s663">My brother went to school, there were three boys, I married the younger ones.</span> <span id="s664">My brother went with the oldest one to school, now that one I did not marry, and as I said he went to school with them.</span> <span id="s665">They left in 1921 for this country, and my brother left in ’39 and so did I.</span> <span id="s666">The correspondence was always kept alive through the mothers.</span> <span id="s667">My mother corresponded with my husband’s mother over the years.</span> <span id="s668">That’s how I found money in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s669">And when I was in Shanghai and the war was over the correspondence started again between me and her and she wrote me in one of her last, “Don’t you get married, I have a son who isn’t married yet.”</span> <span id="s670">Okay, so that’s how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: So you gave these American soldiers scarves to send?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: No.</span> <span id="s673">I mean some of them came over and I said where are you from and I said New York and I said I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s674">I have some friends and I would like some of them to get a gift, would you take it?</span> <span id="s675">They took it and they brought it.</span> <span id="s676">Trustworthy people.</span> <span id="s677">Everybody looked at me, how can you do a thing like this.</span> <span id="s678">I mean in retrospect...So that was one of the little things I did, and there was another American young man who I gave my money.</span> <span id="s679">I figured I might have difficulties in taking it out.</span> <span id="s680">He delivered it also.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You were lucky.</span> <span id="s682">Or else you have a good eye for who to trust...</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I was lucky.</span> <span id="s684">I’ll say it again and again.</span> <span id="s685">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s686">I cannot complain actually.</span> <span id="s687">So I met a lot of Americans there and eventually a contact with my brother started.</span> <span id="s688">So my brother naturally said well you have to come here, and so I went and slowly started the procedures.</span> <span id="s689">My brother sent the papers and I went to that stinker official there and that stinker official said that’s not enough we’re not going to let you go, and I told my brother that’s not enough so he sent me the papers of my husband number one.</span> <span id="s690">That was enough.</span> <span id="s691">So then I had to wait, and then I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">: And when did you leave Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What happened between the end of the war and ’47?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: As I said, I started to work at the P.X. and when that folded I thought, now why don’t you get yourself some job with some firms, so I got myself a job with one firm as a secretary, but that didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s696">I didn’t care for that guy there.</span> <span id="s697">Then I got a job with Americans and lasted maybe half a year, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s698">Then they went back to America.</span> <span id="s699">Naturally I was always very well paid, I want you to know that.</span> <span id="s700">Then I got myself a job with an Arabian Jew again.</span> <span id="s701">Arabian, Egyptian, whatever.</span> <span id="s702">He had a dairy farm and I was there in the office, and I had that job till I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Let me ask you, what in some cases the refugees who had come to Shanghai were not able to get jobs why do you think it was easier for you to find jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: I don’t know from what refugees you are talking.</span> <span id="s705">I don’t know what years you are talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Well either the early years, I guess the early years I am talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: If you are talking about when they emigrated here from ’39 to ‘4?</span> <span id="s708">I was not employed in that years, I gave lessons, alright.</span> <span id="s709">So there is a little difference.</span> <span id="s710">I never looked for a job.</span> <span id="s711">I have to say that also, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Was it common then at the end of the war, when the war was over, to find a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I would say that people who knew something could always find a job and I know people who didn’t know anything, always made a buck.</span> <span id="s714">They were just able to do things.</span> <span id="s715">I know somebody who gave lessons or would play in a bar many of them, or in a restaurant, and would make a little money.</span> <span id="s716">The next one would sell something and would buy it and sell it again and make a little bit money.</span> <span id="s717">There was a lot of trading going on.</span> <span id="s718">Actually everyone who had a profession like a doctor or dentist made money and was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Did they make money then from the non – Jewish community?</span> <span id="s720">The non refugee Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Not necessarily, there were enough Jewish people who as I said made their living outside, had money and could support all of the services.</span> <span id="s722">I’m sure my doctor saw as well as Chinese as Jewish, and gentile people.</span> <span id="s723">Definitely.</span> <span id="s724">They also treated people for nothing.</span> <span id="s725">They didn’t get a penny from me and didn’t expect it, never asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: That’s what I meant, was there free I guess from your experience was there an intercommunication between the Chinese and the French, they would go to a German refugee doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s728">The refugee doctors were always well known as good doctors period.</span> <span id="s729">.</span> <span id="s730">So they certainly were preferred.</span> <span id="s731">They had access to the hospitals and were good surgeons, and were well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Did disease, the different foods and disease play a big role?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: It didn’t affect me.</span> <span id="s734">I had once hepatitis, but I got out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Was it hard to adjust to the foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: No.</span> <span id="s737">I wasn’t much of a cook to start with as I said in the beginning we didn’t even have cooking possibilities.</span> <span id="s738">The first two weeks when we lived in Hongque we cooked on a spirit burner... one flame , then you filled it with spirit, gasoline I guess it was.</span> <span id="s739">I cooked and my cooking consisted of rice which I knew how to cook and fruits which I knew how to cook.</span> <span id="s740">A meal consisted of rice and fruits.</span> <span id="s741">That was my big cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: When you ate out did you go to what kind of restaurants?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: When we lived in Hongque the restaurants were mostly German ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: When you say you lived in Hongque, was that before...?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: That was the first two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: That was before it became the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s748">But it was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s749">It always was.</span> <span id="s750">Later it was really named the ghetto, but it always was.</span> <span id="s751">But the Jewish people had already made restaurants, there was one next to the other so to speak, and you could always eat.</span> <span id="s752">It was nice food.</span> <span id="s753">Nice surroundings.</span> <span id="s754">As pleasant as possible.</span> <span id="s755">And when we lived out of that area we went to other restaurants, and they were also German run mostly or European run.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Run by the people who had emigrated under Hitler, or people who had been there before?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Both.</span> <span id="s758">There were lots of Russian people there.</span> <span id="s759">I don’t think we covered it at all in our talk.</span> <span id="s760">The Russian emigration came through the Bolsheviks, and most of the Russians came from Vladivastok.</span> <span id="s761">There was a big, big Russian community there and they had naturally opened a lot of restaurants, bakeries, and stores and all.</span> <span id="s762">So, strangely enough.......(end of tape).</span></p> <p><span id="s763">QL After you left Shanghai, or when you left Shanghai, was there a feeling of disintegration of the Shanghai community?</span> <span id="s764">Did most people leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: A lot of people left Shanghai.</span> <span id="s766">Yes, all my friends left sooner or later, before me, after me, at the same time.</span> <span id="s767">The Arabian Jews left, I mean Allis Hayim went to Hong Kong, Speilman went I think to South America, Parry went to Hong King.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Why was there such a tremendous exit?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Because they left when the Japanese, I mean the communists started to come in.</span> <span id="s770">Hynaman left when the communists came in.</span> <span id="s771">German refugees who made a good living there stayed on to the end.</span> <span id="s772">Like Hynaman who had a bookstore, he only left when the communists came in and I think he was even imprisoned while he was there, and went to Canada then.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did you know at this point what had happened to the rest of your family?</span> <span id="s774">Your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I think I had hoped against hope, but after the war was over and I tried to get in contact the truth came out.</span> <span id="s776">And I found out particulars from my brother in law who was gentile as I mentioned before, and he stayed in Berlin all the time, and he could give me the dates when they were taken and where they were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: This was the husband of your sister who died in childbirth?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Having to leave Shanghai, you were in Shanghai what, eight years?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: I didn’t want to leave, hated to leave, no I didn’t like to leave.</span> <span id="s781">I felt very happy there, I had a boyfriend there, I mean another boyfriend naturally, and I was very well adjusted, but I left, nevertheless.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Was that because you felt you had to leave on account of the communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: No.</span> <span id="s784">No, there were no communists when I left.</span> <span id="s785">Nobody even dreamed of communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: That was in 49?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I left in ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Why did you decide to leave then?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: My brother wanted me to come.</span> <span id="s790">And my boyfriend said, well it’s better for you to leave, look.</span> <span id="s791">It’s the better place to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: How did it feel, you had to leave Germany once, and now after eight years you had to leave Shanghai?</span> <span id="s793">That must be a little difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s795">As I said I left Germany.</span> <span id="s796">I had my boyfriend, so I was twenty one, and at that time you lean towards a boyfriend more than your family, so I knew there was no other way apparently, so I left.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t think it was such a hard thing.</span> <span id="s798">And leaving Shanghai was not such a hard thing either.</span> <span id="s799">I came for my brother.</span> <span id="s800">I was looking forward to seeing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: How did it feel.</span> <span id="s802">You mentioned you had sort of established a (word missing) for yourself.</span> <span id="s803">How did you feel about starting a life for yourself somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Well I came to my brother and see what was happening to him.</span> <span id="s805">And the Americans I had met, and I had spoken to them about how I’m going to meet people, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s806">If you belong to your congregation you will meet people.</span> <span id="s807">So you jump and you see what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: When you came over to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I didn’t like to leave San Francisco either.</span> <span id="s810">Naturally I started in San Francisco and in San Francisco I really didn’t know much people.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: When you came from Shanghai to San Francisco did you come on an American boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s813">An LTD a very small boat.</span> <span id="s814">There were about forty or fifty people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: A passenger boat, or a transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No, kind of a transport boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: What was the voyage like?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Very nice.</span> <span id="s819">Very nice, very enjoyable.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: When you came to San Francisco who met you?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Who met me?</span> <span id="s822">A friend of mine who had left before and gone to San Francisco and my boss’s nephew.</span> <span id="s823">I had worked that time as I said and I left, I emigrated, and he met me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Meaning in the P.X.?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: No.</span> <span id="s826">No in the end I worked for someone who was the owner of a dairy farm, an Egyptian Jew, and his nephew lived in San Francisco and he met me.</span> <span id="s827">I think he was the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Were your intentions always to come to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I never had any intentions.</span> <span id="s830">I was always pushed or shifted or commandeered.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Were you commandeered to come to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Why did you say you did not like to leave San Francisco?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Because I like the city.</span> <span id="s835">A beautiful city.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: About three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: How did you, were you able to bring whatever money you had in Shanghai with you?</span> <span id="s839">Was that sufficient to make it in San Francisco for three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: First of all the immigration department gave me money also.</span> <span id="s841">It was a committee.</span> <span id="s842">I’m just trying to find the name, HIAS.</span> <span id="s843">HIAS paid for the hotel where I stayed.</span> <span id="s844">And I looked to get a job in San Francisco which I couldn’t get in the first three weeks.</span> <span id="s845">So I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Did HIAS give you any help in trying to get a job in San Francisco?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s848">I think they were more or less interested in trying to locate me to my brother push me over there so they have no more responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: When you came to New York, what were your expectations of life in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Another city.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Did your brother meet you?</span> <span id="s852">Did you come across country by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s854">I came by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: What were your impressions?</span> <span id="s856">You had lived in Europe and Shanghai and now you were crossing the United States, how did you feel about here?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: So you travel.</span> <span id="s858">I wasn’t very much keeled over if that’s what you would like to hear.</span> <span id="s859">The only time I was keeled over I think was in Hawaii.</span> <span id="s860">We stopped in Honolulu, and that was the first time in eight years that I could eat fruits without washing them.</span> <span id="s861">Without being afraid, that you had to boil them, or take the skins off or things like this.</span> <span id="s862">That’s what I liked.</span> <span id="s863">Okay, because I even wrote it down.</span> <span id="s864">I mean San Francisco was a nice city, but so what.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: When you came to New York, did you get a job here?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: No.</span> <span id="s867">Who needs a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: How did you manage to support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: I went to my brother where I arrived I think on the thirtieth of June.</span> <span id="s870">At his house.</span> <span id="s871">And he lived in Brooklyn four flights up in a three room hole with a son who at that time must have been nineteen, no it must have been eighteen because he still went to school and I didn’t like it there.</span> <span id="s872">So I arrived on the twenty ninth of June, that’s a big difference, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s873">The first of July, that was two days over, my husband number one came to look me over.</span> <span id="s874">He came with his partner, Sammy Goldstein.</span> <span id="s875">He came to look me over, and on the fifth of July I came to the city, to the office of his, and I don’t think I slept ever again anywhere in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: They invited me, they took me out to their house in the country.</span> <span id="s878">They had a house in the country in Mahopaw.</span> <span id="s879">I stayed there.</span> <span id="s880">I mean the mother of theirs who knew me as a three year old child.</span> <span id="s881">I stayed there, and occasionally I would go to the city and stay at that time brother in law’s house.</span> <span id="s882">Who had a house in Riverdale.</span> <span id="s883">And stayed there, and then I went back to the country, and then I said well maybe I should look for a room.</span> <span id="s884">I looked for a room.</span> <span id="s885">I made the motions, and they said oh you can’t live in that neighborhood...no you can’t live there, well why don’t you live here.</span> <span id="s886">The apartment is big enough.</span> <span id="s887">In the city they had a five room apartment.</span> <span id="s888">It was just her son living there and she herself.</span> <span id="s889">And then he said, oh I don’t know, I think we were invited to a wedding and he took me along.</span> <span id="s890">He was invited, and very naturally he took me along to these people he said oh, that’s my future wife.</span> <span id="s891">I didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: But you were commandeered?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I was commandeered as I said.</span> <span id="s894">That was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Just to go back for a minute when you arrived at your brother’s house in Brooklyn, how did your brother, and your 18 year old nephew receive you?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: They picked me up at the train station.</span> <span id="s897">I guess it was Grand Central Station.</span> <span id="s898">I had one suitcase.</span> <span id="s899">My nephew took my suitcase, my brother took me.</span> <span id="s900">They took me to the subway.</span> <span id="s901">Now it’s a long ride to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s902">He apparently wasn’t very wealthy, so we took the subway.</span> <span id="s903">I’m not very used to this thing.</span> <span id="s904">I was a spoiled brat.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: What did you think of the subway ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: I didn’t think much of it.</span> <span id="s907">But I’m used to subways of that’s what you wanted to know.</span> <span id="s908">I mean Berlin had subways.</span> <span id="s909">You see I’m not coming from a little village.</span> <span id="s910">Nothing could keel me over any more.</span> <span id="s911">It’s big, so it’s a little bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Did your nephew, well he was born here, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: No, my nephew was born in Berlin and when he was about nine or ten years old he went to England, and after two years he went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: By this time did he feel himself Americanized?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s916">He was Americanized I’m sure.</span> <span id="s917">He went to Peter Stuyvesant High School.</span> <span id="s918">He must have been the last year when I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Did you continue with your music here?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: I got married right away.</span> <span id="s921">As I said I started in June, in November I got married.</span> <span id="s922">In December I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s923">In October my first child was born...</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Where did you live at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Riverside Drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: This was the apartment that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s928">Washington Heights near the Hebrew Tabernacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Oh near the Hebrew Tabernacle?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: That’s how the whole thing is, we are members of the Hebrew Tabernacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: When you first settled down here this was a different kind of life than you had lived up to now.</span> <span id="s932">How did you feel about being a young mother in Washington Heights?</span> <span id="s933">Were you among mostly refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s935">I didn’t like Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s936">I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: I had very little in common with all these people.</span> <span id="s939">First of all I was considered an outsider.</span> <span id="s940">I didn’t run around with a Mogen David so everybody thought I was a German girl.</span> <span id="s941">And people were a little nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: You mean the German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes, were really nasty.</span> <span id="s944">And I didn’t like it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Did you explain that you had been in Shanghai and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: You can’t tell it to every strange person.</span> <span id="s947">You go into a dry cleaning store and you get your stuff, you can’t tell I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s948">I mean in the course of conversation with your neighbor you might say it, all of a sudden you will see how a face lights up and a disposition changes.</span> <span id="s949">And then you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: They understand.</span> <span id="s951">In terms of your music did you ever, even after your children were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I tried to play the piano, in fact I tried to take lessons and when I was supposed to come to my very first lesson my husband got very seriously sick so that took care of that.</span> <span id="s953">That was in ’48, and then I put it aside.</span> <span id="s954">After nine years or eight years I decided now it is time the kids are a little bit bigger, let’s see what you can do now.</span> <span id="s955">I started again.</span> <span id="s956">It took about ten months and then my husband died, and then I said goodbye.</span> <span id="s957">Then I stopped completely.</span> <span id="s958">Now I’m trying to play again.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Did you participate in the time you were married, did you go to concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Orchestra concerts, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Did you ever take lessons yourself to get back?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: That’s what I’m just saying.</span> <span id="s963">That’s the two attempts I made.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: When you started to take these lessons who did you take them with?</span> <span id="s965">I mean was it someone from the German community.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: The first gentleman was a German, but I never even met him.</span> <span id="s967">I only spoke to him over the telephone and as I said it was supposed to be the first lesson and then my husband got very seriously sick so I never met the guy.</span> <span id="s968">He was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s969">The second guy was a Russian Jew, a Russian American I found out about.</span> <span id="s970">In my building there was a young fellow living who played the piano and I asked him to give lessons to my son which he did, and in the course of conversation I asked him with whom he was taking lessons and what this guy’s teaching him, and it sounded interesting to me so I got in contact with this guy.</span> <span id="s971">I was very pleased.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Were most of your friends during those years part of the refugee community?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Washington Height?</span> <span id="s974">Friends.</span> <span id="s975">I had no friends.</span> <span id="s976">Those were all taken over from my husband the friends we had.</span> <span id="s977">Not from the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: They were not from the community?</span> <span id="s979">They were American”</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: They were Americans and they were friends from the early, early years.</span> <span id="s981">People he knew from Germany yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: He came much earlier then?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: He came in ’21.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Would you say that today after living here thirty years now are most of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: I’m not assimilated.</span> <span id="s986">I have no friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: You say you are not assimilated.</span> <span id="s988">Of the people you associate with would you say you associate more with Americans or?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: I would even say I do not associate with people.</span> <span id="s990">Sounds strange doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: No.</span> <span id="s992">Do you consider yourself more an American or a member of the German Jewish community in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: I do not consider myself of the German Jewish community in New York.</span> <span id="s994">No.</span> <span id="s995">I don’t consider myself an American either.</span> <span id="s996">I consider myself a member of the world.</span> <span id="s997">It’s very funny.</span> <span id="s998">I just spoke the other day, I’m at this point I was approached and I’m giving German lessons to a lady, I mean lessons is a big word I’m having conversation, and she is Romanian born and she asked me something similar to that and that’s why I was able to give the answer fast.</span> <span id="s999">Because she said you know I’m living here a number of years and I’m not Americanized and I just do not have anything in common with American people.</span> <span id="s1000">She says she feels much better in Europe.</span> <span id="s1001">No matter where, but Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Have you been back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: I was back to Europe once, in ’69, ’70.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Was it in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I visited my brother in law in Germany.</span> <span id="s1006">I visited my nephew who was at that time in Nuremberg, and I visited another nephew in Hamburg and I visited friends in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: How did you feel about going back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: I didn’t go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1009">I visited my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: How did you feel when you were visiting your family, did you come into contact with any other Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I looked up a few of my older teachers and visited with them who were very friendly, very courteous, very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s1012">And felt terrible that they couldn’t hide my girl friend, that she had to perish.</span> <span id="s1013">That’s stupid, but that didn’t change the matter.</span> <span id="s1014">She is done.</span> <span id="s1015">And....</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: The reason I ask that is that I was wondering after all that experience, how you felt about being back there, meeting them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: I don’t hold people responsible.</span> <span id="s1018">Alright.</span> <span id="s1019">I do not carry a hate towards the Germans.</span> <span id="s1020">Neither would I carry a hate for the Jewish guy in the concentration camp who chose me to go to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: I terms of your son, you said you consider yourself more a citizen of the world or at least more comfortable in Europe....</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No I didn’t say that I felt more comfortable in Europe, that I don’t know, but I do feel myself a member of the world so to speak.</span> <span id="s1023">I do not feel an alliance to any particular country, I don’t feel myself German.</span> <span id="s1024">I don’t think I ever felt myself German due to the fact that I never was German.</span> <span id="s1025">I was never accepted.</span> <span id="s1026">So I never was German.</span> <span id="s1027">I certainly couldn’t feel I was Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: But in terms of your children, do you feel they are American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1030">Yes.</span> <span id="s1031">I think at one time, I don’t know when maybe many years ago I said it would be a very good idea if you would take yourself off and go to some other country and make a living there.</span> <span id="s1032">Why should we leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Do you think you were a different mother than anyone you knew who was an American mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yes, I expected more from my children, I saw to it that they had more values in life, cultural wise, I saw to it that they were interested in educational things, got some educational toys only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Do you think this was different from your American counterpart?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1037">The American mothers would not direct their children that much to museums, not that much to concerts or operas, not insist on their being culturally enriched.</span> <span id="s1038">My kids went to private schools and I still remember the uproar of the mothers, why do they have to learn about music, they had a music course there.</span> <span id="s1039">Why spend so much time for that.</span> <span id="s1040">Why do they have to make homework for that?</span> <span id="s1041">And that was better American people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Where did your sons go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Barnard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: In looking back, what would you think was the greatest adjustment that you had to make when you came here, or when you went to Shanghai, I should ask it both ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: In Shanghai, yes, being without my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Was that hard for you in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: I would say so, yes.</span> <span id="s1048">Yes...Here?</span> <span id="s1049">I don’t know what adjustments I had to make here.</span> <span id="s1050">I really can’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Did you work here at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: When you say the greatest adjustment in Shanghai was being without your mother, why do you think, without knowing what would eventually happen, why do you think that was a great adjustment for you?</span> <span id="s1054">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Because I was used to her taking care of all my personal needs.</span> <span id="s1056">Here it was myself and I had to sew my button on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: You mean in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Yes, I couldn’t say here sew my button on, or shorten my dress, or make me a dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: It was the first time you were kind of on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: In terms of your life now.</span> <span id="s1062">How do you feel about Jewish successes in American politics, like Javits?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: I think it’s disgusting that there are so many Jewish people in our New York government, in leading positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Because it only brings more anger and more hate out.</span> <span id="s1066">(unable to translate) Koch can’t do so good because the economic situation just isn’t, can’t be good, no matter what they will try and it goes back to us as Jews.</span> <span id="s1067">That is my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Again, in looking back, do you think your life, this is a very hard question, do you think your life would have been very different had you, lived in Germany the entire time, had you not gone to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Well I wouldn’t be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: No I meant if nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1071">If the Nazis had not come to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: It would have been a lot different, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: In what way do you think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: I might have succeeded in my musical career.</span> <span id="s1075">If this would be better I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1076">Basically I think I was happier being a mother.</span> <span id="s1077">I don’t think I am what you would call a career woman.</span> <span id="s1078">I don’t think I would be 100 per cent happy and fulfilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: But you think you might have succeeded in that, where here there was no possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Shanghai killed it already.</span> <span id="s1081">Even the break into Shanghai from Germany already killed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: In what way, I’m not so well versed what happens to a musician when...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Well when you are taking off from a certain teacher it’s very hard to get used to a different teacher, number one, to find another teacher, I wasn’t a beginner.</span> <span id="s1084">I was pretty far ahead.</span> <span id="s1085">To find somebody I would like to take guidance is already a difficult thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Did you find anybody in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I didn’t even look there strangely, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Then the break was between ’38, ’39 and 1950 almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: When you describe your being (words missing) in growing up...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: It didn’t hinder me at all, it didn’t affect me...I think at one point I had to go to the German police department, I think it was for doing the papers for my teacher examination, I think, and I gave them proof that my father was active in the German World War 1 and that cleared the whole matter up and that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: You mean he had been a (words missing), a soldier, whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: He was in one way or another connected.</span> <span id="s1093">He was listed in something, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: But you always felt you were accepted as a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
