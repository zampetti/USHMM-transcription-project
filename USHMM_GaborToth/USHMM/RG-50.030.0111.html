id="s23">Uh...He now lives in New York.</span> <span id="s24">He's an international writer.</span> <span id="s25">His...his studies were...he had a Ph.D in...uh...international...uh...international...he was an international lawyer in international law.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What...How...Where did you live?</span> <span id="s27">What was it like for you as a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: We lived in a very large apartment.</span> <span id="s29">My parents were very lively, had a very lively...uh...environment.</span> <span id="s30">I was...uh...taken care of by a nurse maid.</span> <span id="s31">Uh...We had a lot of company.</span> <span id="s32">My parents went to the theater, to the...to the opera, to concerts, and I started to go to the theatre very early in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Uh...Besides theatre, what kinds of other things did you do as a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I learned how to read when I was...uh...4 years old.</span> <span id="s35">And I read a lot.</span> <span id="s36">And I walked a lot.</span> <span id="s37">We went in parks.</span> <span id="s38">Uh...I played with my little friends.</span> <span id="s39">I went to art school.</span> <span id="s40">Uh...It was called Czisek Art School, and it was specially for little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What about being Jewish in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I can't really answer this question in general.</span> <span id="s43">I can only answer this for my family.</span> <span id="s44">Uh...We were culturally contingeous Jews, but we did not practice any religious rites, and we didn't go...have Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s45">I went...from the time on I went to school, I had religion in school.</span> <span id="s46">I learned about the Bible, and I learned how to read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s47">Uh...And I went...I was once in a play...uh...when I was about 7 years old, and...uh...it was about Esther.</span> <span id="s48">(Long Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: As the Nazis began coming to power...uh...in Germany,...uh...did that affect your life at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s51">At that time, we...my father had moved his family: my brother, myself, and my mother to Berlin.</span> <span id="s52">He was editor of the newspaper in Berlin, and when the Nazis came to power, we lived in.</span> <span id="s53">.</span> <span id="s54">in the capital of Germany.</span> <span id="s55">He was very...uh... endangered because he was...uh...uh...on the Nazi blacklist as a liberal writer and journalist.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: What did that mean for you....your family, that he was on the blacklist?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, I didn't know that at the time.</span> <span id="s58">My parents didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s59">Uh...I only knew that we packed in a hurry and left Berlin as soon as possible which was easy for us because we had Austrian passports.</span> <span id="s60">And...uh...the laws about German Jews did not apply to us.</span> <span id="s61">So we went back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s62">Uh...My father had lost his job.</span> <span id="s63">Uh...And so we had to...our life became very restricted from that time on.</span> <span id="s64">We lived with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s65">My grandfather was a pediatrician.</span> <span id="s66">Uh...My mother's...that's my mother's father.</span> <span id="s67">My father's father had died.</span> <span id="s68">He had been a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: When we came back to Vienna, we...uh...my brother and I went to schools...uh... There was no language difficulty and...uh...we continued school life until...uh...my...but my father had great difficulties finding a job.</span> <span id="s71">Uh...He was...uh... he resented the...uh...anti-Semitism in...in ...in Austria.</span> <span id="s72">Uh...It was undercover, but it was there and so after he tried very hard to with all kinds of various jobs, he decided he's going to leave Austria and he went to Prague to establish himself there.</span> <span id="s73">So when the Nazis came to Austria, our family was separated.</span> <span id="s74">My father was in Prague, and my mother and my brother and I were in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Uh...At this point, of course,...uh...everybody was very worried, and...uh.</span> <span id="s77">.</span> <span id="s78">my father wanted us to come to Prague, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s79">Somehow, I cannot give you the details, but we didn't get permission and we didn't get permission to go anyplace.</span> <span id="s80">My mother tried everywhere, and my father was frantic and he...he suggested that we meet in Addis Ababa or in Martinque just so that we could be reunited again.</span> <span id="s81">And then finally he got a visa from Prague to...uh...France, and he moved from...to France, hoping that that he would have it easier to have his family follow, but it turned out that the French did not...uh.</span> <span id="s82">.</span> <span id="s83">permit us to come.</span> <span id="s84">And...uh...uh...so one day...uh...my father just said...In the meantime, the Nazi laws applied to Austria, and...uh...my father recognized the danger, and...uh...said we had...just had to leave at all cost.</span> <span id="s85">And...uh...we...uh...we took a bus from Baden Baden in Germany that made an excursion into France, Strasbourg, then came back to Baden Baden, and we intended to leave the bus in Strasbourg, but we were very foolish because...uh...we didn't take much but we had one piece of luggage for the three of us.</span> <span id="s86">And, of course, when we came across the border that piece of luggage was...uh...discovered, and...uh...people asked, "Whose luggage is it?"</span> <span id="s87">And we said, "It's ours," and then they they said, "You...you weren't going to visit the Cathedral of Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s88">You were going to come illegally to France and they stamped our passport and sent us back to Germany.</span> <span id="s89">And...uh...my father said to my mother, you have to try again, and we went to...uh...we went to...uh...uh... Can you cut it off please?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: It's okay.</span> <span id="s91">Let's put it back it on.</span> <span id="s92">You are about to try again.</span> <span id="s93">Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s95">I..</span> <span id="s96">.</span> <span id="s97">We went to Saarbrucken and...uh...wanted to go to France from Saabricken, and this was already the...the...this was the days of the Munich Acccord, and you could feel the tension in both countries and the...the troops on the frontiers and when we came to the...uh...railroad station, there was an SS man and he said, "I know what you want.</span> <span id="s98">You want to go illegally to France.</span> <span id="s99">You won't make it."</span> <span id="s100">And my mother said, "Let us try it."</span> <span id="s101">And he said, "Okay, I'll let you try it, but if you come back you will be sent to Dachau."</span> <span id="s102">And so we went over without a visa to France, and, of course, we were caught.</span> <span id="s103">There were more police in France than ever.</span> <span id="s104">And we were caught and we were put into prison, and then we were put back on the train again and when we arrived the next day it was, I think, at the station in Forbach....No.</span> <span id="s105">Excuse me....at the station in Saarbrucken, the same SS man was there and he...it was like... He smiled like I told you so.</span> <span id="s106">And then we were put into separate rooms and we were... I don't know what happened exactly to my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s107">I know they were beaten.</span> <span id="s108">I know I was stripped completely and a little...little beaten.</span> <span id="s109">And...uh...then I was...we were released and we were thinking now we are on our way to Dachau.</span> <span id="s110">And I can't explain it but somehow they gave us an opportunity to escape and we ran and we escaped.</span> <span id="s111">And...uh...We found ourselves together again outside the railroad station and...uh...my mother contacted my father in Paris and he said, "Go to Cologne and try to get a visa from the Consul there.</span> <span id="s112">I am going to contact him and I hope he will give you the visa."</span> <span id="s113">And my mother went to with us to Cologne, but the Consul did not give her a visa.</span> <span id="s114">He...I wasn't with my mother so I don't know exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s115">We were...uh...waiting for her.</span> <span id="s116">When she came back, she was crushed, completely...completely crushed.</span> <span id="s117">She was a changed person.</span> <span id="s118">She...At this...by this time, of course, you realize we had been...uh...always in the same clothes and had not changed and...uh...had not had the opportunity to...uh...have any... uh...semblance of human life.</span> <span id="s119">And...uh...she was completely...she dissolved and...and she decided we had to go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s120">This was the only way we could survive.</span> <span id="s121">And...uh...She went in this state in the middle...she didn't want to show it to us, I think, how...how desperate she was.</span> <span id="s122">And so she went to...to sit on a..</span> <span id="s123">.</span> <span id="s124">a..</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">in a little place in Cologne in the middle of Cologne and I only know by her story what happened.</span> <span id="s127">I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s128">Uh...uh...Secretary from the...uh...Embassy arrived and asked her, "Aren't you the lady that wanted the visa?"</span> <span id="s129">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s130">And he said, "Well, do you have any jewelry?"</span> <span id="s131">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s132">And he said, "Well, maybe we can do something."</span> <span id="s133">And so she traded all her jewelry and got three visas, and we were on our way to the airport before you could say anything and we...uh...arrived in Paris and my father was there and I think I'll never forget walking into the airport in Paris into freedom.</span> <span id="s134">And...uh...my father took us to a little hotel and we...uh...we stayed there...uh...in the middle of town and I remember being very...uh...hungry all the time because we had very little to...money.</span> <span id="s135">My father had...had no job and...but soon after that, he...uh...managed to make a newspaper, a newsletter, not a newspaper, a newsletter.</span> <span id="s136">He wrote it all himself, a little bit like the Kiplinger Newsletter, about economic situation in Western Europe and...uh...he got people to subscribe to it and he had a..</span> <span id="s137">.</span> <span id="s138">uh...multiplication machine and...uh...he...he sent out his newsletter.</span> <span id="s139">I..</span> <span id="s140">.</span> <span id="s141">I..</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">I did the technical part, the photocopying and making of the newspaper, and we were able to live from his income and soon we had...uh...a little apartment and...uh...my brother went to school and...uh...everything seemed...uh...to pick up except that we were very worried about our family that we had left behind.</span> <span id="s144">My father...my grandfather....uh...was...because he was a doctor was not allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s145">He was under strict orders to stay in Vienna and take care of the sick.</span> <span id="s146">And if he had tried to leave he would have been arrested.</span> <span id="s147">My other grandmother...uh.</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">lived with...uh...my father's brother and they tried to go to England, and my mother's sister...uh...her husband was actually put into Dachau concentration camp on... on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s150">And so we had cause to worry.</span> <span id="s151">And...uh...in the end, my family was able to go out of...uh...Austria in various ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Tell me...tell me about...a little more about life in Paris.</span> <span id="s153">Uh...I believe you had someone living with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Uh...Well, as soon as we had the apartment...uh...we tried to help other people who had no apartments and...uh...no place because as...when you pass through such...uh...events, you...you feel fortunate when you get a little...a little something already.</span> <span id="s155">And so...uh...my Latin teacher, for instance, who...who left Austria... And she was...she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s156">She was...uh...she was Catholic, but she had a Jewish boyfriend, and was anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s157">And so she wanted to leave Austria.</span> <span id="s158">She came to our place and stayed with us until she had a job.</span> <span id="s159">And it's...she had a job offer from a little village in France...uh...the name of which we had, of course, never heard before, and it turned out that her...she was going to teach German in Le Chambon Feugerolles.</span> <span id="s160">And then we had other people sleeping in our place, whoever had no home.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What did you do during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Uh...I wanted to go to art school.</span> <span id="s163">I always wanted to be an artist.</span> <span id="s164">And so I took an examination to...for an arts school and prayed that I would be accepted, and I did get accepted.</span> <span id="s165">It was a question then to...uh...pay because schools in France are essentially free.</span> <span id="s166">So it wasn't much.</span> <span id="s167">And...uh...I just...uh...had...uh...some lady helped me with the paying of it.</span> <span id="s168">So I went to the art school and...uh...that was...I was very thankful for that.</span> <span id="s169">I had a wonderful...uh...experience.</span> <span id="s170">My brother went to boarding school too.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: When and how did things begin to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: It became...it...with the declaration of war between...uh...Germany and France on...in...uh...I would like to add too that in the period just before I..</span> <span id="s173">I met a young student who, a Czech student, who today is my husband.</span> <span id="s174">And...uh...he...he at this time, he was a student in Paris, and he liked to come to our house and discuss politics with my father.</span> <span id="s175">And...uh...when the war was declared, I would...I have to add something that is more general now because our situation in...in France was ambiguous for the French because we were Austrians, and Austrians were Germans.</span> <span id="s176">So we were part of the enemy.</span> <span id="s177">On the other hand, they did understand vaguely that anti-Nazis could not really be an enemy, so it was very difficult for them to apply enemy laws to these types of refugees that came to France.</span> <span id="s178">But...and it depended actually on the individual...how he interpreted the laws.</span> <span id="s179">So when the...uh...war was declared on September, the 3rd, 1940...No...Excuse me...1939...uh...There immediately, there was a mobilization of the French population and also there was a call for foreign nationals who were non-enemies to...uh...help the French effort to fight the war.</span> <span id="s180">Now...uh...My father would have joined it, but he was not allowed to join it.</span> <span id="s181">He was...the Austrian men, my father and my brother, were considered enemy aliens at this point, and they were ordered to go into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s182">So my brother and my father had to go into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s183">They were not together.</span> <span id="s184">My brother was in one camp, and my father was in another.</span> <span id="s185">The...the women were left outside so my mother and I stayed in Paris.</span> <span id="s186">Uh...The Czech student, whose name is Ernest, engaged himself into the Czech army that...the Czech army in exile, and he...we were all wanting to help the war effort to fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s187">And also we didn't think it would...uh...the Nazis would win.</span> <span id="s188">I..</span> <span id="s189">.</span> <span id="s190">I mean at this point we were convinced we're going to save...uh...the world from Nazism.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Your father is...your father and brother are in camps.</span> <span id="s194">You are outside the camps.</span> <span id="s195">How did you live at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: You know that is a good question.</span> <span id="s197">I hardly know how to answer.</span> <span id="s198">Uh...My...my mother...uh...my mother had, in her youth when she was about 20 years old...uh...helped my grandfather to take care of the wounded in World War I, so she had a little bit of nursing training.</span> <span id="s199">And...uh...she then went and by word of mouth tried to do some nursing and she got money from ...from that.</span> <span id="s200">And...uh...in France...I..</span> <span id="s201">.</span> <span id="s202">you...I went...wanted to do babysitting or teaching languages or whatever, but in France...uh...there isn't no...you don't...do babysitting.</span> <span id="s203">At that time, you didn't do babysitting.</span> <span id="s204">You were a nurse maid.</span> <span id="s205">But you didn't do babysitting in the evenings like you do it in America.</span> <span id="s206">And I didn't want to give up school, so...uh... I had just a few occupations, a few times that I could earn money and I tried by all means to do it, but it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s207">We lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s208">That's the answer.</span> <span id="s209">And...uh...as a matter of fact, there's a..</span> <span id="s210">.</span> <span id="s211">there's a very funny story, but I am not going to go into it.</span> <span id="s212">You want me to.</span> <span id="s213">Uh...In school, we had...uh...party.</span> <span id="s214">And...uh...I was told, "Oh, Elizabeth comes from Vienna.</span> <span id="s215">Bring us a Viennese cake.</span> <span id="s216">And my mother was able to do it, but we didn't have the money to buy the ingrediences, so how are we going to do this Viennese cake without saying that we don't have the money?</span> <span id="s217">I don't remember any more how we solved the problem.</span> <span id="s218">I remember that...uh...I was terribly embarrassed.</span> <span id="s219">And another story is that...uh...we had a Spanish girl in the school and...uh...in France, it was...we...there were a lot of Spanish refugees at this time.</span> <span id="s220">And, of course, I felt close to this girl because she was in my opinion a co-sufferer, and we got to be very, very good and close friend.</span> <span id="s221">Her...her name is Maria.</span> <span id="s222">And at one time, Maria invites me to her house.</span> <span id="s223">And...uh...I look at her address and it was the Rond Point des Champs Elyssees and...uh... Okay, I..</span> <span id="s224">.</span> <span id="s225">another thing is I never had enough money for metro, so I walked a lot and also later I got myself a bicycle.</span> <span id="s226">But at this particular point, I..</span> <span id="s227">.</span> <span id="s228">I walked to the Rond Point, and when I came to the address it...it was the French Embassy.</span> <span id="s229">And...uh...I was very astounded and I rang the bell and the bell...door was open and I walk in and in front of me is the portrait...of...of Franco, an enormous portrait of Franco, and I got very frightened, but I say, "Okay."</span> <span id="s230">I walk in and I turn around and upstairs is my little girlfriend, Maria, say, "Come up.</span> <span id="s231">Come up."</span> <span id="s232">And I walk up, and there's a tremendous portrait of Hitler.</span> <span id="s233">And I walk up, and my little girlfriend, Maria, was the daughter of the French...of the Spanish Ambassador.</span> <span id="s234">(Pause) By the way, he became Ambassador to America later.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You were in this limbo for awhile.</span> <span id="s236">Did your father come back from the internment camp at this point?</span> <span id="s237">What happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s239">And...uh...meantime, we went visiting my...I went visiting my brother once.</span> <span id="s240">I couldn't visit my father, but he was released from camp.</span> <span id="s241">My brother was...uh...not released, and he was released from camp.</span> <span id="s242">I don't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Tell me about the visit to your brother.</span> <span id="s244">You have drawn a picture of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, I..</span> <span id="s246">.</span> <span id="s247">that...that is why I got a bicycle.</span> <span id="s248">I had to...I wanted to visit my brother and...uh...somebody was selling a bicycle and so I figured it would be much less if I bought a bicycle and go instead of taking the train.</span> <span id="s249">So I bought this bicycle, which I named Barthalemus, and I went to see my brother.</span> <span id="s250">And I got permission.</span> <span id="s251">It was very rare that people got permission to visit.</span> <span id="s252">And I was very happy to do this.</span> <span id="s253">I was very happy to see my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So your brother remained in camp, however?</span> <span id="s255">He was not released?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No.</span> <span id="s257">My...my father was released, maybe because of his age?</span> <span id="s258">I don't really know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Can you describe his coming home?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Oh, it...one day he appeared.</span> <span id="s261">It was completely unexpected.</span> <span id="s262">He appeared and we just...it was like...like sunshine coming back.</span> <span id="s263">(Laughter) It was great, and I remember all he wanted is to take a bath...uh, read his newspaper, and have a good meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: When did things change for you yet again?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: And then...uh...he didn't stay long.</span> <span id="s266">My father didn't stay long because he had to engage himself in to what was called Camp de Prestataire which was part of the French Army unit actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">It was the same thing as a concentration camp, only it was called Prestataire, and the other difference is...is then we got...uh...a little compensation from the French government for his being...uh...engaged so to speak as a Prestataire.</span> <span id="s268">It was ...uh....it was not any more a prisoner.</span> <span id="s269">It was...uh...you were engaged in taking part in the war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s271">So your father was more or less in this service?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Uh...When did things begin to get a little worse?</span> <span id="s274">What...what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Uh...Well, things got worse when...uh...things got worse for France.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s277">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Uh...We had...we had...uh...the Germans advanced.</span> <span id="s279">In the beginning, it was called the Drole de Guerre because nothing happened.</span> <span id="s280">And then in...in the springtime, the Germans advanced and...uh...the unexpected happened.</span> <span id="s281">They weren't...they weren't....they were victorious.</span> <span id="s282">Nobody had imagined that.</span> <span id="s283">They conquered Belgium.</span> <span id="s284">They conquered Northern France.</span> <span id="s285">And...uh.</span> <span id="s286">.</span> <span id="s287">we couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s288">At one point, you could hear the...the cannons and...uh...and...uh...the...the streets and everything in Paris were dark...of course, darkened, and you could hear the bombs.</span> <span id="s289">And it was frightening, and people started running away.</span> <span id="s290">Most of the French people had a place in the...in Southern France somewhere and or grandparents and knew where to go, but people like us didn't know where to go, so we couldn't make any plans, but also we couldn't make any plans because the police did not let us travel.</span> <span id="s291">And...uh...we were told by our conciege that we should not even think of leaving our apartment in Paris, because she would...uh...notify the police.</span> <span id="s292">And...uh.</span> <span id="s293">.</span> <span id="s294">so we were under...under observation, and we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s295">In the end, when the pressure became so...I mean...by pressure, I mean we realized the Germans are going to be in Paris in 2 days.</span> <span id="s296">Uh...We decided we are going to leave.</span> <span id="s297">And...uh...we didn't know where my brother were...was, and nor where my father was.</span> <span id="s298">Uh...We...we assumed that my father was...uh...somewhere fighting perhaps or in the work camp, and my brother equally and...uh...but we didn't know where they were, and we didn't know where to go and we had no means of going any place except the bicycle.</span> <span id="s299">So we decided the following: My mother would go on foot.</span> <span id="s300">She would make auto stop, and I would follow her wherever she would go.</span> <span id="s301">And...uh...so I wouldn't have a..</span> <span id="s302">.</span> <span id="s303">a destination except the destination where the car that would accept her would take her.</span> <span id="s304">That would be my destiny and our destiny.</span> <span id="s305">And it...we...we didn't imagine the difficulty of carrying out this plan, but we went to the Port d'Orleans in the south of Paris, which was uh...group.</span> <span id="s306">already filled with people leaving and it's very difficult to even recognize the layout.</span> <span id="s307">And...uh...But quickly I got a..</span> <span id="s308">.</span> <span id="s309">a car for my mother.</span> <span id="s310">I..</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">My mother was too shy to do the auto stopping herself, and...uh...so I did it for her.</span> <span id="s313">And then I put her into the car, and then I quickly asked the driver where he was going as he rolled away, and he said, Rambouillet and so I took my bicycle and all I knew is...was my mother was on the way to Rambouillet.</span> <span id="s314">And as I bicycled I realized I don't know where in Rambouillet I am going to meet her.</span> <span id="s315">Also there were more than one road to go to Rambouillet, so she could be in the north, or east or west of Rambouillet.</span> <span id="s316">Fortunately, by almost a miracle I found her at the entrance of Rambouillet.</span> <span id="s317">I was looking at every car and I can't tell you today how come I found her.</span> <span id="s318">I found her.</span> <span id="s319">It's not very far from Paris.</span> <span id="s320">And...uh...We stayed the night there at a very poor woman's house who was very...uh...uh...to whom we were very thankful for taking us in.</span> <span id="s321">We slept at her house and the next day, the voyage started all over again.</span> <span id="s322">But we had learned to be a little more precise about our destination.</span> <span id="s323">So we said when the...the next person says where he is going, we will meet at the Marie, at the city hall of this particular village, because every village in France has a city hall.</span> <span id="s324">So the next time, I..</span> <span id="s325">.</span> <span id="s326">uh...I think it was...we went to Chauteaudun, and then we met in Chauteaudun.</span> <span id="s327">And it was at the city hall and again we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s328">We met somebody who offered us...uh...a..</span> <span id="s329">.</span> <span id="s330">a place in his house to sleep.</span> <span id="s331">And the next day, my mother...we went to...oh, I think...no, the next... Excuse me, I..</span> <span id="s332">.</span> <span id="s333">I think I am mixing it up.</span> <span id="s334">The next day we went to Chatres, and there's a..</span> <span id="s335">.</span> <span id="s336">Yes.</span> <span id="s337">And somehow I went much faster than my mother because of the....the roads were all clogged with people and...uh...the bicycle could go in and out and the...the cars were stuck.</span> <span id="s338">So, I arrived at...uh...Chatres earlier than my mother and...uh...I waited for her.</span> <span id="s339">And then...as she came, at the moment she came, there was...uh...uh...bombing attack, and we had to run into the shelter.</span> <span id="s340">And I remember taking my mother's hand and leaving the bicycle outside and taking my mother's hand and running into the shelter.</span> <span id="s341">And when we came out of the shelter 2, 3 hours later, there was two policemen standing next to my bicycle and they said, "Is this your bicycle?"</span> <span id="s342">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s343">And they said, "You're a German spy."</span> <span id="s344">And I said, "I am not a German spy."</span> <span id="s345">And they said, "What's this?"</span> <span id="s346">And showed me.</span> <span id="s347">.</span> <span id="s348">in my...I had taken along in my...my musette, I had taken along Ernest's passport.</span> <span id="s349">I had taken along Goethe's Faust, and I had...and something else that indicated to them that I am...I had some German origins and they arrested my mother and myself and put us in jail.</span> <span id="s350">And...uh...I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s351">I said, "What...what are you doing?</span> <span id="s352">I mean I..</span> <span id="s353">.</span> <span id="s354">We're just trying to flee from the Germans, and you say I am a German spy."</span> <span id="s355">I couldn't believe it, but they didn't listen.</span> <span id="s356">And...uh...somehow...uh...at 5 o'clock in the morning, they opened the cell and they said, "The Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s357">The Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s358">Run away."</span> <span id="s359">And I took my mother, and we ran away, literally.</span> <span id="s360">I even found my bicycle, and...uh...then we went to Chateaudun.</span> <span id="s361">And then from Chateaudun, the next day...we...the next day we...we said we are going to Blois if possible because we were depending on...we couldn't say at anytime where we wanted to go, only where....where we could go.</span> <span id="s362">Right?</span> <span id="s363">So, I..</span> <span id="s364">.</span> <span id="s365">when my mother got into a car, this car went to Vendome.</span> <span id="s366">So I was supposed to meet her in Vendome and I came to Vendome.</span> <span id="s367">And at that time the...the roads were clear and I expected my mother to be in Vendome before me because with a bicycle you go slower than with a car, but she wasn't there.</span> <span id="s368">And I was worried and...uh...but I didn't have much time for worrying because a bombardment started again and...uh... a man came to me and said you have to...to leave where you are in front of the...uh...city hall to go and go into shelter.</span> <span id="s369">And I said, "I can't go into shelter.</span> <span id="s370">I am waiting for my mother."</span> <span id="s371">He said, "You can't stay here.</span> <span id="s372">It's not allowed.</span> <span id="s373">You have to go into the shelter."</span> <span id="s374">So I put a big piece of paper with my mother's name and telling her that I was in the shelter, and then I went to the shelter.</span> <span id="s375">And when I came out of the shelter, the piece of paper was gone and my mother wasn't there.</span> <span id="s376">So I couldn't understand anything, and I was pretty upset because my mother perhaps had seen it, but she hadn't come to the shelter or she hadn't waited for me.</span> <span id="s377">What was I supposed to do?</span> <span id="s378">She wasn't there.</span> <span id="s379">And the Germans were going to come.</span> <span id="s380">So in my being so upset, I..</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">uh...looked at the....I don't think I had a map, but I must have looked at something that shown me that the camp of my father was only 3 or 4 miles away from where I was.</span> <span id="s383">So I decided that I'm going to see if I cannot find my father and then come back to this place in Vendome.</span> <span id="s384">Or go to Blois where we said we would be together this evening.</span> <span id="s385">So I left a note again at the Marie saying that I am on the way to look for my father.</span> <span id="s386">If it is late, I will go back to Blois and find her at the Marie in Blois.</span> <span id="s387">And when I came to the place where my father was supposed to be, there was...the camp was empty.</span> <span id="s388">And I found one officer there who packed his luggage and he said Yes, your father was here about 4 hours ago.</span> <span id="s389">He...he went with his...uh...group.</span> <span id="s390">Uh...He went into this and this direction, and you probably can catch them if you bicycle fast.</span> <span id="s391">So I was torn between trying to find my father and going to Blois as I had promised my mother.</span> <span id="s392">And I thought I would find my father for sure, but I wouldn't find my mother perhaps.</span> <span id="s393">Perhaps I wouldn't find my mother.</span> <span id="s394">And so I decided to go to where my father was.</span> <span id="s395">And I bicycled and bicycled and bicycled and then finally, I realized I was bicycling...bicycling in the wrong direction toward the Germans and...uh...after I had bicycled for 4 hours and not found my father....</span> <span id="s396">I don't know whether I had gotten the wrong directions or whether I..</span> <span id="s397">.</span> <span id="s398">I can't...I can't say what went wrong there.</span> <span id="s399">Anyway after 4 hours bicycling, I was at the end of my physical possibilities.</span> <span id="s400">And I propped myself against a tree and...and passed out.</span> <span id="s401">And then when I came to myself, I was surrounded by four Belgian soldiers who gave me sugar and fed me sugar and then I woke up and...uh...they said...uh...you'll have to move from here.</span> <span id="s402">The Germans are coming instantly.</span> <span id="s403">And I said, "I am looking for my father.</span> <span id="s404">I have to go to this other direction."</span> <span id="s405">They said, "No.</span> <span id="s406">Your...your father is not there.</span> <span id="s407">Your father couldn't be there."</span> <span id="s408">Then I said, "Okay, then I go to Blois and find my mother.</span> <span id="s409">And they said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s410">We go with you."</span> <span id="s411">And we took the road and went to Blois, and as we came to Blois, the policeman said, "You cannot cross the bridge anymore.</span> <span id="s412">We are going to blow it up."</span> <span id="s413">And I was on the other side of the Loire, the city hall was on the side of the bridge they were going.</span> <span id="s414">In other words, I couldn't go to the city hall anymore.</span> <span id="s415">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s416">.</span> <span id="s417">I..</span> <span id="s418">.</span> <span id="s419">I nearly threw myself on the bridge, but they took me off and...uh...they said, "You can't do this.</span> <span id="s420">You can't go across."</span> <span id="s421">I said, "I have to find my mother."</span> <span id="s422">And they said, "Your mother is not there, because we are going to blow this whole thing up."</span> <span id="s423">And so I..</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">this is why I lost my mother too.</span> <span id="s426">And...uh...they blew up the bridge.</span> <span id="s427">The...the bombs rained down.</span> <span id="s428">The whole thing looked like in a..</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">looked so surrealistic.</span> <span id="s431">The fire, the bombs, the everything.</span> <span id="s432">And...uh...I was lost.</span> <span id="s433">And...uh...I went to the...uh...to a barn and...uh...cried, and that was it.</span> <span id="s434">And then the...the Belgian soldier said, "If you want to go, you could go down south of France with us.</span> <span id="s435">We are going down there."</span> <span id="s436">So I said, "Fine.</span> <span id="s437">I'll join you."</span> <span id="s438">And this was very lucky for me, because they were very...uh...dependable fellows and I had learned in the meantime that to go with four fellows was safer than to go with one.</span> <span id="s439">And...uh...we...this must have been....I don't know what day this was anymore, but any...anyway, we went to this...toward the south and bicycled and bicycled.</span> <span id="s440">And one day...uh...where we stayed overnight... We...we fed ourselves by taking things from...uh...the fields actually.</span> <span id="s441">And...uh...the...the boys were very inventive about this and they always found something to eat.</span> <span id="s442">And...uh...uh...at...at one time, however, we went to...uh...Centre.</span> <span id="s443">.</span> <span id="s444">how do you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, not hospital.</span> <span id="s447">Uh...where they...they took in refugees and...uh...we went to this Centre d'Accueil and in the Centre d'Accueil was a young man....</span> <span id="s448">I..</span> <span id="s449">.</span> <span id="s450">everywhere I went, I asked about my father, mother, and brother if anybody had seen them.</span> <span id="s451">And I also asked in the Centre d'Accuiel whether anybody had seen anybody of my family and somebody said from the description, they think they know my brother.</span> <span id="s452">And so where he was last seen a few days ago in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s453">So, I said, "I have to go and find my brother."</span> <span id="s454">And I said goodbye to the boys and...uh...took off for Toulouse the next morning and bicycled as fast as I could to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s455">And...uh...I arrived in Toulouse at noon...noon, before noon and I went to the Centre d'Accueil in Toulouse and I realized that Toulouse was a big city.</span> <span id="s456">It wasn't like a little village.</span> <span id="s457">It was already before the war...I mean...yes, before the war it was a million people.</span> <span id="s458">And at this particular time...uh...the refugees came all from the north, not only Belgium or Luxembourg, but all the French people and they had...and the city of Toulouse was swelled to two million people.</span> <span id="s459">And they had this Centre d'Accueil to take care of them...uh...take care of them is a euphemism...uh... It...it was dreadful.</span> <span id="s460">There were murders and rapes and a terrible place.</span> <span id="s461">But what could you do?</span> <span id="s462">Where would you stay otherwise?</span> <span id="s463">And...uh...so I went to this place and I inquired where I would find my brother.</span> <span id="s464">And at every meal I went up and I said, "Is there anybody who knows my brother?"</span> <span id="s465">And I couldn't find him so.</span> <span id="s466">So I was pretty desperate by the evening.</span> <span id="s467">I went to the middle of the city and...uh...the middle of the city was quite different.</span> <span id="s468">There were lots of people, and some people had enough money to go to restaurants and cafe houses, so I looked into the cafe houses and I found actually people I knew...uh...from Paris and...uh...but I didn't find my brother.</span> <span id="s469">And I was very, very discouraged because I had to go back to this awful place and as I walked down to go to...back to the Centre d'Assueil, I went through a little street and at the end of the street there was my brother and he sold newspapers.</span> <span id="s470">And that's how I found my brother.</span> <span id="s471">He was there.</span> <span id="s472">I..</span> <span id="s473">.</span> <span id="s474">I..</span> <span id="s475">.</span> <span id="s476">it was...I don't know.</span> <span id="s477">I can't say I mean how it happened.</span> <span id="s478">It was there.</span> <span id="s479">He was there.</span> <span id="s480">And, of course, we were both very happy and...uh...he...uh...he had a girlfriend with whom he lived and he said he would meet me the next day at the...uh...post office and then we would discuss what we would do together and we would rearrange everything what we would do.</span> <span id="s481">And so the next day at 10 o'clock I came to the post office and...uh...I was impatient.</span> <span id="s482">He didn't come right away, so because he was...I was impatient I went to the...uh...one of the counters, one of the...where you sell things.</span> <span id="s483">What do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Store?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No.</span> <span id="s486">No.</span> <span id="s487">No.</span> <span id="s488">In the post office</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Opening.</span> <span id="s492">One of the opening windows.</span> <span id="s493">One of the windows in the post office.</span> <span id="s494">And...uh...where they...in France they have what is called poste restante and...uh...I don't know if this is here too.</span> <span id="s495">There is no such a thing where they keep the...uh...letters or for other people, and you go.</span> <span id="s496">You identify yourself and you can pick up your mail that way.</span> <span id="s497">And so I went to one of the windows and I asked, "Do you have any letter for...for me?"</span> <span id="s498">And they said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s499">And I certainly hadn't expected anybody write me a letter because nobody knew I was in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s500">Nobody on earth knew that on that day I was going to be Toulouse.</span> <span id="s501">And there was a letter!</span> <span id="s502">And I looked at it.</span> <span id="s503">It was from my mother.</span> <span id="s504">And she...that letter...it was a very short, little letter saying...uh.</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">Elizabeth, if you get this letter, I am in Baucus, and I am waiting for you.</span> <span id="s507">And so when I..</span> <span id="s508">.</span> <span id="s509">my father...my brother came to the post office, I gave him the letter.</span> <span id="s510">I said, "Look here.</span> <span id="s511">I found my mommy and your mommy."</span> <span id="s512">And we were so happy.</span> <span id="s513">And so...so I said, "Immediately, I will go and find here."</span> <span id="s514">The letter was already 10 days old, so I was afraid she would not be there anymore.</span> <span id="s515">So I..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">uh...said to my brother, "You'll hear from me when I find my mother."</span> <span id="s518">And I went to the train station with my bicycle.</span> <span id="s519">I had only enough money to go to Pau and from there on, I had to take my bicycle again and bicycle to where my mother was which was close to the Spanish frontier.</span> <span id="s520">And I took the train to Pau and took out my bicycle, and as I was in the railroad station, I saw a..</span> <span id="s521">.</span> <span id="s522">a little man who was in a similar uniform as my father had when I..</span> <span id="s523">.</span> <span id="s524">uh.</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">he went into the Prestataire.</span> <span id="s527">And since I recognized the uniform, I went to him and I said...no, I went to him...he... I heard him shout in German, and I went to him and I..</span> <span id="s528">.</span> <span id="s529">I realized that he only spoke German and he...I said to him something about my father and he was very rude.</span> <span id="s530">He said, "I don't want to speak about anything.</span> <span id="s531">I want to find my wife."</span> <span id="s532">And he...he was rude to everybody.</span> <span id="s533">So I said to him, "This isn't anyway you are going to find your wife.</span> <span id="s534">I can help you because I speak French.</span> <span id="s535">I'll help you."</span> <span id="s536">So, it turned out that his wife was in Gurs, in the concentration camp in Gurs and he was looking for her.</span> <span id="s537">I found out how he could find...go to Gurs from Pau, and told him exactly which train to go.</span> <span id="s538">In fact, went with him to the train, set him into a compartment, and then I said, "Have you ever seen my father because you have the same kind of a uniform?"</span> <span id="s539">And he said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s540">Yesterday."</span> <span id="s541">And he...I said, "My goodness, as the train was already starting to roll.</span> <span id="s542">"Please tell me where it was?"</span> <span id="s543">And he said, it was in...near of Limoges."</span> <span id="s544">I said, "Exactly where it was?"</span> <span id="s545">So shouting out of the window, he gave me the telephone number I could call.</span> <span id="s546">And...uh...he departed.</span> <span id="s547">And...uh...I was flabbergasted, of course, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s548">I took my bicycle and just as I went to Toulouse, I went to Barcus to find my mother.</span> <span id="s549">And when I came to Barcus, it wasn't as I had imagined either.</span> <span id="s550">It was a very, long drawn out village.</span> <span id="s551">I didn't know exactly where my mother was, but I..</span> <span id="s552">.</span> <span id="s553">and I went to the first cafe and asked them if they would know my mother.</span> <span id="s554">And at that point I realized that everybody in the village knew I had been lost because my mother thought I had been killed in the...uh...bombardment in Blois Just as much as I had been desperate for her, she has...had been desperate for me.</span> <span id="s555">She did not think I had survived it, and she had told everybody that she mourned her daughter.</span> <span id="s556">And so when I came to this little village, everybody looked at me as if I were a ghost.</span> <span id="s557">And they told me where my mother was and I came into her little house where she lived in a peasant hut.</span> <span id="s558">And, also, a moment I will never forget in my life, my mother looked at me like coming back from the dead.</span> <span id="s559">And here I was, and here was my mother.</span> <span id="s560">And not only could I tell my mother and...and...uh...embrace my mother and kiss her and...but I was able to tell her, "I know where my brother is.</span> <span id="s561">I know where my father is."</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s563">Okay.</span> <span id="s564">At this point, we will break and change tapes.</span> <span id="s565">Perfect place to break.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s568">Tell us the story of the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: The story of the letter?</span> <span id="s570">All right.</span> <span id="s571">While I was Toulouse, I wrote a letter to...uh...a friend of Ernest in Switzerland, saying that I was alive and...and if he would know where Ernest is to write me a letter poste restante in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s572">Okay.</span> <span id="s573">I come now back to...to my mother...mother's meeting.</span> <span id="s574">Uh...We, of course...there was only one thing to do is to go back to Toulouse, see my brother, and go back to and find out if my father was where this man had said he was.</span> <span id="s575">I had seen him.</span> <span id="s576">So we first went to the telephone booth and dialed this magic number and...uh...we found my father and...uh...he came to the farm and...uh...it...it was incredible.</span> <span id="s577">Incredible!</span> <span id="s578">So, of course, he said, "Come immediately."</span> <span id="s579">And...uh...so our aim was... Yes, he was in Limoges, near Limoges, which was beyond Toulouse.</span> <span id="s580">So our aim was to go to Toulouse and then from Toulouse to...to where he was.</span> <span id="s581">Okay?</span> <span id="s582">So that's what we did.</span> <span id="s583">I..</span> <span id="s584">.</span> <span id="s585">uh...in parenthesis, I may say we took the train and...because...of course, because my mother had no bicycle.</span> <span id="s586">We took the train and everything we owned was robbed in that train which included, unfortunately, our food cards...cards...and all identity cards.</span> <span id="s587">Everything we still had was stolen in this train ride, which is terrible because when you don't have identity cards and no food cards at this time, it's hard to exist.</span> <span id="s588">Well, I don't know what we did in.</span> <span id="s589">.</span> <span id="s590">to...uh...get food at that point.</span> <span id="s591">I..</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">I've forgotten.</span> <span id="s594">Uh...We arrived in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s595">It was a terrific reunion with my brother and...uh...we....my mother had a tiny bit of money from this compensation of the French Government.</span> <span id="s596">That was...so we could pay for our fare.</span> <span id="s597">And we had decided we are going then now to go to my father.</span> <span id="s598">My brother wanted to stay in Toulouse and...uh...but before we went to take a train ticket to...to go my father's, I went to the post office and there was a letter from...uh...Ernest's friend, saying that Ernest was very close to where my mother had been.</span> <span id="s599">So I said to my mother, "I am going to go and find Ernest.</span> <span id="s600">Now that I know the way!"</span> <span id="s601">(Chuckle) So my mother understood and she said, "You go ahead, and we meet at your father's."</span> <span id="s602">I rode down again, met Ernest, and he had been...uh...in this little place and my meeting with Ernest was also in the street.</span> <span id="s603">He didn't know I was coming.</span> <span id="s604">I saw him walking in the street and...uh...it was also unbelievable.</span> <span id="s605">So...and the next day, I convinced him to go with me to see my father.</span> <span id="s606">But he had not been demobilized yet so he said, Okay, I think it's best if I go first to, I think, Tarbes, but I am not sure...uh...to get demobilized because then I also get a little money when I undemobilization, and then we can...I can take a train ticket and we don't have to go by bicycle and...and other stuff.</span> <span id="s607">And...uh...So he went to Tarbes, got a little money, and we went to see my father.</span> <span id="s608">And then we lived with my father on my father's ration.</span> <span id="s609">My mother, Ernest and I, all three of us on one ration and that couldn't last.</span> <span id="s610">So Ernest decided he's going to look for a job.</span> <span id="s611">But, of course, he wasn't allowed to work, so he had to...No, he wanted to be...Excuse me...He wanted to be a student actually and continue his studies, so he went to Grenoble and what happened to him is another story, A very, very sad and long story.</span> <span id="s612">Uh...My mother and I, in the meantime, stayed with my father, living off this soldier's ration, and...uh... If you ask how this life was, it was very difficult, very very difficult.</span> <span id="s613">Uh...This village had no school, where I could go to.</span> <span id="s614">Uh...We had practically no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s615">Uh...Finally, we got...arranged for.</span> <span id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">for a place where my mother and my father could stay in one room and I could stay in another room.</span> <span id="s618">And...uh...I got acquainted with the library there, La bibliotheque, and...uh... I must say I got as good an education from just reading one book after the other in the...in the bibliotheque ...uh... I read all of Romain Rolland, all of Baudelaire, of Maupassant...uh... Not bad!</span> <span id="s619">And...uh...uh...otherwise, we...the days were spent collecting...uh...uh...food such as berries and chataigne.</span> <span id="s620">What is it.</span> <span id="s621">.</span> <span id="s622">uh...uh...uh... No.</span> <span id="s623">And...uh...just the daily life to...to wash yourself was quite a problem.</span> <span id="s624">We had...you had to go to a public bath and there...I don't think there was any for women.</span> <span id="s625">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s626">And...uh...Well, main concern then was to find out where my grandparents were.</span> <span id="s627">And...uh...We couldn't get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s628">We couldn't find them.</span> <span id="s629">And my...uh...that was more or less the daily task.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Under what circumstances did you leave that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: And one day we received a letter from our...the lady who was my Latin teacher in Vienna, who had gone into a village...uh...to become a German teacher, and she wrote me and my father...parents a letter saying that as things do not look...uh...too well... In the meantime, of course...I digress.</span> <span id="s632">You excuse me.</span> <span id="s633">In the meantime, the Vichy government...uh...persecute...started to persecute the foreigners and to persecute especially the foreign Jews and we had to live...uh...not...uh...yet in hiding, but on the edge of society.</span> <span id="s634">And...uh...when the letter came, the teacher said that she would suggest that I come to where she is, which is Le Chambon and she would have a job for me.</span> <span id="s635">During the summer time, I could take care of Pastor Trocmé's children and in the fall, I could go to school.</span> <span id="s636">So my parents' decided this was a much better solution for their daughter and I wasn't very happy to leave my parents, but I went to Le Chambon and there I was received by Paster Trocmé and...uh... I..</span> <span id="s637">.</span> <span id="s638">my job was to take care of the children, to help in the household, and to do anything else that was necessary.</span> <span id="s639">And...uh...that's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Can you describe life in the Trocmé household please, in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: That wasn't the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s643">Describe...describe...describe life taking care in the...in the Trocmé family.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s645">The main...the main thing was there were four...four children.</span> <span id="s646">The Trocmé's had four children.</span> <span id="s647">One of them was only 2 years younger than I, so actually...uh...uh...that...uh...Nellie was not under my charge at all.</span> <span id="s648">She was 14 years old, and I remember played beautiful piano and was very independent young lady.</span> <span id="s649">Uh...The children that I was taking care of Jon Pierre, who was 12, Jacquo, who was 10, and Danielle, who was 7.</span> <span id="s650">And...uh...the...this was summer time and the children did not go to school, so you had to take care of the children from the day...from the moment they opened their eyes til the moment they closed their eyes.</span> <span id="s651">They were very, very active little children, so that's what you had to do.</span> <span id="s652">And the...the main task was to take them out...outside, so that they could play, and I remember taking long walks and taking picnics and mainly trying to keep peace amongst them because they were continuously fighting.</span> <span id="s653">(Chuckle) And...uh...uh...this...then I had to help with preparing the meals and...uh...the...it......but what I remember most...most is the evening meal where we all sit around the table and...uh... It was a very moving moment when Pastor Trocmé said the prayers and the whole...the whole rhythm of the day changed.</span> <span id="s654">It...it was very busy everywhere where...when, you know, you hear about the busyness, about the lots to do in the Trocmé house and it was true.</span> <span id="s655">It was a dynamic situation and at that moment, everybody was quiet and thoughtful and completely changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: What did you know about what the Trocmé were doing to help other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I didn't know about their plans at all.</span> <span id="s658">One day, however,...uh...Mother Trocmé told me that they intended to have children come from the Condegeres and that when they are in Le Chambon, they would want me to go there in.</span> <span id="s659">.</span> <span id="s660">into the same house to help with the children because the children would not know French.</span> <span id="s661">A lot...a lot of the children would not know French, and they wanted me to help with the children.</span> <span id="s662">Would I do that?</span> <span id="s663">And I said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s664">And then, also,...at...at...one thing happened that made...did...it was very strange.</span> <span id="s665">They did not treat me like a refugee child.</span> <span id="s666">They treated me more like a French child...youngster.</span> <span id="s667">Right?</span> <span id="s668">Uh...Be...I don't...I mean I wasn't...they did not realize so much my...my background, I don't think.</span> <span id="s669">Until one day, I receive a letter from my grandfather saying that they were going to go to Cuba and I was terribly upset.</span> <span id="s670">I thought that I would never see my grandparents again, and I cried very much.</span> <span id="s671">And then they realized that...uh...I had the similar background to the children that they were helping and...uh...I think they were...uh...very glad I could be...uh...bridge between the people of the village and the people and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Can you tell me something about the Trocmés?</span> <span id="s673">What were they like as people?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Uh...Pastor Trocmé was a very distant person.</span> <span id="s675">I've read...uh.</span> <span id="s676">.</span> <span id="s677">several descriptions of him as a person, and he was all of them.</span> <span id="s678">All of the descriptions was...were...are true.</span> <span id="s679">When I say he was a very distant person, then I mean he was a very distant person at the beginning, at the outset.</span> <span id="s680">He...he was...he was a leader.</span> <span id="s681">He was a leader.</span> <span id="s682">To...to his wife he was completely different.</span> <span id="s683">His relationship with his wife, it was completely different.</span> <span id="s684">He was very warm.</span> <span id="s685">So he was both warm and distant.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: And Mrs. Trocmé?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: And...uh...I have a tendency to call her Mama Trocmé.</span> <span id="s688">Mama Trocmé was a wonderful...uh...caring person...uh...who...who did everything.</span> <span id="s689">She...she would ...uh...uh...do...uh...peel potatoes as much as she would help another person.</span> <span id="s690">I mean she would be there for...for her own household.</span> <span id="s691">She had an awful lot to do.</span> <span id="s692">The daily difficulties were enormous for her.</span> <span id="s693">Enormous.</span> <span id="s694">She had four boarders in her house.</span> <span id="s695">In order to survive financially, the Trocmé's had to have boarders.</span> <span id="s696">And...uh.</span> <span id="s697">.</span> <span id="s698">when...they... they gave her a lot of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: When you moved around in the town, how did it feel like for you as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I didn't move around in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s703">I was with the children or in the house.</span> <span id="s704">I never moved around town.</span> <span id="s705">And then when I was in the house with the other...the house was called Lagasbe.</span> <span id="s706">Uh...If you want to come to that period now...uh...that...I was first in LeChambon during the summer.</span> <span id="s707">Right?</span> <span id="s708">And then when the school started, I moved to Lagasbe.</span> <span id="s709">And...uh...when I came to Lagasbe, the children from Gurs ...were...had already arrived, I think a day or 2 before.</span> <span id="s710">And...uh...There was a room for the girls and a room for the boys.</span> <span id="s711">Was very, very small.</span> <span id="s712">Very small and crowded.</span> <span id="s713">So I was in the girls' room.</span> <span id="s714">And...uh...There my task was to...(pause) uh...to...uh...help them in any way you can.</span> <span id="s715">I mean there was not an assigned task.</span> <span id="s716">You helped because they were des... These children had just left their parents, and they were in a situation where they hardly knew where they were.</span> <span id="s717">They...they did not understand where they were.</span> <span id="s718">They...uh.</span> <span id="s719">.</span> <span id="s720">knew they were somewhere in France without their parents.</span> <span id="s721">They had come from Germany.</span> <span id="s722">They had...uh...arrived in Gurs in...in the camp.</span> <span id="s723">They...they had been transported from Gurs to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s724">And...and they had no idea where they were and what they were there for.</span> <span id="s725">So, you...you had to...to hold their hands.</span> <span id="s726">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s727">You...you had to hold their hands because they were alone.</span> <span id="s728">All of them.</span> <span id="s729">Each one of them.</span> <span id="s730">Uh...Then I was told I should go to school and I was glad to go to school.</span> <span id="s731">There was only one other person who could go to school because the school was, of course, already...uh...high school and you had to know French in order to go to school.</span> <span id="s732">And the other children did not know, except one boy.</span> <span id="s733">So the boy was , and I..</span> <span id="s734">.</span> <span id="s735">we went to school.</span> <span id="s736">And we went to school each day so I don't really know what happened in the little house during the day.</span> <span id="s737">I only know that in the evening when I came home I tried to teach them some French.</span> <span id="s738">I tried to sing songs with them.</span> <span id="s739">I..</span> <span id="s740">.</span> <span id="s741">uh...tried to console, and then after our meal...well our meal consisted of a soup and a piece of bread, essentially, I had to study a lot.</span> <span id="s742">So I studied til ll o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s743">Then I got up at 6 o'clock in the morning to study some more before I went to school.</span> <span id="s744">And...uh...went to school with...uh...Jon.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: This...I..</span> <span id="s747">.</span> <span id="s748">I started...uh...uh...school in September and...uh.</span> <span id="s749">.</span> <span id="s750">in November, I got a letter from my father saying, "Drop everything.</span> <span id="s751">We have an American visa.</span> <span id="s752">And come to Lyon tomorrow."</span> <span id="s753">And...uh...that was it.</span> <span id="s754">I..</span> <span id="s755">.</span> <span id="s756">I was flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s757">I was...uh...torn...uh...I felt I am betraying my little comrades.</span> <span id="s758">I was leaving them at the peak...I..</span> <span id="s759">.</span> <span id="s760">I had realized that the...that we were in hiding more or less and...uh...I..</span> <span id="s761">.</span> <span id="s762">I was torn to go, but I mean I could not leave my father's letter...uh...unanswered and he had already, of course, left his village, so he expected me to be in Lyon.</span> <span id="s763">And so I prepared to leave.</span> <span id="s764">And when I prepared to leave, the children took me to the railroad station and it started snowing and the children went home and I waited for the train and the train never came.</span> <span id="s765">And I got frantic.</span> <span id="s766">It was afternoon and I still couldn't leave.</span> <span id="s767">And I was all by myself and I..</span> <span id="s768">.</span> <span id="s769">uh... decided I had to...to walk to Lyon.</span> <span id="s770">And...uh...I left the place and...uh...about an hour later, I was lost.</span> <span id="s771">Completely lost!</span> <span id="s772">The...uh...snow had turned into a tremendous snow storm.</span> <span id="s773">I..</span> <span id="s774">.</span> <span id="s775">I was first in the snow up to my ankles and then it became higher and higher and I got stuck til up to my knees and at one point, I thought that was it.</span> <span id="s776">I am not going to make it either back or forth, and I remember just putting my head on the snow and sort of giving up and...uh...then it was so cold that I had to move.</span> <span id="s777">And I started running again.</span> <span id="s778">Somehow I got out of it.</span> <span id="s779">Somehow I got into someplace where the...where people...and somehow I got into the train to Lyon.</span> <span id="s780">I can't remember exactly how.</span> <span id="s781">And I was...uh...I was...uh...That's the reason I can't remember much of this because I was in total shock.</span> <span id="s782">And...uh...when I came to Lyon, I don't remember how I met my parents anymore.</span> <span id="s783">I..</span> <span id="s784">.</span> <span id="s785">I was so totally shocked.</span> <span id="s786">Uh...My father must have gotten a visa there and I must have gotten a visa there, but I don't remember anything.</span> <span id="s787">And...uh...I remember then my father and...my brother wasn't with us because he was still in a camp.</span> <span id="s788">And he joined us in Marseilles and I am beginning slightly to remember from that part on when we were in Marseilles...uh...my father received a letter from the Committee that we should go to the Condemill to await permission to leave France.</span> <span id="s789">We had the America visa.</span> <span id="s790">This visa, I must add how we got it.</span> <span id="s791">It...it was a miracle almost because only a thousand people got visas from the United States at this time.</span> <span id="s792">They was...this was a special action by...uh...President Roosevelt and the Refugee Committee headed by Varian Fry who...uh...wanted to save European intellectuals.</span> <span id="s793">And they, because my father was on the black list and he was a writer, they gave him this chance and gave him and his family another chance to come to America.</span> <span id="s794">And...uh...(Pause) But we didn't have a permission to leave the country yet.</span> <span id="s795">That was another hurdle to overcome.</span> <span id="s796">So we were told to go to await the official permission in the Condemill.</span> <span id="s797">And...uh...My father said, "No.</span> <span id="s798">I shall not go to any camp even if I have to starve."</span> <span id="s799">And so we did not go to the Condemill.</span> <span id="s800">We did starve, and we stayed in Marseilles and...uh...things dragged on and dragged on and dragged on and...uh...my father became very impatient.</span> <span id="s801">And one day he said to us, "We are leaving."</span> <span id="s802">It happened to have been the 7th of December 1941.</span> <span id="s803">And we took the train from Marseilles to the...to the Spanish border where we got out of the train.</span> <span id="s804">We went across the border with our American visa, but not the permission.</span> <span id="s805">And at that particular point the border was closed, but we were already on the Spanish side.</span> <span id="s806">So we couldn't be sent back because the border was closed so we were in Spain, and the Spanish had no objections because they knew we were not going to stay in Spain and...uh...uh... we had...we took a ticket...we had 50 dollars on us for the four of us.</span> <span id="s807">My brother had joined me I think I had mentioned that.</span> <span id="s808">For the four of us we had 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s809">We took the 4th class ticket to go to...uh...Portugal.</span> <span id="s810">And...uh...was a long ride.</span> <span id="s811">When we came to Barcelona...uh...my father said, "Let's get out of the train.</span> <span id="s812">I know somebody in Barcelona."</span> <span id="s813">So we all left the train in Barcelona.</span> <span id="s814">But it wasn't...I guess they weren't too much afraid because we had the American visa.</span> <span id="s815">And then we traveled to Lisbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Go on?</span> <span id="s818">(Chuckle) Again, I mean you had to live from day to day.</span> <span id="s819">There was no money so we went to a Committee and...uh... they helped us.</span> <span id="s820">They were very kind.</span> <span id="s821">And we stayed...of course, it was not, as I mentioned before, the war had started.</span> <span id="s822">Pearl Harbor and...uh...uh...the Germans started...uh...mining the Atlantic Ocean.</span> <span id="s823">The boats did not want to cross anymore through the United States.</span> <span id="s824">It was not easy to pursue the plans to go to America.</span> <span id="s825">Finally, we did get...uh...a passage on the Niasa, and the Niasa did not go directly from Lisbon to New York, but went first to Cuba.</span> <span id="s826">And, of course, we wanted to see my grandparents but we weren't allowed to get off the boat at all.</span> <span id="s827">And my grandparents never knew that we had landed in Cuba.</span> <span id="s828">And...uh...from Cuba we went to the Bermuda's, at which point we learned that the Niasa was full of spies and that we're not going to be able to pursue our voyage and...uh...the police came on board and they interviewed everybody for hours, found the spies, arrested the spies, and we then were allowed to...to go to America.</span> <span id="s829">However, they did not want us to go to New York, and we landed in Virginia Beach.</span> <span id="s830">And...uh...the American authorities came on board, again screened everybody on board and then we got permission to...to leave.</span> <span id="s831">We were guided from the boat, blindfolded to a train that was also blinded... had... uh...the windows were blinded.</span> <span id="s832">Uh...And we were given seats and we were not allowed to move from there, and the trains started to go to New York, but we were afraid.</span> <span id="s833">I mean we were in America, and the first thing we got was...uh...sandwiches.</span> <span id="s834">We had never seen such white bread in years and we were extremely relieved and I mean...uh...you cannot describe the feeling.</span> <span id="s835">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s836">It's...it's a feeling that you can only have once in a lifetime.</span> <span id="s837">We arrived in New York, Pennsylvania Station.</span> <span id="s838">I don't think a lot of immigrants did that.</span> <span id="s839">Uh...I think it's 32nd or 34th Street.</span> <span id="s840">We arrived and here you were and then where did you go?</span> <span id="s841">Right?</span> <span id="s842">So...uh...we...we decided we have to disburse because we didn't have any money to go to a hotel or anything like that.</span> <span id="s843">And...uh...so my...we all had friends and I went to some friends I had and I happened to be on 86th Street, West Side.</span> <span id="s844">So I walked from 34 to 86th Street because it's very easy to find your way in New York, and I rang the bell and (laughter) I said, "Here I am.</span> <span id="s845">Will you take me in?"</span> <span id="s846">And they did.</span> <span id="s847">I imagine my father and my mother and my brother had the same kind of experience.</span> <span id="s848">I came in.</span> <span id="s849">They took me in.</span> <span id="s850">They were very, very kind.</span> <span id="s851">And I fell sick.</span> <span id="s852">Immediately!</span> <span id="s853">Immediately fell sick.</span> <span id="s854">My...And the first thing I did was, when I got better, I went to Julie Richmond High School, and inscribed myself and they were very, very kind.</span> <span id="s855">I knew two words of English.</span> <span id="s856">And if I say them to you you will laugh.</span> <span id="s857">They are: cheek to cheek."</span> <span id="s858">(Laughter) Because one of the Fred Astaire songs of that time...Now I know it was "Together Dancing Cheek to Cheek."</span> <span id="s859">And that was the only two words, is cheek and to...uh...that I knew.</span> <span id="s860">I don't think I knew what it was.</span> <span id="s861">(Laughter) Uh...But I went to high school and I said I would like to go to school and they said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s862">But they, of course, noticed that I couldn't speak a word of English so they sent me to the French teacher in order to sort me out.</span> <span id="s863">It so happened that the French teacher did not speak any French.</span> <span id="s864">She came from Spain.</span> <span id="s865">And I didn't know any Spanish so that didn't work.</span> <span id="s866">And...uh...after awhile, I found a very, very wonderful English teacher who understood the...my difficulties, and...uh...she explained it to the others and so I was...uh...put into...uh...into two classes at once so I would advance quickly and...uh...didn't take me long.</span> <span id="s867">I learned English and...uh...I graduated within the same year from high school.</span> <span id="s868">And...uh...I lived first with a family that needed a babysitter and I took care of the baby after I came home from school and then later when my father made...could afford it and we had an apartment, I moved in with my parents.</span> <span id="s869">My father, of course, joined immediately a group of...uh...people who...to help other refugees and...uh...he also got himself an agent and he contacted the Free French.</span> <span id="s870">I contacted the Free French too, but they thought I was too young to be of any help.</span> <span id="s871">I didn't think so and I..</span> <span id="s872">.</span> <span id="s873">today I..</span> <span id="s874">.</span> <span id="s875">I don't know why they didn't let me join them.</span> <span id="s876">Uh...I was very eager to...to help the war effort.</span> <span id="s877">At the same time, my brother was recruited into the Army and he did...he became...uh...American soldier and...uh...after basic training, he was sent overseas and he died in France on the last year of the war in the French...in the American army.</span> <span id="s878">And...uh...well, I thought I should make my contribution, but I guess...uh...I..</span> <span id="s879">.</span> <span id="s880">I wasn't able to...to join any group that went on combat.</span> <span id="s881">I continued school.</span> <span id="s882">After graduation from high school, I entered Hunter College of the City of New York.</span> <span id="s883">At that time it was not...uh...evident to get into Hunter College.</span> <span id="s884">You had to pass a very stiff exam.</span> <span id="s885">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s886">.</span> <span id="s887">to this day, I don't know how I managed to pass this exam, but I did.</span> <span id="s888">I was accepted in Hunter College and there the French teacher spoke French.</span> <span id="s889">(Laughter) He was , and only a few weeks after I..</span> <span id="s890">.</span> <span id="s891">I..</span> <span id="s892">.</span> <span id="s893">uh...joined the Hunter College.</span> <span id="s894">He went and joined the Free French and went back to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: What happened after...very briefly, after you finished college?</span> <span id="s896">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Uh...After I finished college, still in the last year of college, I heard that Ernest Koenig had survived the war.</span> <span id="s898">He had looked for me via his brother.</span> <span id="s899">In England, his brother had written to somebody in New York who must have looked up the telephone book or something.</span> <span id="s900">Anyway, I was found.</span> <span id="s901">I was contacted by Ernest Koenig, and...uh.</span> <span id="s902">.</span> <span id="s903">we decided to see each other again.</span> <span id="s904">And so my...upon graduation, I was only intend to earn enough money to pay a ticket over to Europe and visit Ernest.</span> <span id="s905">So, upon graduation, I looked for a job.</span> <span id="s906">And I looked...I was at that point also I had done the Art Students League.</span> <span id="s907">I didn't mention that.</span> <span id="s908">I didn't only go to college.</span> <span id="s909">I went to the Arts too.</span> <span id="s910">I must say after my brother died, I was crushed and I didn't want to go to...to see anybody or stay...stay anymore in my old environment so I went...I left...uh...college.</span> <span id="s911">I went to evening college to...in order to finish the...the year and I went to arts school in the day time, to Art Students League.</span> <span id="s912">And...uh...when I graduated I..</span> <span id="s913">.</span> <span id="s914">uh...I..</span> <span id="s915">.</span> <span id="s916">uh...I graduated in arts.</span> <span id="s917">And I looked for jobs in art.</span> <span id="s918">And as you know, jobs in art after graduation are not easy to find unless you are ready to do...uh...serial kinds of jobs, like in cartoons or that kind of thing I was offered, but I didn't want to do that.</span> <span id="s919">So one day, I..</span> <span id="s920">.</span> <span id="s921">uh...I went to the public library to get out a book and there was a big advertisement for somebody with my language skills.</span> <span id="s922">I went in.</span> <span id="s923">I got the job, and I became a librarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: When did you see Ernest again?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Uh...I..</span> <span id="s926">.</span> <span id="s927">after a few months on my job, I had enough money.</span> <span id="s928">I asked for permission if I could go to Europe and they gave it to me for a week, I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s929">My...I..</span> <span id="s930">.</span> <span id="s931">also...Ernest, by that time, had lived in London and my grandmother was in London also.</span> <span id="s932">So very officially, I visited my grandmother.</span> <span id="s933">And my father came with me to visit his mother, so my father and I went to London, and I met Ernest at the Picadilly...uh...subway station.</span> <span id="s934">Uh...And...uh...we decided to get married next week.</span> <span id="s935">(Laughter) That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s937">Okay.</span> <span id="s938">Elizabeth, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s939">I would like...I would like to go just for 1 minute if we can, back to LeChambon.</span> <span id="s940">Uh...You were teaching in the school.</span> <span id="s941">Uh...Can you tell me something about the kids, the children that you taught, that you were helping out with in this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: No.</span> <span id="s943">I wasn't teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: No.</span> <span id="s945">You were helping with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No.</span> <span id="s947">I wasn't teaching at all.</span> <span id="s948">The...it was helping them psychologically more than anything else.</span> <span id="s949">The children were very disturbed and they were treated as a bunch and not as individuals.</span> <span id="s950">They were not...they were the children that came from Gurs, but that wasn't so.</span> <span id="s951">Each child had a different individual story, and nobody listened to them.</span> <span id="s952">So what I really did is I..</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">I helped them tell me their stories.</span> <span id="s955">I mean I allowed them to...to...to tell their stories, their griefs, their...their unhappiness.</span> <span id="s956">They cried at night.</span> <span id="s957">They had nightmares.</span> <span id="s958">One of the children wet herself every night.</span> <span id="s959">But that wasn't known in the village.</span> <span id="s960">That wasn't known at all.</span> <span id="s961">We kept that to ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: It sounds like you were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: We were very, very close.</span> <span id="s964">We were like sisters and brothers with the boys too.</span> <span id="s965">The boys...I..</span> <span id="s966">.</span> <span id="s967">I am speaking now about the girls because I was in the girls' room, but I felt for the boys like if they were my brothers, just as much.</span> <span id="s968">Especially for the teenage boys.</span> <span id="s969">They were so hungry.</span> <span id="s970">They...they were howling like wolves, and people didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s971">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s972">They were lonesome.</span> <span id="s973">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s974">.</span> <span id="s975">I especially remember some of the boys...uh...well, you would call it, stole a potato and he was punished for it.</span> <span id="s976">And I was devastated because he was...he was not responsible.</span> <span id="s977">His body needed it.</span> <span id="s978">We...we were so close...uh...I..</span> <span id="s979">.</span> <span id="s980">in France at that time, you got...uh...you got...uh...a special allowance for children for chocolate and sugar.</span> <span id="s981">Up to 16 years, you got chocolate and sugar.</span> <span id="s982">And I collected my chocolate and sugar and I didn't have a chance to say this, but in the meantime Ernest was in a concentration camp, and I took that...and sent it in to the concentration camp and that was one of the reasons I didn't want to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s983">I felt if I didn't send my sugar he would...he would not survive.</span> <span id="s984">So...uh...I have a letter...I think I may still have it...where the children tell me, "We will not forget Ernest.</span> <span id="s985">We will send him sugar."</span> <span id="s986">They had nothing themselves.</span> <span id="s987">But we were very close.</span> <span id="s988">Very close!</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Did the people from the town come into the school to try to help at all?</span> <span id="s990">Was there any contact between your children and the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s992">No.</span> <span id="s993">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s994">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No.</span> <span id="s997">Uh...Maybe later.</span> <span id="s998">At this particular point, it was just being established, you see.</span> <span id="s999">The main thing I think was the...uh...worry.</span> <span id="s1000">Where's the money going to come from to support us?</span> <span id="s1001">And that was...uh...Pastor Trocmé's money and it...I must say, we were supported...uh...wonderfully by the American Quakers and by the...uh... .</span> <span id="s1002">They gave the money.</span> <span id="s1003">Those two organizations.</span> <span id="s1004">If it weren't for the American Quakers and the , they could not have had enough money to establish the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1006">Alright.</span> <span id="s1007">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1009">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0111 page \* arabic20</span></p></body></html>
