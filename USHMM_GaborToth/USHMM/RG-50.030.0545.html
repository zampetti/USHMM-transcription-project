2010</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ellen Zweig, conducted by Judith Cohen on March second in Leisure World in Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s12">Let’s start by telling me your name at birth, as it was in Germany, the names of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s14">The – my name was Ellen Seligman, it’s spelled with one n, s-e-l-i-g-m-a-n.</span> <span id="s15">My mother’s name was Rose Hirschfeld was her maiden name, and my father was Julius Seligman.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And did you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I had one sister, younger than me.</span> <span id="s18">Her name was Margit.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And where were you born, and your date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born in Regensburg, Germany, which is right on the Danube, in May 18th, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And how long had your family lived in Regensburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My mother’s family go back to the 1800s, I believe.</span> <span id="s23">I know like 1890 or earlier.</span> <span id="s24">My father’s family I think came to Regensburg when he was a young boy.</span> <span id="s25">They came from a town called Lambsheim, which is near the Rhine.</span> <span id="s26">And they opened the store there in germ – in Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Tell me something about the first couple years of your life, you remember, before the Nazi takeover.</span> <span id="s28">We’ll start with what sort of store your father owned –</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: – and what sort of cultural activities, religious activities that your parents were involved with.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Okay, yeah [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s32">Well, they were pretty assimilated.</span> <span id="s33">My – my maternal grandparents had a department store called Teats, which was sort of a chain store.</span> <span id="s34">They – they had combined buying powers, I believe, and it was a very nice store, I remember that, it had several floors.</span> <span id="s35">And after my parents got married in 1928, my father opened another store in the suburb.</span> <span id="s36">And they were well off, I have to say, I mean, I would say middle upper class, you know.</span> <span id="s37">And we had a good life, that’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What was your hou – what did your house look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, we – we had a flat, we di – never lived in a house.</span> <span id="s40">Even my grandparents did not have a house.</span> <span id="s41">It was a big flat.</span> <span id="s42">My father had a car.</span> <span id="s43">We had a ri – th-the – the house we lived in had three stories I – I remember, and it had a big garden.</span> <span id="s44">And it was a – a very nice place.</span> <span id="s45">And you know, we – we went on trips, wa – like I said, my father had a car, we could go in the summertime.</span> <span id="s46">This was before 1935, I would say.</span> <span id="s47">We would go skiing in the winter, we g – we would go sw-swimming.</span> <span id="s48">Mostly in the rivers, but they had special places where you could go swimming.</span> <span id="s49">My parents belonged to a tennis club – before all this happened, you know, when they were still able to do that.</span> <span id="s50">S – s –</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: – and it – so when I – or when I entered school in 1936, I guess, I had to go to a Jewish school, I could not go to a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s54">Let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s55">What was your parents’ social circle like before the Nazis?</span> <span id="s56">Did they have German friends in addition to Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I’m su – I’m sure they did, because when they played tennis, you know, at this particular place, it was like a little country club, I guess, and I’m sure they did.</span> <span id="s58">I was too young to remember all that.</span> <span id="s59">The only thing I can tell you, my mother’s sister, who was younger than she was by three years, met her husband through tennis, and he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s60">And even though my grandparents weren’t happy, she married him in 1934, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Oh, after the Nazis had taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, yes, uh-huh, yeah.</span> <span id="s63">And he was a very nice man, he was a lovely per – man and he was from a good family, they were Catholic.</span> <span id="s64">And he helped my grandparents in a way, because they moved in with my grandparents, and in a way, because of him, you know, things didn’t – weren't bad for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did he face any, you know, problems –</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: – from rossenshonda(ph) and –</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah, yeah, well, he did.</span> <span id="s69">Well, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: – this happened after we left, my parents and I left Germany.</span> <span id="s72">They eventually took him to camp, or to a – a workplace, because he wouldn’t divorce her.</span> <span id="s73">And my aunt at that time had two little boys.</span> <span id="s74">I – my – my older cousin I remember.</span> <span id="s75">One was maybe five, and the other one had – was born after we left.</span> <span id="s76">She moved in with her in-laws, they took her in with the two children.</span> <span id="s77">And she – they were living in Munich, and then she went back to Regensburg where her in-laws were living, after everybody had left, 1941, I guess, ’40 - ’41.</span> <span id="s78">And because my family was so well known in Regensburg, and dote – we had a lot of farming communities around there, they brought her food.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And let me ask you a little bit more about this German uncle.</span> <span id="s80">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Fritz Brem, b-r-e-m.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And did he survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s84">They all survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did his family support him after the marriage to your aunt, or was he disowned, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, he – he had – he had a profession.</span> <span id="s87">He was a director of a – a mine that – I – I’m not quite sure, kalkswag(ph) it was called.</span> <span id="s88">And he was a director of it before, and after the war the Americans put him back in a director.</span> <span id="s89">So, you know.</span> <span id="s90">Although he did e-encounter still anti-Semitism, even after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Let’s move back to your own immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You were still fairly young, but what’s your first memory of life under the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, you know, like I said, I was rather young.</span> <span id="s95">I – I just do remember though, my father had a Catholic secretary.</span> <span id="s96">And since my parents couldn’t take us to things like movies, you know, and – she would take – take me.</span> <span id="s97">And the sti – I faintly remember that she once took me to a program, you know, in December, before the Christmas, they have this Saint Nicholas in Germany, and it was very Catholic party, and where, you know, they c – would come around and – and ask all the children, you know, have you been good, and so forth.</span> <span id="s98">And later, I understand – I was told this story, that somebody came up to this woman who had – who was not married, and said, who is that nice little girl with you – that nice little Aryan girl with you?</span> <span id="s99">And it was me, because I had blonde hair and blue eyes.</span> <span id="s100">So, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Any idea what she responded?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t know whether she di – she said her niece probably, you know, something like that, so, you know.</span> <span id="s104">But she was a – a wonderful person and even after the war she kept in touch with my family.</span> <span id="s105">Her fa – her brother was a priest and she eventually went to work fo – with him, or was his housekeeper.</span> <span id="s106">So – and after the war, we – my parents got together with her again.</span> <span id="s107">In fact, she came over here once with her brother on a pilgrimage.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And do you have any other memories of your childhood under the Nazis before you emigrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, I think my family kind of shielded me from this.</span> <span id="s110">I do remember that the – the Jewish community in Regensburg found a place – it wasn’t a ga – actually a g – a sports place where we could all go and congregate on the weekend, or on Sunday.</span> <span id="s111">And you know, th-the – we could play and you know, i-it wa – it wasn’t exactly a country club, but it was a place where the Jewish families could go and have an outing, and things like that.</span> <span id="s112">I remember that.</span> <span id="s113">It was far out into the suburbs.</span> <span id="s114">But, you know, it gave us a place to go when we weren’t allowed to – to commingle with the other population.</span> <span id="s115">So, you know, and we would play sports there, and so forth, you know.</span> <span id="s116">So – but that – other than that, I mean I – I never really – until Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s117">That – that – then – then of course, things cha – really changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s119">Tell me your memories of Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Well, I do remember that there was a knock on our ap-apartment at six in the morning.</span> <span id="s121">But of course my sister and I were in our – were in our bed, and we didn’t get out of bed.</span> <span id="s122">But there was a knock on our door, and they came to get my father.</span> <span id="s123">I mean, that’s all I know.</span> <span id="s124">I mean, you know, at that – that time.</span> <span id="s125">And we – I really wasn’t privy to anything, and my mother probably spoke with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s126">And eventually we moved, we went to my grandmother’s house and stayed with them –</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And why did –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: – while he was – actually my father was not taken to concentration camp, because he had had a broken leg the summer before.</span> <span id="s129">So he took his two canes with him, and because of that they kept him in the town jail with all the older people, for a week.</span> <span id="s130">And after that they – my grandmother was very active in the community and she got him out.</span> <span id="s131">Also her – my grandfather, and their son, were sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s132">But my grandmother, as I said, was very active in the community, and she actually wa – this I – this I was told, went to the Nazis, to the – to the police, and said, several of our men died, we need 10 min – 10 people to have a minyan.</span> <span id="s133">So this – and my grandfather, I think was, came back, and my father was let out, and so forth.</span> <span id="s134">They were – they did let people out.</span> <span id="s135">I don’t think Regensburg was – there were N-Nazis, but I don’t think it was like in some of the other towns, that they were so awful.</span> <span id="s136">Now, I do have a picture here that shows my father in a cart, being marched through the town.</span> <span id="s137">You know, they took all the men that day and marched them through the main street.</span> <span id="s138">It was called Maximilianstrasse, I remember that, before they took – sent them off to either Dachau or the – or the prison.</span> <span id="s139">I have a picture of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And did your father ever describe his emotions after the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No, not really –</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: – or discuss this photograph with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s144">Not really, no, no, he never did, uh-uh.</span> <span id="s145">Only thing I remember, when he was let go, an-and we were co – we came home – when we knew he was home, and I remember him sitting at the – at the table in our family room, shaving off his beard.</span> <span id="s146">Course, he had a growth of beard for the – from the whole week, I guess.</span> <span id="s147">So I remember him sitting there shaving his beard, that’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: And what happened to the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Well, my father was able to sell his store.</span> <span id="s150">Now th – I think he sold it already before that.</span> <span id="s151">My grandfather still was really plundered.</span> <span id="s152">That was plundered and all the windows were smashed, and I think I once saw a little bit of it.</span> <span id="s153">But like I said, my family, I think they shielded us, you know, from this.</span> <span id="s154">They didn’t – they didn’t want me to see it or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s155">And of course, our synagogue was burned down.</span> <span id="s156">The schoolhouse that we – I attended, that’s next to the synagogue, that was not burned, only the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And did you witness the fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: No, no, we lived too far away.</span> <span id="s159">No, we lived too far away, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And right after Kristallnacht, when you tried to go to school – why don’t you tell me a little bit about schooling, when you had to move to a Jewish school, whether it was close –</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Well, I started right from a Jewish school, I never went to any other school.</span> <span id="s162">It was na – ah – ah – it was intermittent, because I think our teacher left ha – where is – it was a one room schoolhouse, basically, all the grades together, you know?</span> <span id="s163">And a – th-they were – there was intermittent because the teacher that finally came to our school came from the neighboring town called Straubing, and he had to come on the train.</span> <span id="s164">And if the train was late, he was late, so, you know, schooling was intermittent.</span> <span id="s165">So, actually I – I don’t remember too much about that.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, it was basically I guess from – we were suppose – well, we were supposed to leave in – in August of ’39, or September of ’39, and just when the war – we had packed everything up, after my parents had made special furniture, small for here, because they knew the apartments here were much smaller, and we moved in with my grandparents and then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s167">And it was – we were supposed to go by way of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Okay, before – I want to talk about emigration, but let me ask one other question with this school; did they shut the school down after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, not really, that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: So you were able the next day to just come back to school?</span> <span id="s171">A: No, I don’t remember it was – it was the next day or it was a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s172">I really don’t have any recollection of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s174">Okay, let’s talk about emigration.</span> <span id="s175">Do you remember listening to your parent talk about wanting to leave Germany, and what those discussions entailed?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Oh yeah, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: When they first wanted to leave [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: – oh, well, I mean, we knew we were getting ready to leave, and that – like I said, my parents, you know, had special furniture made that would be smaller.</span> <span id="s179">Beds that would go up into the wall, you know, things like that, because they knew here it would be a smaller place where we would be able to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: And do they have any trouble getting emigration visas?</span> <span id="s181">A: No, my father had a brother here, who had been here since 1926, I think, and through him we had the affidavits.</span> <span id="s182">And we had numbers to go to the consulate in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s183">And we did go there, you know, we had to have clearance as far as health was concerned and all that.</span> <span id="s184">So I remember going to Stuttgart where the – where the American consulate was, and you know, being checked out and we – everything was okay, and we had the visas.</span> <span id="s185">Before nine – before September ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And then – describe what – you were saying that you were supposed to go to England and the war broke out, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well, yeah, I mean, that – that – then the whole thing got scrapped because we couldn’t leave, we a-are – we had already packed all our things, so we moved in with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s188">And the – the correspondence that I found after – actually my father’s death many, many years later, was regarding – the Americans evidently gave us a hard time because there were four of us, and my father’s brother here wasn’t making enough money, although he worked for relatives here, and the – the ones – was very reluctant to put his name down that he would support us in case he di – we needed to.</span> <span id="s189">So, I think they finally persuaded him, si – but we never took a penny from him, but just to put his name on the – on – you know, this – America was in a depression at that time, so my uncle had a hard time convincing them that even if we came here, he – we would not be a burden to them.</span> <span id="s190">So, you know, that – that I remember.</span> <span id="s191">You know, tha-that correspondence I read mon – many years later.</span> <span id="s192">My father didn’t die until 1984.</span> <span id="s193">But I found all that in correspondence.</span> <span id="s194">And it was even discussion about sending me to Switzerland because my father had relatives there, you know, so I found all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Let’s come back, so September ’39, you’re packed and it falls through.</span> <span id="s196">Describe those events, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, you know, I was – how old – was ’38, I was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: And I don’t think it’s – it really sunk in.</span> <span id="s200">I just knew we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s201">In fact, I remember a couple times there was alarms if we were gonna get bombed, then we had to go down to the cellar.</span> <span id="s202">But other than that, I don’t have much memory of that.</span> <span id="s203">I know my family kept us busy doing arts and crafts at home.</span> <span id="s204">They always found things for – for me and my sister to do, to keep us busy, I guess, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And then how did you finally get out?</span> <span id="s206">A: Well, we finally got left – in fact, it was my sister’s birthday, February 18th, 1940, we took a train to Munich and we stayed in a hotel I remember, and people came to see my father, to give him messages to take us to people that lived in America, asking them to help.</span> <span id="s207">I think that’s what it was all about.</span> <span id="s208">And the next day we took a train over the Brenner Pass to Italy, to Genoa.</span> <span id="s209">And I remember I was very nervous crossing the Brenner Pass, because you know, I did hear that they had taken people off the trains if they found smuggling anything, you know.</span> <span id="s210">If they put thing – people used to hide things in the lining of their coats and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s211">So we were worried about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: And were you searched when you crossed into Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, we were not searched, but just the thought of it made me sick in my stomach after we left.</span> <span id="s214">But we – we got through.</span> <span id="s215">My grandmother made sure we had nothing contra, because she didn’t want anything to happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And then after you arrived in Genoa –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, we – we had to spend a few days there, and you know, we walked around a little bit, we didn’t have much money, I guess, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s218">But, you know, my parents – and the place we were staying was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s219">I mean, I know that.</span> <span id="s220">And we finally boarded the pip – th-the – the ship and I have a picture of the ship, you know, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And this –</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: – it was a terrible voyage for me, I got sick as a dog because of the weather.</span> <span id="s223">I mean, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Which month is this?</span> <span id="s225">This is –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Si – February –</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Of ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yeah, by way of the Mediterranean, and the cross from Gibraltar and over to – to the States and we landed in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Is the fact that the war was on, we – was there any fear of torpedoes or bombing, or you just se –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: If there was I didn’t know, but I barely got out of bed.</span> <span id="s231">And my sister, she was fine, she went up to eat dinner, she did everything.</span> <span id="s232">She was fine, but I was a sick one, yeah.</span> <span id="s233">The only thing I remember, when we got near New York, that my father actually carried me up to sh – see the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s234">That – that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I don’t remember, really, I just remember that – that part of it, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So, let’s talk a little bit about what happened once you got to New York.</span> <span id="s238">Did you start school immediately, or did you wait for the next year?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well, no, we – we actually did not stay in New York.</span> <span id="s240">We stayed a few days with friends of ours as – from – from Regensburg, had come earlier, and my sister and I stayed with them, and my parents were invited to stay with some other relatives who are already very well-to-do, had been here, I guess, for many, many years.</span> <span id="s241">And we, immediately after that, took a train to Washington, because my uncle lived here in Washington, and the other relatives that – that they had, that had been here many years always lived in Washington.</span> <span id="s242">So we came right to Washington, we never stayed in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: And what was your life like as a new immigrant?</span> <span id="s244">Did you feel a lot of culture shock?</span> <span id="s245">Were you able to mix in with the American kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Well, you know, it was a little bit difficult.</span> <span id="s247">I had taken English lessons in Germany already, cause you know, my parents knew that was gonna happen.</span> <span id="s248">So I had taken English lessons.</span> <span id="s249">We went to live with my uncle the first four months or so.</span> <span id="s250">I mean, he ha – he had bought a little house, it wasn’t a very big house.</span> <span id="s251">It was in a good neighborhood called Glover Park, I don’t know if you’re familiar, off Wisconsin Avenue?</span> <span id="s252">And he had a wife and one son, and also my grandmother on – father’s mother had come right after Kristallnacht, they brought her out – he brought her over here.</span> <span id="s253">So they were for – four, and we were four, eight of us in that little house.</span> <span id="s254">We, my parents and my sister and I all slept down in the basement.</span> <span id="s255">It was a built out basement, but we stayed – you know, we lived there.</span> <span id="s256">And we were taken to the elementary school in the neighborhood, which – and they gave me some tutoring in math, I was – think I was be – I was like in the fifth grade then, because you know, I – I had a little – little – didn’t have that much schooling over there, so they gave me tutoring, and they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s257">And then, I do remember some kids calling us Nazis and stuff, you know, but you know, we had to let go, what could we do, you know?</span> <span id="s258">We were here, we were safe, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s259">And the summer, during the summer, through the Jewish Community Center, we were sent to Camp Louise, I don’t know if you – you may – so my sister and I both were sent there for three weeks, which was really nice of them to do that, you know, they did a lot, the Jewish community and also the Washington Hebrew congregation, where we finally ended up, which was mostly juv – German Jews.</span> <span id="s260">Took us in, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: When you say took us in, what sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, let us go to –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: – hospitality –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: – Sunday school, Sunday school.</span> <span id="s265">And they had a newcomers club too, at that time that my parents, I think, you know, went to.</span> <span id="s266">So, yeah.</span> <span id="s267">An-And eventually we were able to get an apartment – you want me to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Sure, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I think that following September, my parents were able to afford a one bedroom apartment for the four of us, you know.</span> <span id="s270">My father had gotten some work th-through si – through the relatives that were mostly members of Washington Hebrew, and were in better circumstances.</span> <span id="s271">Americ – they were already a hundred percent Americans.</span> <span id="s272">And his first job was selling [indecipherable] door to door – not door to door, by recommendation, a company called Real Silk.</span> <span id="s273">They sold socks, men’s socks and ties and I don’t know what else, you know, and he was able to make money, little bit of money, you know, he wa – he was in – you know, so – and then Giant Food, Mr. Cohen was very good to the Jewish immigrants here, and gave everybody a job.</span> <span id="s274">So he worked for them on the weekends.</span> <span id="s275">They – they only had, I think at that time, two stores in this area, but he went to work on the weekends, you know, working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And how many immigrants were working there?</span> <span id="s277">I’m actually very interested in this, to find out more about how the Jewish community here was helping the immigr –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I – I really – I-I know – I mean, I really don’t know too many, I-I know a couple people that worked with him at that time, but I don’t really remember how many, but you know, he worked there, and then – so I – all I know is one time one of them said to him, if you crack a few eggs, he’ll let you take them home for free.</span> <span id="s279">So, you know, he was able to bring home some – some eggs for us to have, you know.</span> <span id="s280">And you know, we managed.</span> <span id="s281">My sister and I went to school then.</span> <span id="s282">My mother also got a job working as a housekeeper for a family.</span> <span id="s283">You know, and then she eventually found a job working for a family where she basically took care of the – the children while the parents were working.</span> <span id="s284">So, you know, she – she had to work too, you know, they both worked, and we were kind of left to our own.</span> <span id="s285">At home we were supposed to clean the apartment and stuff, you know?</span> <span id="s286">And my sister was a rebel.</span> <span id="s287">So – but, you know, we managed it, but th – after that – and then what happened, my grandparents, my mother’s parents were still in Germany, and they had a lot of trouble, they had to pay tax upon tax, and they had to repair the – the store front and everything, you know.</span> <span id="s288">They taxed them because they did have money.</span> <span id="s289">And they finally got out in May of 1940, which was late.</span> <span id="s290">And they – they used to have these, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the closed trains?</span> <span id="s291">They were trains that were closed from Berlin to I think Lisbon, Portugal.</span> <span id="s292">Well, by the time they were ready to leave, there were no more closed trains, it had stopped already.</span> <span id="s293">And this is all secondhand, because I heard the story through my aunt who stayed behind, you know, who was married, my mother’s sister was married to the Gentile.</span> <span id="s294">They went – they were in Munich, and they went to the airline and she gave them one ticket.</span> <span id="s295">And they just said no, we’re not go – one – either we both go or we don’t go.</span> <span id="s296">And so my aunt said, you gotta shmear them, you know, give them a little money under the table.</span> <span id="s297">Maybe tomorrow you’ll – so she did, next day she had two tickets.</span> <span id="s298">I mean, there – there were people that were not bad, they helped.</span> <span id="s299">And so they got on a plane and they were able to go to Lisbon, Portugal, and from there they took a ship, one of those last few out of Lisbon to New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: And came to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yeah, well, they were supposed to stay in New York with my – with their son, who had come earlier, and he was drafted by then.</span> <span id="s302">So they all came to Washington, in the one bedroom apartment, in May of 1940.</span> <span id="s303">And you know, we managed a hot summer, no air conditioning.</span> <span id="s304">And I think in September finally, my family was able to get a two bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s305">So my grandparents had a room, my sister and I had a room and my parents were sleeping in the living room.</span> <span id="s306">That’s how it was, you know.</span> <span id="s307">But we were there from 1941 until 1948.</span> <span id="s308">And I went to high school there, you know, out of that milieu, I mean, we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: And during the rest of the war years, from ’40 to ’45, how much correspondence and communication was there with your aunt who was still in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Well, there were relatives of my father’s who had lived in Switzerland for many years already, had come back long before.</span> <span id="s311">And through them we were able to communicate.</span> <span id="s312">I mean, like we sh – we would send a letter to Switzerland, and I guess there was – maybe send her a postcard saying, heard from, you know, everything is okay, and she would write a postcard back, without a return sender, I’m sure, just to say I’m okay, or something.</span> <span id="s313">So that way, they knew that they were okay, you know.</span> <span id="s314">That’s th – they were the intermediaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And what was your – do you have any memory of news sources during the war?</span> <span id="s316">How you were foll – how much news was reaching the United States, how you followed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, like I say, that – you know, I remember Pearl Harbor, that I remember, and you know, during the war, I mean, I don’t think there was – we didn’t know that much.</span> <span id="s318">I mean, nobody really knew it, although I understand, there was corres – that people knew – well, my aunt in ger – who stayed behind in Germany told me after the war that when the soldiers came back from the eastern front, the German soldiers, they told her what was going on over there, they knew about it.</span> <span id="s319">But of course, they were afraid to talk, I guess, because they would have been shot too, you know.</span> <span id="s320">But she knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Even throughout the war?</span> <span id="s322">During the war, this ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Well, probably a little bit later.</span> <span id="s324">Well, there were my cousins, my father’s sister, one sister, one sister got out with her husband.</span> <span id="s325">The other ones didn’t.</span> <span id="s326">They stayed – they se – actually sent their children to England on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s327">And by the time they wanted to leave, they just couldn’t get out any more.</span> <span id="s328">And my aunt told me – this was after the war – that they came to say goodbye to her, and she knew what was gonna happen.</span> <span id="s329">She knew about it.</span> <span id="s330">Course, she didn’t tell them, you know, they – in fact, my cousin who now lives here said to me, she also, through – they had a very good housekeeper who helped them have – through, you know, you – she said, her mother went out and had warm clothes made, because she knew they were going east.</span> <span id="s331">They were one of the last deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And do you know where they were deported to?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah, I ha – I think it was Auschwitz, and actually, she just found out not long ago that her mother was not gassed immediately.</span> <span id="s334">Her father was, and he was one of seven brothers, and I think five of them, they were gassed imme – they were older, they were gassed immediately, but her mother was working, sewing or doing something, and she contracted typhoid fever, and then that’s what did her in.</span> <span id="s335">So, you know, but that was my father’s second sister.</span> <span id="s336">The first one was able to get out and lived in New York City.</span> <span id="s337">So, you know.</span> <span id="s338">So they’re – they’re the only close relatives that we really lost.</span> <span id="s339">And they were very Orthodox, you know, they were the kind that thought God will help, and you know.</span> <span id="s340">It was a big family.</span> <span id="s341">The name was Einstein, and they were from Augsburg.</span> <span id="s342">And they were a – cattle dealers and they were well-to-do, I mean, they just di – n-never thought anything like this would happen.</span> <span id="s343">By the time they really wanted to get out, they wanted to go to Rhodesia, and they wouldn’t take children.</span> <span id="s344">So, you know, they just didn’t believe it would ever happen, because with their money, they were better off – well a – better off than I think my family was.</span> <span id="s345">But they just didn’t believe, you know, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And when – when your father found out about his sister – how much after the war he learned?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, I don’t know, I don’t remember that, when it was.</span> <span id="s348">I-I’m not sure exactly how long it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So – so, before we conclude, I guess, the last questions, did your parents – did you notice any change after they learned about the war, difficulties adjusting to the United States, to what extent they discussed this?</span> <span id="s350">How much talk was there in your house when you were in – already older, in high school, or like college, about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Well, I don’t think there was too much talk about it.</span> <span id="s352">The one thing I should tell you is my mother, unfortunately, when we finally – they got on their feet, they were able to buy a house in 1949, I guess.</span> <span id="s353">My mother had gotten sick, and she had cancer.</span> <span id="s354">So, I mean, that was a real problem, you know.</span> <span id="s355">My grandparents were still living with us, her parents, and she passed away in 1950.</span> <span id="s356">I mean, I was able to finish high school, but college, I had to pay my own way and I never finished because, you know, I had to help my father actually, after my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s357">So that kind of put a dent in it.</span> <span id="s358">And the fact that they were fairly young, we spoke mostly English in our house.</span> <span id="s359">And of course my grandparents weren’t happy with what happened in Europe and everything, and my grandfather took it very hard when my mother passed away, so you know.</span> <span id="s360">And then I do remember after the war was over that they sent packages over there for my aunt and her family every week.</span> <span id="s361">And they also had another – a group called self help, and they were mostly the German Jewish refugees here, that sent packages over to – to people.</span> <span id="s362">Food, you know, to help whoever was left, or whoever survived.</span> <span id="s363">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s364">So, you know, d-discussion, I really don’t remember that much, that they ever talked about it too much.</span> <span id="s365">So, you know, luckily that they – my mother’s sister survived.</span> <span id="s366">That was a big thing already, you know.</span> <span id="s367">And actually, her brother who ended up in the army, went to see her.</span> <span id="s368">I think that was – happened, you know, after liberation, and did find that she was in – you know, they were okay, you know, that they survived, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s369">So, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And they remained in Germany throughout the rest of their lives, or did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah, they remained in Germany.</span> <span id="s372">They did come over here.</span> <span id="s373">My grandparents were able to celebrate their 50th wedding anniv – well, she came over first, I think in – after my mother had passed away already, and then they came over for my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary.</span> <span id="s374">So that was, you know.</span> <span id="s375">But my aunt – and she came back a few more times after her husband passed away, and told me that after everybody had left, she had never converted to Catholicism when she married him, but she said, after everybody left, she felt like she needed to belong someplace.</span> <span id="s376">She felt alone, you know, and – not that she was strong in Judaism, but she became Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did she ever feel any unease living in Germany, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yeah, she did, she did.</span> <span id="s379">She said even after – she had moved to Munich, and she had an apartment there, and she said whenever she came over here to visit, she would never say she’s coming to see her family, cause she didn’t want everybody – anyone to know that she was Jewish originally, and said she was coming to see friends.</span> <span id="s380">So she did have a certain amount of unease about letting people know that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s381">But we have kept in touch with the cousins.</span> <span id="s382">In fact, the children of one of the cousins just came – was here visiting with me, and her husband.</span> <span id="s383">And you know, my children have gone over and stayed with them.</span> <span id="s384">So we have a good rela – I mean, they were never Nazi, none of them Nazis, you know.</span> <span id="s385">Of course, they were children too, but – and we – my husband and I had visited over there, you know, so we have kept up the relationship, you know.</span> <span id="s386">So they know who we are, and we know who they are, and then, you know, they’re not – they’re not strong Catholics either, you know.</span> <span id="s387">But yeah, we do have the relationship with them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So, is there anything else that you’d like to say, that you feel we haven’t covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No, I – I think – no, you definitely – mother’s mother, my grandmother, was very – very active in the community, in our town, as – has rubbed double off on me, because I have gotten involved here in a lot of community things.</span> <span id="s390">I mean, I was very active in BBG, and you know, president of my BBG group, and active in adult things, you know.</span> <span id="s391">And I’m active here in the Jewish residence, and now I’m president of a group of widows and widowers, which meets at the JCC, so I think it somehow rubbed off on me to be active and give – give back.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s393">And if ste –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: And also volunteer at the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And is the fact that you came to the United States as an immigrant affected your attitudes about anything, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Well, I’m – I’m – I’m a liberal, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s397">You know, I’m kind of hope things, and always wish that things would get better here, an-and hope, you know.</span> <span id="s398">So, you know, tell my children about – they know about my background, they know, and you know, that it was hard, I – you know, I had to pull myself up by my bootstraps, and had to pay for everything myself, it wasn’t given to me on a silver platter, so – although, my parents did get some restitution eventually, but it wasn’t much, and you know, basically I had to fend for myself.</span> <span id="s399">And luckily, when I met my husband – he was also from Germany, he was from Hamburg, but he had established himself over here by that – he came a little earlier, 1937, and had become a photographer and – and had opened a studio, and I felt it was my duty to help him, so I became like the manager of the place.</span> <span id="s400">So, you know, we both worked hard, and you know, we made a fairly good living, you know.</span> <span id="s401">And started all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Well, thank you so much.</span> <span
