Bowers.</span> <span id="s8">“K” standing for....</span> <span id="s9">A: Kenneth.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q:.</span> <span id="s11">And your address I have down here is 110 Woodland Drive, Warner Robins, GA, 31093.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Your date of birth, January 30, 1917.</span> <span id="s14">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Your age at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s16">A: Heavens!</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: That's a toughie when we start asking those questions.</span> <span id="s18">A: I guess 21 or 22, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your prospective profession at the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born and raised on a farm in Kansas.</span> <span id="s21">They were difficult times then, and I enlisted in the Air Force in 1939 to go to the aircraft mechanics school at Chanute Field.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: You enlisted in the Air Force after working on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">And at that time, American Air Lines was buying out graduates from this school and it was a way for me to get a trade.</span> <span id="s25">And after one year service, you could buy out for $120-some dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: When you say "buy out," what are we...?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: They would give you a discharge.</span> <span id="s28">And that' s the reason I happened to enlist and got in that early.</span> <span id="s29">So I guess I meant professional Air Force...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Professional military Air Force.</span> <span id="s31">And your present occupation is what?</span> <span id="s32">A: I am retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Your military unit at the time that you were in the Air Force?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: The 91st Squadron, 439th Group was the outfit I was assigned to and belonged to all during the war, but during the last two months of the war, I was detached to the 19th Tactical Air Command which was Patton's supporting Air Force.</span> <span id="s35">We were up there at his advanced headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And your rank at the time of the liberation?</span> <span id="s37">A: I was a Flight Officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Which camp were you in any way involved in?</span> <span id="s39">A: Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: That gets us directly into the camp situation now.</span> <span id="s41">You got there after the liberation.</span> <span id="s42">You said earlier 4 or 5 days after the liberation.</span> <span id="s43">How did you get near there?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: The guy I was working for up there at the l9th Tactical Air Command which was what the Army called G-2, Intelligence, came back in the office one day and said that Patton's troops had just overrun a camp.</span> <span id="s45">So 3 or 4 or 5 days later, he said, "Let's go up there and look at it and see."</span> <span id="s46">He had access to a staff car and it was about a 2 hour drive.</span> <span id="s47">He heard all these awful.... [Brief interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s48">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span> <span id="s49">So he and I drove up that day.</span> <span id="s50">At that time Patton had assigned a bunch of medics to that area and I guess also some cooks, too, because as you can see [referring to his photographs], there were a lot of very, very sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: I saw your pictures here.</span> <span id="s52">Do you remember the date you entered the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Let's see, when did the war end?</span> <span id="s54">V-E day was what, April, wasn't it?</span> <span id="s55">All this would probably have been in March....</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: March or April.</span> <span id="s57">You entered the camp with this one gentleman.</span> <span id="s58">A: With this colonel that [unintelligible] detached.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And when you entered the camp, what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: There was a big, vast open area as you can see in this picture here.</span> <span id="s61">And one of the first things ...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you take these pictures yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s64">They had erected this monument made out of old plywood, and I think there's some numbers on there as to how many they saw perish -- 51,000 or something like that.</span> <span id="s65">This was the entrance to it.</span> <span id="s66">[Referring to photograph] Just an ordinary looking building.</span> <span id="s67">But after this sign, the monument, there's a huge vast open area and then a whole mess of low barracks-type buildings.</span> <span id="s68">We called them barracks.</span> <span id="s69">Then we met this German Jew who had only been incarcerated there for several weeks and he spoke some English.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: This was a German Jew, did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s72">He'd only been in there for several weeks so he was not emaciated like some of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: He looks awfully good.</span> <span id="s74">[Referring to photograph]</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, he'd only been there for a short time.</span> <span id="s76">Inside the long, low buildings were shelves standing six feet out from the wall, one on top of the other, and that's where the inmates slept and spent their time.</span> <span id="s77">He said that when they were first incarcerated they were all on work details, early in the morning until late at night, and they fed them one bowl of gruel a day.</span> <span id="s78">An interesting point is one of the medics that we talked to said when they first got there, they cooked up a lot of solid food for them.</span> <span id="s79">They lost a lot from the solid food, so they had to go back and put them on a soup type thing and gradually start feeding them.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Ate too quickly and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: When you entered and you saw these layers, barracks, were there any people still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s84">There were a few of them aro und here that were still alive.</span> <span id="s85">Where are they?</span> <span id="s86">[Referring to photograph] Yes, here they are.</span> <span id="s87">It was harder to look at those people than the corpses in that it seemed life had gone from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">They didn't show any emotion.</span> <span id="s89">I suppose you could say they were really more dead than alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: You took those pictures so you were fairly near to them.</span> <span id="s91">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: They did not respond to you in any way.</span> <span id="s93">A: No, those didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: No overtures of welcome or no speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Some of them did.</span> <span id="s96">The ones that were better able to walk around.</span> <span id="s97">But these were just sitting there in the sun.</span> <span id="s98">Interestingly enough, when we did first enter, there were some of them that came up and threw their arms around us and that type of emotion was displayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Were these severely emaciated people who threw their arms around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Not severely, but bad enough.</span> <span id="s101">You could tell they had been on a starvation diet.</span> <span id="s102">Sunken cheeks and that type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: If you were to go back to that period, can you remember any feeling on your part when they threw their arms around you?</span> <span id="s104">Was it an uncomfortable feeling?</span> <span id="s105">Repulsive?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No.</span> <span id="s107">It was just a shocking, stunning thing.</span> <span id="s108">You just could not comprehend one human doing this to another human.</span> <span id="s109">Incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s110">We stayed there for several hours and wandered around, and it gradually wore on you just what an awful, awful thing it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What did you expect to see when you walked in there?</span> <span id="s112">Did you have any idea?</span> <span id="s113">Obviously somebody came back and reported to you that a camp had been taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: This Colonel had had a report.</span> <span id="s115">Yes.</span> <span id="s116">Q: Did you expect to see what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s118">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s119">That was one of the reasons I’m so glad that I did have the presence of mind to take that old camera with me because memories fade.</span> <span id="s120">Talking about that, I did want to say that on the way back that evening, we noticed that we were itching and I looked at the Colonel and he was itching too so we had gotten body lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: From the embrace of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: And it would be an awful, awful thing to have to live with body lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Which is what they did for a long period of time.</span> <span id="s124">If you were asked to give a description of the sounds of the camp, the smell of the camp, would anything come to mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, I would say the lack of sound more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: At this point, had people left already?</span> <span id="s127">Were there any guards when you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Of our people, you mean?</span> <span id="s129">Guards?</span> <span id="s130">Q: No, German.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s132">There were two SS that they caught at the time the camp was liberated and here they are.</span> <span id="s133">[Referring to photograph]</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s135">The two SS, obviously from this picture, were shot.</span> <span id="s136">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: By the liberators?</span> <span id="s138">No?</span> <span id="s139">By the inmates?</span> <span id="s140">A: The inmates clubbed them to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: The inmates clubbed these two to death?</span> <span id="s142">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s143">So I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Who identified these people for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: He kind of gave us a guided tour, as well as he could, and took us all around through here.</span> <span id="s146">His English was so bad and then we had to work with sign language.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And your German wasn't too good, either, so you had a little difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: So as far as getting an emotional reaction, verbal reaction, it was rather difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: The language barrier makes it very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: [Referring to photographs] This is the crematorium here.</span> <span id="s151">Here's visiting allied troops here.</span> <span id="s152">Americans.</span> <span id="s153">But he said at times he’d seen flames as high as 30 meters.</span> <span id="s154">I think there were about 10 or 12 furnaces in there.</span> <span id="s155">And these bodies here were all stacked up in front of it.</span> <span id="s156">What these people are looking at are these corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: These are Americans in here.</span> <span id="s158">So at the time you went it, you were not alone.</span> <span id="s159">A: I was not a liberator, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What were those Americans doing there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Some of them were assigned there to medics and cooks, that type of support crew.</span> <span id="s162">I suppose some of them were visitors just like we were.</span> <span id="s163">I understood Patton visited the camp also very shortly after it was liberated.</span> <span id="s164">And when they were talking to the townspeople, the townspeople didn't know anything about it so Patton had some of his M.P.'s round up the whole town and march them out there and took them through it.</span> <span id="s165">He wanted to make sure that they couldn't say that they didn't know anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did you talk to any German citizens at the time?</span> <span id="s167">A: No, we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: I have some questions here as to the survivors of the camp.</span> <span id="s169">I don't know how much you experienced.</span> <span id="s170">Since you were a visitor, you certainly had no specific orders as to treatment of the people that you were going to be meeting up with.</span> <span id="s171">You were just kind of going through there on your own.</span> <span id="s172">How did the Colonel who was with you react to what he saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: That's difficult to say.</span> <span id="s174">You were so stunned and shocked by what you were seeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Was there much communication between the two of you as you were walking into the camp, when you saw your first mound of bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s177">What's to say, really?</span> <span id="s178">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s179">Observing it, each for himself.</span> <span id="s180">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Obviously you have pictures here.</span> <span id="s182">Did the conditions there make you feel in any way that you were looking at something that was less than human?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: [Unintelligible] Because we wouldn’t treat an animal that way.</span> <span id="s184">You see, as I understood it, this thing was a systematic starvation and that's the way they did it.</span> <span id="s185">They would work them until they couldn't walk or perform any manual labor any more and then, I guess, as you can see, they were just starved to death.</span> <span id="s186">Just look.</span> <span id="s187">Some of them that were still able to walk around... maybe we could blow some of these pictures up.</span> <span id="s188">[Referring to photograph] But, here's a fellow here -- he had so little meat on the body that you could tell where the part of the arm that has two bones in it is and the part that has just one and the same way with the leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: You remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s191">What makes you remember is that you didn't see how he could walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: No muscle there to support the bone structure.</span> <span id="s193">How do you move about?</span> <span id="s194">A: How can he move about?</span> <span id="s195">But he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: You were at the camp for a couple of hours, you said, and you kind of went from one area to the other.</span> <span id="s197">What do you think made you move on from one area to the other after you saw your first sight?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s199">Curiosity?</span> <span id="s200">Of course, this gentleman was showing us things.</span> <span id="s201">Q: So he was moving you right along.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: He was moving us around.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: He seemed to be quite familiar with everything that was going on there, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">Of course, right after they were liberated they probably had a lot more communication than they did before, so he was familiar with what went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did any of the survivors that you saw that were able to get around react to this gentleman here that was taking you around?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Some of them spoke to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: It’s just sort of unusual to see somebody so well-fed, well-dressed in contrast to the totally emaciated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: So healthy as he looked.</span> <span id="s210">Right.</span> <span id="s211">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: You kind of wonder how he got there, when he got there, what he did to stay out of what was going on there.</span> <span id="s213">When you returned to your own camp afterwards, did you share any of what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: With the people that were in the G-2 office there.</span> <span id="s215">Q: That was the Intelligence Office.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Was it new to them, what you shared with them, or was it something that they had already seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No.</span> <span id="s219">We urged them if at all possible to get up there and see it.</span> <span id="s220">Q: They hadn't gone there?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What was their reaction to what you said?</span> <span id="s223">A: Horror, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Had they heard anything about it?</span> <span id="s225">Were there rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: As I recall now, we had heard of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s227">But [we had no] pictures and I don't think that just verbally you could really get [the description] across.</span> <span id="s228">It's incomprehensible, unbelievable that this kind of thing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: It's really difficult to absorb so how can you communicate to somebody else.</span> <span id="s230">You were married at the time that you were in the service.</span> <span id="s231">Did you write about this in any letters going home?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s233">I suppose I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Mrs. Bowers: Only that you had gone in to see it.</span> <span id="s235">Not in great detail.</span> <span id="s236">It was too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: No detail.</span> <span id="s238">And these pictures had not gone home.</span> <span id="s239">You took these pictures back with you, so you [directed to Mrs. Bowers] were totally unaware, essentially, of what he had seen.</span> <span id="s240">What was the first time you shared what you had seen in those camps with anybody outside of your officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: After I'd gotten home and found the pictures and everything, I described it to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Do you remember, Mrs. Bowers?</span> <span id="s243">I’m making you think all the way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">That's kind of rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Mrs. Bowers: When did you have those developed?</span> <span id="s246">You didn't send them to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No, I was afraid to send them because all our stuff was censored.</span> <span id="s248">Q: Fear of not getting through.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I just kept them and brought them back with me.</span> <span id="s250">Q: When did you take these out again?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: It’s been about 2 years now that I heard about this World War II Glider Pilot Association reunion, and for years all these pictures were in an old cigar box just helter-skelter.</span> <span id="s252">In making plans to go to this Glider Pilot reunion, we dug them up one cold, gray Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s253">I started putting them in order as much as I could.</span> <span id="s254">This was before the television movie "Holocaust."</span> <span id="s255">Then a high school kid had some kind of a project to interview people who had been in combat in World War II so she brought her little tape recorder and did the interview.</span> <span id="s256">Then I happened to think about those pictures and I said I would let her borrow them to show them to the class, so they came out again.</span> <span id="s257">Of course, when we go to these Glider Pilot reunions we always take them.</span> <span id="s258">Everybody takes whatever memorabilia they have to reminisce and relive experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Mrs.Bowers: They usually have a "War Room" set up with albums and</span></p> <p><span id="s260">things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s262">So you obviously attended the Glider Pilot reunion.</span> <span id="s263">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Were there many such pictures from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: No.</span> <span id="s266">Very few glider pilots got in to see anything like that, and I wouldn't have had I not been detached up to the 19th Tactical Air Command.</span> <span id="s267">That was pretty close to the front.</span> <span id="s268">The troop carrier was always way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So those are really unusual pictures that you have.</span> <span id="s270">You really didn't hear too much about the camps by mail or anything like that.</span> <span id="s271">Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No children.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I was just going to ask you whether or not they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: From what I've read and from accounts that I recall then, I suppose that this was not the worst one.</span> <span id="s275">I understand some of the others -- you may know more about that -- were much more cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Auschwitz was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s277">Dachau.</span> <span id="s278">But Buchenwald was really one of the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Oh, it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s281">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I've never been able to talk to anyone to compare.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Definitely was one of the worst camps.</span> <span id="s284">Right in line with the worst camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I once had the idea that possibly it wasn't in that they didn't gas anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: But there were very torturous things going on with the women and medical experimentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I wanted to mention something that came to mind about a thing that almost killed me.</span> <span id="s289">When we got up close to the two Nazi SS types, one of the inmates of the camp kicked the corpse.</span> <span id="s290">And that to me would express hatred more vividly than anything that you could possibly imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: That must have been something for you to see, and you weren't able to talk to the inmate.</span> <span id="s292">I guess humanity left them all.</span> <span id="s293">When you exist in such an inhuman way for a period of time, you lose your humanity.</span> <span id="s294">Did you ever have any nightmares about this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No.</span> <span id="s296">I can't say I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: We're going to go on to some of the religion questions that we would like to include.</span> <span id="s298">Do you consider yourself a religious man now?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did you at the time?</span> <span id="s301">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Were there any conscious thoughts about God, or religion, at the time that you entered this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No.</span> <span id="s304">None that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Any irreligious thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I don't know what you mean by "irreligious."</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: [Thoughts like] is there a God?</span> <span id="s308">Questioning the existence of God, the idea of good.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s310">You just couldn’t fathom how one people could do this to another people.</span> <span id="s311">A lot of times after combat you have second thoughts about "what am I doing here" and all this, but knowing that we were a part of eliminating that kind of thing made you feel that maybe this whole thing was worthwhile and I did make a contribution, however insignificant it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did you see a lot of death of your own fellow soldiers around you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I don't know what you mean by "a lot."</span> <span id="s314">I saw enough.</span> <span id="s315">Q: Any at close proximity... shot, killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I gave morphine to one of the kids who rode in the glider with me who was hit in the abdomen and I'm sure he never made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: That was death, too, and now we have the kind of death that you viewed here in the Buchenwald concentration camp.</span> <span id="s318">Was there ever a difference for you in how you looked at death?</span> <span id="s319">You may have seen it from one of your fellow soldiers and [you saw] the type of death you were viewing here [at the camp].</span> <span id="s320">Was there a difference or was it all just war?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I guess it's all just war.</span> <span id="s322">Or a part of war.</span> <span id="s323">I know some of the guys who got killed...I don't know.</span> <span id="s324">You don't think about it a lot because you don't know when the next mission is coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: It's a difficult question.</span> <span id="s326">It's just that sometimes you have a flashing memory of what you may have thought there at the time.</span> <span id="s327">What is your religion, if I may ask that?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I'm Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did your religion have any effect on your attitude toward the Nazis?</span> <span id="s330">A: By "Nazis", do you mean the Germans, the SS, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: The SS - the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I don't suppose we gave it a whole lot of thought.</span> <span id="s333">We flew gliders and made invasions and there was always the very real possibility of being captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">We were always told never to surrender to the SS.</span> <span id="s335">The Wehrmacht, the regular German Army, was O.K.</span> <span id="s336">You might survive, but the SS, no.</span> <span id="s337">Of course, they told us how to identify them.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So there was a real difference between...?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s340">I’m not tying in with religion but we had been told then that there was a difference.</span> <span id="s341">But I don't believe that I really thought that much about it until I saw what the SS had done.</span> <span id="s342">Then I think that you just wonder how Hitler and his henchmen could get a breed of men like this that could do these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Did what you saw there have any effect on your political point of view?</span> <span id="s344">A: In what regard?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: The civil rights movement, the Viet Nam War, the Mid-East situation.</span> <span id="s346">A: I'm sure it did, but how could I know the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: In other words, there are no correlated thoughts such as: Look what</span></p> <p><span id="s348">happened here....</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: And could it happen again.</span> <span id="s350">I suppose maybe you thought about that sometime during the civil rights struggle, with some of the beatings and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Did you think of what occurred at the Buchenwald camp as any particular type of persecution?</span> <span id="s352">As a Jewish persecution, as a general persecution for anybody who disagreed with the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s353">Do you remember thinking of it or even discussing the camp situation in relation to a particular type of persecution or was it always war and this was the Nazi's way of dealing....</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: This was Jewish persecution there.</span> <span id="s355">Of course, we had been told that some political prisoners were put into these camps.</span> <span id="s356">I had no personal knowledge that this happened.</span> <span id="s357">I believe that's all I can elaborate on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Can you relate any of the feelings that you may have had about Buchenwald and the experience there, with part of it having been a Jewish persecution, to the situation in the Mideast today?</span> <span id="s359">Do you have any personal feelings about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: I don't know what you're driving at.</span> <span id="s361">I am real elated that Egypt and Israel are at least talking to each other, exchanging ambassadors, and I think there's a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, in that regard.</span> <span id="s362">I don't understand all I know about the PLO movement and all of that, why such intense hatred exists in that area.</span> <span id="s363">I do know that there's a tremendous amount of refugees in that area yet.</span> <span id="s364">I guess there's two sides to the issue and I suppose I would tend to favor the Jewish side in that, knowing that they left their homeland and went to another strange place and started up a new country.</span> <span id="s365">I have a tremendous amount of admiration for them in doing this because when you pick up with what you can carry and go, that's courage.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Do you think this could happen again?</span> <span id="s367">A: I should hope not.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: I suppose we all hope not.</span> <span id="s369">In any way, shape, or form.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: I suppose it could.</span> <span id="s371">I mentioned that one instance of hate.</span> <span id="s372">On a mission into southern France, we had some German prisoners who we were walking up the street, and one lady came out of the house and spit on one of them.</span> <span id="s373">You don't see that every day.</span> <span id="s374">I hadn’t.</span> <span id="s375">Especially for a woman to do it.</span> <span id="s376">What her experiences had been, who knows?</span> <span id="s377">Also, we saw hatred between the Japanese and the Koreans.</span> <span id="s378">I was a year in Korea.</span> <span id="s379">To answer your question I suppose it could happen again somewhere, maybe not to the Jews but to... it may be happening right now in Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: There are very few World War II veterans who have had a chance to really share what they did experience in these camps.</span> <span id="s381">What is your reason for being willing to share this experience now?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: After the TV thing on the Holocaust [NBC television movie “Holocaust”], some people tended to discount it [by saying] it’s just T.V. It’s put on and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s383">The reason that I wanted to share this and make whatever contribution I can make is to help corroborate the fact that it did, for sure, exist and it was as bad as portrayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: You watched "The Holocaust"?</span> <span id="s385">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: How did you feel about this movie?</span> <span id="s387">A: I thought it was a very good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Was it overdramatized?</span> <span id="s389">Underdramatized?</span> <span id="s390">Too realistic?</span> <span id="s391">Not realistic enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I thought it was done very well.</span> <span id="s393">I really did.</span> <span id="s394">I heard some commentators talk about it.</span> <span id="s395">Of course, they had some pros and cons but I thought it was [well] done.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: When you watched, were you with anybody else or were you watching it just by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: We both watched.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Do you have any friends that watched it that you know of?</span> <span id="s399">Did you discuss it with them at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: I discussed it with Helen Frank, who is Jewish.</span> <span id="s401">I told her I was coming up here to talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Had she seen it?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s404">I never did hear anybody really pan it.</span> <span id="s405">I heard some people were skeptical about some of the things.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: It really did an awful lot to make the T.V. audience aware that the Holocaust really did exist.</span> <span id="s407">Do you yourself feel a need today to try to see to it that something like this doesn't happen again?</span> <span id="s408">Obviously, your contribution here is an indication that you are certainly doing your job, but are there any other avenues that you would consider important to pursue to be sure that something like this would not happen again?</span> <span id="s409">Politics and education and religion.</span> <span id="s410">Family to family.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I would like to think that I would do whatever I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Do you see it appropriate to teach the history of the Holocaust in the churches?</span> <span id="s413">As being appropriate, in adult education.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I would certainly think it would be appropriate.</span> <span id="s415">Q: Do you belong to a church?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Has it ever been taught in any way in the Church -- in adult education, in a Sunday School class -- that you are aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Not that I am aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Anything from the pulpit, in any way?</span> <span id="s420">A: Not that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Do you think that from the pulpit would be an appropriate place to review some of these goings-on, when talking about prejudice, hate, love...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: I would certainly think it would be appropriate.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Was there anything else that I didn't cover with you that you think you'd like to share?</span> <span id="s424">Were these pictures taken within those few hours that you were</span></p> <p><span id="s425">there?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What are we looking at here?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Bones.</span> <span id="s429">That's out behind the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Just a mound of bones behind the crematorium.</span> <span id="s431">A: Human bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: The wreath?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: That was there when I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: It looks like they’re pretty new, too, those wreaths.</span> <span id="s435">Aren’t they?</span> <span id="s436">You didn't witness any mass burials.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No.</span> <span id="s438">None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Well, I do want to thank you very very much for being part of our project and sharing your experience with us.</span></p></body></html>
