id="s58">They gave us only one apartment and they gave us a..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">uh...my father a job.</span> <span id="s61">But when the Germans came they did away our

and my...uh...whole life was shattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">I mean we took 180 degrees turn.</span> <span id="s65">And fortunately enough my parents never pampered me.</span> <span

to escape, went...went with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s71">And it was...I remember that...that night we went through a town and the whole trees are burning where the Germans throw incinerator bombs over there and we ran right through the fire and right through the misery.</span> <span id="s72">People were dying and did not...uh...affect me.</span> <span id="s73">I did not...uh...for some reason or another I..</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">I..</span> <span id="s76">.</span> <span id="s77">I roll...even...even being a child of 14 or so, I can roll with the punches and accept...uh...much reluctantly our...our problems for the future.</span> <span id="s78">And we knew that the future is going to be nothing but hell.</span> <span id="s79">But we were cut off.</span> <span id="s80">The offensive, German offensive was...was pretty fast and they cut us off and we had to return back home.</span> <span id="s81">We returned back home.</span> <span id="s82">Luckily in our...in our homes we met our aunts and uncles over there in our apartments and...uh...the Lithuanians didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s83">All because they...we...we treat them...my parents treat them prior to or we lucky they did not attack our houses, but they killed during the week.</span> <span id="s84">During absence, absence.</span> <span id="s85">They killed at least about 10,000...uh...Jewish people before the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s86">See, they...they were proud what they have done, and they didn't kill just with machine guns or guns.</span> <span id="s87">They beheaded, they raped, they murdered, they robbed in the...I remember I went in a..</span> <span id="s88">.</span> <span id="s89">after we came to the ghetto, I came in a house where a friend of my...a friend of a schoolmate lived and they killed...they raped her and her mother and they killed her father and with this blood the put a sign of the wall nemne kome (ph) take revenge.</span> <span id="s90">That was written down on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Now...uh...when we came back and we were...uh...put together we had no right to go out nowhere.</span> <span id="s92">We were sitting in the...in the house and waiting for further orders.</span> <span id="s93">The...the Germans came in and they started giving orders.</span> <span id="s94">The Lithuanians were very happy to fulfill their orders.</span> <span id="s95">They were actually the front man.</span> <span id="s96">You can...they called themselves the partisans.</span> <span id="s97">And they were taking people to the Seven Fort and Nine Fort.</span> <span id="s98">Any body they can grab, they're killing.</span> <span id="s99">That's the LIthuanian.</span> <span id="s100">Beside the German before...before the Germans started giving out orders what to do, how to organize.</span> <span id="s101">Then after a month or two they decided to have a ghetto, and the ghetto was made in...they call a little place called Slabotki.</span> <span id="s102">It's right before Kovno.</span> <span id="s103">And...uh...in Slabotki was known to have...there was a terrific...uh...blood bath because the...there was a religious group of Rabbis and Hassidian and they....uh...they killed a lot of them.</span> <span id="s104">They tore their beards and they kill a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">And this is a..</span> <span id="s106">.</span> <span id="s107">a chapter which I..</span> <span id="s108">.</span> <span id="s109">uh...I hated to speak about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Tell us...tell us what happened exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Uh...They...they pulled out the Rabbis from the apartment, from the learning house...the (ph) and they cut their beards off and they hung em and they cut their head off and the hair and they made em take a Sefer Torahs in the shul and the holy books and put em in piles in burn it.</span> <span id="s112">And then...then the Lithuanian partisans killed them right...right there and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">They...uh...killed them and they throw them in in shallow graves next to the river all the Niemen or the Velier.</span> <span id="s114">There are two rivers over there.</span> <span id="s115">And...and after when they closed...in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s116">And when the ghetto was established and the water...the water took away the sand and they were exposed, so we had to take out all...take them all out from inside the graves and rebury them.</span> <span id="s117">It was a..</span> <span id="s118">.</span> <span id="s119">a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s120">And...uh...then they establish a ghetto and I was...they grabbed people to make the fences.</span> <span id="s121">I was also one to make a fence.</span> <span id="s122">And we had to encircle ourselves in our own fence, and...uh...the (ph) and we were gathered together around 30,000.</span> <span id="s123">It was a small ghetto...was two ghettos in fact, a small ghetto where they had a little hospital and they put the old people in the hospital, and then there was a larger ghetto.</span> <span id="s124">It's one they decided to liquidate the hospital and liquidate the doctors and just burn the whole thing up...the whole flame, and didn't let anybody to go and help them.</span> <span id="s125">We were standing outside watching how the sick people and the people are burn...are burning up...the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s126">And we asked them questions.</span> <span id="s127">How come you do...that you do that?</span> <span id="s128">There wasn't answers.</span> <span id="s129">We want to eliminate...we wanta liquidate as many as we can they said.</span> <span id="s130">They give us all kind of excuses that from now on, we aren't going to do anymore.</span> <span id="s131">We ain't' gonna burn.</span> <span id="s132">We ain't gonna do... We put you all to work and...uh...you're gonna work.</span> <span id="s133">And then it was the 28th of October in 1942, they had...uh...sent out some...uh...fliers that next day all the people should...should get together and they should assemble themselves in a place called the Democracy place.</span> <span id="s134">So I..</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">and at that time around 20, 29 people in the morning...they got together and they...anybody...they're gonna find a house, they said they're gonna kill.</span> <span id="s137">They're gonna shoot them to death.</span> <span id="s138">So we got up in the morning...6 in the morning and families, with all...with children and babies, everybody assembled themselves.</span> <span id="s139">7 o'clock exactly.</span> <span id="s140">We didn't know what...what is gonna happen.</span> <span id="s141">We didn't know what's...because they told we just gonna count them...count you out how many you are, and in the evening you're going back home.</span> <span id="s142">But 7 o'clock in the morning the...we were surrounded by the Lithuanian police, Lithuanian partisans and...uh...in columns.</span> <span id="s143">We all stayed in columns.</span> <span id="s144">And German officers they were there (ph) a people and they start sorting us.</span> <span id="s145">Right and left.</span> <span id="s146">We didn't have at that time an idea what's all about it.</span> <span id="s147">But we felt that something is wrong because all the older people and the sick ones were going on side and the one who could...could still work was going on the other side.</span> <span id="s148">When it came to us, we were standing in line together, my father, my mother and myself and my grandmother and my aunt, they were elderly.</span> <span id="s149">And because of them, he put us all in the bad side.</span> <span id="s150">We...my mother got very scared and she told my father, "Maybe you can run away.</span> <span id="s151">Get out.”</span> <span id="s152">Because he work...worked in the fire department.</span> <span id="s153">He had a arm...arm band.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">And...uh...the police department, and also a arm band and at that time the Germans didn't recognize if you're police or not police, so he...she pushed him out from the line as they were taking us to the side for the sick people and she said, Maybe you can help us.</span> <span id="s155">Maybe you can...uh...you save our lives.”</span> <span id="s156">And ...uh...the Lithuanians just pulled us away and with a..</span> <span id="s157">.</span> <span id="s158">with the guns, they beat us up and they throw us in the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s159">You could call a small ghetto which was all fenced up.</span> <span id="s160">In the evening there were accumulated about 10,000 people in that...uh...small compound...small ghetto.</span> <span id="s161">What our destination we still didn't know.</span> <span id="s162">We...we thought that maybe they're gonna give us other work.</span> <span id="s163">We never thought they're gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s164">After all 10,000 people.</span> <span id="s165">But the Germans had their own plans already.</span> <span id="s166">They had all prepared.</span> <span id="s167">They had taken out the Jewish and Russian prisoners to Ninth Fort and they dig...dug trenches.</span> <span id="s168">And then...uh...they...uh...put machine guns and then they're going...there they they're gonna kill us and...and bury us.</span> <span id="s169">As we were accumulated...as we got assembled in that small ghetto (sigh) we didn't know...we were confused.</span> <span id="s170">We didn't know what happening.</span> <span id="s171">The people were crying.</span> <span id="s172">They were separating children from old people.</span> <span id="s173">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s174">My father wasn't here.</span> <span id="s175">I was just my mother.</span> <span id="s176">For some reason, a instinct we should keep on moving further away and not to stay in the beginning.</span> <span id="s177">All through the night...we shouldn't run away there...the LIthuanians were shooting in the sky with...with guns.</span> <span id="s178">It was like a battle zone in order for us...to keep us scared.</span> <span id="s179">Now in the middle of the night without our knowledge....we didn't know that, they start pulling out people already, and putting them in.</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">in trucks and taking them away.</span> <span id="s182">In our...our place was the going in the morning.</span> <span id="s183">We were in line to go in the morning.</span> <span id="s184">For some reason or another I was...uh....told my mother, "Let's ...let's stay back.</span> <span id="s185">Let's don't be in a hurry.</span> <span id="s186">Maybe some day...maybe my father's going to help us.</span> <span id="s187">Something is going to happen.”</span> <span id="s188">And...uh...as we...was already 12 o'clock, and we were less than 100 people and everybody was taken away to the ninth fort to be short.</span> <span id="s189">We were staying and there was a lady standing in front of us and the German officer recognized her.</span> <span id="s190">She worked for him.</span> <span id="s191">And she was with a baby, and he pulled her out from the line and dragged her out.</span> <span id="s192">As he dragged her out on the good side, so called, so- called, the (ph) it was...my father happened to be there.</span> <span id="s193">My father...because he all night long, he tried to come...begged people, begged the Germans to help...to...to save...you know, he said, that's my wife and my child is there.</span> <span id="s194">He didn't talk anymore about my grandmother or my aunt or his sisters were there because they're older you see.</span> <span id="s195">Because of them we also got lined up on.</span> <span id="s196">.</span> <span id="s197">the bad side.</span> <span id="s198">So as she was pulled out he...he fell on his knees and he...uh...and that woman happened to recognize my father.</span> <span id="s199">She said, "Your wife and son is still there.”</span> <span id="s200">And he start begging the German and there was next to him sitting...standing the chief of police, a Jewish chief of police, and he also start begging the German.</span> <span id="s201">"He's a good man.</span> <span id="s202">I know him," he said, "Help him.”</span> <span id="s203">He said, "Come.”</span> <span id="s204">And here, all of a sudden, as I stay in line with my...my grandmother and my aunt and myself, my mother and myself, I hear a scream, "You're husband's (ph).</span> <span id="s205">Your husband's running.”</span> <span id="s206">I..</span> <span id="s207">.</span> <span id="s208">like a wild man, I..</span> <span id="s209">.</span> <span id="s210">I..</span> <span id="s211">.</span> <span id="s212">I jumped out.</span> <span id="s213">I was only a child, 14 or so.</span> <span id="s214">I saw my father.</span> <span id="s215">It like a Messiah is coming.</span> <span id="s216">I had a feeling that...I don't know what...what is going to happen to us, but the feeling was there that something is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s217">And the German looked at me, at my father and we looked alike...facial expression.</span> <span id="s218">He said...and my father was running like a wild man...he's eyes and his hair.</span> <span id="s219">I still remember the...the way he looked.</span> <span id="s220">And I jumped on him.</span> <span id="s221">I said, "Papa.”</span> <span id="s222">The German said, "Is this your son?"</span> <span id="s223">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s224">"Whom else do you have here?"</span> <span id="s225">He said, "My wife.”</span> <span id="s226">"Take your wife and come on.”</span> <span id="s227">And as we walked out people were screaming, "Take my child.”</span> <span id="s228">They take the last hundred and took them away to be killed.</span> <span id="s229">And it took us...he saved our life and that... this was a scene I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s230">And they...they took the people on the ninth fort...they were...they put in bunkers and heard at that time told...they stripped until the underwear and they walked out a hundred at a time they were machine gunned for 3 days and then they covered them up with dirt.</span> <span id="s231">For 3 days the graves were moving up and down.</span> <span id="s232">They took tractors and run over the graves in order to squeeze out the last breath.</span> <span id="s233">And when the front came closer and the Germans did not want to leave no evidence, they undug the graves and they found mother with children hugged together by dying and with parents, grandmothers.</span> <span id="s234">They saw people together.</span> <span id="s235">And they burned them all off.</span> <span id="s236">We could see from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s237">Wasn't far from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s238">We could see the flames all the way to the sky.</span> <span id="s239">We still didn't know what it was until people escaped from there.</span> <span id="s240">There were Jewish people and the...and the Jewish prisoners and the Germans and the Lithuanians told them to undig them all.</span> <span id="s241">And while they were undigging them they told them to take out all the gold from their teeth and...and put it for the Germans...to save them.</span> <span id="s242">They also they themselves stole the gold and before New Year's Eve...It was in 40.</span> <span id="s243">.43, before they go finish the burning, they have bought for...for...for the guards the gold...it was a whiskey.</span> <span id="s244">And...uh...New Year's eve or Christmas eve, they made them all drunk.</span> <span id="s245">And being winter and being white...they took white sheets and they escaped that way.</span> <span id="s246">They all 200 escaped from nineth fort.</span> <span id="s247">It was a..</span> <span id="s248">.</span> <span id="s249">it was a tremendous thing what they have done.</span> <span id="s250">And they.</span> <span id="s251">.</span> <span id="s252">they delivered the witnesses.</span> <span id="s253">They were there by the killing and they were there by them digging and burning the Jews...the people up.</span> <span id="s254">And they saw what the Lithuanians had done.</span> <span id="s255">There were very few Germans.</span> <span id="s256">Actually the whole thing was done by Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s257">They were Germans were just guiding the whole operation.</span> <span id="s258">And they were the witnesses which escaped from them.</span> <span id="s259">It was a tremendous.</span> <span id="s260">.</span> <span id="s261">uh...the German hierarchy was tremendous upset.</span> <span id="s262">They looked all over for them, but some...naturally, some didn't get...they hide in ghetto.</span> <span id="s263">They caught couple of them, but most of them escaped.</span> <span id="s264">After that tragedy, we still did not know what happened to 10,000.</span> <span id="s265">From 10,000 just myself, my mother was survived, and my father.</span> <span id="s266">And the rest went in...that lady, which we still didn't know who she was.</span> <span id="s267">She recognized...she knew my father.</span> <span id="s268">The ghetto was chaotic.</span> <span id="s269">It was...uh...unbelievable.</span> <span id="s270">People didn't care to work.</span> <span id="s271">They didn't care to...to do anything.</span> <span id="s272">After all, the ghetto cut almost in half and every family had somebody taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s274">You went back to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s276">Yal.</span> <span id="s277">Back to the ghetto and back to the room where we were in barracks over there.</span> <span id="s278">And the life quote unquote become normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Tell us about that life.</span> <span id="s280">What...how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s282">As...uh...as we were in the ghetto...you know, the ghetto had own police department, fire department, had a Jewish community committee and...uh...they had an order for...the Germans also wanted the ghetto...ghetto to...to exist because the hierarchy for the Germans didn't want to go to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s283">So things are...starting getting better on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s284">They thought they going with the Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s285">They going in...in 2 weeks, they go and kill the Russians.</span> <span id="s286">The war was over.</span> <span id="s287">I remember one...one thing a..</span> <span id="s288">.</span> <span id="s289">a..</span> <span id="s290">.</span> <span id="s291">a German told my father as we running there.</span> <span id="s292">We were caught between the Germans and the Russians on the front and the Russian dug in all the...bunch of young kids.</span> <span id="s293">I remember then.</span> <span id="s294">They told us keep on going because the front is going to be...after the 24 hours they shouldn't know each other.</span> <span id="s295">And they held out actually the whole German army.</span> <span id="s296">Young boy...German officer told my father.</span> <span id="s297">Hitler said 2 weeks going to be Blitz.</span> <span id="s298">The war be over.</span> <span id="s299">In 2 years if the Russian fight that way, 2 more years the war won't be over.</span> <span id="s300">He said this the first day or the second war started.</span> <span id="s301">They didn't realize because the whole Europe, they took very easy.</span> <span id="s302">You see, France and Belgium and Holland, but here they...they were getting very resistance, you see.</span> <span id="s303">So the German himself had an interest in the Kovno ghetto operation because it killed the people from the small towns, a kill with nothing left over there.</span> <span id="s304">In the ghetto, they...they established that as their...their place.</span> <span id="s305">They...they had a Jewish people working for them like the Judenrat and...uh...they tried to establish something good for us and good for them.</span> <span id="s306">Mostly for them.</span> <span id="s307">But they had...they need us too in order to control their destiny for awhile they need us too.</span> <span id="s308">The front was still away.</span> <span id="s309">There is still a successful.</span> <span id="s310">So I..</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">uh...I had a job youth organization for small children got a job to teach us a trade.</span> <span id="s313">And I worked a little bit over there.</span> <span id="s314">Then they made a brigade to go to air...air...airport for small children or for small children to go to work in fields.</span> <span id="s315">Now the older people they...they promised they ain't going to do more less things you had to assemble all 10,000 someplace else and they...uh...still was trying to fool us.</span> <span id="s316">They were very smart and they knew how to psychologically.</span> <span id="s317">They set up a special office to fool us psychologically.</span> <span id="s318">They were very, very (ph).</span> <span id="s319">And we...we had to believe them.</span> <span id="s320">In order to survive we had to believe them.</span> <span id="s321">Help we didn't get from nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Escape from the ghetto we couldn't...we couldn't do.</span> <span id="s323">If we escape, a Lithuanian saw us and you were a Jew, he told the Germans on us.</span> <span id="s324">Help was not coming.</span> <span id="s325">We couldn't create and get a partisan groups because we did not have enough woods like in Poland, like in Russia to escape.</span> <span id="s326">And.</span> <span id="s327">.</span> <span id="s328">uh...the Lithuanian population had no interest in helping us.</span> <span id="s329">They were happy.</span> <span id="s330">In fact, we were a burden to them.</span> <span id="s331">We took away their place and their homes.</span> <span id="s332">They took away everything we had was okay.</span> <span id="s333">But we're living in their homes in small shacks over in the ghetto in...uh...Slobotka, it was no good.</span> <span id="s334">Pressure on...they put pressure on the German government to...uh...to get us out.</span> <span id="s335">They didn't care how they get us out or kill us or whatever, you see.</span> <span id="s336">Now...uh...after they start creating the brigades and they told everybody that...uh...things will be better.</span> <span id="s337">They gave us enough food...and they gave us for awhile enough food in ghetto in order to calm our nerves we should start believing them.</span> <span id="s338">It was all done psychologically.</span> <span id="s339">And it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What...what was your father doing at this time.</span> <span id="s341">You told me he had to go someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: He...Yal.</span> <span id="s343">My father was...uh...in the...in the fire department and there was a lot of...we didn't have many fires because we didn't have even in case we had a fire, small fire somes, you had to...uh...run with like bucket...bucket brigade or we had an old fire engine, like a pump fire engine.</span> <span id="s344">And the roads were full of stand.</span> <span id="s345">There were no roads.</span> <span id="s346">So you had to push them by hand to the fire.</span> <span id="s347">By they time...they came to extinguish the fire, there was no house, no fire.</span> <span id="s348">But...uh...there were a lot of suicides going on.</span> <span id="s349">And my father...uh...used to...people used to jump in the wells to commit suicide and any time they called...they .</span> <span id="s350">They called my father because he was...he knew how to go down in a deep well and with a rope, hold himself and bring the people up.</span> <span id="s351">He saved a lot.</span> <span id="s352">Also a lot drowned because by the time they call him...they had no telephones...uh...the problem was, so lots of them died.</span> <span id="s353">But because of him...people knew him...what a good many was...how he saved people in ghetto.</span> <span id="s354">This way...other incident I told you before, this way the police department...police chief as a German told him, "He is a good man.</span> <span id="s355">Save his family.”</span> <span id="s356">He was...he was known.</span> <span id="s357">And ...and also because of him I got also a easier job in ghetto rather than going to work on air force...airport being I was still young.</span> <span id="s358">He gave me also job called elbote that I was...I worked in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s359">There were no telephones, just taking messages for him to the...from...from their office to other place.</span> <span id="s360">I was like a runner.</span> <span id="s361">It was my...my job.</span> <span id="s362">Uh...They gave me a little...uh...hat and they gave me a band here, a uniform.</span> <span id="s363">This was my job.</span> <span id="s364">And this kept me...kept me alive...kept me out from doing hard work.</span> <span id="s365">Uh...Being still young, he wanta kept me around him.</span> <span id="s366">Then they organized, as the war progressed and as the war got worse, the German...we got involved in...uh...in the cold weather....</span> <span id="s367">the washing...we got bogged down there.</span> <span id="s368">They needed fur coats.</span> <span id="s369">They needed shoes.</span> <span id="s370">They needed gold.</span> <span id="s371">So they had one time a..</span> <span id="s372">.</span> <span id="s373">uh...flier out on the wall...All the fliers came on the...on the walls by the Jewish community committee that next week in 3 days, all the Jews got to bring in their gold and their furs and their leather boots, everything.</span> <span id="s374">They start bringing in their leather coats, leather coats, the boots, but gold was not coming in.</span> <span id="s375">So...uh...the Germans had a remedy for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">For a week, they walked around the ghetto and they was killing people on sight.</span> <span id="s377">The SS brigade came in.</span> <span id="s378">Every morning 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock and everyone in sight they killed, like dogs.</span> <span id="s379">And after a week, they said, "If you don't bring back...We'll do...we'll stop it only if you bring back all the gold.”</span> <span id="s380">And...uh...this...uh...they shook everybody up and...uh... naturally, everybody brought...in order to stay alive, in order to continue with their life, they brought all the gold they've taken out the most fur and gold from the Kovno ghetto than other all the ghettos together.</span> <span id="s381">And they said, again after...after you bring us the gold, again everything will be nice and fine.</span> <span id="s382">Don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s383">It's fine.</span> <span id="s384">How can...but meanwhile they organized...they took out five intellectuals they needed intelectuals to drive them from ghetto, scholars, teachers they needed them for a special job to go in Latvia.</span> <span id="s385">And sure enough people ... they trust .</span> <span id="s386">.</span> <span id="s387">so how can they trust?</span> <span id="s388">We were so...we became so minimized our life...like they de...degenerated you see.</span> <span id="s389">They made for us...uh...a resistance of culture, a resistance of being a humanbeing became so nil...became like...like animals.</span> <span id="s390">And this was their intention to minimize.</span> <span id="s391">They took five hundred of our people, registered the best, the most intellectuals and we never saw from them anymore.</span> <span id="s392">We still goal...this were the aktion ...aktion from the 500.</span> <span id="s393">Then they created a brigade...a workshop...in ghetto workshop where they...we produced like toys for the Germans, wooden toys and...uh.</span> <span id="s394">.</span> <span id="s395">dolls.</span> <span id="s396">Uh...Also, we washed all the clothes came from the front, the bloody clothes and everything.</span> <span id="s397">We washed over there, and we sewed them up.</span> <span id="s398">We made a shoe factory to...uh...repair the old shoes from the front.</span> <span id="s399">Many times became frozen.</span> <span id="s400">We pulled off ...we pulled off the...uh...many times you find skin and blood in the shoes and the boots.</span> <span id="s401">We washed them out over there.</span> <span id="s402">They had...there were 500 people working over.</span> <span id="s403">I was also fortunate to work there too and I was also working there in ...uh...as a runner.</span> <span id="s404">And I was working as a runner and also I was working as...uh...learning a trade as a..</span> <span id="s405">.</span> <span id="s406">uh...smith, making different things from iron.</span> <span id="s407">And this kept me...kept me going in order not to go out from ghetto, not to get out and...uh...be worked day and night over there and use up my strength something else.</span> <span id="s408">You see, again, I have to thank my father for...for help me doing that.</span> <span id="s409">And then at one...uh... one day, it previously...as....uh...I got a call to come in...in the office from the big boss from the...uh...from the ghetto workshop over there...in the office over there.</span> <span id="s410">And there was sitting Gecke.</span> <span id="s411">Gecke was Oberstrumbannfuhrer Gecke.</span> <span id="s412">I mean I looked at him...he...his head was like a..</span> <span id="s413">.</span> <span id="s414">he was like the SS Obersturbanfuhrer sure.</span> <span id="s415">He was...the top man from the SS.</span> <span id="s416">He was taking care of the whole eastern coast...shore...eastern coast, all the east ghettos, and the lager and the concentration camps and all that.</span> <span id="s417">In fact, I found out later, he was one of the 15 people involved with Hitler when they...when they decided to...uh...to make unify, to make eliminate the Jews.</span> <span id="s418">He was one the few people.</span> <span id="s419">His eyes just penetrate me.</span> <span id="s420">I was standing there looking at him, and his head was like a dead head....like...like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s421">He was...uh...he asked me to take some papers to the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s422">And if they give me papers, the boss from the Jewish (ph) over there in charge, told me to take off tomorrow cause it's late already and don't come in to work tomorrow.</span> <span id="s423">This was...uh... that...this was not the best thing for me, but because next day as I got up in the morning I heard speakers, loud speakers, going around the ghetto with...uh...the bull horns, and they tell everybody whose not going to work, whose not at the work to accumulate to go and assemble themselves on that place where...from where they have sorted people out.</span> <span id="s424">The memory still lingers with me at that time.</span> <span id="s425">I did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s426">I was sure...I sure wasn't going to...to go again over there.</span> <span id="s427">I didn't know what's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s428">The ghetto was already surrounded with Lithuanians, the partisans they called.</span> <span id="s429">Uh...The people have went to work.</span> <span id="s430">All the brigades were gone already because they go 7 o'clock...6, 7 o'clock over there the whole ghetto's out.</span> <span id="s431">Whoever is left in the ghetto I didn't know what's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s432">I got...uh...I went and hide in the room right away and start try to find a place to hide.</span> <span id="s433">It's like a..</span> <span id="s434">.</span> <span id="s435">uh...a rat looking for some place to hide.</span> <span id="s436">I didn't...I didn't know where to go, and I didn't know where they find us.</span> <span id="s437">I saw a little shed.</span> <span id="s438">You see the ghetto was made in a..</span> <span id="s439">.</span> <span id="s440">where farmers used to live...farmer country.</span> <span id="s441">There was a shed like a..</span> <span id="s442">.</span> <span id="s443">not a out house, a shed with a cellar inside where they keep hay.</span> <span id="s444">It's a little barn, a small barn.</span> <span id="s445">So I opened the barn and I saw through a..</span> <span id="s446">.</span> <span id="s447">a trap door in the bottom.</span> <span id="s448">So I pushed away the hay in the side and as I was trying to go inside two mothers with little babies came to me and said, "Please help me.</span> <span id="s449">Please help us.”</span> <span id="s450">I said, "What are you doing.</span> <span id="s451">I know...I know what I'm doing.”</span> <span id="s452">They said, "Please let me go in with you in that...in that basement...in that hole.</span> <span id="s453">It was not basement, was a hole with a cellar they dug out.”</span> <span id="s454">I said, "Come down.”</span> <span id="s455">I didn't care.</span> <span id="s456">And I put hay on the trap...on the trap and...uh...I just went down.</span> <span id="s457">And it was dark, but I could see through that crack in the door, in that little...uh...trap door.</span> <span id="s458">(cough) Exactly 8, 9 o'clock, I don't know exactly when, the Germans came, the police and...uh...they start banging houses, raus, raus, raus, Juden raus.</span> <span id="s459">I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s460">And he opened...the German opened the door, flinged the door wide open and he comes in and he starts feet...starts shaking around all that...that...uh...hay, straw and he's standing on top of that door.</span> <span id="s461">And I..</span> <span id="s462">.</span> <span id="s463">I'm...the door is almost collapse, and I'm trying to hold up the door shouldn't collapse over there.</span> <span id="s464">And I say, "God, help me.”</span> <span id="s465">I mean why...what can I do?</span> <span id="s466">And...uh...he looked around and looked around and took...took his bayonet...I could see all that...and shoveled around in all that hay and he walked out.</span> <span id="s467">But he didn't walk...he was like a post.</span> <span id="s468">He was walking back and forth.</span> <span id="s469">As soon he walked out, one baby start to cry.</span> <span id="s470">So I said, "Please.</span> <span id="s471">Please.</span> <span id="s472">Help us.</span> <span id="s473">Help us.”</span> <span id="s474">So, she stopped.</span> <span id="s475">The baby stopped crying.</span> <span id="s476">And...uh...I know if he didn't grey and he didn't have a heart attack.</span> <span id="s477">I was only 15 years old, 15 and a half years old, and I could see the German all day long going back and forth.</span> <span id="s478">And the other baby start crying.</span> <span id="s479">So the mother urinate in her hand and the baby to drink, you know, to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s480">Exactly again they came in and look but didn't...didn't step no more on that...I was ready to hold up again.</span> <span id="s481">He didn't...just looked outside in.</span> <span id="s482">Other guard came and they joked and they...they...they had a good time going back and forth.</span> <span id="s483">And...uh...exactly 4, 5 o'clock the whistle blew.</span> <span id="s484">Every...everything was done exactly perfect.</span> <span id="s485">And...uh...A..</span> <span id="s486">.</span> <span id="s487">uh...a German truck picked them all up, all the post over there.</span> <span id="s488">And I made sure and seen them off and walked to the first and looked around.</span> <span id="s489">I told the mothers came out.</span> <span id="s490">And one baby was died.</span> <span id="s491">She...the mother... the mother choked her own baby.</span> <span id="s492">And this left a tremendous impression on me because now (ph) I saw her and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s493">And one baby is still alive because the mother she urine and she get a drink but the other baby from...from fear, the mother choked her own baby, choked her own child...choked her own child.</span> <span id="s494">I didn't see them anymore because the Germans did not finish the job that day.</span> <span id="s495">The next day they came again.</span> <span id="s496">This is called the kinder aktion.</span> <span id="s497">They had picked up all the...as the parents when they went to work, the children are left.</span> <span id="s498">Some parents was left their children.</span> <span id="s499">Some grandparents was left their children because that...everybody went to work on the air port or whatever...the brigades.</span> <span id="s500">So they...they were going around with dogs and finding little babies and children and 5 year old.</span> <span id="s501">I didn't know what happened that time.</span> <span id="s502">The whole thing happened in front of my father where he had the fire department over there by the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s503">They came in buses, and they line the buses in Germans.</span> <span id="s504">And as they assembled the children they thrown the in...in the buses.</span> <span id="s505">So if a mother would not part the child....she wanted to be with her child...they sicced...a German dog was trained so, to jump on the mother's face and bite his face so the mother dropped the child.</span> <span id="s506">They grabbed and brought her child in...in the bus.</span> <span id="s507">They didn't care for the...for thee parents.</span> <span id="s508">They want only the children.</span> <span id="s509">And...uh...next day, naturally I went to work and...uh...next day by the same thing, they...whatever left children one day, they picked it up next day.</span> <span id="s510">When the parents came from...from work at night, (Pause) it was...it was hard to describe what...what happened...what happened there.</span> <span id="s511">(Pause) They came from work.</span> <span id="s512">(Pause) And you find...you find children.</span> <span id="s513">So they...they picked up the pillows and blankets (Pause) (Sigh) and they ran around in ghettos screaming (Pause) (Sigh) (crying) and pulled their hair.</span> <span id="s514">I saw a..</span> <span id="s515">.</span> <span id="s516">a woman came up to one of the Germans and the guard somebody by the fence and start screaming at him and and calling him swine.</span> <span id="s517">He took out a gun and killed her.</span> <span id="s518">A..</span> <span id="s519">.</span> <span id="s520">a Jewish life didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s521">They had no...they had no...uh...I don't know what kind of people they are.</span> <span id="s522">I mean I saw a German...a young man came in ghetto, played with a little poodle, little tiny dog, puppy.</span> <span id="s523">He played with him.</span> <span id="s524">He gave him chocolate.</span> <span id="s525">He finished playing, took out a gun and killed him.</span> <span id="s526">I mean it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s527">And as you live all this through, small incidents, which are not written up in the books...just right here, it's...uh...you just can't believe.</span> <span id="s528">You can't believe it how people can be that cruel.</span> <span id="s529">(Sigh) After that, thank...thank God, I was still with my parents, my mother and father at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">But...uh...for the rest of the people life became really nothing.</span> <span id="s531">No...No...it wasn't worth living, but people have children.</span> <span id="s532">People have families.</span> <span id="s533">People have the grandparents and grandparents...grandmother...grandparents and uncles and aunts...they were all annihilate taken away.</span> <span id="s534">We were...you became...we became nothing.</span> <span id="s535">We became like zombies.</span> <span id="s536">But how little did we know that the future is still going to be worse.</span> <span id="s537">Uh...My all...only luck they say...I was that time maybe 15 or so, and I could still be...come every night with my parents.</span> <span id="s538">My father protected us, my mother and me as much he could, but this also limitation...limitations.</span> <span id="s539">Because the...uh...Russian front came closer and closer.</span> <span id="s540">They lost the Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s541">And...uh...that I'm also...became heyday for 24 hours or 48 hours.</span> <span id="s542">You can go go around and get and kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s543">You want them and just get out and take out anger on Jews.</span> <span id="s544">So they lost the Stalingrad and we suffer.</span> <span id="s545">They want we suffer.</span> <span id="s546">So we were like a pawn...you know, like a..</span> <span id="s547">.</span> <span id="s548">like a nothing.</span> <span id="s549">And it became closer and we heard news that...uh...they're losing everywhere because we got more and more wounded soldiers coming back from the front and people...people worked in the unclothing means where they were...in Kovno was that a point where they stop and they clean them up before send to Germany.</span> <span id="s550">And the people, the Jewish peopled them undressed, helped them to clean up bodies, and helped them in the shoes and in the uniforms came in ghettos to be washed.</span> <span id="s551">And...uh...and the mood from the soldiers where they were cursing and, you know, the German government.</span> <span id="s552">They were cusring Hitler, but still there was not a big spark to...to get him to make a new government or to kill him or something.</span> <span id="s553">But nothing that even get reunited, but they're too afraid of doing something like that.</span> <span id="s554">So we knew that if they having problems on the front...we knew the front is getting closer.</span> <span id="s555">And...uh...Gecke came, the Oberstrumbammfuhrer...Gecke came and he told the...uh...the Judenrat...Jew...the Jewish leaders, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s556">We...uh...we won't annihilate you.</span> <span id="s557">You'll still...they figure back in Germany, you work for us.</span> <span id="s558">They have factories over there.</span> <span id="s559">But...uh...we still did not know the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s560">We still doesn't...didn't know.</span> <span id="s561">We didn't have the connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Uh...Some people did, but...but we did not know...the ghetto itself didn't know that there was concentration camp.</span> <span id="s563">We thought we the only ones survived.</span> <span id="s564">We...we didn't have the communication.</span> <span id="s565">We didn't know the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s566">We didn't know the uprising.</span> <span id="s567">We were completely isolated.</span> <span id="s568">We were...we thought we only ones survives.</span> <span id="s569">Until they start liquidating the liquidating the ghetto.</span> <span id="s570">And they start...they say in the ghetto, "We're going to liquidate on that and that day because the...uh...we knew...we knew the reason why they want to...and evidence when the Russians are coming closer, want burn everything up.</span> <span id="s571">But naturally we want to save ourselves.</span> <span id="s572">We start hiding.</span> <span id="s573">So the...the first transport, they got together as many they could and...uh...and they couldn't find them all.</span> <span id="s574">The brought in a special...uh... trained people, killers....special killers to find the find the people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s575">We were...my father and me, my mother, we're trying to find a place to hide.</span> <span id="s576">But where can you hide?</span> <span id="s577">I mean the...in basement you can't go and hide in the attic you can't go.</span> <span id="s578">You might...we knew they're going to destroy all the houses so we saw outside a outhouse and we saw people like going in there.</span> <span id="s579">Somebody built a bunker.</span> <span id="s580">So we said, "Please, let us also in.”</span> <span id="s581">They were nice enough to let us come in there too.</span> <span id="s582">So it was a big...uh...big room and on top was a camouflage outhouse.</span> <span id="s583">People didn't know there was a room downstairs.</span> <span id="s584">And people used the outhouse.</span> <span id="s585">And we were downstairs.</span> <span id="s586">So...uh...now it was....but to save your life, you do everything.</span> <span id="s587">There are no end.</span> <span id="s588">(Sigh) And the Germans found us.</span> <span id="s589">Next day they're looking with dogs and they...they came.</span> <span id="s590">I see a German SS man and he ripped apart the bunker with a luger in his hands and "Come out, Juden fechstunke (ph) Juden.”</span> <span id="s591">You smell of Jews.</span> <span id="s592">If you don't come out, we'll...we'll kill you.</span> <span id="s593">Sure enough, we came out.</span> <span id="s594">We all came out and...uh...they assembled, you know, from the other bunkers, they assembled people and....uh...we looked and we smelled all of us....maybe they had over there, maybe 500 or so.</span> <span id="s595">We're last transport they sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s596">After us, they burned the whole ghetto down.</span> <span id="s597">We were the last ones.</span> <span id="s598">And...uh...we sit together and it was a terrible day.</span> <span id="s599">It was rainy, and we were sitting in front of the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s600">The people discussed the...the future and...uh...was a parallel thing happened which I still remember.</span> <span id="s601">There was a small cat ran through.</span> <span id="s602">And the German SS sicced his dog on the cat, and the poor cat was all pulled out...going, trying to get away from him, going move toward the fence.</span> <span id="s603">And she was...when she was close to the fence, he say...he told him, "Give a command to kill her, and he jumped and killed her.”</span> <span id="s604">And this was so parallel to our lives.</span> <span id="s605">We are in their hand.</span> <span id="s606">They're the dog, and we're the cat, and we're at their mercy.</span> <span id="s607">Whenever...whenever they want to kill us, they kill like that.</span> <span id="s608">And that small, little incident, is so engraved in my brain that...and it was all...it was like a play.</span> <span id="s609">The weather was bad, was windy, was cold, and the whole atmosphere was right there.</span> <span id="s610">Next morning they assembled us all, and we walked all the way to the railroad.</span> <span id="s611">They put us in as much as they could...as many as they could in the freight cars, without much air, locked us up and we're on our way Germany.</span> <span id="s612">Where we...we went...we were going, we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Tell me about that ride?</span> <span id="s614">Tell me about that ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: As we were riding and...uh...and we're cramped together and packed together without place to urinate or toilet.</span> <span id="s616">Nothing.</span> <span id="s617">Was not...and no water, no bread, no nothing.</span> <span id="s618">Some young guys...myself and few others decide...decide...decide to escape.</span> <span id="s619">So...uh...the German was...was in front, sitting with the driver...driving over.</span> <span id="s620">During the day he was sitting in front...the front door.</span> <span id="s621">In the back, I took a..</span> <span id="s622">.</span> <span id="s623">I took out a knife and I tried with the back door cut a hole.</span> <span id="s624">And there was a..</span> <span id="s625">.</span> <span id="s626">uh...a seal there on...on the lock.</span> <span id="s627">I cut my arm.</span> <span id="s628">It went right through my arm.</span> <span id="s629">I got a mark here still here.</span> <span id="s630">And it was bleeding all over.</span> <span id="s631">But this...and once we opened the door, and I put my small hand...I put my hand in there, I cut a seal, broke a seal, unlocked the latch, and there was no way to...to jump because they specially picked out a double line all the way to Germany.</span> <span id="s632">They were a line...we were on one track and the other track was going and the Germans were going right behind us...in case the German get killed.</span> <span id="s633">So we closed back up and this was a adventure of trying to jump out from the train.</span> <span id="s634">But my cousin, I found out later did jump and his wife...a train...the first transport.</span> <span id="s635">And...uh...they did make it.</span> <span id="s636">But the Lithuanians gave them...uh...told on them.</span> <span id="s637">They were killed later.</span> <span id="s638">These our friends...these are people we lived all our life together...were in school together and the business together and when...uh...when the war came, they kill us, as many as they could.</span> <span id="s639">(Sigh) Our first stop I remember was some place in Germany.</span> <span id="s640">We saw...the reason I knew it was in Germany over the border because I could read sign.</span> <span id="s641">The wheels are...are turning for the future on the trains.</span> <span id="s642">for the...uh...Zieg means...uh...When they win a war...when they win a way, the wheels are turning for to win the war.</span> <span id="s643">So I knew we were in Germany then.</span> <span id="s644">The train stopped the next day.</span> <span id="s645">A German soldier came up to me...I'll never forget it...with a paper in black letters written down.</span> <span id="s646">And if this is said would be true, would happen, we be free right now.</span> <span id="s647">They missed...Hitler was being...they....uh...they tried to kill Hitler, and Hitler survived.</span> <span id="s648">In big letters.</span> <span id="s649">This is our luck.</span> <span id="s650">So...uh...they gave us some water.</span> <span id="s651">I remember that time.</span> <span id="s652">And again they shipped us off.</span> <span id="s653">They shipped us off to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s654">At that point I was still with my parents, mother and father.</span> <span id="s655">In Stutthof...</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s657">What I need to do now is to stop.</span> <span id="s658">If we may, we'll change tapes, give you a chance to breath and then you'll tell us the story of Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Here...we arrived...the train.</span> <span id="s663">We still didn't know where where it was.</span> <span id="s664">And all of a sudden the trains opened up...the cattle cars...wasn't a train....the cattle cars it was.</span> <span id="s665">And...uh...some dead people...some fainted people, and a few survivors who made it...the younger ones came out.</span> <span id="s666">We assembled ourselves and the screaming from the Germans .</span> <span id="s667">I..</span> <span id="s668">.</span> <span id="s669">I can still hear in my...my head...also....</span> <span id="s670">the raus, raus, Jude .</span> <span id="s671">And they put us all in the...in the trucks and they brought us in...and they took us in a gorgeous, beautiful runway with trees, with a lake with...with swans on the lake.</span> <span id="s672">I said, "Where are we here?"</span> <span id="s673">Are they going to give you...gonna give us the work here or what...what's happening.</span> <span id="s674">Little did I know, that's the worst hell hole.</span> <span id="s675">And as we assembled ourselves in a big room, in a bigger hall with...uh...and people had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s676">They were special place...altogether woman and men, they didn't care for the toilets.</span> <span id="s677">People went on too them, and they were standing up and there were filled up with human waste.</span> <span id="s678">Two...two Germans tried to amuse themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">They start laughing.</span> <span id="s680">They took the end of their...uh...guns, rifles butts, and they hit two men in the head and they fell in...in the human waste.</span> <span id="s681">And they were laid there drowning.</span> <span id="s682">They drowned over there.</span> <span id="s683">And they were laughing.</span> <span id="s684">They had a good time.</span> <span id="s685">I..</span> <span id="s686">.</span> <span id="s687">all these things I wasn't used to that at that point.</span> <span id="s688">This is...completely different thing.</span> <span id="s689">And at that time in that place, I lost my mother.</span> <span id="s690">I..</span> <span id="s691">.</span> <span id="s692">I was separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s693">I saw her the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">They...she kissed me.</span> <span id="s695">I kissed her.</span> <span id="s696">And she asked my father to take care of me.</span> <span id="s697">And we hugged.</span> <span id="s698">The last time I ever saw her.</span> <span id="s699">They took at night to the...all the men...they took us to the...unclothing...they took us to the...uh...the place where they kept us all night long, all naked.</span> <span id="s700">Take all the clothes off, and we had to go in a..</span> <span id="s701">.</span> <span id="s702">in a unclothing place which they shaved us, the hair, whatever, and...uh...we washed.</span> <span id="s703">They gave us some clothes and clothes...it was whatever...whatever we grabbed.</span> <span id="s704">Anything.</span> <span id="s705">Different shoes and different....uh...jackets and different ...not a different...uh...different hat, but anyway, luckily we were not sent in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s706">We all assembled...and I was standing with my father...and next morning they sort us out...the Stutthof.</span> <span id="s707">They kept us a few days over there, probably a week or two weeks I would say.</span> <span id="s708">And they...uh...they beat us up good.</span> <span id="s709">I start to feeling what it means already being in a concentration camp cause the atmosphere change everything and they...uh...they separate the young...young kids from their parents or from the other ones.</span> <span id="s710">They send them away.</span> <span id="s711">Luckily I was still at that point with my father...uh...because I was...and when the German came in and followed me, I got up and extended my...I was tall and skinny and they let me go with my father.</span> <span id="s712">And they shipped us all to Dachau from there.</span> <span id="s713">And there was special...uh...camp because Dachau in camp 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">In...uh...in camp 2 they are a brand new camp.</span> <span id="s715">Brand new barracks and brand ....brand new....the Germans and the whole thing and there was only one Lithuanian from Kovno.</span> <span id="s716">Everyone knows him which...uh...he was wearing German uniform.</span> <span id="s717">And he was officer there, and he was the worst one.</span> <span id="s718">He was beating on us.</span> <span id="s719">He was the worst one.</span> <span id="s720">Again, my father, being a barber, got a job working inside the camp, not to go outside.</span> <span id="s721">In the beginning I was working outside.</span> <span id="s722">It was a night shift, and day shift.</span> <span id="s723">And it was very miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">They....they are building there...it was a place build...factory for Messerschmidt ...for the German...uh...more in the inland, underground factory.</span> <span id="s725">They had slave labors and we were building that.</span> <span id="s726">That's our job.</span> <span id="s727">And...uh...at that place I didn't have it too bad because after awhile working outside, I was working inside the camp itself.</span> <span id="s728">My job was....as they progressed...as the camp continued, people start dying off from diarrhea, malnutrition.</span> <span id="s729">It really was very bad.</span> <span id="s730">It was...people were working in mud...have...up to their knees because the rain was very...very...red mud over there.</span> <span id="s731">It was terrible place to be.</span> <span id="s732">But...uh...my job was every morning when the lice came in...people had to be full of lice and they died.</span> <span id="s733">Every morning I had a little cart.</span> <span id="s734">It was a good job.</span> <span id="s735">Go from barrack to barrack and pick up the dead people.</span> <span id="s736">And me and the other young boy...we used to go on from barrack to barrack and pick all the dead people.</span> <span id="s737">And me and the other young boy, we used to go on from barrack to barrack and every morning take em like a rickshaw and...uh...in... both...dump em on top of the...on top of that little wagon until they accumulate.</span> <span id="s738">Go out with this.</span> <span id="s739">Dump them outside again.</span> <span id="s740">Do the same thing again.</span> <span id="s741">It's a job for the day.</span> <span id="s742">I was very lucky by doing that because I was in camp.</span> <span id="s743">I didn't have to go...and I had some little more soup or more coffee or more hot tea or hot water rather.</span> <span id="s744">And one day I come to that pile of people and I..</span> <span id="s745">.</span> <span id="s746">uh...I saw a person laying there which...it was still breathing.</span> <span id="s747">He opened his eyes and he said, "Don't you recognize me?"</span> <span id="s748">He was one of my father's friends.</span> <span id="s749">He worked also in ghetto as a fire...in fire department, which I knew him like I knew my father.</span> <span id="s750">I look at him.</span> <span id="s751">He was still of flies.</span> <span id="s752">His whole body was full white...I did not...I put him on aside.</span> <span id="s753">I couldn't do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s754">We didn't put him on the truck...on this truck...on this little hand cart.</span> <span id="s755">But the thing was that the lice took over the camp so dramatically and diarrhea and diphtheria that people are dying in masses and nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s756">They de...decide then to liquidate after about 4 months to liquidate the camp altogether.</span> <span id="s757">And they were going to send my father...you see, they...they weren't interested to have families together.</span> <span id="s758">They want to send separate...father and son separate, brothers separate.</span> <span id="s759">Though they liked my father.</span> <span id="s760">They wanted to send him in a better place and send me out to Czechoslovakia in a different camp.</span> <span id="s761">They accumulate about 500 people to send to Czechoslovakia to Therenienstadt...no to...uh...Flossenburg and...uh...my father said, "No.</span> <span id="s762">I won't go without my son.</span> <span id="s763">I helped him so far.</span> <span id="s764">I want to help him further.”</span> <span id="s765">And it was...uh...it was my luck really that we went with me.</span> <span id="s766">It was almost his undoing, because he could have had a better place going in other camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s767">We were shipped away in.</span> <span id="s768">.</span> <span id="s769">in...uh...Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s770">From there to Leitmeritz (Litomerice).</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Leitmeritz (Litomerice) was a..</span> <span id="s772">.</span> <span id="s773">Leitmeritz (Litomerice)yelling was a place from Flossenburg, other part.</span> <span id="s774">And there was a hell hole.</span> <span id="s775">There was a worst we ever...ever saw.</span> <span id="s776">From the 500 or so people, maybe 10 survived.</span> <span id="s777">First of all, it was old camp already.</span> <span id="s778">And the Pollacks were in charge of the camp and...uh...we worked over there in mines in...uh...cement mines.</span> <span id="s779">And naturally the better jobs is taken already, being an old camp.</span> <span id="s780">So they...uh...they all got new .</span> <span id="s781">I mean we got some new people.</span> <span id="s782">And they came...they grabbed us next day and they put us in all kind of jobs...work.</span> <span id="s783">We are working in the...in the coal...it's like coal mine.</span> <span id="s784">It's the same thing.</span> <span id="s785">It's miserable inside.</span> <span id="s786">It's wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">It's...uh...muggy.</span> <span id="s788">It's...uh...fog all the time...little small lamps and you gotta drill, with a big drill you gotta drill the...the cement mines.</span> <span id="s789">It's all cement in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s790">I..</span> <span id="s791">.</span> <span id="s792">uh...I was working luckily with my father and the bread was...the ration was terrible.</span> <span id="s793">You get less and less....one slice of bread and...uh...we had to get up...get up early in the morning.</span> <span id="s794">It was cold...was...uh...maybe 20, 30 below zero.</span> <span id="s795">We had no shoes.</span> <span id="s796">We had wooden...uh...wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s797">And the wooden shoes, when you go in the snow, they became like...uh...like ice skates so you could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s798">You had...uh...the uniform...one a pajama.</span> <span id="s799">You had to stand in a appell in the morning for 2 hours.</span> <span id="s800">Woke you up 6 in the morning, 5 in the morning in order to count you...they count you.</span> <span id="s801">They count you out.</span> <span id="s802">If someone is missing, they had to count again.</span> <span id="s803">And...uh...it was miserable.</span> <span id="s804">Was just...and people start dying off dying off.</span> <span id="s805">One day I standing with my father over there...comes to me...there was over there...also over there besides Pollacks, besides Jews, all the Germans...criminals, homosexuals, whatever.</span> <span id="s806">I didn't know about that.</span> <span id="s807">I..</span> <span id="s808">.</span> <span id="s809">I wasn't that...that...that known what's going on in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s810">I was still new about that.</span> <span id="s811">As I stand by my father and worked, a German comes up to me and he orders me to go with him.</span> <span id="s812">He was a..</span> <span id="s813">.</span> <span id="s814">uh...a colonel from the...uh...from the air force.</span> <span id="s815">I didn't want to go, but he says, I have to go with you.</span> <span id="s816">I was still...we just came up from new camp....from...from Dachau.</span> <span id="s817">I still did not look so dilapidated and so worn out.</span> <span id="s818">I still looked pretty good because I had a clean uniform.</span> <span id="s819">He tells me...as we go deeper...he takes me deeper and deeper and he see nobody one here...just fog with little lamps burning and the railroad trellis because the little railroads where they bring out the...all the cement over there.</span> <span id="s820">He started hugging me.</span> <span id="s821">I started moving away.</span> <span id="s822">He said, "Hug me.”</span> <span id="s823">And he...uh...he wanted to kiss me.</span> <span id="s824">I started pushing him away.</span> <span id="s825">I didn't know...I was all...I was all confused.</span> <span id="s826">I didn't know what happening.</span> <span id="s827">And he un...he unzipped his ...uh...pants.</span> <span id="s828">I start screaming.</span> <span id="s829">As I start screaming, people...uh...kapos from other brigades over there, the Polish kapos, start running.</span> <span id="s830">And I..</span> <span id="s831">.</span> <span id="s832">uh...start telling you...what happening.</span> <span id="s833">As I telling him the story, they called right away a SS guard and...uh...bayonets, they guy took us down in the headquarters.</span> <span id="s834">Here my father...he works over there by the cement...that big machine.</span> <span id="s835">He cutting cement.</span> <span id="s836">He sees they're taking me with the guard away over there and I can't tell him nothing.</span> <span id="s837">He looks at me.</span> <span id="s838">We look each other.</span> <span id="s839">I had...they took us in a general staff over there.</span> <span id="s840">I had to tell the story what happened over and over gain.</span> <span id="s841">They took a petition from me about 20 times.</span> <span id="s842">They came over, "How did a..</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">a German officer try to kiss a Jew?"</span> <span id="s845">That was the most...uh...I..</span> <span id="s846">.</span> <span id="s847">I told them the whole story.</span> <span id="s848">I told them A to Z.</span> <span id="s849">He pulls his pants off and I start screaming.</span> <span id="s850">So then was tremendous thing for the Germans over there.</span> <span id="s851">The Germans SS.</span> <span id="s852">They telegraphed to Berlin.</span> <span id="s853">They came to Berlin, people coming down there....coming down.</span> <span id="s854">I had to tell the story.</span> <span id="s855">And they kept me completely isolated.</span> <span id="s856">Him and me, completely isolated.</span> <span id="s857">I thought that's my end.</span> <span id="s858">I'm finished.</span> <span id="s859">In the middle of the night...they called me down one night.</span> <span id="s860">They called me down....12 o'clock, 1 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s861">And they took me down in unclothing.</span> <span id="s862">There where the...uh...showers are.</span> <span id="s863">He stand undressed...the German officer, colonel, and Germans and Pollacks beating him with cold water and I had to watch how they were beating him.</span> <span id="s864">By the time he got through his head was twice the size it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">And I..</span> <span id="s866">.</span> <span id="s867">they...the more officers standing around me.</span> <span id="s868">I had to tell them the whole story.</span> <span id="s869">And he was yelling mutter, help .</span> <span id="s870">Mother, help me.</span> <span id="s871">You see.</span> <span id="s872">His head got so big his head used to .</span> <span id="s873">Fit right on top here.</span> <span id="s874">I find out 2 days later he died from the beating.</span> <span id="s875">But the tragedy was they made me watch him being destroyed.</span> <span id="s876">And I..</span> <span id="s877">.</span> <span id="s878">I'm a young kid.</span> <span id="s879">I mean how...how can I cope with that?</span> <span id="s880">But I did.</span> <span id="s881">My...my...the lucky thing was they did nothing to be me.</span> <span id="s882">They tell me to go back to my father after that.</span> <span id="s883">Actually, this was a miracle.</span> <span id="s884">It was a miracle from God.</span> <span id="s885">Because see, they didn't prove that I participate in anything, you see.</span> <span id="s886">And here...he said not...and I totally (ph).</span> <span id="s887">He hugged me and he kissed me in the face, and I start screaming afterwards.</span> <span id="s888">I went back to work.</span> <span id="s889">(Sigh) And the one...and we got weaker and weaker and weaker because the food wasn't there.</span> <span id="s890">They tried to cut the portions less and less because...the Pollacks got bigger portions.</span> <span id="s891">And the Jews got almost nothing, and a kapo was a Pollack.</span> <span id="s892">So one day, we are carrying cement.</span> <span id="s893">I mean bag cement, I could hardly walk myself.</span> <span id="s894">I fall down.</span> <span id="s895">I can't carry.</span> <span id="s896">The German said...he was...was not German...a Polish German.</span> <span id="s897">He lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s898">He said, "I'm going to kill you today.”</span> <span id="s899">I said, "Why" He says, "I'm gonna kill you.”</span> <span id="s900">And as I picked up a bag...a barrel...a bag cement and walked, he knocked me down and jumped on he and with his heel, hit my face and my nose and my teeth.</span> <span id="s901">And he let me lay there like...like I was dead...like blood...a piece of meat...raw meat.</span> <span id="s902">My father standing next to me.</span> <span id="s903">He could do nothing.</span> <span id="s904">And the end of the day I was laying there.</span> <span id="s905">End of the day, my father picked me up with the other kapo, Jewish haftling, there or prisoner, whatever you call them...they were...were called.</span> <span id="s906">And I started getting fever.</span> <span id="s907">I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s908">I started getting fever and it took me down to the...to the so- called hospital.</span> <span id="s909">When they call it hospital, and my father left me there.</span> <span id="s910">He didn't see me...see anymore.</span> <span id="s911">And in a time he came in and asked, "What happened to my son?"</span> <span id="s912">They told him, "Your son is long dead.”</span> <span id="s913">But he never gave up hope.</span> <span id="s914">I knew while...they told me it type of fever.</span> <span id="s915">They threw me in a small little army cot with...uh...three more...four or five Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s916">They were actually Russians....</span> <span id="s917">Russians...everything was there in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s918">(Clearing throat) As they start dying off.</span> <span id="s919">You imagine the cart is so small, and we were all laying there.</span> <span id="s920">As they were starting...and they wouldn't give me no water and they wouldn't give me nothing.</span> <span id="s921">They did give me a bunch of aspirins in my hand, and they told me swallow them.</span> <span id="s922">But I chewed up...how you...you can't hardly chew one aspirin.</span> <span id="s923">So I almost choked myself, but I..</span> <span id="s924">.</span> <span id="s925">I..</span> <span id="s926">.</span> <span id="s927">maybe it helped me.</span> <span id="s928">Maybe it survived me.</span> <span id="s929">I don't know.</span> <span id="s930">But a hand...handful of aspirin I swallowed or I chewed it up.</span> <span id="s931">And I was laying with the guys on the cot.</span> <span id="s932">And four guys...four big guys, and they started dying off.</span> <span id="s933">And the less died I kept them on the blanket for 3 or 4 days in order to eat his bread...his ration, and survive.</span> <span id="s934">I mean this is...this, you see, like a tiger.</span> <span id="s935">You have to survive some how.</span> <span id="s936">I laid in the hospital without food, without eating...so after they start swelling already, I told them he's dead.</span> <span id="s937">They move him away.</span> <span id="s938">I..</span> <span id="s939">.</span> <span id="s940">I was complete delirious.</span> <span id="s941">But I remember so vivid I want to get...get a drink of water.</span> <span id="s942">They wouldn't give no water.</span> <span id="s943">But they had the hose...uh...the hose that cleaned the floor, the concrete floor in that hospital.</span> <span id="s944">They put cold water on top of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">They wouldn't let me drink me the water.</span> <span id="s946">And I was delirious thinking that I explore their minds where I worked, and I wanted to kill myself.</span> <span id="s947">Cause the Germans after me...they run after me.</span> <span id="s948">I gotta kill myself.</span> <span id="s949">So I some how find a wire, like a hanger...a wire, and in Europe, the toilets have a..</span> <span id="s950">.</span> <span id="s951">a single...a container on top of the water you pull down.</span> <span id="s952">I went in the toilet and I..</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">I made a loop my head and I hooked up in front and I jumped off the toilet.</span> <span id="s955">But the...but not being rope did not pull.</span> <span id="s956">I start gargling and I gaged myself.</span> <span id="s957">So somebody...prisoner or one...one next to me, they got me off and I pull this off and I ran away.</span> <span id="s958">But I heard they were right on the blanket and I heard they were looking for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Somebody was tell in Polish...at that time I spoke Polish well because being there you learn to speak Polish and Russian.</span> <span id="s960">And...uh...as I was laying there in the blanket and it one day they came and I..</span> <span id="s961">.</span> <span id="s962">I felt I'm getting better.</span> <span id="s963">How I don't know.</span> <span id="s964">Without food.</span> <span id="s965">They did...the polish prisoners, they give a little soup, more bread.</span> <span id="s966">For me, nothing.</span> <span id="s967">I was laying there...was laying there.</span> <span id="s968">One day they liquidate the whole hospital.</span> <span id="s969">They took them all to be burned or gassed, whatever.</span> <span id="s970">They forgot me.</span> <span id="s971">They complete forgot me.</span> <span id="s972">And people ask how I survived.</span> <span id="s973">I don't know how I survived.</span> <span id="s974">This way I survived.</span> <span id="s975">They forgot me here.</span> <span id="s976">I was saved in the big aktion.</span> <span id="s977">I was...it's a miracle really.</span> <span id="s978">I..</span> <span id="s979">.</span> <span id="s980">As I lay in bed, I see my father's eyes in front of me.</span> <span id="s981">I was laying next to the...I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s982">I was laying next to the window.</span> <span id="s983">He...he never gave up looking for me.</span> <span id="s984">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s985">I looked at him.</span> <span id="s986">He start crying.</span> <span id="s987">I..</span> <span id="s988">.</span> <span id="s989">I know the way he looked, it's like a muslim and he was half dead.</span> <span id="s990">I'm sure I looked worse than him.</span> <span id="s991">He made with me the hand and he walked away.</span> <span id="s992">So I knew that he's alive and we're still alive.</span> <span id="s993">Now I had to get out.</span> <span id="s994">I had to get out of here.</span> <span id="s995">Next to...as I was laying there a whole day by myself, but the next day they brought the other group of sick people.</span> <span id="s996">(Cough) So I decided...again, who told me how to survive?</span> <span id="s997">I decided to get out from the hospital.</span> <span id="s998">They called shonung (ph).</span> <span id="s999">This is a place where you...after let's say you, you are cured quote unquote, you stay there until it get better and then they put you to work.</span> <span id="s1000">But you died there anyway.</span> <span id="s1001">They don't feed you and you die there.</span> <span id="s1002">So I say, I want to go to the shonung (ph).</span> <span id="s1003">The only thing I had in my pajamas from the hospital, the uniform over there, and...uh...a pair of wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1004">Nothing!</span> <span id="s1005">And a hat.</span> <span id="s1006">A hat...a..</span> <span id="s1007">.</span> <span id="s1008">uh...a prisoner's cap.</span> <span id="s1009">So I went in the and I laid their a couple of days and I said, "If I don't get out of here, I'll die.”</span> <span id="s1010">Because a bunch of zombies walking around there, old people and they're dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">They're walking around with their blankets.</span> <span id="s1012">No food.</span> <span id="s1013">And they...uh...they wait to die.</span> <span id="s1014">You don't get better there.</span> <span id="s1015">You die.</span> <span id="s1016">I decided to go to work.</span> <span id="s1017">I could...I could hardly walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Now...but the brigades were already formed, you see.</span> <span id="s1019">And they I was just extra one.</span> <span id="s1020">They grabbed me in the place.</span> <span id="s1021">And my father saw me...that I'm going in a brigade, but he couldn't help it because he was...his brigade passed by already, and it filled up....his brigade already.</span> <span id="s1022">So here I'm going with all new people, all new kapo.</span> <span id="s1023">Nobody know me.</span> <span id="s1024">And we're going to a big mountain, and on top the mountain, snow.</span> <span id="s1025">Just to walk to the place, working place, was a effort.</span> <span id="s1026">At least a good hour to walk.</span> <span id="s1027">Cold.</span> <span id="s1028">Miserable.</span> <span id="s1029">Hungry.</span> <span id="s1030">I mean it's a miracle.</span> <span id="s1031">As I came there I saw way on top the mountain they're building a tower...a watch tower.</span> <span id="s1032">And we're supposed to bring up strands of wire.</span> <span id="s1033">We have wire carry over there...on the mountains, on the snow and everything else.</span> <span id="s1034">So they told me I should grab one.</span> <span id="s1035">And it's heavy and I put over...you can't...you have to put over your neck in order to carry that.</span> <span id="s1036">I had to walk with that up the mountain...the kapo next to me.</span> <span id="s1037">And I walk and I fall...and he beats me.</span> <span id="s1038">So I'm thinking to myself...the funny part was I never said I'm going...I never thought I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s1039">All 3 years, I never thought I'm gonna die.</span> <span id="s1040">There is a Jewish writer Shalom Alehem, and he writes whenever I study him and he writes, " .”</span> <span id="s1041">It means you should never lose your hope.</span> <span id="s1042">Be always...think always forward, you'll survive.</span> <span id="s1043">I never thought I'm gonna die.</span> <span id="s1044">So as I was going...crawling up that mountain with this big strand of wire on my neck which I am sure it weighed at least 25, 30 pounds, maybe 40 pounds...I don't know...I was falling down.</span> <span id="s1045">He beat me.</span> <span id="s1046">I got up.</span> <span id="s1047">He beat me.</span> <span id="s1048">So I flashed back like I saw a movie years ago like the Russian the boats over there.</span> <span id="s1049">They used to fall down...the slaves.</span> <span id="s1050">They used to beat them.</span> <span id="s1051">They used to get up.</span> <span id="s1052">They beat them.</span> <span id="s1053">I said, "I'm the same...I'm the same...I'm the same...uh...I'm the same boat right now, and I'm gonna survive.</span> <span id="s1054">How I made that day I'll never...I'll never...and then we go up and we go down and carry some more and up.</span> <span id="s1055">Every time I fall he beat me.</span> <span id="s1056">Fortunate again, the next day my father took me in...in▐ his brigade.</span> <span id="s1057">He talked to the kapo, his kapo, maybe to take me and my son just came out from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1058">He's sick.</span> <span id="s1059">Please take him in.</span> <span id="s1060">And he begged him working there and also, being a barber, he also...if they're working there 12 hours, 14 hours working in the mines without food without anything he...uh...he used to come and shave people's faces for extra bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s1061">And my...uh...he comes to me.</span> <span id="s1062">He would not eat his soup.</span> <span id="s1063">He comes to me and he say, "My son, I ate already.</span> <span id="s1064">I had already enough.</span> <span id="s1065">That's for you.”</span> <span id="s1066">I say, "Papa, have you eaten already?"</span> <span id="s1067">"Yal.</span> <span id="s1068">Yal.</span> <span id="s1069">That's for you.”</span> <span id="s1070">So you cannot go yet.”</span> <span id="s1071">(Crying) (Long Pause) (Obviously crying) I can't forget his voice.</span> <span id="s1072">Believe me, not...not many fathers done that.</span> <span id="s1073">And when he...he used to lay on the bunk...uh...and I used to reminisce the food we used to eat at home on the holidays.</span> <span id="s1074">He used to tell me, "Don't talk," he said, "Don't waste...don't waste energy.</span> <span id="s1075">Be quiet.”</span> <span id="s1076">And one day when we are laying on the...on the bunk...there were 3 or 4 bunks...laying second bunk, and people had to urinate, make in their pants.</span> <span id="s1077">It was...couldn't control theirselves.</span> <span id="s1078">Somebody above us urinated on top of us so the...the Polish kapo thought my father done it.</span> <span id="s1079">So he jumped on the bunk and started beating him unmercifully.</span> <span id="s1080">So I jumped on my father to protect him.</span> <span id="s1081">So they broke a stick on me.</span> <span id="s1082">At least being younger, I survived that you see.</span> <span id="s1083">Otherwise, he would kill my father.</span> <span id="s1084">So indirectly we kinda compliment each other.</span> <span id="s1085">We.</span> <span id="s1086">.</span> <span id="s1087">we...our spirit.</span> <span id="s1088">We talk with each, give each other .</span> <span id="s1089">(Crying) (Sigh) And...and as the front again...the front came closer.</span> <span id="s1090">The...uh...Germans are losing more and more ground.</span> <span id="s1091">They decide to move us...to move us to...uh...to Therenienstadt.</span> <span id="s1092">In Therenienstadt they put us...just put us in...uh...barracks or in...uh...officers quarters or soldiers quarters four...four floors high, without food without anything.</span> <span id="s1093">Nothing really.</span> <span id="s1094">Nothing!</span> <span id="s1095">They didn't feed us.</span> <span id="s1096">(Sigh) I remember...I remember they came...also some different scenes seem to stick in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">When they came in there...we...we walked from...uh... Litomerice to Therenienstadt.</span> <span id="s1098">We walked and we came there...been hungry, thirsty.</span> <span id="s1099">They assembled so many people altogether...most Jews...they throw...they throw bread in the air.</span> <span id="s1100">Like a dog, you see.</span> <span id="s1101">And people grabbed and teared it apart.</span> <span id="s1102">He said, "Don't do that because you...you squeeze, they're gonna kill you there.</span> <span id="s1103">See?</span> <span id="s1104">But.</span> <span id="s1105">.</span> <span id="s1106">but as I was standing for far away and seeing how the people like a..</span> <span id="s1107">.</span> <span id="s1108">you take a bunch of hungry dogs and you throw a piece and they were clinging to each other, tearing each other apart.</span> <span id="s1109">And the Germans laughing and having a good time, enjoying themselves.</span> <span id="s1110">May the 8th, we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1111">Another day or two, my father wouldn't have made.</span> <span id="s1112">Never would have made it.</span> <span id="s1113">He was...he was laying in bed.</span> <span id="s1114">Couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1115">A skeleton!</span> <span id="s1116">I can see pictures.</span> <span id="s1117">His skin was like a dead person.</span> <span id="s1118">I..</span> <span id="s1119">.</span> <span id="s1120">I still have some walking power.</span> <span id="s1121">And I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1122">I looked...I was on fourth floor that time.</span> <span id="s1123">I looked through the window.</span> <span id="s1124">I see a tank with a star...a Russian tank.</span> <span id="s1125">And was all around.</span> <span id="s1126">So I realized that's our liberation.</span> <span id="s1127">I never knew how I'm going act liberation.</span> <span id="s1128">But I couldn't walk down the stairs.</span> <span id="s1129">I slide myself down on my behind, all these stairs, because my feet couldn't carry my body.</span> <span id="s1130">And I crawled myself up to the tank.</span> <span id="s1131">There was no Germans around it.</span> <span id="s1132">And I..</span> <span id="s1133">.</span> <span id="s1134">I kissed the feet of the...the Russian.</span> <span id="s1135">He...for him it was also strange.</span> <span id="s1136">I mean...uh...he didn't see...he never saw people looking like we were.</span> <span id="s1137">Dead people crawling from all the halls out.</span> <span id="s1138">He gave me oh a piece of bread or a piece of something.</span> <span id="s1139">I..</span> <span id="s1140">.</span> <span id="s1141">I took it to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">And I..</span> <span id="s1143">.</span> <span id="s1144">we both ate and the crumbs together.</span> <span id="s1145">And next day I know they opened the whole...uh... But they had a quar.</span> <span id="s1146">.</span> <span id="s1147">quarantine because there was typhus period, you see.</span> <span id="s1148">Couldn't go any of them.</span> <span id="s1149">But the Germans are walking in thousand and thousand columns so we grabbed some food from them and some something, whatever they had over there.</span> <span id="s1150">They were as weak as don't don't kill me.</span> <span id="s1151">Don't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1152">Just....Just here whatever you got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">All...all of a sudden they became nice people.</span> <span id="s1154">They walk in columns and columns and columns.</span> <span id="s1155">I remember an incident.</span> <span id="s1156">It's a laughing matter.</span> <span id="s1157">I started getting my...my energy back already.</span> <span id="s1158">My father was feel a little bit better already.</span> <span id="s1159">I gave him...I brought him some food, some chocolates from Germans over there.</span> <span id="s1160">As I walked...I walked in to the Germans, take their food away or something, I was very thirsty so one German had a..</span> <span id="s1161">.</span> <span id="s1162">a bottle of...field bottle.</span> <span id="s1163">I said, "Give to me.</span> <span id="s1164">I'm thirsty.”</span> <span id="s1165">He said, "No.”</span> <span id="s1166">I said, "Give it to me.”</span> <span id="s1167">I mean give it to me.</span> <span id="s1168">He's a big, 6 foot German.</span> <span id="s1169">Here's a little...little Jewish prisoners, you know, but I was liberated and he was right now, he would shoot you and run, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">So he gave it to me and I opened up and I looked, He had Volka, a hundred proof Volka.</span> <span id="s1171">I could stand that.</span> <span id="s1172">I couldn't swallow this.</span> <span id="s1173">But this...this is a..</span> <span id="s1174">.</span> <span id="s1175">a thing that I..</span> <span id="s1176">.</span> <span id="s1177">a comic thing that happened you know.</span> <span id="s1178">And...uh...we were...we were there quite about 2, 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s1179">My father got more to his energy, and...uh...they opened the .</span> <span id="s1180">A lot of...the Russians...they actually didn't took care us much.</span> <span id="s1181">They themselves didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1182">But everything....they opened up all the...the places, all the warehouses with fruit and with white fruit, and prunes and all that.</span> <span id="s1183">We had to have it.</span> <span id="s1184">Also my father starts cutting the Russians hair too.</span> <span id="s1185">They gave better meals.</span> <span id="s1186">Because being a barber, you see, he had his trade right there.</span> <span id="s1187">So we start both coming to our energy.</span> <span id="s1188">And we had accumulated two...two suitcases and some clothes for ourselves, and...uh...one day we decided to go find our mother.</span> <span id="s1189">How do you go back when the transportation...that for 2 weeks we were traveling on top of the trains.</span> <span id="s1190">We couldn't go inside because all...all filled up with Russian...with Russians going back home and with other ones.</span> <span id="s1191">So many times...many times I wind up sleeping on the...kerosene trains, the gasoline trains.</span> <span id="s1192">They run once over there.</span> <span id="s1193">Just keep on going towards...towards Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1194">And we...uh...we stopped on the way and we were tired, so one day we fell asleep and we woke up and the Russians stole our... whatever we had...the suitcases.</span> <span id="s1195">Again we were...we start from ground zero until we came to...uh...to Lodz.</span> <span id="s1196">In Lodz we got off and we said we'll try...rather than go back Lithuania, try to find here because they so few Jews on the...maybe some Jewish people will know where Mother is.</span> <span id="s1197">And sure enough we find people who have...told us...uh...that she has died with the prayer on her lips we...on her lips we should survive.</span> <span id="s1198">She only...only begged we should survive.</span> <span id="s1199">And...uh...they were with her all the way in the concentration camp, and she worked very hard and had typhus fever, and she died.</span> <span id="s1200">How she died and when she died and exactly the grave, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1201">And the date we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1202">And...uh...when I met after 40 years...I met...the lady's going to come today...Marsha.</span> <span id="s1203">She...my mother died in her hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">She told me that.</span> <span id="s1205">And...uh...after 40 years, we haven't seen each other in 40 years, and she told me that they're going...not a week before the liberation.</span> <span id="s1206">They're going out on the appell to count, and she couldn't make it, and she put her down.</span> <span id="s1207">When she came back, she was dead already.</span> <span id="s1208">At least, I know she died in March.</span> <span id="s1209">At least I know that her soul is not floating empty and and every...every March I say kaddish in a for her soul.</span> <span id="s1210">She was a good woman.</span> <span id="s1211">And...uh...the only thing my...my parents really left me was a good name, which I.</span> <span id="s1212">There was no monuments.</span> <span id="s1213">There was no...no wealth, which I can give it to my children when I'm... I tried to raise my children the same way to...to be (Sigh) good with people.</span> <span id="s1214">After we find out my mother passed away in...in...uh...in Lodz, wasn't any use to go to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Wasn't nothing there any more.</span> <span id="s1216">Just (sigh) dead family, so we decide to go back, join a kibbutz in...uh...in Lodz.</span> <span id="s1217">Uh...They...they taught me that...how to handle ammunition whatever.</span> <span id="s1218">One more thing I want to insert.</span> <span id="s1219">When...when the Russians liberated Therenienstadt, they...uh...asked the people who was in...in Leitmeritz (Litomerice) early camp...they gave us all guns.</span> <span id="s1220">They say, "Go out and kill the...the Germans.</span> <span id="s1221">Kill anybody you want.”</span> <span id="s1222">I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1223">I couldn't take revenge.</span> <span id="s1224">I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s1225">Let God punish them.</span> <span id="s1226">I don't....Why do I have to have blood on my hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Abe, can you go back for just a minute because it wasn't clear.</span> <span id="s1228">You were in Flossenberg, in the subcamp of Flossenberg.</span> <span id="s1229">When were you taken to Therenienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Uh...From...From Flossenberg, they take to Leitmeritz (Litomerice).</span> <span id="s1231">Q: Litomerice.</span> <span id="s1232">After Litomerice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: After Litomerice.</span> <span id="s1234">As the front came closer, after we were liberated May the 8th, in 45.</span> <span id="s1235">Uh...I would say...uh...middle of April...middle of April, or end of April, I mean...the calendar...a calendar not that...uh....the only...yal...the only thing I..</span> <span id="s1236">.</span> <span id="s1237">uh...only calendar there now...I know it was January 31st when I was...my birthday when I was laying in the hospital that time with typhus fever.</span> <span id="s1238">And Germans was...was raving...I remember the kapos was...was raving that the Germans are taking...had...have the Allied forces on the...on the run.</span> <span id="s1239">At that time in the...uh...there was a major offense over there.</span> <span id="s1240">The Germans turned around a major offense in the Allied Forces in the Allied forces in...in Brussels it was...in the Battle of the Bulge, and they were all...and I just kind of... But anyway, as...uh...I joined kibbutz, and...uh...from the...the kibbutz we...we decide, you know, where to go.</span> <span id="s1241">I can't go...I can't go in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1242">I can't go...uh...in any place else, so the best thing for me to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1243">But my mother before we are separated, she told me...I knew it all along.</span> <span id="s1244">She has two brothers and a sister in America.</span> <span id="s1245">She...she said to me, "If you survive, try to find them.”</span> <span id="s1246">The only thing I know their names and what was doing.</span> <span id="s1247">They're printers.</span> <span id="s1248">The only thing I knew her was the name of the printers.</span> <span id="s1249">I didn't know where they were in New York or whatever.</span> <span id="s1250">So...uh...on the way to...uh...on the way to...uh.</span> <span id="s1251">.</span> <span id="s1252">Germany I joined up Bricha.</span> <span id="s1253">It's uh...and...We...I used to bring people from Poland to...to Linz...uh...to Linz...Graz...Austria.</span> <span id="s1254">From there go to Italy and give it to the Haganah.</span> <span id="s1255">And this we carried the people...uh...for awhile was easy because a friend of mine with the Americans CIC gave me some papers to bring his sister to...uh...to DP camp in America...in Germany.</span> <span id="s1256">So I found her and I brought her and I used same papers to...to bring people over the borders to...uh...for the Haganah to...for Palestine...for Israel....Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s1257">Until...</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Tell us about those trips, will you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Well, it was very dangerous trips.</span> <span id="s1260">Was...there were a lot of old people and children.</span> <span id="s1261">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1262">Uh...You had to...uh ...walk through...by all the guards.</span> <span id="s1263">It was not much food.</span> <span id="s1264">We had some rationed food from the UNRA gave us, the American ration food.</span> <span id="s1265">And it was a dangerous...uh... dangerous mission to go across the mountains.</span> <span id="s1266">And was cold.</span> <span id="s1267">Sickness.</span> <span id="s1268">We had to cope with all that.</span> <span id="s1269">And I done it...done it a number of times until the English have found out...they saw my document over and over again and they...uh...they captured me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">They beat me up, took away my papers, and they made me work over there close by, by the railroad.</span> <span id="s1271">And one day I..</span> <span id="s1272">.</span> <span id="s1273">uh...I said, "That's...that's the end of it.”</span> <span id="s1274">I saw the train coming and the train leave and I jumped in there on the last train and I wind up in the American zone.</span> <span id="s1275">And...uh...because it's actually was an English zone....the American zone was...uh...not much to go by.</span> <span id="s1276">And once I..</span> <span id="s1277">.</span> <span id="s1278">uh...I went over I decided to settle down.</span> <span id="s1279">Because the funny part was even...it's very ironic.</span> <span id="s1280">Even being in concentration camp, not having my schooling...after all I was 13 and a half years old, I was thinking when I..</span> <span id="s1281">.</span> <span id="s1282">not if I survive, when I survive, "What am I gonna do?"</span> <span id="s1283">I mean I didn't have no schooling.</span> <span id="s1284">I didn't have no money.</span> <span id="s1285">I need a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">So the little trading I had in ghetto from , I advanced it in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1287">Came...they had a trading school from the...from the , and I learned auto mechanics, which gave me a..</span> <span id="s1288">.</span> <span id="s1289">a nice start here in America.</span> <span id="s1290">So...uh...at one point I was...also when I was in Landsberg, or to go to Israel...Palestine at that time, and I registered to go to America.</span> <span id="s1291">So the HIAS called me first with America.</span> <span id="s1292">So when I came in the country, they gave me seven dollars on the ship.</span> <span id="s1293">They dropped me off in New York, without a language, without nothing, without any relatives, without any...any body.</span> <span id="s1294">And I felt pretty lonely.</span> <span id="s1295">Because at that point I still didn't know where my aunts lived.</span> <span id="s1296">I didn't know where to turn.</span> <span id="s1297">So...uh...I bought me...I remember at that time, a candy bar, a Fifth Avenue candy bar, and a big one.</span> <span id="s1298">At that time they had big ones.</span> <span id="s1299">I said, "Well, seven dollars might go a long time.”</span> <span id="s1300">And...uh...I didn't like...care for New York because the by the trains and subways was too much for me....was everything happened to fast for me and...and...to...to be.</span> <span id="s1301">So somebody asked me to go to Washington...Washington, D.C. I didn't know Washington, California, I would go any place out of New York.</span> <span id="s1302">So I wind up in Washington where I..</span> <span id="s1303">.</span> <span id="s1304">uh...I..</span> <span id="s1305">.</span> <span id="s1306">uh...I went to school here, night school, and I worked and I established my life.</span> <span id="s1307">I met my wife a year later.</span> <span id="s1308">She's also a survivor from Belgium.</span> <span id="s1309">Also went through Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1310">And we...uh...yesterday was actually 42 years married... anniversary.</span> <span id="s1311">We have a very successful marriage.</span> <span id="s1312">We had the same common...common denominator.</span> <span id="s1313">You see we're both survivors, and we know each other.</span> <span id="s1314">Though I'm from Lithuania, she's from Belgium but.</span> <span id="s1315">.</span> <span id="s1316">uh...the common denominator is there you see.</span> <span id="s1317">And we have three nice sons with three grand...grandchildren, one the way, and I'm a happy guy.</span> <span id="s1318">Really.</span> <span id="s1319">(Sigh) And the final thing, I'd like to read something for you which I have outlined.</span> <span id="s1320">I want to conclude it in if you don't mind.</span> <span id="s1321">I put on my glasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Before you read, would you tell me...you had left your father in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s1323">Bring him up...tell about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s1325">I..</span> <span id="s1326">.</span> <span id="s1327">I left my father in the DP camp and he married a..</span> <span id="s1328">.</span> <span id="s1329">uh...a lady he knew when he was a child.</span> <span id="s1330">And she also lost her husband and two grown children.</span> <span id="s1331">They also hid in a bunker.</span> <span id="s1332">.</span> <span id="s1333">bunker and two weeks before liberation, the Lithuanians told on them and they were shot by Germans.</span> <span id="s1334">So they also broke up...they also broke up people.</span> <span id="s1335">All of us were broken up people.</span> <span id="s1336">Just skeletons really.</span> <span id="s1337">Tried to grow skin.</span> <span id="s1338">Meat and skin on us.</span> <span id="s1339">And...uh...it took me two years.</span> <span id="s1340">After all, he wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with him.</span> <span id="s1341">It took me two years to make paper for him.</span> <span id="s1342">Secure him a job which had...the only one job he worked next to the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s1343">In fact when he...when he met so many important people there...when he was going for the first citizen papers, Eisenhower private...private detectives were...were his witnesses.</span> <span id="s1344">Was well liked.</span> <span id="s1345">And...uh...he worked all his life until he passed away here.</span> <span id="s1346">And he enjoyed life, and he gave me that...that instinct of life.</span> <span id="s1347">He gave...I inherited it, the joy of life.</span> <span id="s1348">And...uh...it's important to me, to my wife to make her happy.</span> <span id="s1349">And everything...everybody...everything else around us are happy.</span> <span id="s1350">And...uh...he died a happy man.</span> <span id="s1351">It was a New Year's eve about 18 years ago.</span> <span id="s1352">He was dancing in Beverly Hilton Hotel.</span> <span id="s1353">It thousand people around him.</span> <span id="s1354">He had a massive heart attack.</span> <span id="s1355">And...uh...being New Year's eve and the ambulance couldn't come so fast and so they survived...they revived him, but he was too late already.</span> <span id="s1356">He lived other month or so and he passed away.</span> <span id="s1357">And his...uh...his wife, my stepmother, passed away a few years later.</span> <span id="s1358">But he'll always have a big part in my heart.</span> <span id="s1359">I go often...very often to his grave, so my children go.</span> <span id="s1360">At least I have a grave here for him where I can go.</span> <span id="s1361">For good or for bad and...and pray and shed a tear, and talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s1362">I think that much God gave me.</span> <span id="s1363">And I want to come to the few words I want to finish with that.I don't know if they're appropriate or not, but...uh...I wrote down something on paper here.</span> <span id="s1364">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1365">The expression I ask myself many times.</span> <span id="s1366">How can a whole nation collectively turn away their faces from the wholesale murder of the Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1367">It takes effort to look the other way.</span> <span id="s1368">Perhaps if you learned the answer to that question, we can prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again, but I doubt it that we have learned.</span> <span id="s1369">I doubt it that we ever will learn.</span> <span id="s1370">Because I came one day driving...flying from Israel back to America and we stopped in Germany to refuel.</span> <span id="s1371">Was in Munich.</span> <span id="s1372">And the plane stopped and we had to take a little shuttle bus to go to the station where...where to...inside the airport, and they came to us and start even that yelling, austeg, austeig, austeig .</span> <span id="s1373">My wife and I we turned and looked at each other and reminded us of the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1374">And this is very, very hard emotion to take.</span> <span id="s1375">And that's the reason I was present for the Holocaust survives here in Washington for a long time and the reason was we got to leave...we got to leave witnesses, which I am doing right now.</span> <span id="s1376">The people should know that it did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Maybe if we couldn't prevent, maybe they can prevent.</span> <span id="s1378">Maybe somebody can prevent.</span> <span id="s1379">Maybe I can...I can leave a token of my experience to humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
