id="s6">[Director's comments] Interviewer: We'll start with you giving us your name and spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">00.04.58 Kurt Herman: Okay.</span> <span id="s8">My name is Kurt Herman, K-U-R-T H-E-R-M-A-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Interviewer: Let's start with that story you were mentioning about you and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">00.05.13 Kurt Herman: Okay.</span> <span id="s11">Well, we lived in Vienna during -- after Hitler came into Austria.</span> <span id="s12">And we happened to be crossing the Danube River between the 9th District and the 2nd District.</span> <span id="s13">And along came a motorcade with Adolf Hitler in it and all his entourage.</span> <span id="s14">And we had to stand there and do the normal Nazi salute.</span> <span id="s15">And we're scared, but we survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">[Director's comments] Interviewer: Kurt, when was the first time as child that you have a recollection of what it was to be Jewish in Vienna at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">00.06.27 Kurt Herman: The recollection in Vienna at that time for a Jewish person really hit us after Hitler came into Austria and started to separate me as a child from my non-Jewish friends in the school system.</span> <span id="s18">And I asked my dad actually, "What did I do?"</span> <span id="s19">And he said, "You didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s20">You were just born Jewish.</span> <span id="s21">And that's the way it is right now."</span> <span id="s22">Interviewer: What business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">00.06.59 Kurt Herman: My father and grandfather had a fabric business in the 9th, uh, District.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Interviewer: Tell me about what it was like to be a Jewish student in elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">00.07.22 Kurt Herman: Okay.</span> <span id="s26">Well, prior to Hitler, we were all -- boys and girls of all faiths were mixed seating in the classroom.</span> <span id="s27">And the boys after school went to the playground, played the sport that we played over there, which is called fussball and soccer here.</span> <span id="s28">And it was all well.</span> <span id="s29">As soon as the sign came up after Hitler invaded that said "Jews over here and non-Jews over here," that all ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">00.07.48 They all had swastikas, and now I was harassed because I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Interviewer: Once Jews in Vienna began to realize the best course was to leave Vienna, what are your recollections of what you and your friends were talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">00.08.19 Kurt Herman: Well, we had a little discussion.</span> <span id="s33">But we're little children, and we all knew we have to try to leave here, but it's really at the discretion of our parents because we can't really do anything.</span> <span id="s34">But my Jewish friends including my cousin -- another cousin who lived near me -- were all talking about ["Can't we] -- I hope we're going to go to America and see each other."</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Interviewer: Why America?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">00.08.44 Kurt Herman: That was always the country of choice.</span> <span id="s37">First of all, we had relatives here, and we thought that they -- they left earlier, and they said that America is the place to be, it's free, and everybody can come.</span> <span id="s38">Well, we found out not everybody can come, but we did -- that was our decision.</span> <span id="s39">And we never wanted to go to another European country.</span> <span id="s40">Somehow I think we had an inner feeling that this might not stop here, which was a good guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">00.09.13 So why go to the next country and then to go again?</span> <span id="s42">So we tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Interviewer: Do you remember as a boy, what would you have heard about America?</span> <span id="s44">What did you know about the U.S. at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">00.09.32 Kurt Herman: Not very much except that I had relatives here, and they all talked about that -- how nice it is here.</span> <span id="s46">They're not discriminated against as much.</span> <span id="s47">And there's freedom, freedom you can say anything you want and, uh, the newspaper isn't controlled.</span> <span id="s48">Even though the Austrian newspaper wasn't completely controlled, it was somewhat controlled.</span> <span id="s49">And after the Nazis there was no freedom anymore at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Interviewer: Your parents at this point, I'm assuming, themselves were eagerly looking for a place to leave as well.</span> <span id="s51">Tell me -- 00.10.06 Kurt Herman: Very, very -- yeah, Mother -- Mother and Dad and grandparents and all -- everybody was trying -- my grandfather wasn't so hot to leave.</span> <span id="s52">He thought that they wouldn't bother him because he was a general in the Prussian army in the first World War.</span> <span id="s53">Of course, he was wrong.</span> <span id="s54">And the effort was being made, but it's diff- -- it was difficult to come here.</span> <span id="s55">You needed a sponsor.</span> <span id="s56">You needed to [fall] in the quota system.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">00.10.31 And things weren't -- it was just tough to do, but we kept at it.</span> <span id="s58">And then later on perhaps we succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Interviewer: Tell me what happened to your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">00.10.48 Kurt Herman: Well, my father, who was of Polish birth, fell under the Polish quota system as did my grandmother and grandfather.</span> <span id="s61">And they were able to get passports to leave, destination Cuba.</span> <span id="s62">The thought was if they can get to this hemisphere, Cuba is near the United States, and maybe later they can come here.</span> <span id="s63">Unfortunately the ship they were on, even though they had proper papers and passports, was unable to land in Cuba or anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">00.11.22 And after being on the ocean and ports and so on for several months, finally landed up in France as displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Interviewer: What happened to them at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">00.11.34 Kurt Herman: Well, my father in early 1940 after I had already been here as well as my mother was able to get bookings to the United States and arrived here and our three-family unit was intact.</span> <span id="s67">My father -- my grandfather and grandmother could not and perished in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Interviewer: Now let's move to the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s69">The larger one involved many thousands of children going to the UK.</span> <span id="s70">Was that an option for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">00.12.23 Kurt Herman: My mother confronted me several times about signing up to go to Great Britain, which eventually took 10,000 children.</span> <span id="s72">But for whatever reason, particularly one that I wanted to come to America and that my mother was trying to come to America, I decided I don't want to go to Great Britain.</span> <span id="s73">It could've been bad the decision, but I'm here.</span> <span id="s74">So it was a good decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Interviewer: And instead what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">00.12.50 Kurt Herman: Instead what happened?</span> <span id="s77">Several months later in the Jewish press they announced a Kindertransport to the United States of America.</span> <span id="s78">Now, I wasn't certain that I'm going to make it, but I certainly went and tried.</span> <span id="s79">And we were -- people came from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s80">Gilbert Kraus, his wife Eleanor Kraus, and a doc- -- a pediatrician by the name of Dr. Schless came and interviewed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">00.13.20 Took us, gave us mental, physical tests.</span> <span id="s82">We conversed.</span> <span id="s83">Of course we had an interpreter because we don't speak the same language.</span> <span id="s84">And while there were some 600 people that applied, we found out they're only taking 25 boys and 25 girls.</span> <span id="s85">And after the interview was over, we went home and hoped to hear, which we did hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">00.13.44 May 10th we heard that this lucky person was selected for this venture to the United States, which I should arrive at the train station in Vienna in May with the passport and the two suitcases [that were] the regulations for our journey to America in June at the -- June 2nd on a ship called the USS President Harding out of Hamburg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Interviewer: Before you arrived in the U.S., the interviewing and questionnaires for the choosing of the children was happening in February -- 00.14.29 Kurt Herman: February or March, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Interviewer: And you didn't find out until --</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Kurt Herman: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Interviewer: A few months later.</span> <span id="s91">What do you remember about that period in terms of -- was your father still around or was it just you and your mother at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">00.14.43 Kurt Herman: Mom and I were -- Mom and I were the only ones left in Vienna at the time.</span> <span id="s93">My father had since departed.</span> <span id="s94">We didn't know where he was because there was no instant communication, but we later found out he's on the ocean somewhere.</span> <span id="s95">Actually I landed before he did, which was several months later.</span> <span id="s96">[Unintelligible] there's really not much you can do.</span> <span id="s97">You got to wait and hope that you're lucky to be selected.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Interviewer: And in those -- 00.15.08 Kurt Herman: You can't call anybody and follow it up.</span> <span id="s99">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Interviewer: And in those months, Kurt, did you have other friends your age who were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">00.15.18 Kurt Herman: Uh, I -- you asked -- I'm not sure that friends my age left.</span> <span id="s102">I will tell you that my other cousin on my father's side and his mom left on their own to the United States.</span> <span id="s103">That's about the only recollection I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Interviewer: Tell me with as much detail as you can recall about the day you left Vienna on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">00.15.57 Kurt Herman: Well, of course that was a day that we were all anxious for.</span> <span id="s106">We got to the Vienna train station as instructed by the time.</span> <span id="s107">I arrived at the train station and found that the train station was full of stormtroopers.</span> <span id="s108">And our first recollection was, well, they changed their mind.</span> <span id="s109">They're not going to -- I mean we didn't know what went on behind the scenes -- that we're not going to leave.</span> <span id="s110">They're not going to let us go.</span> <span id="s111">The parents particularly were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">00.16.24 And then of course they did put us on the train.</span> <span id="s113">But I was told that they told the mothers, and the fathers if they were there, they're not allowed to cry.</span> <span id="s114">That they're using this as a publicity how good they are to let these go.</span> <span id="s115">And they're not allowed to wave because that's too close to sieg heil.</span> <span id="s116">And they just have to put up with it.</span> <span id="s117">So after a period of -- I guess it took an hour for all this happen -- we're on the train.</span> <span id="s118">And we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">00.16.53 And waved goodbye to Mom.</span> <span id="s120">We could wave, but they couldn't.</span> <span id="s121">And said to ourselves, "Are we ever going to see our parents again?"</span> <span id="s122">Which was one of the conversations on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Interviewer: You mentioned a couple of suitcases.</span> <span id="s124">What kinds of things do you remember bringing with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">00.17.10 Kurt Herman: Just mostly clothing.</span> <span id="s126">In fact, all clothing.</span> <span id="s127">There was nothing else that, you know -- not TVs, no radios.</span> <span id="s128">We just brought clothing.</span> <span id="s129">No food.</span> <span id="s130">So, you know, personal things like toothbrushes and toothpaste.</span> <span id="s131">Things you have to do to get along.</span> <span id="s132">But nothing -- and no money.</span> <span id="s133">[Well, we] didn't need any.</span> <span id="s134">But, uh, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Interviewer: Even going back further to February or so, what do you remember about one or both of the Krauses?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">00.17.46 Kurt Herman: Well, they were impressive people.</span> <span id="s137">I do remember Eleanor.</span> <span id="s138">Red finger nail polish was so different than what we are used to seeing.</span> <span id="s139">So I remember her.</span> <span id="s140">I know she had more makeup on than I was used to seeing.</span> <span id="s141">So I was pretty impressed with her.</span> <span id="s142">I was only a young guy, but I thought she was a pretty woman.</span> <span id="s143">What the heck?</span> <span id="s144">You might as well start.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">00.18.11 Uh, other than that I didn't remember much.</span> <span id="s146">Uh, I remember the doctor because he examined us, gave us a physical test and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">[Director's comments] Interviewer: As I understand the story, you first went from Vienna to Berlin -- 00.18.41 Kurt Herman: Correct.</span> <span id="s148">Overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Interviewer: Tell me a little bit about -- Kurt Herman: Well, they brought us into -- as I recall, they took us to Berlin and put us like -- I think it's like a gymnasium because a big place.</span> <span id="s150">And we slept on the floor as best we could.</span> <span id="s151">We were harassed a little bit when we got there.</span> <span id="s152">However, when the American consulate came with having our passports to go to America, the Nazis eased off.</span> <span id="s153">And the pressure was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">00.19.09 Then we slept there.</span> <span id="s155">Got up the next morning and were transported to Hamburg, Germany, to board the ship the USS President Harding.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Interviewer: I assume you had never been on a ship before.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">00.19.23 Kurt Herman: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Interviewer: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Kurt Herman: Awesome.</span> <span id="s160">It was an awesome sight to see this large ship which is going to take us to America, with the American flag flying.</span> <span id="s161">It was something to be remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Interviewer: What are your specific memories of being on board that ship for however long it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">00.19.47 Kurt Herman: Well, it took -- it took altogether like over two weeks, but we did stop in two places, Liverpool and Le Havre, to pick up passengers.</span> <span id="s164">The remembrance was that all the children were housed four in a -- in a -- in a room with bunk beds in third class.</span> <span id="s165">And the Krauses were in first class.</span> <span id="s166">We basically had to fend for ourselves, and we were just the darlings of this ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">00.20.15 Everybody took to us, the captain.</span> <span id="s168">We had -- they put us in drills, life drills.</span> <span id="s169">We also had English lessons by the Krauses.</span> <span id="s170">And the rest of the time we just [moped] around, and we took particular interest in eating because we hadn't really had good food for a while.</span> <span id="s171">And the most interesting part of the eating was we couldn't read the menus.</span> <span id="s172">So we had to point to things to eat and then if the waiter brought it and we didn't like it, we just shook our head and said, "No, we don't want this."</span> <span id="s173">00.20.49 Sooner or later they figured out they better not bring spinach or all this good stuff that Mom thinks we should eat because we're not going to eat it.</span> <span id="s174">Unfortunately I would say 50 percent of the children were seasick.</span> <span id="s175">So they didn't have this pleasure.</span> <span id="s176">I was not seasick a day.</span> <span id="s177">I had this great pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Interviewer: What was the best thing on the menu?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">00.21.11 Kurt Herman: Ice cream was the best thing on the menu.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Interviewer: Did you have a roommate on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">00.21.26 Kurt Herman: Yeah.</span> <span id="s182">There was three other people in the ship.</span> <span id="s183">I don't recall their name.</span> <span id="s184">Julius wasn't one of them.</span> <span id="s185">I know that.</span> <span id="s186">There was three other boys around my age.</span> <span id="s187">They were trying to do that, but one of them was younger.</span> <span id="s188">We sort of watched over them.</span> <span id="s189">There was one child that was a lot younger.</span> <span id="s190">The older ones.</span> <span id="s191">Big deal.</span> <span id="s192">I was nine.</span> <span id="s193">So I was older.</span> <span id="s194">Watched over them.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">00.21.47 We sort of helped each other.</span> <span id="s196">The older ones helped the younger ones.</span> <span id="s197">So we sort of took care of ourselves.</span> <span id="s198">But adults helped.</span> <span id="s199">They were all -- everybody that was on there was willing to help if we needed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Interviewer: I realize you were all relatively very young kids.</span> <span id="s201">I'm curious if you remember amongst the group of you when you would talk at night or during the day, what your sense was of just the gravity of the situation that had you on that ship in the first place?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">00.22.21 Kurt Herman: Well, we were certainly conscious of the fact that we have now escaped Nazi Germany where things aren't good for Jews, even though the things weren't that terrible yet.</span> <span id="s203">It was bad enough.</span> <span id="s204">And that we're going to an adventure to a new country where we have rights and freedoms, fully understanding that it is possible we will not see our parents again and that we may be living -- 00.22.50 We didn't know where we were living.</span> <span id="s205">We didn't know whether we're going to a community place or foster homes.</span> <span id="s206">We didn't even know we were going to a camp, even thought it was summertime.</span> <span id="s207">We just knew we were coming.</span> <span id="s208">And I also knew that when I got there that, uh, there were some relatives there but that nobody was taking -- nobody went to relatives.</span> <span id="s209">We all stayed together, all 50 of us, in the holding area until we were told where we're going.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Interviewer: Was there interaction with the Krauses -- 00.23.25 Kurt Herman: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Interviewer: On the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Kurt Herman: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Interviewer: Tell us a little about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Kurt Herman: The Krauses taught English to us.</span> <span id="s215">We had classes.</span> <span id="s216">They would show up and help us learn English once, sometimes twice a day.</span> <span id="s217">There was no interaction at mealtime because they were in a different era -- area.</span> <span id="s218">But yes, we were in the -- they were around.</span> <span id="s219">We saw them, and we had pictures.</span> <span id="s220">They were part of the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">00.23.49 Not all of them.</span> <span id="s222">Sometimes we only had children, but they were part of the -- they were there.</span> <span id="s223">They were the heroes.</span> <span id="s224">They're our heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Interviewer: What's your first memory of arriving in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">00.24.07 Kurt Herman: Statue of Liberty was our first memory of the United States.</span> <span id="s227">We were facing the Statue, as we have some pictures of that, looking at this lady and cheering.</span> <span id="s228">"Here we are, arriving in New York."</span> <span id="s229">It was a wonderful feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Interviewer: You knew the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">00.24.34 Kurt Herman: Yes, we -- well, they-they told us.</span> <span id="s232">We were warned.</span> <span id="s233">It's not like we knew what the Statue was, but we knew what it stood for by the time we got there.</span> <span id="s234">I mean that's what the Krauses did, you know.</span> <span id="s235">Indoctrinated us a little bit.</span> <span id="s236">And it was good enough for us to do.</span> <span id="s237">So.</span> <span id="s238">Yeah, we knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Interviewer: So you arrive in the harbor there, and you head straight to Philadelphia or -- 00.25.05 Kurt Herman: We had -- we were boarded on a bus and sent to Collegeville, Pennsylvania, for a summer camp that -- owned by Brith Sholom.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Interviewer: What was life like there for two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Kurt Herman: We'd never been to summer camp before.</span> <span id="s242">So life was great.</span> <span id="s243">I mean it was just terrific.</span> <span id="s244">We could -- you know, we were -- had counselors.</span> <span id="s245">We had controlled groups.</span> <span id="s246">We were taught English.</span> <span id="s247">Twice a day.</span> <span id="s248">We're taught "The Star-Spangled Banner."</span> <span id="s249">We're taught, "Pledge allegiance to the flag.</span> <span id="s250">God bless America."</span> <span id="s251">In addition to playing our own sport, fussball and -- or soccer, we're taught baseball and basketball and learned how to chew gum, because American kids chew gum.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">00.25.47 So we didn't want to be different.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Interviewer: Still chew gum?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Kurt Herman: Yeah, I still chew gum.</span> <span id="s255">But now more like a gentleman, not like before.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Interviewer: While you were at the camp that summer, were the Krauses a presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">00.26.10 Kurt Herman: Sometimes.</span> <span id="s258">We had dignitaries from Brith Sholom, and the Krauses would visit with the president or the whatever they call them, grand master.</span> <span id="s259">Yes.</span> <span id="s260">We had other visitors, too.</span> <span id="s261">You know, Jewish -- maybe prospective -- I don't know who they were.</span> <span id="s262">They could've been prospective foster parents visiting the camp.</span> <span id="s263">It was always seems to be visitors there.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">00.26.36 And sometimes, you know, we'd have Pledge Allegiance every morning and sometimes there's an adult there helping other than the normal counselor and staff.</span> <span id="s265">So I'm assuming they had something to do with Brith Sholom.</span> <span id="s266">Actually we didn't know Brith Sholom was involved at that point.</span> <span id="s267">We did not know that.</span> <span id="s268">We just knew Krauses.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Interviewer: So you're understanding then was that these two people were solely responsible basically for bringing -- 00.27.03 Kurt Herman: Yes.</span> <span id="s270">Somehow or other, somebody mentioned B'nai Brith.</span> <span id="s271">So we thought it was B'nai Brith.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Interviewer: While you were at the camp what, if anything, did you know about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">00.27.19 Kurt Herman: I was in correspondence with my mother at the camp.</span> <span id="s274">Every day -- it was required to write letters, of course in German.</span> <span id="s275">They knew where she was, and she knew where I was.</span> <span id="s276">I knew nothing about my dad.</span> <span id="s277">I knew my aunt was there, too, but I didn't correspond with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Interviewer: Of course this was prior to the formal outbreak of war -- 00.27.48 Kurt Herman: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Interviewer: So letters and correspondence were still -- Kurt Herman: Yes, there were -- I'm not certain they weren't edited, but I wrote postcards.</span> <span id="s280">There was nothing to edit.</span> <span id="s281">I'm telling I'm playing, I'm having fun, I'm eating ice cream.</span> <span id="s282">And playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Interviewer: Tell me a little bit about the family that you at least temporarily stayed with.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">00.28.15 Kurt Herman: Okay.</span> <span id="s285">At the end of -- at the end of the summer, there was a lady came.</span> <span id="s286">Her name is Mrs. Leonard.</span> <span id="s287">I didn't know that she lived in Allentown, but she lived in Allentown, PA.</span> <span id="s288">She took me and another boy by the name of Julius to live in her house.</span> <span id="s289">The lady is a family lady, has children, had a grandchild already that was only three years younger than us, and her youngest child was a senior in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">00.28.44 Fortunately for us, she happened to be a very wealthy lady living in a 10-bedroom mansion with live-in help.</span> <span id="s291">And I thought I was in heaven living in this place.</span> <span id="s292">And very lovely lady.</span> <span id="s293">She disciplined us, but she helped us, too.</span> <span id="s294">There was a lot of tough times in school initially with the language.</span> <span id="s295">And the socialization wasn't bad with the other kids because we played sports and sports takes over, covers all other prejudices.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">00.29.23 If you can play, you play.</span> <span id="s297">So that helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Interviewer: And Mr. Leonard?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Kurt Herman: Mr. Leonard was nice to us, but he was in his -- doing his business, and he -- and she -- and he wasn't with us all the time.</span> <span id="s300">But one thing we had at the Leonards', quarter of 7:00 every night you had to come down to dinner, not coming off the playground.</span> <span id="s301">You had to be cleaned up.</span> <span id="s302">You didn't have to wear a tie, but you had to be neat.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">00.29.53 I remember they had a piped-in radio station, Lowell Thomas came on at quarter of 7:00 every day through mealtime.</span> <span id="s304">And mealtime was togetherness.</span> <span id="s305">And if you came late and were dirty, you didn't get your allowance money.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Interviewer: What grade were you in at this point?</span> <span id="s307">What was school like?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">00.30.17 Kurt Herman: Well, I was supposed to be -- Julius and I age-wise, supposed to be in fifth grade.</span> <span id="s309">But when they interviewed us after much hullabaloo at the school, they put us in third grade.</span> <span id="s310">Our English wasn't good enough, but we were great in math because we already had all this stuff.</span> <span id="s311">But I give credit to both of us.</span> <span id="s312">We did get through third, fourth, and fifth without missing a beat, without having to stay back a year, and moved on to sixth grade, which of course was after I left the Leonards because that year was over and Mom had since come.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">00.30.54 So we moved to in school -- another school in another section of Allentown.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Interviewer: So please tell me then a little about your mom arriving and what that was like in terms of the reunion with your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">00.31.08 Kurt Herman: Well, Mother came.</span> <span id="s316">That was a -- you know, reunion.</span> <span id="s317">Hugging and kissing and crying.</span> <span id="s318">And Mother came -- and interpreting for Mother to speak to the Leonards because I'm now a bilingual guy.</span> <span id="s319">And she's not.</span> <span id="s320">And from what I gather, I stayed at the Leonards'.</span> <span id="s321">That Mother was, uh -- they got her a room through the Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s322">Helped her out a little bit.</span> <span id="s323">And since fortunately she could operate a sewing machine, they got her a job in one of the mills.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">00.31.41 So she was able to sustain herself and get on her feet a little bit.</span> <span id="s325">And she started to take English classes.</span> <span id="s326">And by the time the school year ended, I left the Leonards to live with Mom.</span> <span id="s327">We set -- we had a small apartment in another side of Allentown where -- where it's not so ritzy.</span> <span id="s328">But always in touch with the Leonards, constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Interviewer: So that means you lived with the Leonards from the time you arrived -- 00.32.11 Kurt Herman: It's about a year, close -- a school year basically.</span> <span id="s330">A school year.</span> <span id="s331">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Interviewer: So you started back in school in, say, September of '39 and you stayed with the Leonards through the end of that school year -- 00.32.24 Kurt Herman: Yeah, May, June, whatever.</span> <span id="s333">Yes.</span> <span id="s334">And September then I -- I went to a different school.</span> <span id="s335">It was a little harder at the different school because again that was a different neighborhood, less Jewish.</span> <span id="s336">So -- but it wasn't that bad either.</span> <span id="s337">Again, I must emphasize they saw me play ball, and I was playing with them.</span> <span id="s338">So they didn't bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">00.32.46 Thank -- my mother used to say, "Thank God for sports."</span> <span id="s340">Although she resented that I was playing all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Interviewer: And then when did your father arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">00.33.00 Kurt Herman: Well, my father came, uh, during the time -- during that time.</span> <span id="s343">Before I finished, he came.</span> <span id="s344">Finally got out of France.</span> <span id="s345">So he and Mother had a place already before I officially moved in 100 percent.</span> <span id="s346">But it was in that close range.</span> <span id="s347">It wasn't that long.</span> <span id="s348">And my father having had experience in the textile business was able to get a job in one of the mills there, too, as a pattern cutter.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">00.33.28 And he was already a linguist.</span> <span id="s350">Unfortunately, English wasn't one of the things he'd learned.</span> <span id="s351">But he was well-educated for that era.</span> <span id="s352">And a linguist can pick up the language -- he picked it up pretty-pretty fast.</span> <span id="s353">They both picked it up pretty fast.</span> <span id="s354">They spoke with an accent, but they can't help that.</span> <span id="s355">And five years after they arrived, they became citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Interviewer: How about you?</span> <span id="s357">When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">00.33.53 Kurt Herman: Well, I automatically become a citizen when they did.</span> <span id="s359">I'm a child.</span> <span id="s360">I also automatically became a citizen when I went to the service, the military.</span> <span id="s361">But I already had my papers before that.</span> <span id="s362">So it was not a problem -- I didn't have to do any testing.</span> <span id="s363">It's the same thing as a minor child.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Interviewer: During the time you lived with the Leonards, at that point was there any contact at all with the Krauses or -- 00.34.21 Kurt Herman: No.</span> <span id="s365">Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s366">I do not remember the Krauses.</span> <span id="s367">I do remember contact with another foster family who took in one of the girls.</span> <span id="s368">And they were friends with the Leonards.</span> <span id="s369">So once in a while we saw her.</span> <span id="s370">They visited.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Interviewer: But otherwise basically no contact -- 00.34.40 Kurt Herman: Not -- maybe.</span> <span id="s372">Not from me.</span> <span id="s373">Perhaps from them.</span> <span id="s374">Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s375">No.</span> <span id="s376">I don't remember interfacing with the Krauses after that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Interviewer: I want to jump ahead many, many years.</span> <span id="s378">I'm very interested in the story of how you came to learn some years later sort of what and who was behind this whole operation -- 00.35.20 Kurt Herman: Okay.</span> <span id="s379">I don't know the exact date about it, but in the '50s, in this area was published a paper called the Jewish Times.</span> <span id="s380">I was married.</span> <span id="s381">I was employed.</span> <span id="s382">My wife calls me on the phone and says, "I just heard from somebody your picture's in the paper today."</span> <span id="s383">I said, "Well, how's my picture" -- she says, "When you're nine years old."</span> <span id="s384">I said, "How come?"</span> <span id="s385">There's a story in the Jewish Times that says it is not true -- B'nai Brith did not rescue these children.</span> <span id="s386">Brith Sholom did.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">00.35.44 That's when I knew -- so look how many years later -- that Brith Sholom rescued us, through the Krauses obviously.</span> <span id="s388">They were their representatives.</span> <span id="s389">And not B'nai Brith.</span> <span id="s390">Now, what was interesting about the whole thing -- one of the people behind Brith Sholom was a gentleman by the name of Alex Stanton.</span> <span id="s391">I was very active in -- at the time I was employed as a CFO at the Federation of Jewish Agencies.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">00.36.11 And he used to come in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">[Director's comments] Interviewer: Go ahead and retell the story of how you first -- 00.36.36 Kurt Herman: Okay.</span> <span id="s394">I-I didn't know that -- who rescued us, which organization.</span> <span id="s395">In 1972 in the Jewish Times, which is a Northeast Jewish paper, there was an article published by Brith Sholom that indicated that it's wrong -- B'nai Brith did not sponsor this trip.</span> <span id="s396">Brith Sholom did.</span> <span id="s397">And they quoted Alex Stanton who was the grand master of Brith Sholom.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">00.37.00 At the time I was employed at the Federation of Jewish Agencies as a chief financial officer and had interfaced with these people constantly.</span> <span id="s399">They didn't know who I was.</span> <span id="s400">I didn't know who they were.</span> <span id="s401">Well, now we reunited.</span> <span id="s402">They came to my office.</span> <span id="s403">And from then I was known as one of their children.</span> <span id="s404">Several times Mr. Stanton was honored.</span> <span id="s405">We had -- we were invited, my wife and I, to sit on the dais.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">00.37.28 And we're always introduced to the Brith Sholom crowd in -- when he was honored.</span> <span id="s407">And his-his daughter and son-in-law were very active in the Federation and worked with my very closely on a lot of matters.</span> <span id="s408">So that's how we -- that's how Brith Sholom came into my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Interviewer: You've got more history with Brith Sholom recently.</span> <span id="s410">Tell me a little bit about your -- 00.38.03 Kurt Herman: Well, uh, in about mid-'90s -- well, we had one reunion with Brith Sholom.</span> <span id="s411">But I had nothing to do with that, other than I helped as being one of the survivors.</span> <span id="s412">I -- they invited me to come to one of their closing events as a guest.</span> <span id="s413">So then I decided maybe I should join Brith Sholom.</span> <span id="s414">I was near retiring, and I had time.</span> <span id="s415">So I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">00.38.32 And I joined, ironically, the Kraus Pearlstein Lodge, which was named after Gilbert Kraus's father, uh, the oldest lodge that Brith Sholom has.</span> <span id="s417">And I was -- became a member.</span> <span id="s418">And then I became a vice-president.</span> <span id="s419">And for the last four years served as president of the lodge.</span> <span id="s420">And I'm also involved in the national office as treasurer.</span> <span id="s421">And on the board of governors.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">00.39.03 So I'm pretty actively involved with Brith Sholom now.</span> <span id="s423">It's called a give back time.</span> <span id="s424">They rescued me.</span> <span id="s425">I should give them my services, which I'm happy to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Interviewer: Let me ask a little about your Judaism, how observant you are.</span> <span id="s427">Were you an observant family in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">00.39.38 Kurt Herman: In Vienna, I would rec- -- as I recollect, we certainly observed the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s429">And we went-went to services Friday night and Saturday.</span> <span id="s430">My grandparents was -- were kosher.</span> <span id="s431">Uh, I don't think we were kosher, but they were.</span> <span id="s432">Then we sort of centered our Judaism around their house.</span> <span id="s433">Uh, we're always synagogue members.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">00.40.08 My parents in Allentown -- my father attended Sabbath services regularly.</span> <span id="s435">I went some Friday nights.</span> <span id="s436">I didn't go always on Saturday because my junior high basketball team practiced Saturday morning, and you can't interfere with that.</span> <span id="s437">I was bar mitzvahed and was a member.</span> <span id="s438">I was always a member of the Jewish Community Center in Allentown where all our social and athletic activities for Jews centered.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">00.40.39 So I -- so Judaism was always part of it.</span> <span id="s440">Uh, when we're married, uh, the -- we became original members of the synagogue that's in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s441">We're still there.</span> <span id="s442">I served as treasurer for 10 -- uh, treasurer for 10 years.</span> <span id="s443">And now I'm a financial advisor to that group.</span> <span id="s444">So we've been synagogue members -- are we truly completely observant?</span> <span id="s445">No, but we are attendees.</span> <span id="s446">And we're actively in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s447">My wife also.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Interviewer: You've got a large family, kids and a number of grandkids.</span> <span id="s449">Have they always known this story, your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">00.41.27 Kurt Herman: Yes.</span> <span id="s451">My -- my story -- before I told this story to other people, which wasn't till after the movie Schindler's List, my children and grandchildren knew.</span> <span id="s452">I'd been -- I went to their schools and spoke.</span> <span id="s453">And if not, we spoke here.</span> <span id="s454">But I never publicly spoke about this to outside groups.</span> <span id="s455">I was never asked.</span> <span id="s456">Nobody ever asked.</span> <span id="s457">It became vogue it seems.</span> <span id="s458">I guess they figured these people are dying out, we'd better get something down on -- messages down.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">00.42.00 And now it's become like [a-a vocation] I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Interviewer: Was there something specific about Schindler's List that kind of triggered?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Kurt Herman: No.</span> <span id="s462">I don't know.</span> <span id="s463">I just know that people started to call Jewish places to -- "We want to hear about the Holocaust."</span> <span id="s464">Well, it started out with then the kids came -- my daughter said they want to learn in my -- in my grandson's school.</span> <span id="s465">So I went to that school.</span> <span id="s466">So I was pretty much on my own until the Holocaust Museum opened here.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">00.42.38 And then they booked speakers.</span> <span id="s468">And now it's-it's big.</span> <span id="s469">They have a Web site.</span> <span id="s470">And then -- then I was -- then I heard about these symposiums about where they have kids come in to colleges.</span> <span id="s471">Uh, so they call me for that.</span> <span id="s472">It sort of exploded, you know.</span> <span id="s473">Then I -- there was Downingtown has big programs every year, and I go there now.</span> <span id="s474">Uh, so I would say that I delivered this speech a good 24 times a year to as little as 10 people and as many as 900.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">00.43.15 Same message.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Interviewer: What's the core of the message?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Kurt Herman: The core of the message is -- well, I'm still -- I'm hoping that the core they get that hatred is not good and that here's my story of how I finally was able to escape all this hatred and survive.</span> <span id="s478">And I-I don't mince any words.</span> <span id="s479">I was lucky, very lucky.</span> <span id="s480">And I suffered probably less than most because I got out of there faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">00.43.46 Then the message is Brith Sholom's great.</span> <span id="s482">They saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Interviewer: Why do you suppose the Krauses and Brith Sholom did what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">00.44.06 Kurt Herman: That's an excellent question which I really don't know, but I guess they felt if they could possibly rescue some children out of this thing, that they should make an effort.</span> <span id="s485">Because -- and [know] it was difficult to get American passports.</span> <span id="s486">And they were able to main -- get 50 passports.</span> <span id="s487">Maybe they would've rescued more children if they could get more passports.</span> <span id="s488">I don't know.</span> <span id="s489">But that was the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">00.44.29 They had some connection in the Roosevelt administration with Biddle I believe is the man's name.</span> <span id="s491">I don't know what his position was, but somehow got these passports.</span> <span id="s492">So I assumed they had the -- they had a big meeting according to what I heard, and they voted.</span> <span id="s493">And they had the funds that they should try to rescue some people, which thank God they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Interviewer: You said you had stayed in touch with the Leonards.</span> <span id="s495">What became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">00.45.19 Kurt Herman: Well, Mr. Leonard passed.</span> <span id="s497">Mrs. Leonard [lived] alone.</span> <span id="s498">Now, I lived with my family in Allentown for a while and therefore visited her quite a bit.</span> <span id="s499">Then we relocated to Philadelphia basically for better jobs.</span> <span id="s500">But I had my mother and father there.</span> <span id="s501">So when I visited Mom and Dad with my children, I went to Mrs. Leonard afterwards and saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">00.45.47 So whenever I visited Mom and Dad, I visited my other mom.</span> <span id="s503">Gracious lady.</span> <span id="s504">A couple times she was honored in Allentown by [Adasa], and I was invited.</span> <span id="s505">And I attended.</span> <span id="s506">And she introduced me as-as a son.</span> <span id="s507">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Interviewer: You mentioned hearing from the granddaughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">00.46.13 Kurt Herman: Yes.</span> <span id="s510">Mrs. Leonard's granddaughter -- Gail Leonard was her name -- lived on the -- the house adjacent to the Leonards'.</span> <span id="s511">And was three years behind us, but went through the Allentown school system.</span> <span id="s512">And I knew her.</span> <span id="s513">I mean just -- not socially, but I knew her.</span> <span id="s514">We talked on occasion.</span> <span id="s515">So one time when I went on the computer recently a year or two ago on Classmates, I noticed that Gail Leonard was on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">00.46.45 So I took the liberty of sending her an email.</span> <span id="s517">And she remembered two boys being at her grandmother's house.</span> <span id="s518">And, uh -- and so we reacquainted on email.</span> <span id="s519">She actually didn't know why we were there.</span> <span id="s520">So I -- I told her a little bit of the story and then told her to go to Google and she can read all about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">00.47.11 So periodically we send emails.</span> <span id="s522">We exchange wishes.</span> <span id="s523">She once indicated she might come east, which I said, "Well, if you do let's be sure we get together," because she has a grandchild I think at Bryn Mawr.</span> <span id="s524">But that so far hasn't happened.</span> <span id="s525">But we are in touch and, uh, we wish each other Happy New Year's and Happy Holidays.</span> <span id="s526">And when an article comes up or something of interest here, I always tell her, "I spoke today, Gail.</span> <span id="s527">And, uh, both your grandmother and you were in the speech," which I will do later today.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Interviewer: What's the message you most want those kids to take away?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">00.48.05 Kurt Herman: Well, I -- there's two messages I tell them to show that they shouldn't hate anybody.</span> <span id="s530">The second message I give to youngsters.</span> <span id="s531">If you heard me today I said, "Get an education.</span> <span id="s532">I got one.</span> <span id="s533">My grandkids have it.</span> <span id="s534">You need that to succeed today."</span> <span id="s535">Because some of these kids think they don't need this, they don't need that.</span> <span id="s536">Well, they're wrong in my opinion.</span> <span id="s537">And so I peach -- preach that to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">00.48.33 And the fact that there was a Holocaust that shouldn't happen again, they shouldn't people as much, even though it's happening everywhere else again.</span> <span id="s539">It's just not going to change.</span> <span id="s540">But you got to try.</span> <span id="s541">I mean what else can you do?</span> <span id="s542">And as some [peop-] -- I'm introduced with a person who introduces me says, "You're fortunate, children.</span> <span id="s543">You have a live survivor of this event.</span> <span id="s544">And there won't be many soon."</span> <span id="s545">00.49.04 So that's another message, that they're fortunate to-to have somebody that's really, uh -- really was there.</span> <span id="s546">In fact, several times somebody came up and said, "I didn't believe any of this till today."</span> <span id="s547">Even though I'm not telling a-a camp story.</span> <span id="s548">They said, "I didn't think this happened, but now I believe."</span> <span id="s549">So maybe that -- if I reached those, that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Interviewer: If you can tell again the story of your aunt and your cousin winding up on the same ship -- 00.49.49 Kurt Herman: Yeah.</span> <span id="s551">About -- yeah.</span> <span id="s552">Uh, about five months after I had arrived in America and only a few months at-at the Leonards', I was notified from relatives in New York -- they knew where I was [by the way] -- that my aunt and cousin had come to America.</span> <span id="s553">And, uh, that's all I knew at the time.</span> <span id="s554">So we talked and they came to visit and mentioned that they were on the same ship -- 00.50.18 And when she got into the cabin and having seen my name on-on the -- on the board -- on the bed, she realized that she's in the same cabin that I had five, six months before.</span> <span id="s555">Of course she cried.</span> <span id="s556">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s557">I was saved.</span> <span id="s558">And we had a nice visit, fully understanding that I'm not going to live with her now and possibly -- possibly if nobody else comes, that's all that's left.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">00.50.45 I mean the Leonards had no further obligation.</span> <span id="s560">But after [an hour] I was content to stay where I was because I was better off than they were, fortunately.</span> <span id="s561">They had just started.</span> <span id="s562">They language hasn't [come], you know.</span> <span id="s563">So they stayed in Brooklyn with relatives.</span> <span id="s564">And we brought -- of course we were in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Interviewer: What was your name doing on the bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">00.51.11 Kurt Herman: I put it there.</span> <span id="s567">I put my name on the bed.</span> <span id="s568">I was a mischievous kid.</span> <span id="s569">I thought it'd be fun.</span> <span id="s570">That's what kids do.</span> <span id="s571">Later on I remember during the war when they say "Kilroy was here."</span> <span id="s572">I said, "Oh, I beat him."</span> <span id="s573">I put "Kurt was here."</span> <span id="s574">Interviewer: What haven't I asked you that you'd like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">00.51.44 Kurt Herman: Uh -- Interviewer: We covered a lot of ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Kurt Herman: Yeah.</span> <span id="s577">Uh, well, I should tell you that, uh, if I haven't already that both my uncle, who left Vienna to go to Shanghai, finally got to the United States to reunite with his mom -- his wife and son.</span> <span id="s578">And that my father got out of France and reunited with us.</span> <span id="s579">Eventually all six of us set up life in Allentown, PA.</span> <span id="s580">So six out of eight people who started got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">00.52.15 The oldest people unfortunately died, but by the law of nature, that was pretty good.</span> <span id="s582">I mean it was sad, but as I said, considering a family of eight, for six to survive, that's a high percentage.</span> <span id="s583">Considering we were dispersed all over the place, you know.</span> <span id="s584">Some in Europe, some Italy, you know.</span> <span id="s585">I thought -- I think that's-that's miraculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">00.52.41 And fortunately for me both my mom and dad lived into their 90s.</span> <span id="s587">So I had them for a long time.</span> <span id="s588">They were able to share my-my children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s589">So it ended pretty good.</span> <span id="s590">Uh, and I think I mentioned that, uh, I've been married for 55 years, 56 years.</span> <span id="s591">To some lady from Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s592">Her name is Rosalyn.</span> <span id="s593">And, uh, we have three daughters, six granddaughters, and two grandsons.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">00.53.23 All in their -- well, not now.</span> <span id="s595">They're dispersed a little, but they're all at least -- three -- five of them are close.</span> <span id="s596">We see them.</span> <span id="s597">The grandchildren are all grown.</span> <span id="s598">One is married.</span> <span id="s599">The five of them have college degrees.</span> <span id="s600">Two of them in college now, and the other one's going, too.</span> <span id="s601">So they're all going to have educations.</span> <span id="s602">If I preach to those kids, I preach to my own kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">00.53.50 Uh, I should tell you that, uh, I am getting a pension from the Austrian government.</span> <span id="s604">Even though I never worked there.</span> <span id="s605">But that was part of their law and rule.</span> <span id="s606">Wasn't easy to get, but after six years of writing, I got it and now get a check every month.</span> <span id="s607">And, uh, we got some other money recovery from my grand- -- father's and grandfather's business.</span> <span id="s608">A check.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">00.54.18 And, uh, through my stroke of luck I found that my father had money in a Swiss bank, and I got that, too.</span> <span id="s610">So instead of spending that money on some nonsense, I'm educating my grandchildren with it.</span> <span id="s611">So that their burden isn't as great because education's very expensive.</span> <span id="s612">And now after working as chief financial officer in some companies, I'm retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">00.54.43 And I volunteer in many -- many places.</span> <span id="s614">And I give speeches.</span> <span id="s615">And somehow they make me the treasurer of all the organizations.</span> <span id="s616">Except one, where I'm the president.</span> <span id="s617">But I handle the money, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Interviewer: You mentioned this morning that you've not been back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">00.55.09 Kurt Herman: I've not been back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s620">I have no interest in going there because it's not -- I don't have good memories.</span> <span id="s621">I was invited to come and speak there.</span> <span id="s622">At that time, they -- I was negotiating with money for my bus- -- for my family's business.</span> <span id="s623">So I wrote them back.</span> <span id="s624">I said, "Rather than send me to Vienna to speak, send me the money you owe me."</span> <span id="s625">Which they did, but it took a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">00.55.41 You got to be persistent with them.</span> <span id="s627">They're not just going to give it to you.</span> <span id="s628">But you do get it.</span> <span id="s629">Take a while.</span> <span id="s630">They break your heart.</span> <span id="s631">But it -- if anybody's listening and has a chance, stick with it.</span> <span id="s632">You'll get it.</span> <span id="s633">Austria's better than most.</span> <span id="s634">Than some other countries gave nothing.</span> <span id="s635">Hungary was very -- Germany's starting to do a little bit now.</span> <span id="s636">But, uh, so I can't complain about -- I-I looked at that as found money.</span> <span id="s637">Never counted in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">00.56.13 Never expected it, but if they put a law in, you try.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Interviewer: What is the first time you felt like an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">00.56.38 Kurt Herman: First time I felt like -- well, sort of when I -- when I started school and I started to master the language.</span> <span id="s641">And particularly when I left that first school where they knew I was a refugee.</span> <span id="s642">Because I went to the second school.</span> <span id="s643">All they knew then is I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s644">They didn't know I was a refugee because I have no accent.</span> <span id="s645">So -- and then of course when I went to the Jewish center and I participated in their activities, they never singled me out as anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">00.57.11 They didn't even ask about my story.</span> <span id="s647">They just accepted me as a Jew and in their activities and a basketball player.</span> <span id="s648">I think that comes up a lot in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">[Director's comments] Interviewer: When you went to camp, obviously you were picked by a family and you went to Allentown.</span> <span id="s650">But do you remember anything about the selection process or people coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">00.58.00 Kurt Herman: No one talked to me, but I do remember people coming to take other kids.</span> <span id="s652">This all happened close to the end of the -- between the summer and -- excuse me -- the school year.</span> <span id="s653">The fact the Krauses took two people.</span> <span id="s654">And I remember some people had parents already.</span> <span id="s655">Some went to relatives, and others went to foster homes.</span> <span id="s656">I remember, but no one interviewed me other than when I met Mrs. Leonard.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">00.58.28 She didn't even interview.</span> <span id="s658">She just said, "This is it."</span> <span id="s659">So the interview process must've taken place in the office to see who's left.</span> <span id="s660">She actually wanted a-a brother and sister, but there weren't any.</span> <span id="s661">So.</span> <span id="s662">Lucky for me.</span> <span id="s663">She took two guys.</span> <span id="s664">[Unintelligible] going to take -- yeah -- the brother and sister, but I think there was only one of them.</span> <span id="s665">And they went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s666">To Texas, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Interviewer: I assume kids were siphoning off during the course of the summer, some probably fairly early after you arrived.</span> <span id="s668">Some as late as -- 00.59.13 Kurt Herman: No.</span> <span id="s669">No one was siphoned off early.</span> <span id="s670">The siphoning off process began between the end of August when camp was over.</span> <span id="s671">Last week.</span> <span id="s672">Most of them stayed till the end of the camp.</span> <span id="s673">We didn't want to miss all that good stuff.</span> <span id="s674">So I don't recall anybody leaving early.</span> <span id="s675">I mean even if a parent came early, why would they take their child out of there when, you know, it's an adjustment period?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">00.59.40 They're going to get more out of adjustment there than they are at home.</span> <span id="s677">They're more -- you know, we're talking not German now.</span> <span id="s678">We're trying to speak English.</span> <span id="s679">We have classes.</span> <span id="s680">It's better.</span> <span id="s681">I thought it was better.</span> <span id="s682">I thought it was pretty easy adjustment.</span> <span id="s683">I mean when I got to school, I could speak pretty well, you know.</span> <span id="s684">I -- my grammar wasn't -- I didn't know my grammar, but I could -- I could converse in the lan- -- and understand most of it.</span> <span id="s685">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">01.00.07 I-I don't recall everybody -- anybody leaving early.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Interviewer: Was there already a functioning summer camp at Sholom Ber or?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">01.00.16 Kurt Herman: There was a regular camp across the lake, which we interfaced sometimes.</span> <span id="s689">But our side, we only were by ourselves except when we interfaced on Fridays.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Interviewer: So there were other -- 01.00.29 Kurt Herman: Across the -- we went across the lake.</span> <span id="s691">The American guys.</span> <span id="s692">I might give you an interesting ane- --- a-a-a-a, uh -- speak.</span> <span id="s693">Somebody called me when one of my articles was in the paper and said to me, "My name is" -- whose name I do not recall.</span> <span id="s694">"I was on the other side of the camp, and I remember you people coming in.</span> <span id="s695">And we couldn't figure out that sport you were playing.</span> <span id="s696">Now I know it's soccer."</span> <span id="s697">01.00.57 So that's very -- I thought that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s698">That's when my one article was in the Jewish paper or something.</span> <span id="s699">He picked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Interviewer: He had never seen anybody playing soccer before?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">01.01.10 Kurt Herman: I guess not.</span> <span id="s702">Not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Interviewer: Did you become a good baseball player?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Kurt Herman: Fair.</span> <span id="s705">But not enough to -- no.</span> <span id="s706">Not enough to make school teams.</span> <span id="s707">No.</span> <span id="s708">I played all sports.</span> <span id="s709">Well, not all sports.</span> <span id="s710">I was a good swimmer, too.</span> <span id="s711">But I focused on basketball.</span> <span id="s712">That was the game I loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Interviewer: Did you know anyone else who interviewed in Vienna for the trip or was this the kind of thing that you talked about with your friends?</span> <span id="s714">Or was it really just a family-oriented thing, and the family said, "Don't share this outside the family"?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">01.02.17 Kurt Herman: Uh, no.</span> <span id="s716">No one said I shouldn't share, but I would tell you as I recollect today, I only know one other boy who was a friend of mine who tried to go on this trip.</span> <span id="s717">So other -- there was just people I didn't know.</span> <span id="s718">He wasn't selected.</span> <span id="s719">He was a friend prior to that.</span> <span id="s720">And there was another boy who did go on the trip who I'd met once or twice.</span> <span id="s721">So I knew who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">01.02.43 The rest were all strangers.</span> <span id="s723">We didn't talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s724">I mean we talked among family.</span> <span id="s725">They knew I was interviewed because my-my aunt could've sent my cousin, and she didn't want to.</span> <span id="s726">He was six, and he wasn't -- other people were six years old.</span> <span id="s727">But she chose not to do that.</span> <span id="s728">It's not easy to send your child away and then never see them again perhaps.</span> <span id="s729">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">01.03.12 But people did it.</span> <span id="s731">They sent them to England, too.</span> <span id="s732">So you do what you have to do, I guess, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Interviewer: The friend that you just mentioned who was not chosen, do you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">01.03.28 Kurt Herman: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s735">I do not know what happened to anybody there.</span> <span id="s736">[Just do you know] where they're located.</span> <span id="s737">You come here, you have to adjust.</span> <span id="s738">You're not worried with this guy or that guy, you know.</span> <span id="s739">You commute with your -- communicate with your family.</span> <span id="s740">That's about it.</span> <span id="s741">Because they move around.</span> <span id="s742">Who knows where they -- maybe they left Vienna to try to escape this guy.</span> <span id="s743">I mean eventually there was no escape, but in the beginning you could -- they let you out if -- even if you went to Switzerland, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">01.03.59 They did let you out.</span> <span id="s745">But then they closed everything up after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Interviewer: I believe you said your mother ended up being on one of the if not the last ships to leave -- 01.04.12 Kurt Herman: Yes, my mother was-was-was -- had papers to come to America.</span> <span id="s747">But she had to go to Genova, Italy, to sail on an Italian liner.</span> <span id="s748">And when she got there, she found out that she was a person on the waiting list, number one person on the waiting list.</span> <span id="s749">Fortunately for her, someone got sick.</span> <span id="s750">Unfortunately for that person.</span> <span id="s751">She got the spot.</span> <span id="s752">And according to information we had, that's the last ship-ship they left out -- let-let out of there legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">01.04.45 So she was fortunate to come here.</span> <span id="s754">Somehow all the luck fell in place, didn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Interviewer: This is a very Philadelphia story.</span> <span id="s756">As far as I understand, you're the only surviving Brith Sholom child still living in Philadelphia or has been living in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">01.05.18 Kurt Herman: I'm the only surviving member of this 50 currently living in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s758">There was another lady who lived in Philadelphia, but she died.</span> <span id="s759">Other than that, most of them were somewhere else.</span> <span id="s760">There's some in the close area.</span> <span id="s761">New England I think there's a Dr. Braun, and Mr. Tepper is in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s762">And there's a couple other guys in the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">01.05.42 But the others are dispersed, which we found out when we had a reunion and about 13 or 14 people came to tell their stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Interviewer: You must really like it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">01.05.57 Kurt Herman: Well, my loved ones are here.</span> <span id="s766">I'm not so crazy about the weather, but my loved -- my family's here.</span> <span id="s767">So why shouldn't I be here?</span> <span id="s768">And I've, you know, made a name for myself here.</span> <span id="s769">I'm involved.</span> <span id="s770">And yeah, I like it.</span> <span id="s771">I could -- Interviewer: Did you hear of anyone moving back to Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">01.06.21 Kurt Herman: No, I never heard anybody going back to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Interviewer: There's apparently one guy living in Germany, but I haven't confirmed his whereabouts -- 01.06.31 Kurt Herman: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Interviewer: Oswald Lewinter.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Kurt Herman: The name doesn't ring a bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Interviewer: Yeah -- Kurt Herman: And I don't know why he wants to live there, but that's his business, not mine.</span> <span id="s777">No, I don't recall anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Interviewer: And I believe there's one gentleman living in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">01.06.44 Kurt Herman: That's possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Interviewer: I only know of the one -- Kurt Herman: Israel -- Israel is possible.</span>
