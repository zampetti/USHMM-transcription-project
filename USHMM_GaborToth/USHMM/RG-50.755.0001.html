<html><body><p><span id="s1">Kurt Admon Okay.</span> <span id="s2">So here we are, and as I said, just start, Kurt, with your name, and if you could spell it for the woman who's transcribing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">00:00:43 My name is, uh, Kurt Admon, and it's K-u-r-t, Kurt Admon, A-d-m-o-n Great.</span> <span id="s4">And just so I have it for the record, tell me when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Uh, in 1928, November 12th, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Great.</span> <span id="s7">Okay.</span> <span id="s8">Thank you.</span> <span id="s9">Kurt, I wanna first ask you for some of your memories of your early years in Vienna.</span> <span id="s10">I know you've written about the neighborhood you lived in, and just tell me some of your memories of your early years growing up in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">00:01:28 Uh, one of the first things that I can, uh, recall distinctly as, uh, an event was the civil war [laughs], the civil w-, war in Vienna.</span> <span id="s12">That was in 1934, and, uh, the...the, uh, the...the...the battle was between the Austrian Army and the Socialist Party m-, militia in...in Vienna.</span> <span id="s13">The, uh, we...we were not living in the n-, neighborhood where this was going on, but we had relatives, my...my mother's, uh, older sister and her family living in the, uh, housing, uh, biggest...biggest housing project in Vienna, Karl Marx [inaudible], uh, which was the center of the Socialist, one of the centers, b-, of the Socialist, uh, Party in...in...in Vienna, and we were worried [laughs], and we heard the cannons.</span> <span id="s14">Now the...the Karl Marx [inaudible] was on the outskirts of Vienna, and, uh, after that we, uh, first of all, nothing happened [chuckles] to our family.</span> <span id="s15">Every, everything was fine, but, uh, afterward when we would go on, uh, hikes on Saturday, Sunday, out of Vienna, the route always took us by this Karl Marx [inaudible], and we could see the marks on the building because the Austrian Army shelled it with artillery, and, uh, so you could see the marks on the...on the building, and uh, remember all the time of what had happened [chuckles].</span> <span id="s16">That, that's...that's for the [inaudible] memories of early Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">00:03:25 Uh, we lived in a tr-, proletarian community, a proletarian area, and the first...the first time we had electric light in our housing was, uh, b-, also about 1936.</span> <span id="s18">Until then, uh, hu-, housing had, uh, gas, gas light, gas cooking and so on, and this is in a..</span> <span id="s19">.</span> <span id="s20">in a district which was, uh, next door to the may-, to the main, the original Vienna district, district number one, so 'member this is some, someplace way out, and, uh, I remember when we had the electricity installed and it changed our life.</span> <span id="s21">Uh, the light different, all kinds of things different.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">00:04:25 Uh, radio.</span> <span id="s23">Now we did not buy a radio, but, uh, a neighbor, who lived in another building across the street bought a radio, and, uh, very often we would hear his his radio, because when h-, he listened to all of Hitler's speeches in Germany, w-, this was a-, before the Anschluss, this, and, uh, uh, so we heard all of Hitler's speeches from [laughs], from the radio across the street, thanks to the elec-, electricity.</span> <span id="s24">And, uh, one of the memories of...of th-, th-, accompanying that was always my father's remark, “War is coming closer.”</span> <span id="s25">This is 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">00:05:15 And, uh, we felt it, the...the, we knew what was going on in Germany, uh, to the extent that, uh, a, uh, a neighbor in our building living upstairs, further upstairs from us, uh, told us not to worry, that if the Nazis take over in...in Austria, he'll protect us.</span> <span id="s27">He was a member of the Nazi Party th-, in...in...in, uh, the politics of...of Austria were very complex.</span> <span id="s28">We had a Nazi Party which was Nazi, at-, at-, attached to the German Nazi Party.</span> <span id="s29">We had a local Fascist Party, which they were fighting one another.</span> <span id="s30">We had a s-, very active Socialist Party, which I mentioned with the, uh, the, uh, revolt against the...the...the government.</span> <span id="s31">We had a Communist Party.</span> <span id="s32">So, uh, our political life was very [laughs], very lively in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">But it does sound like your father was very prescient in thinking that war was coming, and I'm curious, Kurt, for your memories as war was approaching, as things were getting worse in Vienna, what your memories were of how life began to change for you and your family, both before and after the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">00:06:50 Before the Anschluss, uh, I don't think that there was any change that I can attach to that, but, uh, after the Anschluss, from the first minute there was changes.</span> <span id="s35">The first change was the, uh, hysteria, the...the...the...the hysteria of joy with which the Anschluss was...was, uh, received.</span> <span id="s36">Uh, we...we lived on a street not far from the, one of the main streets where the German Army marched through on the day, and, uh, unforget-, unforgettable, the...the...the hysteric joy that...that was on the streets.</span> <span id="s37">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s38">And, uh, th-, th-, always, I always remember that with...with, uh, [laughs],</span></p> <p><span id="s39">00:07:45</span></p> <p><span id="s40">I..</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">I don't know how to... how to...how to express it, but, uh, after the war, after all of everything, one of the, uh, one of the sayings in Austria was that we were, uh, Hitler's first victim.</span> <span id="s43">Ha!</span> <span id="s44">[laughs] S-, s-, no, really, unbelievable, and...and...and horrifying in a..</span> <span id="s45">.</span> <span id="s46">in a way, h-, ha-, they...they...they...they were going wild in the streets, and they were the first victims, going wild.</span> <span id="s47">Okay.</span> <span id="s48">But, uh, that was the...that was the first minute, the...the shock.</span> <span id="s49">It wasn't unexpected because there was, the...the...the Nazi Party in...in, uh, Vienna was n-, in Austria was not a small party.</span> <span id="s50">It was...it was well represented in...in, uh, in...in the Parliament, and, uh, also then...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">00:08:45 Then the...the...the...the s-, the, what...what changed first of all for me, for us, uh, and I'm not sure if that's what's the first thing happened, was, uh, the, uh, um, the danger of...of...of, uh, of violence, the danger of...of meeting m-, mob violence in the streets.</span> <span id="s52">Uh, maybe the, uh, people who were...were employed in government jobs or other, m-, maybe had...had s-, more...more, uh, more personal problems with their livelihood and so on, but what...what we felt first of all was...was the...the violence in the street, uh, not...not against us personally, but especially, uh, the Orthodox Jews, who, uh, marked by...by their, uh, looks, by...by their dressing, by the way they appeared in the streets, they were marked...marked targets, and there was a lot of it, lot of violence.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">00:09:56 I think...I think the, uh, ma-, uh, of big change, very...very marked change in...in be-, in...in official behavior towards Jews as a whole in Vienna came, uh, well, first of all it came in the school, really.</span> <span id="s54">We, the...the...the...the Anschluss was in March, in...in the middle of the school year, middle of the school semester, and the, still in that semester we were separated from, uh, from the, uh, Austrian Christian, uh, pupils in...in...in the same school.</span> <span id="s55">We stayed in the same school, but they marked off a section that was used by the Jews, and so Jewish teachers, Jewish pupils moved to their section and, uh, the others, the...the nor-, the normal [laughs] people stayed where they, in the other section.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">00:11:01 But, uh, then, uh, next year, next school year the...the change was complete, as we were moved to a different school, which was a completely Jewish school, Jewish pupils and Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s57">Uh, there were a lot of times when...when there was, and...and for us mainly, uh, by the problem of...of, uh, the...the streets, the...the...the danger of the streets, the...the...the organized, uh, the Nazi youth movement.</span> <span id="s58">I started [laughs] worrying about the guy with a, the, in the youth movement with a..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">with a knife in his, uh, belt and so on, but, uh, nothing...nothing serious, uh, did not...did not happen.</span> <span id="s61">What happened was...was internally.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">00:12:03 Uh, we knew before Hitler entered Vienna what was going on in Aus-, in Germany before, and, uh, my father, for instance, the same, still in, within the month of March, uh, went to the American Consulate and...and went early enough to be registered at, in...in the m-, month of March, within two weeks of...of the Anschluss, uh, to fo, to...to register for...for, uh, for...for, uh, traveling, for en-, entry to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">00:12:46 Uh, what I remember at home was the constant, uh, constant consul-, consultations, friends, family, every day, every evening, every afternoon [laughs], ev-, every, all the time was spent, where are we going, how are we getting out.</span> <span id="s64">I mean, the...the...the...the, uh, I think the...the main, the...the main topic, and I think virtually the only topic that was, uh, going on in the Jewish home was how are we getting out, where are we going to, where, the...the question was where.</span> <span id="s65">[clears throat] Uh, America with its difficulties, uh, is, Switzerland with its difficulties, Australia [laughs], uh, you name it, and all...all...all...all...all countries, all...all places, uh, ev-, every day, every evening, consultations, I hear that, uh, there's a lee-, uh, someone who can lead us across the border into Switzerland, uh, for such-and-such a price and such-and-such, uh, uh, Australia, how can we get a visa, the problems with...with immigration to America.</span> <span id="s66">Uh, that's...that's...that's what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Let me ask you along those lines, Kurt.... [logistics] Along those lines, because I'm interested in what your memories are viewing this and reacting to this through a ten year old's eyes, you were about ten years old at this time or not even quite ten, I'm wondering if you remember what your feelings and thoughts were as you're hearing your parents, your family, your friends talk about the need to leave.</span> <span id="s68">Do you have memories of what that meant to a ten year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">00:15:20 No [laughs].</span> <span id="s70">Very...very simple answer to...to the...the, no, nothing.</span> <span id="s71">I was l-, I was listening.</span> <span id="s72">I wa-, I..</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">I..</span> <span id="s75">.</span> <span id="s76">I..</span> <span id="s77">.</span> <span id="s78">I remember the discussions of the...of the, but...but the p-, any personal reaction for me, no.</span> <span id="s79">No.</span> <span id="s80">Uh, the p-, I..</span> <span id="s81">.</span> <span id="s82">I had other reactions as time, uh, progressed, but, uh, for th-, that, the...the took...took for granted.</span> <span id="s83">Look, I..</span> <span id="s84">.</span> <span id="s85">I heard about oth-, other countries before, uh, it be, we...we...we were aware, at least in our home, um, uh, about the war between Italy and...and Ethiopia, th-, Abyssinia, uh, Aby-, uh, [inaudible], these fantastic names, but, uh, okay.</span> <span id="s86">N-, no, the...the, uh, uh, the change came with the Kristallnacht, the change that I ca-, that I felt, that I could see, so if you want me to talk about that and its....</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">00:16:31 The...the ro-, the rolling development of that, I'm...I'm...I'm ready to go.</span> <span id="s89">And Kristallnacht started for me the day after.</span> <span id="s90">Nacht was at night, but the next day, the next day we went to school, and as I mentioned before, uh, this was already a school, Jewish school, Jewish pupils, Jewish teachers, Jewish management, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s91">Uh, about not first thing in the morning, but about nine o'clock, maybe, or something like that, uh, the principal of the gr-, s-, school came into our class and instructed us to go home, straight home.</span> <span id="s92">He didn't say why, he didn't say what, but he...he was obviously very upset, and so we had no idea of what was going on, but something was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">00:17:30 And, uh, so we w-, we left school br-, not...not all together but, uh, filtering [laughs], filtering us out into the street so that it would not be too noticeable that there was a..</span> <span id="s94">.</span> <span id="s95">a sudden, uh, movement of...of many Jewish pupils.</span> <span id="s96">And so I walked home, but, uh, didn't get home.</span> <span id="s97">Ne-, ne-, near our, uh, how-, near our house was a Jewish synagogue on one of the main streets in our...in our district, and so I..</span> <span id="s98">.</span> <span id="s99">I walked there, by there, and there was this huge crowd around the synagogue.</span> <span id="s100">I had no idea what was going on, it was a huge crowd, and I kept pushing myself into the crowd to see what [laughs], what's going on.</span> <span id="s101">Uh, I c-, I c-, I couldn't see what was going on but obvi-, obviously it was something that had, uh, negative meanings, and not, uh, but I c-, I couldn't see.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">00:18:43 I did...I did not see, but it was burnt down and fi-, and finally the synagogue was burnt down, but, uh, I didn't, I couldn't see at...at that time, I couldn't see flames.</span> <span id="s103">And so I..</span> <span id="s104">.</span> <span id="s105">I left the crowd and walked home, uh, nothing, I didn't, I had no idea what was going on, and only when I got home was I informed of what was happening out there and I..</span> <span id="s106">.</span> <span id="s107">and I don't know why, and, uh, uh, th-, we were actually closed in for that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">00:19:15 Uh, later on, uh, later on I found out, we found out that, uh, one of my uncles was arrested at...at, uh, that day of Kristalln-, even during the night of Kristallnacht, uh, the Germans arrested a few thousand men, Jewish men in...in [inaudible], and one of my uncles was in on the list, the, uh, I don't know why, but...but he was.</span> <span id="s109">So, uh, this, by the way, was the man that was living in...in Karl Marx [inaudible] before and, uh, and maybe that had something to do with it, but I..</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">I don't know.</span> <span id="s112">Uh, his wife was very [laughs], very upset, this is h-, my mother's older sister, and, uh, my mother was a cooler person than she, and so it, uh, to a great extent it fell upon her to try and find out what's going on and how to get him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">00:20:25 And so my mother had an additional task now in life, going to the, uh, Gestapo headquarters and trying to find the, find her, uh, brother-in-law, or find out where he is, what, how can he get out, when can he, and so on.</span> <span id="s114">Uh, during that period, few weeks, couple of weeks after...after Kristallnacht, uh, when she was not home, she was [laughs] by the way doing her...her routine at the...at the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s115">Uh, we, uh, we had un-, un-, unwelcome visitors.</span> <span id="s116">A young couple came to our how-, to our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">0:21:21 My father was home, luckily, and, uh, they came with a paper informing us that we are being, we have to r-, get ourselves out of the apartment where we are in, and it's...it's been allotted to them, how, why, when, and, uh, my father was a [laughs] courteous man and talked to them nicely, and, uh, trying to think of a, what possible arrangements could be, when...when they could come, when we could move out and so on.</span> <span id="s118">While we, while they were talking, my mother came home and, uh, that...that, I should say, at least saved the day.</span> <span id="s119">She said, “Look, I have a baby here,” my brother was a little bit over a year old at the time, “and I can't move out just like that.</span> <span id="s120">If you want us to move out, uh, we have to have time to, uh, find where to go.”</span> <span id="s121">And they were, I think, a little bit, uh, uh, embarrassed [chuckles].</span> <span id="s122">I don't remember exactly, but I think they were not so used to th-, to s-, an odd situation like this either, and they agreed, and, uh, they made the arrangements that we would look now, start looking for an alternative apartment and...and then they can move in.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">00:23:06 My mother and father started looking for a place to live, and it became a bit of a problem because we were not the only ones who had the, this problem.</span> <span id="s124">There, this was part of a move of ch-, pushing the Jewish population closer, not...not the ghetto, but moving it...moving it closer together.</span> <span id="s125">Uh, by the way, [inaudible] was...was the man in, of the Gestapo at this stage in Vienna.</span> <span id="s126">Afterwards he moved up [laughs] [inaudible].</span> <span id="s127">Uh, we found a place on the same street, uh, I..</span> <span id="s128">.</span> <span id="s129">I don't think s-, exactly understand the logic of...of...of...of the move, for, from...from their standpoint, we found a..</span> <span id="s130">.</span> <span id="s131">a, an apartment in the same street of, uh, a grocery which had been closed down by, Jewish grocery which the Gestapo had moved out and closed the...the, they...they were living there in the b-, many places in Vienna, maybe other places also, where they have a grocery and the back of the grocery is the apartment of the guy who's running it.</span> <span id="s132">So we moved into this, uh, apartment and, with a grocery store, the grocery store closed and we moving, we are in the apartment, and one of the rooms in the apartment is closed with a..</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">a seal of the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">00:24:40 They had moved most, whatever, they had moved into that room, the Gestapo sealed it, and my mother put a table against it [chuckles], and that was our...our...our ea-, our kitchen, uh, eating breakfast [chuckles] table.</span> <span id="s136">I w-, I w-, that...that seal frightened me.</span> <span id="s137">That seal frightened me.</span> <span id="s138">I w-, I would say every meal that we ate, I was...I was sitting next to the table there, pushed against the door, can't, what happens if I break the seal?</span> <span id="s139">Th- [chuckles], my...my...my first feeling of terror was at, was the seal in our apartment.</span> <span id="s140">And, uh, anyhow, so we...we moved, uh, and stayed there, and, uh, that was, uh, that was quite a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Kurt, what was your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">00:25:56 Uh, he...he was, um, a..</span> <span id="s143">.</span> <span id="s144">a cutter in...in a factory, in...in a clothing factory.</span> <span id="s145">He...he was a tailor by...by...by profession, that he, he'd learnt in a school in Vienna, learned the profession and had a diploma and [chuckles] certificate, but, uh, so he...he was a cutter in...in...in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">I'm gonna ask you to start again about your father, and can you start by saying, “My father?”</span> <span id="s147">. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Right.</span> <span id="s149">Sure.</span> <span id="s150">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">I appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">00:26:44 Good.</span> <span id="s153">[chuckles] My father was, uh, was a cutter in a clothing factory.</span> <span id="s154">Uh, I think it's men's clothing, if I remember correctly, and, uh, that was a profession.</span> <span id="s155">Uh, you...you had to, in order to...to work as a cutter, uh, you had to have a certificate in Vienna, and he'd gone to school, he, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s156">Originally he was also from Galicia (?)</span> <span id="s157">like my mother, but, uh, uh, after the war, First World War, after the First World War he was discharged from the Austrian Army in Vienna and he stayed in Vienna and did not go back to Galicia, and started...started working and started making, uh, learning something, a profession.</span> <span id="s158">Anyhow, he...he was working in this factory, and, uh, in addition he was also working at home sometimes for, often, uh, sewing men's suits to order, to sa-, not, uh, not, uh, manufacturing, but he was still working at the time when...when, uh, when we're talking about now.</span> <span id="s159">Uh, [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s160">00:28:16 There was a time in the early part of 1939, I gather, when your family, along with so many others, were looking for ways to leave Vienna, that somehow someone in your family heard about this opportunity for some children to come to America.</span> <span id="s161">And I'm gonna ask you again what, if any, memories you have of how your family learned of that and what memories you have of beginning to explore the possibility of you leaving your family and coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Well, bef-, before that and connected to that, I, uh, should tell you [clears throat] about his activity regarding the, uh, move to the America.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">His activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">I'm sorry, you said his activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">00:29:21 His activity in...in...in...in arra-, trying to arrange, uh, im-, immigration to America with a..</span> <span id="s167">.</span> <span id="s168">with a sister in America, and from that is a, uh, the natural lead into what you've asked me.</span> <span id="s169">Okay?</span> <span id="s170">So, uh, am-, amongst the, uh, all the activities I mentioned of...of...of...of, uh, looking for outs, the first and...and the most obvious out for us was, uh, the presence of a sister of my father in America.</span> <span id="s171">She, uh, had moved to, from Galicia, Poland, to the United States right after the First World War, and would, had a family th- there now.</span> <span id="s172">She'd married and had two...two sons, but, uh, uh, as poor as a church mouse, and had no possibility of...of directly helping us with immigration, which at that time involved having an affidavit of a, of a American citizen that, who can, uh, guarantee support to the, for the, for you and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">00:30:40 She found some relatives that I n-, I never met, uh, afterwards, even, uh, when I was in America, who were better off than she, and she convinced them to give us an affidavit, that is, a guarant-, an official guarantee to, for...for such-and-such an amount, if, uh, to...to...to s-, to support an immigrant who will c-, if he...if he has a quote, uh, two...two problems, one, the certificate, and two, the quota, for, of a particular country.</span> <span id="s174">Uh, and so she st-, she found this family of ours who could, uh, give us a quo-, uh, an affidavit but had, didn't have enough money to give the affidavit for our whole family, and, uh, the amount that they gave was sufficient for my father and one of the children, and...and...and for me, if, but that was the end of the, uh, of the financial backing that...that they could give.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">00:31:55 And so, uh, all th-, the, a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, b-, bureaucracy concerned with producing this affidavit in America, but also in Vienna at the...at the embassy, the American Embassy, and, uh, so our...our main efforts were in that direction.</span> <span id="s176">Aside from that, he was also looking at other things like...like, uh, uh, crossing into Switzerland, which, uh, was not too safe, because many of the people who crossed into Switzerland were afterwards returned to the German Army, so that was not such a good...good idea, to Australia, where we ha-, we had some relatives who had found a..</span> <span id="s177">.</span> <span id="s178">a route to Australia.</span> <span id="s179">It was, the...the, that's what they were doing.</span> <span id="s180">It was, that was a full-time [laughs] plus occupation, finding the way to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">00:32:57 Along the way there, in, uh, in April, the time th-, [laughs], uh, in...in April we had direct contact from the, uh, Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s182">The Viennese Jewish community had a..</span> <span id="s183">.</span> <span id="s184">had a [speaks in German], it's called a German, uh, com- commu-, uh, cultural center in...in Vienna, and they actually, they had contact with all...all of the Jewish population in Vienna, and, uh, they were the official representative towards the government also of the Jewish community in...in...in Vienna.</span> <span id="s185">We, so we, our c-, contact was from the [speaks in German] to us that, uh, there's a Ger-, uh, a Germ- [chuckles], am Amer-, an American delegation coming, or was already in Vienna perhaps, uh, I don't know the detail, that, uh, is looking, wants to recruit fifty children who, uh, whom they will take to America before their parents come.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">00:34:12 So the...the...the, uh, request was a) for people who are on the short list for getting to America, and b) willing to have their child go alone, not with, uh, not with them, but takes, the child goes and, uh, th-, then as time develops, the...the parents will join them in America.</span> <span id="s187">So, uh, we...we went [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s188">00:34:44 And I know...I know there was a discussion at home.</span> <span id="s189">It, it'll sound funny, but it...it, it's true, uh, my mother was very worried because, uh, well, so she's a Jewish mother and her firstborn is Superman, and, uh, she knows that in America, uh, pee-, children are kidnapped.</span> <span id="s190">This is going back to...to Lindbergh, ten years earlier, the, yeah, it was ten years [laughs], ten years earlier.</span> <span id="s191">She was worried if...if...if, uh, if...if children are kidnapped in America, then...then my son is in danger [chuckles], and she wasn't so sure she would send him without her supervision.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">00:35:27 Anyhow, we went, and we had an interview with the Kraus family, in, at the [speaks in German] in center of Vienna, and, uh, they said, “Okay, nice...nice to have met you, and...and, uh, within a few days or two weeks,” I forget, whatever it was, it wasn't two weeks even, uh, “we'll contact you and let you know if...if, uh, if we can include your son in...in...in, uh, in the delegation.”</span> <span id="s193">The same day, my, I had...I had relatives in...in Vienna, I mentioned before, my...my, and my mother's, uh, sister, my mother's brother-in-law, another sister, the youngest...the youngest sister, and, uh, that day, my...my, the older aunt and my, uh, her, my, uh, her, my uncle, her husband and, uh, the son, who was a year older than I, uh, and another uncle also, went on a trip, on a, not a trip, went to emigrate to Israel, to Palestine, and, uh, had one more sister, uh, my mother's si-, youngest sister that I mentioned before, who ha-, her hu-, had married in the meantime also, her husband was a member of, uh, Hakoach football team.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">00:37:18 I don't know how many people who see this remember or know what...what a fantastic team [chuckles] this was, uh, a Jewish football team, soccer team, in Vienna, [inaudible], and this was an international team that was traveling all over the world, it was known, to the point of because his being a member of [inaudible], he got, uh, an arrangement to...to emigrate to England, and they emigrated to England shortly after I left for America.</span> <span id="s195">So football is good for something [laughs].</span> <span id="s196">Anyway, that was the, that was our...our...our development of...of, uh, a means of getting out...getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Let me interrupt for just a second.</span> <span id="s198">Kurt, you mentioned a few moments ago that your mother was not so crazy about the idea of you coming to America.</span> <span id="s199">Tell me what changed your mother's mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">00:38:29 My father [laughs].</span> <span id="s201">That's, well, I, uh....</span> <span id="s202">M-, I..</span> <span id="s203">.</span> <span id="s204">I mentioned that my...my mother was, uh, was very unexcited [chuckles] about having me go alone witho-, without her supervision to an odd place like America where children are kidnapped, but my father w-, was more practical.</span> <span id="s205">I mentioned before also his, uh, obsession with the fact that war is coming, and the obsession started a year before, or more than a year before.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">00:39:14 Uh, h-, he was very sure that...that there was n-, nothing to, no...no way to stay, and no...no...no minute to spare, and he sh-, he did everything, he dood, he did, and I, afterwards in...in my letters to, the letters he wrote to me, uh, you can feel...feel the tension all the time of...of the, of every minute counts and...and...and every minute may be too late, and he was right [chuckles].</span> <span id="s207">F-, unfortunately for himself he was right.</span> <span id="s208">But, uh, he convinced her.</span> <span id="s209">He convinced her.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">00:39:56 And, uh, within I th-, I think about a week, or a week and a half after our meeting in, at, in...in the kultusgemeinde in Vienna, we got written notification from the Kraus family that, uh, they decided they were willing to include me in the lucky fifty, and, uh, I think we had s-, something like another ten days or two weeks at the most to organize.</span> <span id="s211">I think it was even ten days to organize the leaving.</span> <span id="s212">[sighs] Okay, [speaks in German]?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">I wanna ask you specifically, do you have a memory of meeting one or both of the Krauses at the [inaudible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Yes, yes, definitely the two of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Tell me a little bit about your recollections of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">00:40:54 No, no, no, I th-, they, I..</span> <span

them, but, uh, I don't...I don't...I don't think I was...I was, uh, calm enough to [laughs]...to form impressions of them, no, no, it's not the, not a good question, I have, I haven't had....</span></p> <p><span id="s221">That's all right.</span> <span id="s222">That's okay.</span> <span id="s223">Well, then, tell me a little bit about, you mentioned having ten days or so to prepare to leave.</span> <span id="s224">That's got to be a very dramatic thing.</span> <span id="s225">You're only ten or eleven years old at this point, you're leaving your family.</span> <span id="s226">What do you recall about that period, as you were preparing to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">00:41:57 I don't, I th-, I..</span> <span id="s228">.</span> <span id="s229">I don't think that we, uh, we had so much time to think [chuckles].</span> <span id="s230">I..</span> <span id="s231">.</span> <span id="s232">I don't...I don't re-, rem-, uh, we...we...we had just had one shock.</span> <span id="s233">The same day, as I mentioned before, this was the same day that I got the...the...the, that we went for my interview, uh, was just a week before, week and a half before, uh, the major part of our family had g-, had...had left us.</span> <span id="s234">Uh, my father had no...no relatives in...in Vienna at all, no family whatsoever, and, uh, my...my mother had a large f-, fairly large family, with the two sisters and a brother and accompaniments [chuckles], but, uh, so I..</span> <span id="s235">.</span> <span id="s236">I think it was feeling the shock of being...being virtually alone, and knowing also that, uh, very soon the youngest sister would sh-, who was still...still in Vienna, would also be leaving shortly be-, before then, and, uh, my father at this point also had...had no idea of, uh, when his...when his, uh, visa would be approved.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">00:43:17 Had no, he had, we had all the ne-, necessary documents, but we didn't have a small question like approval.</span> <span id="s238">That came much later, and much, three months later, since it was too late.</span> <span id="s239">Uh, so I..</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">I was packing, and not...not too much to pack, 'cause it' s a one...one, uh, uh, one eleven-year-old [chuckles] boy going to...going to a foreign country.</span> <span id="s242">Not too much to do.</span> <span id="s243">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">00:43:50 And, uh, the thing, uh, that, uh, outstanding in...in, and that I can recall in this whole period was that, uh, I had never riven, ridden in a car before, uh, 1939, uh, the ca-, one of capitals of...of Europe, but I had never been in a car.</span> <span id="s245">But to the...to the, I was going to say airport [chuckles], no, uh, to the rail station we drove in a taxi, and th-, and this...this was my introduction [chuckles] to mo-, the modern life.</span> <span id="s246">I rode in a taxi, in a real car.</span> <span id="s247">And, uh, from here on, memories are not too...too vivid.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">0:44:43 I think I was in, uh, some kind of shock.</span> <span id="s249">Uh, I w-, I was really surprised when reading of, uh, of comrades of mine, reading their...their description of leaving and of...of the...the, uh, being at the train station and so on.</span> <span id="s250">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s251">Don't remember.</span> <span id="s252">I know I was there.</span> <span id="s253">I w-, I..</span> <span id="s254">.</span> <span id="s255">I know I rode there in a taxi [laughs], but, uh, [mumbles].</span> <span id="s256">So we...we...we...we got onto the train and we were...were instructed beforehand not to make demonstrations or anything like that, just be, to be as private as possible, and, uh, so we went...we went on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">00:45:31 So the train took us to Berlin, and Berlin I remember [chuckles].</span> <span id="s258">Of all the things...of all the things that happened, because I re-, I remember we were told that we would be overnight in Berlin, and, uh, we would, we were putting up in a, uh, s-, hostel of sorts in, uh, Jewish hostel of the Jewish Community Center in...in...in...in Berlin.</span> <span id="s259">And we...we went, we got to Berlin, we went to the hostel...the hostel, and, uh, had no idea where in Vien-, in...in, uh, Berlin.</span> <span id="s260">Only later I found out.</span> <span id="s261">We...we took a short walk there to...to refresh ourselves after staying there, to, and before starting the next train ride, we refreshed ourselves and walked in the streets for a few minute, about ten minutes, walk in the street, and I remember walking in the streets and seeing the street sign [speaks in German], which is a very famous street for anyone who knows Europe, or Germany for sure, it's a street that leads into the, uh, uh, no....</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Brandenburg, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s264">The Brandenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">00:47:00 The Brandenburg, yes.</span> <span id="s266">It, uh, [laughs], the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s267">It's...it's a very famous street which...which leads into the Brandenburg Gate, uh, center of...of German power, the...the German government, un-, unto this day, except for the interlude in...in...in Bonn.</span> <span id="s268">Uh, and so this, I re-, I remem-, I remember the...the name of the street.</span> <span id="s269">And many years later, when...when, uh, we visited in Berlin, about two weeks, uh, ten years ago, eleven years ago, I looked...looked for the, uh, place where we stayed, and I found it by...by looking around, uh, ha-, I had the address from a friend of mine, of...of where...where the, a very famous synagogue was, very important synagogue, in...in...in...in the Berlin Jewish life, and I found the, looked, started looking around the...the...the, this street, looking through the map, and I found the Brandnburg Gate, and of course [laughs] there I found Unter der Linden], which was the place that we had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">00:48:23 It took a few years to get it [laughs], to recognize, but, uh, so I re-, I had...I had that interlude in...in Berlin which...which left me an impression.</span> <span id="s271">And on, then on the boat, then I got to the boat [clears throat].</span> <span id="s272">The train and so, no, no experience.</span> <span id="s273">The...the exper-, the...the first experience was on...was on the boat, and, uh, we sta-, I..</span> <span id="s274">.</span> <span id="s275">I knew no...no English at all.</span> <span id="s276">I hadn't had a word of English.</span> <span id="s277">Maybe some other children had studied the...the, by...by chance learned a few words, I had not...not a word of English.</span> <span id="s278">So on the boat I learned a very important song, “My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean” [chuckles].</span> <span id="s279">“My bonnie lies over the ocean, my bonnie lies over the sea,” and this is, uh, my...my first English le-, [laughs], first English lesson.</span> <span id="s280">With that...witht hat we got...we got almost to America.</span> <span id="s281">We got as far as Ellis Island, and...and, uh, with, then we...then we knew we had it made [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s282">So that you have a recollection of seeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">00:49:36 Yes.</span> <span id="s284">Oh, of course, of...of...of course, and the re-recollection with the pictures and....</span> <span id="s285">Also I s-, I s-, I sent . . .

the sign that we had arrived, and...and, uh, some newspapermen came on board and took pictures of us against the...against the Statue of Liberty, and, uh, that...that...that was it.</span> <span id="s290">I sent in...in my correspondence with my father, I sent, uh, some pic-, two pictures, I think, fr-, of me standing against, with the...with the, the accompaniment of the other children, waving f-, Ellis Island against me.</span> <span id="s291">Should I read that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Let's just pause for one quick second.</span> <span id="s293">Just one

him candy, and at parting said, “God be with you,” in reference to our situation, as you can understand.</span> <span id="s437">A few days later, Mama received a note from the Consulate with the advice that she'd, that she should a-, also ask the other citizens for consent to the extension of the affidavit.</span> <span id="s438">On the 24th, Mama sent a letter to Uncle Katz with this appeal.</span> <span id="s439">When I learned of the matter, I sent a telegram to Uncle, and am hopeful that it will ta-, be taken care of quickly.</span> <span id="s440">Okay.</span> <span

<p><span id="s472">No, but, uh, I..</span> <span id="s473">.</span> <span id="s474">I, I spent three months, uh, at least, and I have virtually no memory of what ha-, what was going on,

point, there was a tiny little detail about your childhood that I was personally interested in.</span> <span id="s479">You mention it in your memoir: learning to play violin.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Ohhh.</span> <span id="s481">[laughs] Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">01:05:48 That violin still exists.</span> <span id="s483">Jewish mothers [laughs].</span> <span

my mother, my father also [chuckles] decided I..</span> <span id="s488">.</span> <span id="s489">I, good Jewish boy has to play violin, and so they bought me a child-sized violin, half size, it's called, and started getting lessons playing violin.</span> <span id="s490">Uh, when I left Vienna alone at that time, I did not take the violin with me, but my mother, when she finally did leave Vienna, during the way already, she escaped to Italy, through Italy to America, and she did not forget the violin, and many other things of [laughs]....</span> <span id="s491">She, uh, she brought me the violin, a half, half size violin, and she f-, she del-, it was with her until she died and then, uh, I had to take it, I can't [laughs], can't throw it out [chuckles].</span> <span id="s492">But,

not practicing Jews, except for the high holy days, when my father went to pray, the Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and even I tried to fast Yom Kippur and did partially well [laughs], but, uh, and we had...we had, we held Seder, [inaudible] Seder at home also, which I..</span> <span id="s512">.</span> <span id="s513">I remember mainly for s-, falling asleep in, after drinking at least two or three glasses already on the way, uh, falling asleep, but, uh, we also, I..</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">I..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">I went to, uh, Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s518">I played hooky now and then [chuckles].</span> <span id="s519">I played hooky now and then, but I went to Hebrew school, or my parents sent me to Hebrew school to be more exacting in...in...in what the practice was.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">01:09:44 And also we...we...we took part in the Herzl parade every year.</span> <span id="s521">Theodore Herzl is, was buried in Vienna originally, before he was moved to Israel, to Jerusalem, and, uh, Herzl Day in Vienna was a Jewish holiday, or Zionist holiday [chuckles], if not for all Jews.</span> <span id="s522">And I remember going, and we...we...we paraded, bicycles with...with, uh, blue and white ribbons and...and flags and what have you, uh, very definite memory of...of the celebration of Herzl.</span> <span id="s523">Um, when...when...when I was five years old, I think, one summer we took a vacation from Vienna.</span> <span id="s524">My mother and went to a farm, a real...a real [chuckles] farm in...in...in the neighborhood of Vienna, and, uh, weekends my...my father would...would...would join us.</span> <span id="s525">We were there for a month, I think, or three weeks, and, uh,</span></p> <p><span id="s526">01:11:01 It's...it's...it's unbelievable when I, when...when you think of what farming was then and what farming is today.</span> <span id="s527">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s528">But anyhow, what I, as part of the Jewish aspect of the affair, eh, we went, my mother and I went walking one day to a store in...in the village, and I was wearing th-, th-, uh, embroidered, uh, embroidered shirt, common in the Russian community [chuckles], I don't know why...why I was wearing it, b ut anyhow, we, I, we came to the store and some nice woman, also another customer, came in and looked at my, looked at me and looked at my shirt and said, “Oh, what a nice little boy with a beautiful Russian shirt,” and I protested [chuckles], “I'm Jewish, I'm not Russian.”</span> <span id="s529">Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Kurt, I wanna ask you this question and again, apologies for asking a very, very intensely personal question, but I'm gonna ask it.</span> <span id="s531">You've read these letters that your father wrote to you as he, at the time, thought he was preparing to leave.</span> <span id="s532">You were in America.</span> <span id="s533">How and when did you find out what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">01:12:31 Well, [laughs] [pauses] I don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s535">I told you before, but [chuckles] I don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s536">And, uh, my mother d-, took about a year, three quarters of a year, she took a few months with, before she had the...the guts to tell me, and, uh, [mumbles and chuckles] I can't...I can't be a judge for her, I can't, uh, she did right, she did wrong.</span> <span id="s537">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">[logistics] Is there anything else you wanna add about learning what happened to your father?</span> <span id="s539">I know how personal and painful this is for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">[pauses]</span></p> <p><span id="s541">01:14:09 I'll tell you something, it's...it's not about a, it's not about him [laughs].</span> <span id="s542">But, uh, eh, eh, when...when my youngest son was thirteen years old, I didn't have to take him to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s543">I took him to Vienna.</span> <span id="s544">Uh, not only him, I took also then the older boy and [inaudible], the four of us went...went to Vienna to celebrate bar mitzvah in my home [chuckles], and, uh, we went to our, wh-, where we lived, and I also took them to...to the graveyard, the Jewish graveyard, big Jewish graveyard in Vienna.</span> <span id="s545">I had tried to be there once, but, uh, to my distress, I found out, I..</span> <span id="s546">.</span> <span id="s547">I went there on...on...on shabbat, I found out that graveyards are closed on shabbat.</span> <span id="s548">Jewish graveyards are closed on shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">01:15:24 So I..</span> <span id="s550">.</span> <span id="s551">I d-, and I was just going through quickly and...and the in, out, and [inaudible], I didn't have opportunity to...to enter the graveyard and find...find his grave [inaudible].</span> <span id="s552">So this was our, my...my first contact with [chuckles], with that, and my, I., my brother [inaudible] also came with us that time.</span> <span id="s553">He wanted to see his...his father.</span> <span id="s554">Uh, this was in...in, uh, 19eighty-something [inaudible], but the graveyard was still in...in, not completely, eh, not completely renewed, not completely reconstructed.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">01:16:20 Eh, the many grave, many, many stones that was broken and thrown around this place, that was also many that had been, uh, had been fixed by that time by...by the families and so on.</span> <span id="s556">And, uh, I went to, h-, had no idea where the...the, that was an office [inaudible], this woman came out to...to...to see us, uh, what are you looking for, and I told him, looking for my father, who was buried, you know the date, I said, no, I don't know the date.</span> <span id="s557">I did not know the date.</span> <span id="s558">I know the approximate date.</span> <span id="s559">Do you know his, uh, when he was born?</span> <span id="s560">Yes, uh, [chuckles] have a story about when he was born also, by the way, but, uh, and...and...and, uh, the...the, where the, where...where he was living, uh, his...his resent-, residential [laughs] address, not where he was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">01:17:31 Eh, he, uh, he was killed, fortunately for all of us, very quickly, and, uh, my mother got, uh, the ashes, container of ashes, no...no...no body.</span> <span id="s562">You don't...you don't send bodies that you don't want examined [laughs].</span> <span id="s563">And she buried, she and...and...and the, my...my [laughs] big, my big brother buried him, and they put up a temporary st-, temporary marker.</span> <span id="s564">And the woman went out, and as, faster than you can say Jack Robinson, she was back with a slip of paper giving me the exact...exact location of where he was buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">01:18:30 So y-, y-, you...you...you can...you can...you can destroy the graveyard, you can destroy it, anything, you can kill people, but you keep order [chuckles].</span> <span id="s566">That's my...that's my, my tale of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Let's just sort of wrap up your tale.</span> <span id="s568">I'm certainly familiar with the fact that the kids spent that summer at the summer camp in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s569">Do you have any particular memories or recollections or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">From camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">From camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">No, not, uh, f-, [mumbles], not, eh, I..</span> <span id="s573">.</span> <span id="s574">I remember the...the, uh, the...the, um, uh, the camp, uh, the camp guy, what do you call 'em?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Like a counselor?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Counselor.</span> <span id="s577">Forgot...forgot [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s578">01:19:41 Uh, the camp counselor, I remember, who insisted that he was an Indian, and, uh, ninety-nine percent of the time walked around with a towel around his, uh, around his waist.</span> <span id="s579">That's, that was his official [chuckles], official, because he was an Indian, so that was his his dress.</span> <span id="s580">I remember that.</span> <span id="s581">Uh, I remember learning new food.</span> <span id="s582">Grapefruit, grapefruit we did not know in Vienna.</span> <span id="s583">I at least had never seen, never known, uh, grapefruit.</span> <span id="s584">Uh, sweet potato, celery.</span> <span id="s585">But, uh, then I had, uh, uh, I..</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">I h-, I had a difficult period in camp, when, uh, people started, when...when the children started moving out.</span> <span id="s588">We...we came in June, beginning of June, and we...we were there all of June, July, August…</span></p> <p><span id="s589">01:20:48 And as time was going on, uh, one leaves and two leave, then another leaves and another leaves, and I'm s-, not the only one [inaudible] still, um, but, uh, but, uh, and I was getting worried.</span> <span id="s590">[laughs] Bec-, well, I had, I..</span> <span id="s591">.</span> <span id="s592">I..</span> <span id="s593">.</span> <span id="s594">I..</span> <span id="s595">.</span> <span id="s596">I knew by this time that my father was not getting, I didn't know he was dead, I didn't, but I knew he was not getting here, and, um, I knew that my aunt could not take me, uh, economically, physically [laughs], uh, she couldn't take care of me, and so I was wondering wha-, w-, [laughs] where...where...where...where am I gonna spend my life, and, uh, took, I don't know, took some time.</span> <span id="s597">And then fi-, fi-, finally there was a solution [laughs].</span> <span id="s598">Obviously, uh, here I am.</span> <span id="s599">But, uh, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s600">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s601">As I said, I don't ask questions [chuckles].</span> <span id="s602">That...that...that...that, uh, well, I must, [mumbles] you're pushing me [laughs] into [laughs]....</span></p> <p><span id="s603">I am pushing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">01:22:19 Em, and then I was, eh, I don't, I..</span> <span id="s605">.</span> <span id="s606">I, uh, I don't remember exactly where, another, a family, if...if...if...if a family came to pick me up [chuckles] or if I was sent, halfway station or three quarter station, I don't re-, I don't remember, but anyhow, somebody...somebody came to save my life, and, uh, very nice people.</span> <span id="s607">I..</span> <span id="s608">.</span> <span id="s609">I..</span> <span id="s610">.</span> <span id="s611">I..</span> <span id="s612">.</span> <span id="s613">I..</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">I th-, tr-, trepidation [laughs], really, eh, well...well, uh, from Albany, New York, eh, well doing, well...well, uh, economically

id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">I re-, one of the th-, one of the few things that I can tell you is I..</span> <span id="s618">.</span> <span id="s619">I was st-, I kept, I was fascinated that, uh, uh, th-, the driver was always fiddling with a stick on the floor, and God knows what is he doing with [laughs], move the stick here, move the stick there, eh [chuckles], and so th-, they had a car, and then the wife also drove it, and she's, keeps on with the stick all the time, I don't know what's goin' on and [laughs]....</span> <span id="s620">Anyway, eh, I had a nice room.</span> <span id="s621">They had a small daughter, younger than I, uh, and...and...and…</span></p> <p><span id="s622">01:24:14 Beyond that, the only concrete memory I can give you is that I went to, by myself, on a Saturday during the winter, we ha-, we, I..</span> <span id="s623">.</span> <span id="s624">I came there sometime end of August, the beginning of September, and I left there, eh, December.</span> <span id="s625">Eh, the only thing I can...I can re-, definitely re-, recall is that one day when it was raining out, I didn't know, didn't...didn't, not the rain was, what, eh, on a Saturday

understand, bec-, I came in in the middle, and...and the vague se-, I..</span> <span id="s628">.</span> <span id="s629">I have e-, had enough vague understandings of what was going on that in the end, years later, I..</span> <span id="s630">.</span> <span id="s631">I identified the film.</span> <span id="s632">Three Feathers, if you've ever heard of it.</span> <span id="s633">It was a known, well known film at the time about, uh, uh, an Engl-, English, uh, noble who has to prove himself as a brave man and...and goes to, uh, Egypt and...and...and Sudan and fights with, uh, Kitchener and, eh [chuckles]....</span></p> <p><span id="s634">01:25:33 That, and...and then's break, in the break was a short, the chapter in the...in the life of Dick Tracy, which I had no idea [chuckles], but I re-, I remember, I remembered I didn't understand it too well, but the end was...was th-, th-, th-, the, uh, the...the...the, uh, crooks were shooting at him through a door.</span> <span id="s635">He was...he was...he was tied to a chair like this, [inaudible] under the door, and the police...the police were shooting at him because they're trying to break down the door, and that was the end of the chapter, and, uh, didn't [laughs]....</span> <span id="s636">But I saw in the newspapers [laughs] the next week they still had Dick Tracy, so [chuckles] that's when I found out what I saw, I didn't, I had no idea really [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s637">01:26:26 Eh, one fine day, w-, on a weekend, uh, in...in...in, uh, December, I also ca-, 'cause we had gone, I had gone, uh, weekend day, we had gone out or something and I came in, they said, uh, that we have people here to see you, introduced me to another Jewish family, and said, “We're sorry, but we have to let you go.</span> <span id="s638">What do you think about it?”</span> <span id="s639">And I said, “I'll go,” you know, and...and...and, uh, feel very sorry for them, I feel v-, I feel a bit sorry for myself, too, it was a

id="s675">One is you were telling me before the break about your mother, and I am interested in you just basically, fairly briefly, telling me the story of your being reunited with your mother once she and your younger brother were here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">01:31:46 [sighs] Eh, my mother's a very [clears throat], my mother was a very strong woman.</span> <span id="s677">Eh, [mumbles] she...she got into a, a little...a little two by four, not...not even two by four, and...and...and that's what she had, and...and, uh, but...but she...she was determined.</span> <span id="s678">And she...she [mumbles] fell in love with her sister-in-law [laughs] and...and...and [inaudible], it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s679">That...that...that...that part was wonderful.</span> <span id="s680">And...and she went out to work, and started making money, and...and she rented a place for herself [mumbles], and she said to me, “What...what...what...what...what do I do with you?</span> <span id="s681">You've got a wonderful place.</span> <span id="s682">You're living with wonderful people who can, who want to and can give

'em.</span> <span id="s691">But, um, but, eh, the brother and...and the, fortunately, from...from, uh, my standpoint, my personal standpoint, eh, I was sent back from...from...from, uh, from Israel in, uh, 1951 to work in New York with youth groups, and that gave me, uh, opportunity to...to, I was...I was...I was in Brooklyn also, ma-, s-, s-, God knows [laughs] where, I was in Brooklyn, in...in...in [inaudible] Park, if you know, you know Brooklyn, know Brooklyn, [inaudible] Park, and, uh, it was easy, so I..</span> <span id="s692">.</span> <span id="s693">I..</span> <span

First thing I did was put my brother into a youth group [chuckles], and, uh, th-,.</span> <span id="s696">th-, that period really f-, formed our relationship [mumbles], bo-, on both sides, [mumbles] because before that I, big brother [mumbles], kids, two years older, three years older, brother [inaudible].</span> <span id="s697">Anyhow, that...that...that formed the relationship, eh, to the point where he even came [inaudible] afterwards, and he spent about a year or year and a half here in our...in our kibbutz, and felt that that was not what he was [laughs], wanted to do in life, so he left.</span> <span id="s698">In the end he left, and it was difficult, eh, the...the later years were much easier, the w-, world got smaller, and people move around, and...and even in Israel people move [chuckles], eve-, even in the kibbutz in Israel [chuckles], people move around, and...and...and...and then I left, uh, not too, not...not, well [inaudible].</span> <span id="s699">Anyhow, I..</span> <span id="s700">.</span> <span id="s701">I..</span> <span id="s702">.</span> <span id="s703">I [mumbles], we left, I went to, I..</span> <span id="s704">.</span> <span id="s705">I was
