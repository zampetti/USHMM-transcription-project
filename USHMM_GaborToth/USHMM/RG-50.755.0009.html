Wenkart: Alright.</span> <span id="s6">My name is Henny Wenkart and, uh -- Interviewer: How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Henny Wenkart: W-E-N-K-A-R-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Interviewer: And Henny you spell?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Henny Wenkart: H-E- -- I spell it H-E-N-N-Y.</span> <span id="s10">Sometimes people spell it H-E-N-I.</span> <span id="s11">My father spelled it six different ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Interviewer: That's why we ask.</span> <span id="s13">And never look at me.</span> <span id="s14">I'm not here and the camera is not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">00.01.49 Henny Wenkart: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Interviewer: Okay, here we go.</span> <span id="s17">We're going to do a little bit chronologically, so I'm going to start back in time some ways, well before you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s18">I'm hoping you can start by just describing some of your earliest childhood memories of your life in Vienna as a young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">00.02.18 Henny Wenkart: Well I was born in Vienna in 1928.</span> <span id="s20">And, uh, my father was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s21">Uh, he, uh, he was a regular, you know, had a mixed practice, but not a criminal practice.</span> <span id="s22">He, in fact, uh, I remember when I was very small and the client called him at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">00.02.48 And I remember him saying, "Well, you know we're going to have to plead guilty.</span> <span id="s24">We did do it."</span> <span id="s25">And, uh, then he would be listening and then he said, I can remember, he said, "I'll get you a criminal lawyer."</span> <span id="s26">So this was not -- he was just a regular business and family practice lawyer, but he did well.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">00.03.15 And his office was in a place called the [K-K Palais], which was right on the Franz Josefs Kai.</span> <span id="s28">A very nice building.</span> <span id="s29">I used to play hooky there from nursery school.</span> <span id="s30">[Laughs] He was supposed to take me to nursery school and I cried and cried and cried and so he didn’t want to leave me there, uh, so he took me to the office and he let me type.</span> <span id="s31">And I would type and he would try to read what I had typed.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">00.03.47 And he was mostly [unintelligible] and he would turn red.</span> <span id="s33">When he laughed he, he always turned red.</span> <span id="s34">And, uh, he really had a lot of fun when I came to the office with him.</span> <span id="s35">But one time, uh, I went to this -- he took me to this nursery school.</span> <span id="s36">It was a small nursery school run by some nuns.</span> <span id="s37">And, uh, I was crying and she said to him, uh, "You know she stops crying as soon as you leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">00.04.22 Why don't you listen at the door and you'll see that I'm right."</span> <span id="s39">And what she did is she took me, uh, onto the sofa and said, "Now we're going to watch this second hand go round and round five times and then when it's done five times then you can go and join your dad."</span> <span id="s40">And he waited three minutes and left.</span> <span id="s41">And after the five minutes we went to the door and he was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">00.04.54 And I cried the rest of the morning and I never had to go there again.</span> <span id="s43">He was furious with her for, for, for lying to me like that and he never -- I never had to go there again.</span> <span id="s44">So he, uh -- and, and people said that he spoiled me, but, uh, clearly he didn't because I'm not spoiled.</span> <span id="s45">[Laughs] I came out alright.</span> <span id="s46">He trusted me.</span> <span id="s47">He believed in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">00.05.22 He treated me like a person and that was a terribly important thing.</span> <span id="s49">And, in fact, uh, I knew you were coming this morning and, uh, uh, I dreamed just before I woke up that my father was cleaning up this room and that he stuck all the stuff that's lying around under the carpet.</span> <span id="s50">[Laughs] 00.05.50 You have to realize my father died 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s51">[Laughs] But, uh, but that's the sort of father he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Interviewer: Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Henny Wenkart: My mother, uh, had a different story.</span> <span id="s54">See, my father came to Vienna from one of the provinces, which is now called Poland, but at that time it was Galicia and it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">00.06.19 And he came when he was six-years-old.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, he was 12 years older than my mother, so he grew up in the, in the peaceful Vienna still under the Emperor Franz Josef, who was called The Old Gentleman.</span> <span id="s57">And, uh, he -- you know, we went out to the Vienna woods.</span> <span id="s58">He took his baby brother there and so on.</span> <span id="s59">My mother came during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">00.06.46 She was 11-years-old and she -- actually she lived in a community, Hasidic community, uh, you know, [Tenya] and there came a day when the Rabbi said, uh, "The Cossacks are coming.</span> <span id="s61">We're all going to Vienna."</span> <span id="s62">And they would pack up what they could in wagons and went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s63">Now I don't know who pulled those wagons, maybe the men.</span> <span id="s64">Anyway, my grandfather got bored and went back to protect his store.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">00.07.18 And the Cossacks caught up with him and beat him within an inch of his life and we never -- they never saw him again until the war was over because he was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s66">They didn't know what had happened to him.</span> <span id="s67">And my mother had gone to Vienna with the community and she and her sister and two brothers and her mother lived in one room.</span> <span id="s68">And they were poor and the boys went to work, the girls went to school.</span> <span id="s69">But I'm sure she must have had an accent and must have -- the kids must have made fun of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">00.07.49 She never said that, but it's clear that it must have happened.</span> <span id="s71">She was 11-years-old, which was just the age that I was when I came to this country.</span> <span id="s72">And in a sense, she couldn't go through it all again.</span> <span id="s73">She had made it.</span> <span id="s74">She had married, uh, a lawyer and was a lawyer's wife and she, she, you know, she, she went to French clubs and, and, uh, English clubs and the opera and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">00.08.17 And really, you know, had a good life for just a few years.</span> <span id="s76">And, uh, it was very difficult to give all that up.</span> <span id="s77">I was an only child.</span> <span id="s78">I had a sister who was born when I was nine, but by that time you're pretty much grown up.</span> <span id="s79">I was an only child.</span> <span id="s80">And, uh, and my personality must have been more like her sister's I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">00.08.47 She was her mother's favorite, but I think her sister must have been her father's favorite because she was very sprightly and she danced and she played the piano and she did things.</span> <span id="s82">And, and I think that my mother, who didn’t know anything about Freud, uh, sometimes said, "You know in my dreams you and Marie are the same person."</span> <span id="s83">How do you like that?</span> <span id="s84">She, uh, she loved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">00.09.19 I mean we loved each other, but it was not the same sort of -- she didn't spoil me.</span> <span id="s86">My daddy didn't spoil me, but people said he did.</span> <span id="s87">Uh, and so -- and, you know, we would go to the Vienna woods every Sunday and it was my job to make sure we got home at 12:00.</span> <span id="s88">Mother came if we were going with friends, but not if it was just daddy and me.</span> <span id="s89">Then it was just Daddy and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">00.09.47 And we spoke in whispers in the woods.</span> <span id="s91">Uh, and you know we hiked for two or three hours of a Sunday morning from the time I was two-years-old.</span> <span id="s92">And Vienna was very beautiful, really beautiful.</span> <span id="s93">And, uh, and Daddy loved it and so, you know, I came to love it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">00.10.16 And, uh, so, I mean, I had friends.</span> <span id="s95">Mostly you went to school in the morning and then in the afternoon, uh, my mother and I would meet one of her friends who had a child or children in some park; one of the many wonderful parks.</span> <span id="s96">And, you know, I would play with the child and she would sit and embroider with the children.</span> <span id="s97">Actually, you know what I found recently is a pillow which my mother cross-stitched and I have it on my bed now.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">00.10.51 But this is the sort of work that she did in the park.</span> <span id="s99">And the other woman would also do that and so, you know.</span> <span id="s100">And in the summer we went away.</span> <span id="s101">Uh, we never spent the summer in the City.</span> <span id="s102">Uh, July, my father would take July off and we would go a little bit further away.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">00.11.17 Although we never went to the Riviera or anyway I never saw the ocean until I was on a ship in the middle of it.</span> <span id="s104">Uh, I was too young.</span> <span id="s105">We were going to do that after I was 10.</span> <span id="s106">Uh, so we, we went to the Austrian Alps to [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s107">Uh, we went to the [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s108">We went, we went a couple of times to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">00.11.48 And then in August, uh, we went to this one place, uh, in [unintelligible] in [unintelligible] and, uh, daddy went back to work.</span> <span id="s110">But he came out Friday afternoon on the early train.</span> <span id="s111">He was the earliest father to come on Friday afternoon and he didn't leave until Monday morning.</span> <span id="s112">And I would hear my parents whispering and then he would leave and I would go back to sleep because I didn't want to wake up into a morning where he wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">00.12.23 But I would hear the kids walking on the gravel outside and then eventually I, I did get up.</span> <span id="s114">Uh, but, uh, you could hear the train whistling into the tunnels, first far away and then closer and they would go rattling.</span> <span id="s115">Eventually you heard the rattle of the, the rattle of the wheels.</span> <span id="s116">But the, the trains sound different in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">00.12.53 They don't have that hoarse voice that, that they have here, uh, with us.</span> <span id="s118">Uh, in Europe, at least at that time in Austria, the train whistle was [imitating train whistle], which is very cheerful; into the tunnel and out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s119">And so those were really wonderful times in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">00.13.21 Uh, school I didn't like so much, uh, because, uh, I went to public school and, uh, most kids of my class went to private schools.</span> <span id="s121">I only went to public school for four years and then I went to the [Phonix-Gymnasium], which is an eight-year.</span> <span id="s122">It starts with the fifth grade and goes through twelve.</span> <span id="s123">Uh, but, uh, but I quit school under the Nazis because Jewish kids didn't have to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">00.13.52 And daddy moved his practice home because he was afraid that the K-K Palais was too conspicuous and that sooner or later they would arrest everybody there so he brought his practice home.</span> <span id="s125">And if daddy was going to be home all day I was not about to go to school, so I said, I said that I was afraid to go to school because kids threw rocks at us, uh, on our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">00.14.21 And, uh, and my parents weren't that keen on having me go to school anyway because they were worried.</span> <span id="s127">And anyway, the piano teacher, the English teacher and the Hebrew teacher came to the house anyhow, so I had lessons every day.</span> <span id="s128">And then I had a couple of books, a biology book and a geography book, that I picked up somewhere that I promised to study every day.</span> <span id="s129">[Laughs] And with one thing and another I quit school at the age of 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">00.14.53 And -- well, you know.</span> <span id="s131">[Laughs].</span> <span id="s132">Most kids would do it.</span> <span id="s133">But the thing is that, you know, that I was very bored in school and for that reason, when we had children of our own, uh, I insisted on putting them in private school where they would not be bored.</span> <span id="s134">And for one thing, until the fourth grade they came home at noon and had the whole afternoon free to do what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">00.15.24 Uh, because I think that it's very bad to be bored as a child in school.</span> <span id="s136">I picked up all sorts of habits just to slow myself down.</span> <span id="s137">I would group -- when I was reading I would group sentences into groups of five and three words and I would group the words into groups of five and three letters.</span> <span id="s138">That's a very bad habit.</span> <span id="s139">[Laughs] 00.15.55 But it comes from being bored in school and trying to slow yourself down so you don't go nuts waiting for everybody else to catch up.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Interviewer: Some of what you've been talking about pretty much anticipated where I wanted to lead you next.</span> <span id="s141">That is, when you first, as a young girl, became aware of what it meant to be Jewish in Vienna in the 1930s.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">00.16.23 Henny Wenkart: Uh, well for us it meant, uh, going to synagogue on Saturday.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, and, uh, and also for Sukkos and [Simchat Torah] going to the building where the community, the Hasidic community my mother grew up in still lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">00.16.50 They had a huge Sukkot and they served holishkes, which is stuffed cabbage.</span> <span id="s145">And, uh, and then Simchat Torah, you went up into the Rabbi's apartment, tiny place, and the women were in the bedroom and there was a door with an arch and the men were dancing around the table with the Torahs and we were singing and clapping with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">00.17.19 And, you know, so that was, that was the big [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s147">And for Seders, well, uh, so long as the grandparents were alive you went to their house, of course.</span> <span id="s148">For one -- one family for the first Seder, the other family for the second Seder and that's what we do still here.</span> <span id="s149">Uh, but I remember when I was six I could read German, but I couldn't read Hebrew yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">00.17.54 And I was -- up until then my uncle, my baby uncle, my youngest uncle, had always asked the four questions because he was the youngest at the table.</span> <span id="s151">But by the time I was six it was deemed that I could now ask the four questions.</span> <span id="s152">And they had transliterated them for me on a piece of paper and put it in my Haggadah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">00.18.18 But they said, uh, under no circumstances was I to let my grandfather see inside my Haggadah.</span> <span id="s154">And I thought, "Well, why would he want to get up from his seat at the head of the table and look in my Haggadah?</span> <span id="s155">That's ridiculous."</span> <span id="s156">But I did promise and that was one -- one of the terrible things was that I always kept promises and sometimes I made promises that would have been much better if I'd broken.</span> <span id="s157">But in any case, uh, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">00.18.47 I started asking the question and he did come and try to look over my shoulder and I held the book up to my chest because I wasn't supposed to let him see.</span> <span id="s159">[Laughs] Well how did I ask it after that?</span> <span id="s160">I must have memorized it.</span> <span id="s161">I must have actually known them.</span> <span id="s162">That actually never occurred to me until just now.</span> <span id="s163">And then after the meal I had to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s164">It was so awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">00.19.15 If they put you to bed somewhere in another room and then they wake you up in the middle of the night when the Seder is over and you have to walk.</span> <span id="s166">And it's, you know, it's terrible to be awakened and have to walk.</span> <span id="s167">So, so that was one of the things.</span> <span id="s168">The other, I do remember that even then, uh, going to synagogue on the high holy days people would have their masa wrapped in a newspaper, even then before the, before the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">00.19.53 I won't say before the Nazis because the Austrians were mostly Nazis, uh, and they were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s170">And I remember one time, uh, one of my classmates, [Maria Salinger] who was actually the, the, uh, daughter of the, uh, janitor in my building, and, uh, we were lining up and she said, "Go away.</span> <span id="s171">Uh, you're a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">00.20.23 You don't belong with us Christians."</span> <span id="s173">Uh, and I came home crying and I said, "We have to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s174">We have to move to Israel.</span> <span id="s175">Things like this won't happen there."</span> <span id="s176">Uh, well they wouldn’t have -- there were five or six Jewish girls in my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Interviewer: And what are your vivid memories of the Anschluss?</span> <span id="s178">At that point you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">00.20.54 Henny Wenkart: 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Interviewer: You were 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Henny Wenkart: 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Interviewer: Just coming up on 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Henny Wenkart: Not quite 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Interviewer: Not quite 10 in March of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Henny Wenkart: March 13, 1938.</span> <span id="s186">And I was born in July, so I was not quite 10.</span> <span id="s187">That's right.</span> <span id="s188">And my sister was a baby.</span> <span id="s189">She was crawling, not walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">00.21.16 Oh, well I remember that, uh, I was in bed, but I listened to the radio and, uh, Schuschnigg who was the Chancellor at that time, uh, made an address, uh, on the radio, which I heard.</span> <span id="s191">And, uh, he said that, uh, the Germans were ready to [annex] Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">00.21.52 That he had called London, Paris, Washington for help, uh, Rome.</span> <span id="s193">No one was willing to help us and that he was not about to spill Austrian blood in a futile attempt to fight off the Germans.</span> <span id="s194">The Germans were coming.</span> <span id="s195">And, in fact, there was somebody outside the studio ready to take him away as soon as he finished speaking, he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">00.22.26 And then they played the national anthem again for the last time and that was the end of the broadcast.</span> <span id="s197">So. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Interviewer: As of that moment, Henny, March of 1938, things obviously changed much more quickly for yours and other Jewish families in Vienna then they had been changing from '33 until that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">00.23.03 Henny Wenkart: Well I didn't know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Interviewer: What do you remember about your family beginning to discuss plans for one or all of you to leave Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Henny Wenkart: That was that same day.</span> <span id="s202">That was that same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">00.23.28 Uh, daddy took me out to a park away from bushes and away from hidden mics and so on, uh, and explained to me, you know, that -- about the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s204">And I said well I knew that.</span> <span id="s205">He said, "Well this morning, uh, at four o'clock this morning I was at the American Consulate to get a low number for, you know, so we can get a visa to go to America."</span> <span id="s206">00.24.00 And that was impressive because nobody is up at four in the morning.</span> <span id="s207">Just milk wagons, you know, with their horses.</span> <span id="s208">Uh, that he was actually somewhere else at four o'clock in the morning to get this number, that, that was impressive.</span> <span id="s209">Uh, he said, "And also," he said, "I give you my word of honor that we will be all right."</span> <span id="s210">And his word of honor, you know, was bankable.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">00.24.30 And obviously, if he said that that was it.</span> <span id="s212">And, you know, because I trusted him, I mean I chose to go.</span> <span id="s213">If you build up trust and never misuse it, there comes a time when you can actually, you know, build on it when, when it really is -- how could he know we would be all right?</span> <span id="s214">He didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">00.24.57 But he wanted me -- and he knew that I would believe it if he said it.</span> <span id="s216">And, uh, do I think it's better to lie to children in that way?</span> <span id="s217">Yes.</span> <span id="s218">I am very much against children being told about the Nazi time and the murder of people in concentration camps and so on; very much against that, until they're about 16 or 17-years-old.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">00.25.27 It gives -- I feel it gives the Nazis the victory to spoil, uh, to spoil the lives of children now by burdening them with, with those, those thoughts and those facts.</span> <span id="s220">What good does it do?</span> <span id="s221">What good does it do?</span> <span id="s222">I mean, never again doesn't work.</span> <span id="s223">You know, and we're sitting still right now and those same things are being done in other parts of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">00.25.57 We're not doing anything about it.</span> <span id="s225">And learning about what the Nazis did does not help to make people do anything about it.</span> <span id="s226">It just -- people -- it doesn't work that way.</span> <span id="s227">And a child who has had a happy childhood, uh, is much more likely, I think, to fight back to that place.</span> <span id="s228">Uh, my sister grew up; uh, we were refugees, we were poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">00.26.28 She had a completely different childhood from mine.</span> <span id="s230">You know, I was a lucky child.</span> <span id="s231">I was lonely because I was an only child, uh, but I had friends, I had cousins.</span> <span id="s232">I'm in touch with all of them wherever they went.</span> <span id="s233">Uh, one friend just died in Barcelona, uh, and his brother wrote to me that he is devastated.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">00.26.59 And I wrote back to him, "Well I remember your brother was my age and I remember how happy he was to have a little brother.</span> <span id="s235">I was an only child," and so on.</span> <span id="s236">Yeah, I mean, I didn't see these people for 50 years, so it's that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Interviewer: Between March 1938 and when you left Vienna in May of 1939, 14 months, what are your memories of your family?</span> <span id="s238">How you functioned as a family?</span> <span id="s239">It sounds as if your father continued to assure you that everything was going to be all right.</span> <span id="s240">Outside your doors things were turning very ugly very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">00.27.51 Henny Wenkart: Well, actually not outside our doors because we had moved to the ninth district.</span> <span id="s242">We were not in the second district where the sort of ghetto was.</span> <span id="s243">Uh, and, in fact, on the 10th of November people came from there to hide with us.</span> <span id="s244">Whereas, my father, uh, went to the [Vandoores], to these same Hungarian Jews who wound up in Barcelona because they were Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">00.28.23 And they did, in fact, hide him, but they wouldn't let him use the phone because they figured that was bugged.</span> <span id="s246">And while he was in a phone booth calling home, uh, the Nazis came and arrested everybody in the building, but they let the [Vandoores] go because they had Hungarian papers.</span> <span id="s247">Uh, but had he not been at the phone booth he would have gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">00.28.47 My Uncle [Leo], my mother's brother Leo, who was sort of the one who took care of the family, uh, he, uh, was taken away to Dachau and from there to Buchenwald where he died.</span> <span id="s249">And my Uncle [Ignatz], who used to be called Nazi and then we had to start calling him Igo, uh, he was arrested and beaten up, but he was let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">00.29.21 And he, uh, well he -- his story was that he had torn his shirt and scratched his face and sort of went to sit with the people who had already been taken away and beaten up.</span> <span id="s251">And he, he, he -- at least his story was that he had avoided that particular beating.</span> <span id="s252">And my Aunt Marie on her way over, uh, in her fur coat had been stopped and made to, uh, clean the sidewalk with a toothbrush.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">00.29.59 Uh, well, there was going to be an election, a yes or no election, and that was called off.</span> <span id="s254">And the things that people were cleaning off with the toothbrushes were, uh, where it said no; people voting against becoming part of Germany.</span> <span id="s255">And I remember my grandfather coming over and saying, "Yes, but there is going to be another election."</span> <span id="s256">00.30.26 And my father saying, "Oh sure, but you and I won't be voting in it."</span> <span id="s257">And that happened.</span> <span id="s258">There was another referendum, which was yes, but made no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Interviewer: The opportunity to come to America, it sounds as if your father, as you said, had explored that and had gone at 4:00 a.m. to get an early number.</span> <span id="s260">So in other words, the entire family, you, your younger sister and both your parents were looking for that early opportunity to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">00.31.10 Henny Wenkart: Oh, immediately yes, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Interviewer: And instead, you ended up -- Henny Wenkart: Well nobody -- in Vienna it wasn’t the case that some people were wondering whether or not to leave.</span> <span id="s263">Whoever could leave did.</span> <span id="s264">Uh, my pediatrician left by jumping out the window and killing himself.</span> <span id="s265">People who had no opportunity; had no way of getting papers to go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">00.31.44 What people don't understand is at the beginning you could get out.</span> <span id="s267">Everybody could get out.</span> <span id="s268">You couldn't take your stuff with you, but you could get out.</span> <span id="s269">You just -- nobody would let us in.</span> <span id="s270">Everyone could have been saved, everyone, but the doors were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">00.32.12 You know, it wasn't up to this one, it wasn't up to that one and it wasn't up to me.</span> <span id="s272">And in the end it wasn't up to anybody and people got murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Interviewer: Do you remember how your parents learned of the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Henny Wenkart: No, uh, I don't.</span> <span id="s275">I have no idea how they found out about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">00.32.42 Uh, I mean obviously, we were in touch with the [unintelligible], which is the cultural center of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s277">And, uh, they were notified somehow.</span> <span id="s278">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s279">I know we went there and were interviewed.</span> <span id="s280">And now what I recall for sure was that I was told that I had to make the decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">00.33.16 It was my decision to make.</span> <span id="s282">They would take me, but, uh, my parents were warned not to influence me.</span> <span id="s283">And I know that.</span> <span id="s284">I remember that very strongly.</span> <span id="s285">I said, "Can I take my little sister with me?"</span> <span id="s286">My parents were horrified to hear me say that because they were afraid that that would scotch the whole thing.</span> <span id="s287">But whoever was talking to me said, "No, we're not taking any babies."</span> <span id="s288">00.33.44 "Oh, but I can take complete care of her and she's almost out of diapers," you know, that.</span> <span id="s289">But, "No, but if you would like to come we'd be happy to have you."</span> <span id="s290">And so I went to bed.</span> <span id="s291">I wouldn't eat and I couldn't sleep and, you know.</span> <span id="s292">And I heard my parents sort of whispering to visitors saying, "Oh, it's so terrible.</span> <span id="s293">She, she has this terrible decision to make and she hasn't been able to eat or sleep the whole week."</span> <span id="s294">00.34.19 And I was so ashamed because it was a little bit like when my parents came home from the opera or somewhere pretending I was asleep when I actually wasn't.</span> <span id="s295">I couldn't get to sleep until they came home.</span> <span id="s296">But it wasn't like that because it was much more important.</span> <span id="s297">Uh, the shame was that the minute I knew that I could go, I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">00.34.51 I was leaving my parents and my sister in danger of their lives and I was saving my own skin.</span> <span id="s299">And I knew that.</span> <span id="s300">I knew I was going to do that.</span> <span id="s301">And I was just deeply ashamed of that.</span> <span id="s302">At the same time, of course, I knew they wanted me to go.</span> <span id="s303">If they didn't want me to go, they wouldn't have taken me there in the first place.</span> <span id="s304">They were trying to save me.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">00.35.19 And I was told that if I took this affidavit from this group then their own affidavits would be strengthened because they would only have to be for three people, not four.</span> <span id="s306">And they were more likely to get out.</span> <span id="s307">But that was hogwash.</span> <span id="s308">I knew that hogwash.</span> <span id="s309">It was true, but it was hogwash anyway.</span> <span id="s310">That wasn't the reason I was doing it.</span> <span id="s311">I knew that.</span> <span id="s312">I knew I was doing it to save my own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">00.35.50 I remember, you know, all the trains leaving Vienna in every direction and I wasn't on them.</span> <span id="s314">When my cousin Edith left I screamed so much when her train pulled out that they never took me to the train station again because they were afraid that something was going to happen, so, you know.</span> <span id="s315">And I'm sorry, but I don't think it can be the case that all the children were given this condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">00.36.24 Because I know personally at least two who were too young to have made such a decision.</span> <span id="s317">They were five-years-old and I was nine, 10, whatever.</span> <span id="s318">I mean, yeah, I could, but if they couldn't, why was I made to?</span> <span id="s319">I have never been able to understand that.</span> <span id="s320">Because it destroyed me and it was so unnecessary.</span> <span id="s321">Why do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Interviewer: You left in May of 1939.</span> <span id="s323">Your parents were still waiting to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">00.37.15 Henny Wenkart: My parents came the day the war broke out, which was September 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Interviewer: But when you left in May as a 10-year-old girl, of course you did not know that they were going to leave a few months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Henny Wenkart: I thought they would because I knew their papers were strong and their number was coming up, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Interviewer: This may sound like a silly question, but I'll ask it.</span> <span id="s328">What did you leave Vienna with physically when you got on that train with the other children?</span> <span id="s329">What did you have with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">00.37.56 Henny Wenkart: I didn't have my dolls, uh, although I know where they are now.</span> <span id="s331">Uh, they -- I didn't, I didn't -- I just had clothes.</span> <span id="s332">I had my prayer book, which was sort of a pet.</span> <span id="s333">I forget its name, but it had a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">00.38.22 Uh, and, uh, and $6.75.</span> <span id="s335">Everybody was allowed $10.00, but, uh, my father thought that was an awful lot of money for a child.</span> <span id="s336">[Laughs] So I only had $10.75.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Interviewer: Not much.</span> <span id="s338">Not much to come to America with.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">00.38.56 Henny Wenkart: Well there was nothing -- where was I going to buy anything anyhow?</span> <span id="s340">There was nothing you could buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Interviewer: You didn't know any of the children in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Henny Wenkart: Yes, I did know one boy.</span> <span id="s343">[Quint] something.</span> <span id="s344">I don't -- I knew him vaguely.</span> <span id="s345">I had met him once or twice because he was an acquaintance of an acquaintance and so -- but we had not actually -- he wasn’t somebody I knew well.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Interviewer: I want to move into the journey from Vienna and landing in the United States some weeks later.</span> <span id="s347">I know that there were a couple of stages to that journey; one from Vienna to Berlin and then to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">00.39.52 Henny Wenkart: We stayed overnight in Berlin at the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s349">And there was a young man who played the banjo and taught us songs.</span> <span id="s350">And I've always wondered what became of that young man because he must have done that for lots of people, kids moving through there.</span> <span id="s351">And I wonder whether he got out.</span> <span id="s352">But I didn't know his name, so there was no way of finding out.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">00.40.20 And he taught us some new songs.</span> <span id="s354">Uh, I know he taught us Hinei Lo Yanum.</span> <span id="s355">Do you know that?</span> <span id="s356">It's just very simple.</span> <span id="s357">Uh, uh, it basically means that the protector of Israel does not sleep or slumber.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">00.40.48 And it's, uh, "Hinei lo yanum; hinei lo yishan; hinei lo yanum; hinei lo yishan.</span> <span id="s359">Hinei lo yanum v'lo yishan.</span> <span id="s360">Shomeir, shomeir Yisra'el."</span> <span id="s361">But he had a lovely voice and he played the banjo and it was nice.</span> <span id="s362">After dinner we went to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">00.41.18 In the morning we, uh, were sitting at, uh, these [unintelligible] tables.</span> <span id="s364">There were 50 of us, you know, and they had a few tables on sawhorses and having something to eat.</span> <span id="s365">And the [Krauses] came by, either to check on us or because they had to take us to the consulate to get our individual visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">00.41.48 I have my passport, by the way; my, my identification papers and all that.</span> <span id="s367">Uh, and I ran up to them and I said, "Here, there's some room here at our table."</span> <span id="s368">And, uh, Mrs. [Krause] said, "Oh that's so nice of you dear, but you know we ate at the hotel."</span> <span id="s369">And I said, "You are staying in a hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">00.42.17 We're traveling together and you're staying at a hotel and we're staying like this?"</span> <span id="s371">[Laughs] I'm not sure that she figured out what I actually meant.</span> <span id="s372">Uh, but I hadn't, I hadn't become aware yet that I was a refugee now.</span> <span id="s373">I was not the lawyer's daughter from Vienna anymore.</span> <span id="s374">I was a refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Interviewer: I should back up a second because I also meant to ask you what your first recollections were of the Krauses.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">00.43.02 Henny Wenkart: Well, uh, they were just a very nice couple.</span> <span id="s377">I had, I had been made aware that he was also a lawyer.</span> <span id="s378">And, uh, they seemed very nice and I felt, you know, they had a big responsibility.</span> <span id="s379">They had 50 kids that they were in charge of now.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">00.43.30 Uh, of course, nobody actually on the ship, nobody took care of us, uh, that I remember.</span> <span id="s381">And I'm wondering about that because I know that some of the children are five and six-years-old.</span> <span id="s382">Uh, the problem is they don't remember.</span> <span id="s383">See, I remember when I was five and six, but most people don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">00.43.54 And so what actually the story was there, I mean we were in cabins, but nobody watched whether anybody climbed up on the rail and maybe fell.</span> <span id="s385">I mean, no, if somebody had fallen overboard, somebody on the ship would have known.</span> <span id="s386">But also then after we passed the Irish Sea the gypsies came up.</span> <span id="s387">There were stowaway gypsies and they came up on deck.</span> <span id="s388">And so the boys had a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">00.44.23 They posted guards so that, you know, the gypsies wouldn't steal anything.</span> <span id="s390">I mean, people -- there was a lot of prejudice against Roma among everybody.</span> <span id="s391">Uh, and I don't even know whether they landed.</span> <span id="s392">I, I don't know what happened to those people because they disappeared the day before we landed.</span> <span id="s393">Uh, they were illegal immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">00.44.51 Uh, but as far as I know the Krauses traveled first class and we traveled tourist class.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">[Director's comments] Interviewer: We were talking about being on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">00.45.28 Henny Wenkart: And the Roma came up and then they disappeared again.</span> <span id="s397">And the boys had a great time because they were posting guards and they were taking care of everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s398">The boys always had a better time.</span> <span id="s399">You know, when we got to that camp in, uh, Pennsylvania they learned baseball and we learned how to sew.</span> <span id="s400">[Laughs] I don't know, maybe girls weren't supposed to play baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">00.45.56 It was a different time, I suppose.</span> <span id="s402">But, uh, when we landed we were below having our papers checked.</span> <span id="s403">I do not remember the Statue of Liberty as -- although one of my friends says he does remember it.</span> <span id="s404">So it may be that he was on deck.</span> <span id="s405">I was below.</span> <span id="s406">Uh, and when we landed the press was there and we were not to speak to the press.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">00.46.29 They told the press that we didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s408">[Laughs] But they followed us.</span> <span id="s409">The Times, at least, followed us to Pennsylvania where we wound up.</span> <span id="s410">And, uh, and they were impressed by the fact that we liked Jell-O and tomato juice, neither one of which we'd had before.</span> <span id="s411">Whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">00.46.55 Uh, somebody had brought, uh, some relative had brought a Whitman Sampler to the dock and, uh, that Whitman Sampler when all around the bus.</span> <span id="s413">We were taken on a bus.</span> <span id="s414">And one by one, uh, each of the Viennese children bit into one of these chocolates and began to cry.</span> <span id="s415">[Laughs] 00.47.30 Because they tasted awful.</span> <span id="s416">Viennese chocolate is so good.</span> <span id="s417">[Laughs] I mean they had all these stupid flavors.</span> <span id="s418">I don't know.</span> <span id="s419">Spearmint and, and something that tasted like toothpaste and, I mean, they were really awful chocolates.</span> <span id="s420">They are to this day.</span> <span id="s421">Have you ever tried a Whitman Sampler?</span> <span id="s422">They're terrible.</span> <span id="s423">[Laughs] 00.47.59 Yeah, they're awful.</span> <span id="s424">So anyway we got to this place in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s425">Uh, I was homesick the whole entire time until I was back with my parents.</span> <span id="s426">So, uh, anything that happened after that was through a haze of homesickness.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Interviewer: I don't know the answer to this question.</span> <span id="s428">Did you share a cabin with --?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">00.48.31 Henny Wenkart: There weren't cabins.</span> <span id="s430">The cabins were at the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Interviewer: No, I understand that.</span> <span id="s432">On the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Henny Wenkart: Oh, on the ship.</span> <span id="s434">Yes, I think I shared a cabin with [Elfie].</span> <span id="s435">No, I think there were four of us to a cabin.</span> <span id="s436">Two double bunks.</span> <span id="s437">I don't remember too much about that.</span> <span id="s438">My father had told me that, uh, to avoid sea sickness stay on deck and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">00.49.01 I was mostly on deck.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Interviewer: How do you remember spending your days on the ship?</span> <span id="s441">What do you remember about what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Henny Wenkart: Standing by the rail and looking back and crying.</span> <span id="s443">That's pretty much it.</span> <span id="s444">I mean, I was very, very, very, very homesick; major homesick.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Interviewer: From the time you left Vienna, do you remember when you first then heard from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">00.49.51 Henny Wenkart: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s447">I mean, I got several letters a week, uh, from the beginning because they had written to the address before I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Interviewer: So by the time you were more or less settling in in the United States, you had word that they were still okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Henny Wenkart: Yes.</span> <span id="s450">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Interviewer: And that everyone in Vienna was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Henny Wenkart: Sure, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Interviewer: And that things were still moving on track.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">00.50.19 Henny Wenkart: That about moving on track they couldn't write.</span> <span id="s455">I mean, everything was censored, of course.</span> <span id="s456">And what I wrote back was about my sister whose nickname was Cookie, "She mustn't forget me.</span> <span id="s457">You must show her my picture everyday and talk to her about me.</span> <span id="s458">She mustn't forget me."</span> <span id="s459">00.50.52 So mostly that's what I wrote.</span> <span id="s460">I wrote instructions about what was to be done to make sure my sister didn't forget me.</span> <span id="s461">She didn't forget me.</span> <span id="s462">Well she was a baby, she might have, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Interviewer: Did you have family pictures with you when you left?</span> <span id="s464">Did you leave with physical reminders of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">00.51.19 Henny Wenkart: I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Interviewer: You mentioned the boys playing baseball and the girls doing some sewing at Camp Shalomville.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Henny Wenkart: We weren't in Camp Shalom, you know.</span> <span id="s468">We were at the guest house some distance away.</span> <span id="s469">We visited the camp after we were out of quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">00.51.48 We visited the camp for evening activities, uh, sometimes.</span> <span id="s471">But, uh, from where I was, from our room you could see across to the rec hall and in the camp after hours you could see, but not hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">00.52.14 And we knew that America was a very violent country; gangster movies and so on.</span> <span id="s473">And there was a lot of violence going on there.</span> <span id="s474">You could look through the windows and there were, uh, young men just throwing women around and so on.</span> <span id="s475">And we didn't hear the music.</span> <span id="s476">It was the jitter bug.</span> <span id="s477">[Laughs] 00.52.49 So it was a -- but the interesting thing is that two of the popular songs that summer were, in fact, Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s478">One was by [unintelligible] [Duchin], which we learned and one was And the Angels Sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">00.53.24 And that you don't realize is a Yiddish song until you speed it up.</span> <span id="s480">Because if you sing it normal tempo it's, uh, "We meet and the angels sing.</span> <span id="s481">The angles sing the sweetest song I've ever heard."</span> <span id="s482">You speed that up and it's thump-um-budda-bump-bum, budda-bump-badda-dadah-dadah-dadda-dah.</span> <span id="s483">It's a Klezmer song.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">00.53.55 And that was stunning, that was stunning.</span> <span id="s485">We had one bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s486">There was a pair of brothers, Eddy and Rudy.</span> <span id="s487">And Eddy turned 13 that summer and we had a bar mitzvah then.</span> <span id="s488">And the people came out from Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">00.54.21 Uh, the Krauses came, uh, the grand master of the lodge, his name was [Levine], he came and a number of other people came for the bar mitzvah specifically.</span> <span id="s490">Uh, well, there weren't even enough counselors to make a minyon, uh, I don't think; male counselors.</span> <span id="s491">There may have been, there may have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">00.54.46 Uh, they were German-speaking counselors.</span> <span id="s493">They made, they made sure to hire, uh, counselors from Vienna who were refugees living in Philadelphia so that we could speak German with them.</span> <span id="s494">And, uh, whether we actually had lessons in English I don't know.</span> <span id="s495">It wouldn't have affected me because I knew English.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">00.55.20 But I was very innocent in terms of boy/girl stuff.</span> <span id="s497">Uh, I went to the minyon in the morning and, uh, I was the only girl who went.</span> <span id="s498">But I went because I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s499">I didn't go to, you know, to make eyes with boys or display myself to the boys.</span> <span id="s500">But there were accusations that I didn't understand that that's what I was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">00.55.50 But I didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s502">I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Interviewer: Were you placed in a foster home temporarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Henny Wenkart: No, I wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s505">I wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s506">I wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s507">My father came to see me and he said, uh, you know, "We're going to be very poor and I have been told that you could live for a while in the home of another lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">00.56.24 And it would ease my mind to know that at least you were living a normal life."</span> <span id="s509">And only recently has it occurred to me that if he had said, "You know, it's going to be very hard for me to support four people.</span> <span id="s510">If you went to a foster home for a while it would make it easier on me," if he had said that, I could not have said no, but he didn't say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">00.56.58 He didn't say it.</span> <span id="s512">He wanted me home.</span> <span id="s513">And he brought me a little bracelet that my grandfather had meant for me and every time I went to see my grandfather he would put it on my wrist and pull it off.</span> <span id="s514">He said, "When it doesn't pull off anymore over your hand you get to keep it."</span> <span id="s515">00.57.22 So my father had brought it to me just, you know, to try on and I begged him to leave it with me and he did and I lost it that night.</span> <span id="s516">It fell off my wrist into the grass somewhere and was gone.</span> <span id="s517">He never asked me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Interviewer: Did he resume his career as an attorney?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">00.57.50 Henny Wenkart: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Interviewer: Was your father able to resume his career as a lawyer in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Henny Wenkart: Oh, no, of course not.</span> <span id="s522">No, of course not.</span> <span id="s523">No, no.</span> <span id="s524">No, he got a job for $10.00 a week, uh, drilling holes in artificial rubies.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Interviewer: I'm sorry; drilling holes?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Henny Wenkart: Drilling holes in synthetic rubies.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">00.58.16 And then, uh, after that -- after work he would go and visit doctors as what was called a detail man.</span> <span id="s528">He had this heavy bag of samples, which he would leave with doctors; vitamins and things like that.</span> <span id="s529">But they enjoyed his company, so they would leave their patients waiting and sit with him and chat.</span> <span id="s530">Uh, and then after that he went to, uh -- we were living in Providence, Rhode Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">00.58.47 And there was a branch of Northeastern University at the YMCA and there he studied accounting.</span> <span id="s532">And, uh, this factory was run by a very, uh, charitable man named Adolph Miller.</span> <span id="s533">And Miller came to my dad and said, uh, "I'm going to expand the plant.</span> <span id="s534">We're going to be a war plant."</span> <span id="s535">00.59.18 This was after December 7, 1941.</span> <span id="s536">Uh, "And I want you to be the controller, so take some courses in cost accounting."</span> <span id="s537">And so he did and he became the cost accountant, the controller of that factory.</span> <span id="s538">Uh, then afterwards Miller retired and closed the factory, but got dad a job with his son-in-law, who was a CPA.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">00.59.49 But this was a very dour man and my father got very depressed working for him.</span> <span id="s540">And so eventually, he bought a practice from a widow and, uh, went on his own and did well.</span> <span id="s541">By the end, when he was 62 he learned to drive.</span> <span id="s542">He bought a car and took my mother to Canada.</span> <span id="s543">But he died when he was 67.</span> <span id="s544">He died just after he had made it and had some stocks and securities and so on to leave and then he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Interviewer: So you grew up in Providence?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">01.00.29 Henny Wenkart: Uh-huh, I did.</span> <span id="s547">And I -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Interviewer: Went to high school and college?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Henny Wenkart: Well I lived at home, of course, when I went to college.</span> <span id="s550">I went to Classical High School, which to this day is a wonderful -- it's a public school, but it's a prep school.</span> <span id="s551">And since then I have taught, uh, writing at Harvard.</span> <span id="s552">And the kids that come from Classical are as well prepared as anybody from Andover or Exeter.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">01.00.57 They are really well prepared.</span> <span id="s554">Uh, and then, uh, when I came to graduate dad did the research, uh, to find out which college was the best college in town.</span> <span id="s555">And he said, "Well there's Pembroke College, which is in Brown University.</span> <span id="s556">That's where you're going."</span> <span id="s557">And I said, "Okay," and I went and had an interview and took a test and went to Brown.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">01.01.27 But I lived at home and I left the house at 7:00 in the morning and, and then stayed until midnight.</span> <span id="s559">Then I came home on two streetcars.</span> <span id="s560">I was terrified, but I did it every night.</span> <span id="s561">And, uh, I mean, there was no way that I was going away.</span> <span id="s562">You know, he was making a living, but not that kind of living.</span> <span id="s563">There was never even any thought of it.</span> <span id="s564">But I had friends in the dorm who are still my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">01.01.59 And so I had -- I would keep a sweater and a bathing suit in different people's rooms.</span> <span id="s566">You know, sunbathe on the roof with them and so on.</span> <span id="s567">Uh, I, I did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s568">I was a DJ on the radio station.</span> <span id="s569">I edited the Hillel paper.</span> <span id="s570">And oh, my husband and I were charter members of Brown Hillel and I'm still on the Board.</span> <span id="s571">And, uh, I was a DJ.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">01.02.31 I edited the Hillel paper and I was news editor of the Pembroke paper.</span> <span id="s573">Uh, and I worked 40 hours a week.</span> <span id="s574">I worked in the library and I babysat and I graded papers.</span> <span id="s575">Uh, I loved college.</span> <span id="s576">I had such a good time.</span> <span id="s577">I just loved it.</span> <span id="s578">I mean, the things I was supposed to read were things I would have read anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">01.02.58 The idea that, you know, my job was to do all this, I just loved it.</span> <span id="s580">I was really, really happy in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Interviewer: You graduated when?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Henny Wenkart: '49.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Interviewer: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Henny Wenkart: Then I went to the Columbia School of Journalism and got a Masters.</span> <span id="s585">And then I worked in New York for a while and then, uh -- and my boyfriend had gone to the Harvard Business School and then moved back home with his parents in Providence.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">01.03.33 So, uh, I was in New York and he was in Providence and he'd come down every five or six weeks and I decided nothing was going to happen this way.</span> <span id="s587">So I moved to Boston and got a job as an editor at Ginn, uh, Textbook, editing French, Spanish, German, uh, textbooks.</span> <span id="s588">And then I got a job on WGBH as a producer; various jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">01.04.04 I never kept any job very long.</span> <span id="s590">[Laughs] I did; I worked at MIT for two years.</span> <span id="s591">Uh, and then, uh, my husband decided that it was time to have a family so why didn't I go back to school?</span> <span id="s592">That would be a nice part-time thing to do.</span> <span id="s593">So it took me 15 years to earn a Ph.D in philosophy.</span> <span id="s594">By that time, I had three kids taller than me.</span> <span id="s595">But I made it and I taught both writing and philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Interviewer: Quite a path.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">01.04.42 Henny Wenkart: Yeah.</span> <span id="s598">And the ambition -- [unintelligible] weren't ambitious to become a full professor.</span> <span id="s599">Uh, I could have gone to Wheaton or some other college.</span> <span id="s600">I was offered jobs, but I was walking to work.</span> <span id="s601">I was five minutes away from my classes.</span> <span id="s602">I had three kids that were, you know, that I wanted to be with.</span> <span id="s603">And I had Harvard students to teach.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">01.05.14 You know, that made a big difference.</span> <span id="s605">It didn't matter to me if I was going to climb a ladder.</span> <span id="s606">What if I got a job, a tenure track job in the Middle West?</span> <span id="s607">My husband wouldn’t move to the Middle West and I wasn’t going to have a commuting marriage with the kids in one place and him in another.</span> <span id="s608">So there was no way really.</span> <span id="s609">Uh, and I didn't have -- that wasn't the ambition that I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Interviewer: What was your husband's profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">01.05.42 Henny Wenkart: He's an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Interviewer: As you were raising your children, Henny, did they always know of your story?</span> <span id="s613">Of the Vienna story?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Henny Wenkart: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Interviewer: Your children, your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Henny Wenkart: Oh, I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s617">Sure.</span> <span id="s618">He had gone to Holland, my husband, from Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">01.06.10 He and his little brother had gone to Holland and there he lived in the orphanage for the orphans from Danzig.</span> <span id="s620">And his parents went to England and then sent for them just in time, just before the Germans took over Holland and the kids were sent -- the other kids were sent to their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">01.06.38 So -- and then by the time that family came, there was war and they were in a trans -- they were in a convoy and attacked with submarines and so on.</span> <span id="s622">So his story was a different story.</span> <span id="s623">But you know it damages you.</span> <span id="s624">We're both damaged people.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">01.07.04 Leaving your parents in danger and saving your own life is something you never get over.</span> <span id="s626">You just don't.</span> <span id="s627">Of course, it's a lot worse for those whose parents didn't come out; who lost their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">01.07.32 And, you know, you can say, "Well you're parents wanted you to save yourself.</span> <span id="s629">You know that."</span> <span id="s630">That doesn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s631">And they didn't have social workers working with us, you know.</span> <span id="s632">In those days you didn’t.</span> <span id="s633">Nowadays you would.</span> <span id="s634">[Extended silence] 01.08.10 These people had built a, a, uh, vacation home for themselves.</span> <span id="s635">A beautiful stone house, swimming pool, luxurious for that time.</span> <span id="s636">They had just dedicated it and instead of using it for themselves, they brought out 50 children because they had 50 beds in the place and put us there for the summer and provided us with everything we needed; with counselors who would understand what we were saying, uh, and who seemed kind, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">01.08.45 They were kind.</span> <span id="s638">And, uh, provided foster homes for the ones that needed them.</span> <span id="s639">They did tremendous, tremendous things for us.</span> <span id="s640">But when you're a child, you know, you, you don't think about that.</span> <span id="s641">You can't, you know.</span> <span id="s642">You're sort of in, in this little cocoon and if it's broken, it's broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Interviewer: Why do you think the Krauses did what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">01.09.26 Henny Wenkart: Why do I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Interviewer: Why do you think the Krauses did what they did in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Henny Wenkart: Uh, what I never knew until I read some correspondence quite recently is that they were worried about doing this.</span> <span id="s647">They were Americans, but they were Jews.</span> <span id="s648">And they were actually a little frightened of going into Nazi Germany as Jews, but they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">01.09.56 Uh, I didn't know that until I grew up.</span> <span id="s650">Uh, and I just felt that they must be wonderful people to do it.</span> <span id="s651">Uh, I took it for granted at the time, I think, because I knew that if the roles were reversed my parents would have done it, too.</span> <span id="s652">It's the sort of thing you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">01.10.23 And, uh, they were good people and they did what they did because they were good people.</span> <span id="s654">But my problem wasn't that.</span> <span id="s655">My problem was that I was leaving my parents [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s656">You don't -- as a child -- I mean, you know, maybe I was a very mature child and a very bright child and so on, but I was a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">01.10.51 You know, I was a child.</span> <span id="s658">And, you know, I mean, I kept a diary.</span> <span id="s659">I even know where it is.</span> <span id="s660">Like in my teen years I kept a diary and, uh, after a while I realized my mother was reading my diary and I started -- I continued the diary at home, but I kept a real one at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">01.11.26 And my mother complained.</span> <span id="s662">We had a friend who was sort of in the middle.</span> <span id="s663">I can show you her picture.</span> <span id="s664">She was my matron of honor.</span> <span id="s665">I took out my, my wedding album in case you wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s666">Uh, and so she is 10 years older than I am and 10 years younger than my mother, so she was kind of a bridge.</span> <span id="s667">And my mother said, uh, to her, "Henny thinks I'm reading her diary."</span> <span id="s668">01.11.58 And, uh, my friend said, "That's terrible.</span> <span id="s669">Why do you think that?</span> <span id="s670">My goodness, why would she think that?"</span> <span id="s671">And my mother said, "I can tell by the entries she thinks I'm reading it."</span> <span id="s672">[Laughs] So it's, uh -- I don't know really whether the Krauses got to know any of us personally during the journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">01.12.29 Uh, I don't know that.</span> <span id="s674">I just -- I can't tell you it.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Interviewer: So you don't necessarily remember them spending --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">[Director's comments] Interviewer: I had asked you if you recall what your interaction was like with the Krauses aboard the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Henny Wenkart: Well, you know, that interaction , I was so fresh with them when I came to them.</span> <span id="s678">[Laughs] 01.13.00 Uh, they came, uh, to our deck about two days before we landed and taught us the Star Spangled Banner, which we, you know, being Viennese children and used to real music, [Laughs] couldn't make head or tail of it.</span> <span id="s679">I mean, there is no melody there.</span> <span id="s680">It's, it's just about an unsingable song, and, uh, very difficult to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">01.13.33 We did all learn it I guess.</span> <span id="s682">Well, I'd learned it.</span> <span id="s683">You know, I don't know how many of the others learned it, actually.</span> <span id="s684">Uh, that's one thing.</span> <span id="s685">We didn’t eat together, of course.</span> <span id="s686">Uh, but I don’t even remember eating at all.</span> <span id="s687">Eating doesn't tend to be one of my big things.</span> <span id="s688">I mean, I remember two really good meals in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">01.14.03 One was in Paris when we went to a bistro and how crisp the bread was.</span> <span id="s690">That bread was so crisp that I broke a tooth on one and it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s691">It was worth it.</span> <span id="s692">[Laughs] Things like that.</span> <span id="s693">Uh, but, you know, in general I'm not a foody and I don't remember exactly where I ate, what I ate.</span> <span id="s694">I remember where we ate in college room because we ate at long tables in a dining hall, but a nice dining hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">01.14.36 And, uh, I remember some of the songs that we learned there when we went over to the camp with our counselors.</span> <span id="s696">Uh, I don't know whether the Krauses established any relationships with any specific children.</span> <span id="s697">I just don't know whether they did.</span> <span id="s698">I didn't have any particular relationship with them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">01.15.04 But I was, uh, I was so homesick that I was hardly talking to anybody.</span> <span id="s700">My roommate I talked to.</span> <span id="s701">I was also, uh, pretending that I was already a big girl.</span> <span id="s702">And, uh, my roommates were in their teens and were having their periods and I pretended that I was, too, though I wasn't.</span> <span id="s703">[Laughs] Interviewer: Henny, where did you meet your parents when they came to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">01.15.49 Henny Wenkart: Oh, daddy came to get me.</span> <span id="s705">He visited me first, the day after they arrived, and then, uh, said well, you know, I would stay at, at Collegeville until that disbanded; until school would start wherever we would be living.</span> <span id="s706">And they, uh, actually, uh, rented an apartment -- no, we first stayed with, uh, second cousins of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">01.16.24 Uh, they had two children, Harriet and [Boynard].</span> <span id="s708">Harriet was my age and Boynard was about three years younger.</span> <span id="s709">And they lived on Herzl Street.</span> <span id="s710">Do you know how to spell Herzl Street?</span> <span id="s711">H-E-R-Z-L.</span> <span id="s712">Uh, very nice people.</span> <span id="s713">They lived in a very small apartment and they took the four of us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">01.16.54 And there they called me grandpa's relatives.</span> <span id="s715">They called us that, you know.</span> <span id="s716">Uh, they didn't sort of realize we were their relatives, too.</span> <span id="s717">And grandpa had a little store a third the width of this room.</span> <span id="s718">You know, like a candy and groceries and things like that.</span> <span id="s719">But he was a wealthy man.</span> <span id="s720">He had a store, you know.</span> <span id="s721">[Laughs] 01.17.24 Uh, then we had a [railroad] apartment together with the widow of my Uncle Leo, who had died in Buchenwald, and her two children, who lived until -- well, Bruno died 15 years ago and Marlene, the younger one, was my sister's age and she just dropped dead about a year ago.</span> <span id="s722">Uh, so we lived there in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">01.17.53 And my first school -- I went to two schools in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s724">One was very modern and built on, on, uh, projects.</span> <span id="s725">The project was Hawaii and so we would -- oh, yes, we would color little noodles and make leis and we learned the whole text to Aloha Away, which I still know.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">01.18.23 And, uh, in arithmetic, uh, if you got a perfect paper you moved up a seat toward the front of the room.</span> <span id="s727">And so you reached the front row and if you kept on getting perfect papers you stayed there.</span> <span id="s728">So that was good.</span> <span id="s729">But then I went -- we moved and I had to go to a different school and this was a terrible school.</span> <span id="s730">Very old fashioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">01.18.51 We were seated alphabetically, so I sat in the back.</span> <span id="s732">And the teacher was not very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s733">And one time I had an upset stomach and I kept asking to go to the bathroom and she said, "Why do you have to go to the bathroom so many times?"</span> <span id="s734">And I said, "Because I've got a stomach ache, that's why."</span> <span id="s735">And everybody laughed.</span> <span id="s736">Uh, so that was not very good.</span> <span id="s737">But anyway, we, we -- you could not -- if you needed help from the refugee committee, you could not stay in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">01.19.23 So they sent us to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s739">Now the Baltimore Jewish community was then and is to this day a wonderful community.</span> <span id="s740">Uh, we lived in a slum on Utah Place with cockroaches all over.</span> <span id="s741">Uh, my father got a job as a file clerk in a department store.</span> <span id="s742">But, uh, my parents were invited out to dinner very often by the families of lawyers, other lawyers.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">01.19.55 They accepted him as a lawyer from Vienna.</span> <span id="s744">And there was none of this business about being a refugee, you know.</span> <span id="s745">I, I don't like that pronunciation.</span> <span id="s746">I always say refugee.</span> <span id="s747">And I guess because refugee is like refuse.</span> <span id="s748">Uh, but, uh, daddy didn't want to be -- he wanted to be in Providence because his brother was there.</span> <span id="s749">So we did move to Providence.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">01.20.24 That was okay.</span> <span id="s751">We were allowed to do that.</span> <span id="s752">And that's where I grew up.</span> <span id="s753">And there a refugee was a refugee.</span> <span id="s754">[Laughs] But, you know, it's so weird because who were the other people?</span> <span id="s755">The other people were people who had immigrated from Russia 20 years earlier.</span> <span id="s756">And they had Russian accents so, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Interviewer: I think I asked you this in one of our phone conversations, but I'll ask it here.</span> <span id="s758">That has to do with the times you've returned to Vienna.</span> <span id="s759">I believe you said you've been back once or twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">01.21.04 Henny Wenkart: Well, we went back in '54 and I wanted to show my husband Vienna.</span> <span id="s761">He wanted to show me Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s762">We went back to our old homes and showed each other the way we had lived.</span> <span id="s763">And, actually, on the building where we lived there was only one balcony.</span> <span id="s764">That was our apartment.</span> <span id="s765">It was a round balcony around the, uh, around the parlor.</span> <span id="s766">And, actually, the windows were round, the glass was round.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">01.21.32 And there is this wonderful chandelier and I would go in there early in the morning and watch the sun through the glass of the chande -- the crystal chandelier.</span> <span id="s768">And we did bring it over, but the thing was eight feet high, you know, and it wouldn't -- for 12 foot ceilings that's all right, but not -- it couldn't have been eight feet.</span> <span id="s769">It was six feet, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">01.22.01 Uh, but I had friends.</span> <span id="s771">Uh, Olivia [Koppel], whose mother brought a lot of kids over from Berlin, and she went to visit her daughter who was in her junior year abroad.</span> <span id="s772">And they found -- I had given them the address and the directions and they found the room, the house where, where I had lived.</span> <span id="s773">And she said they stood there looking at it for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">01.22.30 It was a beautiful place, just beautiful.</span> <span id="s775">And, uh, it was essentially a happy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Interviewer: So you were last in Vienna in 1954?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Henny Wenkart: Uh, I could -- well, for three days and then I had to flee again.</span> <span id="s778">And came back again when our youngest son was 10, which was the age I was when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">01.22.58 And showed them around, but the interesting thing is I didn't show them -- I showed them what I knew.</span> <span id="s780">I had never been taken to the Museum of Art because I thought, I always thought that it would be boring.</span> <span id="s781">[Laughs] So I showed them the Natural History Museum, which is right opposite the Museum of Art.</span> <span id="s782">We went to the opera, uh, and saw [Sigrid], but it was disappointing because there weren't many sets.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">01.23.25 I mean, it was -- maybe because it was early after the restoration of the opera, but I'm, you know, I'm used to the Met with lavish sets.</span> <span id="s784">I mean, the singing was glorious, but no sets.</span> <span id="s785">[Laughs] Uh, and I -- you know, and I knew stories like the, uh, uh, like the Lohengrin story about the swan.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">01.23.56 Do you know that story?</span> <span id="s787">Uh, you know, Lohengrin, uh, tells his wife that she mustn't ask him who he is.</span> <span id="s788">And she doesn't and she gets married, but then her friends keep saying, "You know, you don't know who this is.</span> <span id="s789">He could be a crook.</span> <span id="s790">He could be a gangster.</span> <span id="s791">You've got to ask him who he is.</span> <span id="s792">You know, he's your husband now."</span> <span id="s793">So she asks him on their wedding night and he says, "Now I have to leave you.</span> <span id="s794">I told you not to ask me."</span> <span id="s795">01.24.25 You know, and then there's that wonderful aria where he tells her the story of his life, "ich - bin Lohengrin genannt."</span> <span id="s796">And then he leaves.</span> <span id="s797">And he leaves, a swan comes by and he gets on the swan and it, you know, leaves.</span> <span id="s798">But this one tenor -- I forget his name; you might even know him, a very famous tenor -- missed the swan.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">01.24.52 He gets to the edge of the stage and the swan comes by and leaves and he doesn't, he didn’t get on.</span> <span id="s800">So he looked at the audience and he says, "When's the next swan?"</span> <span id="s801">[Laughs] That story I knew.</span> <span id="s802">[Laughs] But, you know, you can get a little book of opera stories.</span> <span id="s803">I have it somewhere.</span> <span id="s804">I don't know where it is.</span> <span id="s805">Uh, I was taken to the opera twice, both times to see Hansel and Gretel.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">01.25.22 And I couldn't understand how everybody looked so different the second time.</span> <span id="s807">And we were sitting way up in the top balcony and in the second act after they burn the witch and everything, uh, my father kept saying, "Look over there.</span> <span id="s808">See that man over there?</span> <span id="s809">Over there, that's the witch."</span> <span id="s810">And I said, "Oh, daddy, they burned the witch.</span> <span id="s811">She's dead."</span> <span id="s812">[Laughs] 01.25.51 So, you know -- but the things you remember are things you didn't quite understand.</span> <span id="s813">Uh, there was one, one saying about how it's very difficult to be a father.</span> <span id="s814">There's nothing to being -- becoming a father, but being a father is very hard.</span> <span id="s815">And, and me saying, "Of course, there's nothing to becoming a father.</span> <span id="s816">You don't do anything to become a father," and everybody laughing and laughing at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">01.26.24 And I didn't understand and didn't forget; didn't forget.</span> <span id="s818">And what I hated was when people asked me who they were because I knew who they were.</span> <span id="s819">But when they asked me that I thought maybe I didn’t really know.</span> <span id="s820">Maybe I was wrong and I wouldn't say.</span> <span id="s821">It's, it's a -- people tease children.</span> <span id="s822">In Europe they do; very different.</span> <span id="s823">Child raising here is very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">01.26.52 Uh, I actually couldn’t do it because they argue with the children and they don't, they don't punish them.</span> <span id="s825">I mean, the worst thing they do is send them to their room, but that's not a punishment.</span> <span id="s826">Uh, but it works.</span> <span id="s827">Walking around the campus I see kids, you know, texting or, or cell phoning their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">01.27.20 Uh, in my day, I mean, I lived at home, but the kids who lived away, they never -- they were glad, glad to get away from home, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Interviewer: This episode that we've been discussing happened now more than 70 years ago.</span> <span id="s830">That's a long time, right?</span> <span id="s831">When you look back over what you've done, all the terrific things you've done throughout your life, as a parent, as a writer, as a teacher, is there any sort of specific memory of what happened in 1939 that is sort of more vivid than all of the others that stands out?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">01.28.08 Henny Wenkart: Yes, just that; just making the decision to leave my parents in danger and save my own life.</span> <span id="s833">Yes, that's been a shadow.</span> <span id="s834">That's not to say that they shouldn't have done what they did when they came and took us away from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">01.28.37 They were rescuing, in some cases, a whole family.</span> <span id="s836">You know, if the family's papers were not strong enough for the whole family, they took one or two of the children away, uh, and then the family was able to come out.</span> <span id="s837">They collected affidavits for every one of those 50 children.</span> <span id="s838">They did a tremendous job, which we were in no position as children to understand at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">01.29.09 My parents must have understood.</span> <span id="s840">But it just occurs to me now something I've never thought about because I was so centric of myself, my own feelings.</span> <span id="s841">My parents were there in the room.</span> <span id="s842">Uh, I don't know if the Krauses were in the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">01.29.39 There was a woman there and I thought she was the pediatrician, but you're telling me that the pediatrician was a man, so this may have actually been a woman, uh, from the Jewish community center who was doing the interview.</span> <span id="s844">Uh, and it may have been her idea to say that they mustn't influence me.</span> <span id="s845">Uh, I'll never know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">01.30.09 Because if the Krauses had been in the room, the men would have shaken hands.</span> <span id="s847">There was nothing like that.</span> <span id="s848">I think they probably were not.</span> <span id="s849">Uh, so -- but I did meet them sometime; on the train I guess.</span> <span id="s850">You know, they were on the train, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s851">And they must have gone around and shaken everyone's hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">01.30.38 But by that time, I was in tears and, you know.</span> <span id="s853">And the train didn't leave and didn't leave and there came a time you would look out the window and you'd be waving and waving and waving for an hour or two.</span> <span id="s854">And I could still see my father's hat.</span> <span id="s855">You know, my father standing on tiptoe to see me.</span> <span id="s856">And my mother was shorter by some, so I didn't even see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">01.31.08 And after a while it was just too much.</span> <span id="s858">I thought, "Well, if we're going to leave, let's leave."</span> <span id="s859">You know, it just gets too much.</span> <span id="s860">It's like a damn hockey game.</span> <span id="s861">The hockey games are always so hard to watch because there are so few scores.</span> <span id="s862">[Laughs] Interviewer: What haven't I asked that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">01.31.39 Henny Wenkart: Uh, I kind of regret that I don’t have more to tell you about the Krauses themselves.</span> <span id="s864">Because, you know, the strong memories of them teaching us the Star Spangled Banner and trying really hard to teach us that unteachable song.</span> <span id="s865">Uh, I know that they came on the bus with us and took us all the way to Collegeville.</span> <span id="s866">And they visited, too, but I don't remember how many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">01.32.11 See, if I'd known you were going to come around and ask me these questions, I probably would have made it my business to remember more.</span> <span id="s868">Uh, that they were wonderful people; that they did something they were afraid to do, but did it is the thing to be remembered, uh, and they both came, which says something about the marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">01.32.41 Because, uh, many a husband might have done this, but not wanting to bring his wife into any kind of danger.</span> <span id="s870">Uh, it may be that he thought, "Well, she's a woman and therefore, uh, would be able to be kinder to these children."</span> <span id="s871">Maybe that was her idea.</span> <span id="s872">I don't know, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">01.33.08 Now as an adult looking back, uh, I do think about them and that they did something very hard and not undangerous.</span> <span id="s874">And were very good people because here you are, not even a grandson, but a grandson-in-law, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">01.33.38 And anxious to get as much material about them said as you can.</span> <span id="s876">The other people you're interviewing that I know of were younger, I think.</span> <span id="s877">So you don't have -- now I know Hannah Brown is dead.</span> <span id="s878">How about Elfie?</span> <span id="s879">Is Elfie still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Interviewer: Uh, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Henny Wenkart: She was, she is two years older than I am, so if she's still alive she might -- Interviewer: But you see I'm talking to [Hanni's] brother, Bob.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">01.34.06 Henny Wenkart: Yes.</span> <span id="s883">Well, he -- uh, I didn't know him and he, when I first tried to get in touch with him, uh, was, uh -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s884">I think he, he may have thought I wanted something.</span> <span id="s885">I get that impression that his wife thought I wanted something.</span> <span id="s886">I don't know.</span> <span id="s887">I don't know.</span> <span id="s888">I mean, I didn't know him really.</span> <span id="s889">I knew Hannah.</span> <span id="s890">She was my roommate.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">01.34.33 Uh, but Elfie was older, so she -- if she's still alive and if you're in touch with her.</span> <span id="s892">Uh, I don't know what her name is now, maybe Elizabeth something.</span> <span id="s893">In any case, she would be 83 now, I think.</span> <span id="s894">So she would remember more.</span> <span id="s895">She was a very grown up girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Interviewer: I honestly don't know how many are still alive.</span> <span id="s897">It's not easy to find people, particularly the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">01.35.06 Henny Wenkart: The women because they changed their name.</span> <span id="s899">I didn't change mine.</span> <span id="s900">And people say, "How come you didn't change your name?"</span> <span id="s901">In the '50s that was very unusual and I say, "Well, we decided not to change our names."</span> <span id="s902">He didn’t change his.</span> <span id="s903">I didn't change mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Interviewer: And what happened to your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Henny Wenkart: My sister lives in Toronto.</span> <span id="s906">And my sister became an anthropologist and taught in Regina.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">01.35.40 Uh, her husband is a filmmaker, but he is a Communist.</span> <span id="s908">And so, uh, he was, he was blackballed by all the networks.</span> <span id="s909">He was a very good filmmaker, but he couldn't get a job here and so when she got her doctorate they moved to Canada where she taught anthropology and he actually taught one course.</span> <span id="s910">What was the course?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Interviewer: You're asking?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">01.36.11 Henny Wenkart: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Interviewer: Marxist film?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Henny Wenkart: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Interviewer: Marxist film?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Henny Wenkart: Just about.</span> <span id="s917">The use of film as a, as a propaganda medium.</span> <span id="s918">Uh, anyway he got bored and he moved to Toronto and she -- and got active in the party there.</span> <span id="s919">And she, uh, took early retirement eventually when their daughter was raised and had gone through the University of Toronto.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">01.36.41 I was recently at her wedding.</span> <span id="s921">Uh, and, uh, so they, they live in Toronto and, uh, as retired people, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Interviewer: I didn't ask what happened to your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Henny Wenkart: Oh, nothing much happened to him.</span> <span id="s924">[Laughs] You'll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">01.37.11 You'll read the book of poems.</span> <span id="s926">You'll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Interviewer: Okay.</span> <span id="s928">And just so I have it on film, why don't you just tell me briefly about your children and where they are and what they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Henny Wenkart: Our eldest son is Jonathan Epstein.</span> <span id="s930">He opened last night in, uh, Paradise Lost by Clifford Odets at the Loeb in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s931">He is a very fine actor.</span> <span id="s932">He has won the Elliot Norton Award twice and has been nominated four and five times.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">01.37.42 Uh, and he has a wife and a son and two stepsons from her previous marriage.</span> <span id="s934">Uh, and then our daughter and her husband are both lawyers, except she's given up the law and she now makes pottery and jewelry and so on.</span> <span id="s935">And he works for the Federal Trade Commission as a lawyer.</span> <span id="s936">And they have a son who is graduating from the University of Chicago and a son who is graduating from high school, both in the same weekend in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">01.38.17 Uh, and they live in Bethesda.</span> <span id="s938">And, uh, our youngest is [Ari].</span> <span id="s939">Ari Wenkart Epstein, who is -- teaches at MIT.</span> <span id="s940">He is an oceanographer.</span> <span id="s941">And he teaches an environmental science course at MIT.</span> <span id="s942">And has a son 11 and a daughter five.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">01.38.50 That's, that's the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">[Audio gap] Henny Wenkart: Well, uh, I left on Mother's Day --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">[Director's comments] Henny Wenkart: I left on Mother's Day, uh, which was the end of May 1939 and they showed up on September 1st when the war broke up.</span> <span id="s946">So it was three months, which seemed very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Interviewer: They literally arrived on September 1st?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">01.39.19 Henny Wenkart: Yes, on the Laconia, a Cunard White Star ship.</span> <span id="s949">We were on the President Harding, which was such a bad ship that somebody told me it sank in dry dock.</span> <span id="s950">[Laughs] Terrible ship.</span> <span id="s951">I was, I was astonished when I saw her because we went to Hamburg and I always thought of ocean liners as these huge things and here was this little ship, which we were supposed to go across the ocean on.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">01.39.52 I was quite frightened.</span> <span id="s953">[Laughs] You're going to have to edit that out, the narcolepsy attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Interviewer: Oh, yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s955">I think you consider yourself now an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Henny Wenkart: Of course I'm an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Interviewer: When you first came over you probably didn't.</span> <span id="s958">So how did that transition happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">01.40.21 Henny Wenkart: Well, when I came over I was a refugee.</span> <span id="s960">I wasn't anything.</span> <span id="s961">I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s962">I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s963">Uh, you know, you can play that game with yourself; what are you first?</span> <span id="s964">What are you second?</span> <span id="s965">What are you, you know.</span> <span id="s966">And, uh, there are people -- well there's the Hannah of the, of the, uh, Hanukah story who sacrifices her children for it.</span> <span id="s967">I would never do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">01.40.49 I mean, first of all, I'm a spouse and parent.</span> <span id="s969">That's first.</span> <span id="s970">Second, I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s971">Third, I'm a writer, editor, philosopher.</span> <span id="s972">Uh, fifth, I'm an American and a New Yorker.</span> <span id="s973">Sixth, I'm a woman.</span> <span id="s974">That's how far down that comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">01.41.20 There a lot of women who are a woman first, you know.</span> <span id="s976">Uh, so at the time, uh, actually, you know, I don't have my own citizenship papers because I was naturalized with my father because I was under 18.</span> <span id="s977">Uh, so I always make sure to keep my passport current.</span> <span id="s978">Uh, came back from the wedding in Toronto and went through passport control.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">01.41.51 And, uh, the official, you know, took my passport and looked through the visas and he gave it back to me and said, "Welcome home."</span> <span id="s980">[Crying] So sweet that I was moved to tears.</span> <span id="s981">And, uh, we were going to make a [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s982">01.42.21 We both were going to make a [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s983">It was in our plan, but we couldn't.</span> <span id="s984">We couldn't leave our parents again.</span> <span id="s985">We just could not.</span> <span id="s986">But, of course, originally we, my family, had bought some land in Palestine.</span> <span id="s987">We were going to go there.</span> <span id="s988">That was the original plan.</span> <span id="s989">And, uh, if those papers had come through before, what, before I went to America and so on, we would have gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">01.42.50 We would have made a [unintelligible] and we would have grown up there and some of our friends did.</span> <span id="s991">Uh, and, you know, I feel very comfortable in Israel.</span> <span id="s992">People say, "Why don't you take dual citizenship?"</span> <span id="s993">But there would be no point in it.</span> <span id="s994">I can't live there when my children are here and I won't.</span> <span id="s995">And, uh, as far as being buried there, there is no -- you don't, you don't deserve to buried there if you didn't live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">01.43.17 I did -- somebody sent me a, uh, uh, tobacco can of soil from Jerusalem, which I do want in my grave.</span> <span id="s997">But, uh, when did I become -- well I became an American when I became a citizen.</span> <span id="s998">Uh, the transition to English was very rapid because I have a poem I wrote in English when I was 12, just a year after I came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">01.43.53 So that I think in English.</span> <span id="s1000">Well, unless I'm reading another language.</span> <span id="s1001">If I'm reading German or French or Spanish I think in that language.</span> <span id="s1002">But I am bilingual in German, except that I couldn't really write.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">01.44.17 You know, I read even a German newspaper or anything and it's such a wonderful language and I say to myself, "You know, I could have been writing in that language if I hadn't switched to English," which is such a simple, simple language.</span> <span id="s1004">But, you know, they used to -- there was something called Esperanto and they thought it would be a language.</span> <span id="s1005">English is the Esperanto because it's simple.</span> <span id="s1006">Everybody has -- everybody speaks English.</span> <span id="s1007">It used to be that everybody spoke French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">01.44.49 They don't now.</span> <span id="s1009">They don't now.</span> <span id="s1010">English is it.</span> <span id="s1011">And, uh, very much an American.</span> <span id="s1012">It may be that culturally -- well, I would say maybe culturally I'm more, more European than American, except that, uh, culturally I fit into New York and I fit into Boston, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">01.45.18 Although, I don't like -- I mean I lived there a long time.</span> <span id="s1014">We lived in Cambridge a long time and I keep an apartment there because I have kids there, but, uh, you know, I'm essentially a New Yorker and I want to continue living here.</span> <span id="s1015">I mean I hope I don't get old enough so that I can't live on my own, uh, or that I can live on my own even though I get old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">01.45.53 I mean I'm working and I'm active and so on.</span> <span id="s1017">I edit the Jewish Women's Literary Annual, which is a very, very good magazine, uh, very well regarded.</span> <span id="s1018">And I teach a poetry workshop.</span> <span id="s1019">It's funny that I'm teaching poetry and not philosophy.</span> <span id="s1020">I did teach philosophy.</span> <span id="s1021">I taught philosophy at Stern College for Women and at Harvard, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">01.46.19 Uh, and I told you that in, uh, this encyclopedia I have an article on [Santa Ana and Irony], which can I hold up the encyclopedia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Interviewer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Henny Wenkart: See?</span> <span id="s1025">I didn't edit it, but I have an article in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Interviewer: How long have you lived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">01.46.54 Henny Wenkart: 30

Cambridge they wouldn’t think of New York as their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">01.47.52 And there was a time for about three years when, uh, we did all live in New York in different places.</span> <span id="s1035">They were on their own in different apartments.</span> <span id="s1036">Our daughter was married.</span> <span id="s1037">But then everybody left and I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">[Abrupt end of recorded material]</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">HennyWenkart interview Page PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT 27</span></p></body></html>
