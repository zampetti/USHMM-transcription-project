i – was born in Poland, in December of 1902.</span> <span id="s26">Her name was Czarna Steel.</span> <span id="s27">And they were sort of distant cousins, so it was, as they say, a – a – a schitter(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: It’s – yeah.</span> <span id="s29">And did you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Oh – oh yes, I have a sister, her name is Helen Winchester, Henya(ph), that was her Polish name.</span> <span id="s31">And I have a brother, Arthur Spielman(ph), and we survived as a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Let’s ha – let’s – before we talk about that, want to move back to life before the war, though.</span> <span id="s33">You were born, you said, in 1939 –</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: – so – so you were born just as the war was beginning, so you probably don’t have any memories from –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Very, very –</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: – before, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I have just very few of my own memories, and most of it, what I call memories were told to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: So, I was gonna say, from what your parents and brother and sister said, what was your family’s life like in Poland before the war?</span> <span id="s40">Your father’s occupation –</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: My father –</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: – cultural affiliations, religious affiliations –</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My father was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s44">They were – we were an Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s45">We lived very well, we – we had help.</span> <span id="s46">We were not considered poor, but certainly we were not rich.</span> <span id="s47">And we had a – a tremendous extended family.</span> <span id="s48">And some of the family were farmers, and – and butchers, and – Shochets, as they would say.</span> <span id="s49">And it was, I guess what you would picture of a normal Jewish family of Poland, which was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s50">I was born in February, which was like six months before the Holocaust, so my memories of that time is – is –</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Did your siblings go to school before?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And what type of school, was it a Jewish school, a Polish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My brother went to chayder and my sister, I believe she went to a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s55">But they had normal schooling as well.</span> <span id="s56">I don’t recall too much about that, but yeah, my family was very learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And what language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yiddish.</span> <span id="s59">Polish.</span> <span id="s60">That’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And am-among the family itself was mostly Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And okay, let’s now move to September ’39, and I know that a lot of these are memories from your siblings and your parents, but from what they’ve told you, what happened September ’39 when the Germans invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, we were – we still were able to live in our home, but shortly after that, we were put into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s65">And I believe that was in 1942.</span> <span id="s66">And we were placed in the ghetto, in a one room place, and I think there were other people among us, and I don’t know how my family’s – I’m diversing if you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I don’t know how my family survived, because of me, because I was such a young baby.</span> <span id="s69">Most – well, I’ll go into that later, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: And do you know, was your father working in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s71">Was he still working as a shoemaker, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes, he had his own place, he was making – and everything was confiscated for him.</span> <span id="s73">And – and I believe how we survived was that he was making boots for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s74">So I – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And was your mother working in the ghetto also, or was she home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I – I – I think she was home with me, but she might have – and I – I – I cannot recall that at all, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: And your older siblings, do you know where they wi – have any schooling, or were they working?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: In the ghetto, I think when – once we were in the ghetto, I don’t think we had any schooling at all.</span> <span id="s79">No, it was very, very difficult, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And how long did your family stay in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Not very long, because when my father first heard of the liquidation starting at the Kraków ghetto, he – he was an amazing man, I must say.</span> <span id="s82">He had foresight, if not luck, and he was able to send ma – send my sister and brother out with a guy, to take them out of the ghetto and just take them away.</span> <span id="s83">I think there might have been a destination, but I d – I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s84">It had – there had to be.</span> <span id="s85">And – and my father paid for the guy to take my sister and brother out.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Do you remember what the emotional state was when they were leaving, and nobody knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Above – yeah, my – my –</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: – what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: – yeah, my father knew he would not see his children again.</span> <span id="s90">That – that was a – that was a given.</span> <span id="s91">And so I just cannot fathom the emotions that were at that time.</span> <span id="s92">And I remained with my mother and father.</span> <span id="s93">I was just too young to be sent off.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: So you were three years old then?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I was about three years old, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s96">Then in – in 1940 – well, during that time also, ’42 - ’43, my father saved a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: I’m – I’m not really certain, but being in that religious community, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the Bobover Rebbe?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Are you?</span> <span id="s101">Okay.</span> <span id="s102">Well, I – I believe they’re distantly related to us.</span> <span id="s103">And he was able to bring them into our place, and they stayed with us while they liquidated other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: This is the Halberstam family?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And how much of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: You just gave me the chills.</span> <span id="s108">How do you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: I’ve been studying the Bobovers.</span> <span id="s110">[indecipherable] So, what was the connection between your family and the family of the Bobover Rebbe?</span> <span id="s111">And how did your father – what did he do for Rabbi Halberstam?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I’m really not sure.</span> <span id="s113">Oh, now I have to find out a lot more.</span> <span id="s114">Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s115">I definitely – as a matter of fact, my brother called me this afternoon and I didn't get a chance to talk to him.</span> <span id="s116">And he would be the one to know, my brother knows everything.</span> <span id="s117">He remembered the streets, and the shops and everything that went on in Kraków.</span> <span id="s118">He knew hundreds of people, and he knew the whole family.</span> <span id="s119">He would – he was interviewed, I think by spe – Spielberg.</span> <span id="s120">I don’t know if he was interviewed by the – was he interviewed by the Holocaust, do you know – oh.</span> <span id="s121">He – he would make a great interview.</span> <span id="s122">But, so these are some of the things that he has told me.</span> <span id="s123">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s125">So, what memory do you have of your father and what he was doing to help other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s127">He saved, I know, two cousins.</span> <span id="s128">Two cousin, my two first cousins.</span> <span id="s129">One wa – was sent to Israel on one of the first Aliyahs.</span> <span id="s130">And then I have another cousin who lives in Chicago, and she was sent with the you – youth – youth organization to the States, cause we did have family in the States, so she was able to come on one of the first immigration trips.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: But, you were saying a minute ago that the Bobover Rebbe got into the ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well, yeah, he ge –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Very little –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Judy, I’m trying, I’m trying very hard.</span> <span id="s137">I know they stayed with us.</span> <span id="s138">They stayed with us, and when the – when it got to be very, very dangerous, my father again sent them out.</span> <span id="s139">Where to, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s140">And at that time, my father had Czech papers, so he was fairly safe, and we were able to get – once the ghetto was being liquidated, we were able to cross over to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Do you have any memory of how you escaped from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Very carefully.</span> <span id="s143">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Was it night, or is it day?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I believe it was at night, and we crossed the border.</span> <span id="s146">And I have a very, very vague story.</span> <span id="s147">That’s one of my rarest little memories, but again, it might have been told to me as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: We were crossing the – a border and of course it was guarded, but my – my father had the papers, and we were stopped.</span> <span id="s150">And they asked us all sorts of questions, and I was three or four years old.</span> <span id="s151">And they were talking to me, and I said – I was whimpering.</span> <span id="s152">And I said, my father is a goy, my mother is goy, but I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s153">And I was three, four years old, and they let us through.</span> <span id="s154">I – that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And when you got to Czechoslovakia, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We stayed – we stayed in Czechoslovakia for a little while.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t recall that at all.</span> <span id="s158">But soon after, we were able to get to Hungary, to Miskolc, Hungary.</span> <span id="s159">Well, first to Budapest.</span> <span id="s160">And from Budapest we went to Miskolc.</span> <span id="s161">I don’t remember Budapest, but I do remember Miskolc.</span> <span id="s162">We lived there as Gentiles for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: And at this time, did you have any knowledge that your brother and sister had survived?</span> <span id="s164">Had you had any contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Okay, in between that, there – they were sent to an orphanage.</span> <span id="s166">And my father heard, or – or somebody had heard that things were really happening.</span> <span id="s167">Whether my father knew where they were, or they were supposed to, but he didn’t know whether they were alive, but if they were, this is where they would – would have been.</span> <span id="s168">He sent a guide out there, and that was the day they were liquidating the orphanage.</span> <span id="s169">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: And this is in Miskolc, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I am not sure whether it was in Czechoslovakia, or whether it was in Hungary.</span> <span id="s172">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s173">And the gar – the guide knew who they were, and he went – first it was my brother, and he said, follow me.</span> <span id="s174">Don’t talk, don’t say anything, just follow me.</span> <span id="s175">And as they walked out, they – the Nazis came in and took the other children.</span> <span id="s176">And I think – I believe the same thing happened to Henya(ph), my sister Helen, and they were able to walk out of the orphanage, and they brought them to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Do you remember the reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No, I do not.</span> <span id="s179">You know, a lot of things seems to be repre – repressed in my mind, and I get so upset with myself, so irritated that I cannot have those memories.</span> <span id="s180">I would do anything to – to really know how I felt, how my parents felt, or – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: So then –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: – the rest of them.</span> <span id="s183">So, we lived in Miskolc for about a year as Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: All five of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Five of us, five of us.</span> <span id="s186">And as I said, we lived – lived as gent – we had a house, and in the house we had a cross, because we lived as – as Gentiles.</span> <span id="s187">And I remember being in the basement of the house, or – we went out to a shelter in a cave or somewhere, and – and the Russians came in and they bombed the whole town, or the area where we lived.</span> <span id="s188">The only house standing was ours.</span> <span id="s189">The cross came down, smacked in smithereens, and the house was standing.</span> <span id="s190">There was a crack though, but that was the only house standing in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s191">So, to me that was absolutely miraculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And then did you remain in the town after the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: We stayed – we stayed there for awhile.</span> <span id="s194">Well, we – during the bombing, my – my – my mother sent my brother out to get bread, there was a tremendous bread line.</span> <span id="s195">And he would bring home rotten bread, or whatever kind of bread we could get, and the bombs were falling, and you know.</span> <span id="s196">And my mother would prepare this bread in rancin – rancid oil that we kept so we could, you know, fry the bread.</span> <span id="s197">And the only food we had was garlic.</span> <span id="s198">So we would have this rotten bread and rancid oil with – spread with garlic.</span> <span id="s199">And you know Judy, it was the most delicious thing in the world.</span> <span id="s200">But, soon after that, when the war – we were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s201">And soon after that, I guess it was early part of 1946, I think it was the year – I’m not sure what part of the year it was, but my brother and my father decided they would go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s202">We remained in – in Hungary.</span> <span id="s203">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s204">But my brother and father went, and he came back with stories that were just incredible.</span> <span id="s205">That was the time of the pogroms.</span> <span id="s206">Soon after the war, when Jews were coming back to Poland, and my father and brother went to see our house, and they knocked on the door, and some Polish people were living there, and they slammed the door in his face, saying, you were supposed to be dead.</span> <span id="s207">So at that – right after that, this pogrom had started, and they escaped by this much from getting killed.</span> <span id="s208">They survived the war, but they were so scared that they would – yeah.</span> <span id="s209">So, we went back – they went back to Hungary and my father told my mother, there’s nothing there for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: And at that time my father, he survived the whole war without being arrested, but at that time he was arrested by the Russians.</span> <span id="s212">Because my father was bootlegging at that time, and the Russian soldiers got sick from – from this drink, and they arrested my father for selling bad liquor to the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: How long was he in jail for?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Not – not terribly long, not terribly long.</span> <span id="s215">But, he had to make a living, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So, how long did you remain in Hungary after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, we – we left soon after that, because I know we were in Gabersee, a DP camp in Germany for three years.</span> <span id="s218">So, we left that in 1949.</span> <span id="s219">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s220">So we must have left Hungary in ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And did you have any trouble getting out of Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I don’t recall that at all, I think we were just – you know, we made arrangements and we were placed in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s223">And we were there for three years, and even though we had family here in the States, it was – I’m sure, you know, it took forever to get the papers, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What was life like in the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: From what I remember as a child, it was okay.</span> <span id="s226">I had friends, I had schooling, I had food.</span> <span id="s227">I was a little bit of nothing, and so that was life, and it was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And di – and did your parents have enough to do in the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Well, my fath – ma – my father worked, my mother stayed at home, and I remember at that time my sister and brother wanted to make Aliyah to Israel.</span> <span id="s230">And oh, they cried to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s231">But, you know, they were good kids, it was all family, you know, and my mother said, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s232">She was tired of fighting, she was tired of being scared, and she wants peace in her life and she didn't want her children going to Israel and fighting another war.</span> <span id="s233">So, that’s how they remained with us, you know, that we stayed as a family unit.</span> <span id="s234">So we came to the States in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did anyone sponsor you?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well, we had the family.</span> <span id="s237">We had my aunt and unc – two aunts and an uncle ra – oh, no, we ha – that time we still had quite a bit of family left.</span> <span id="s238">We were a huge family.</span> <span id="s239">My father had a brother, two sisters.</span> <span id="s240">One sister with a husband, and an uncle who I – I hate to mention, that wer – that were in New York.</span> <span id="s241">And we had other relatives th-through the States.</span> <span id="s242">So we stayed with them for awhile til we – til we settled.</span> <span id="s243">But we arrived in New York harbor on a Shabbat, and cousins came to pick us up.</span> <span id="s244">My father would not get off the ship.</span> <span id="s245">He would not – it’s Shabbat, he is not going in a car, he’s not – you know.</span> <span id="s246">So here after – after 10 years of suffering, he would not get off the ship.</span> <span id="s247">So my cousins left, and they came back a little bit later and they said, if you don’t get off the boat now, we’re not coming back and get you.</span> <span id="s248">So finally he’s – he – he – he was – he was the sweetest man – so finally he consented to get off the ship and we came to my aunt’s house, Tante Eda(ph).</span> <span id="s249">And it was the beginning of a new life.</span> <span id="s250">But he – he – he – his faith was so very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And he stayed a – a Hassid?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And what about your siblings?</span> <span id="s254">Did their faith change at all through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Somewhat.</span> <span id="s256">Their children are – are very religious, all of their children.</span> <span id="s257">My sister and brother-in-law are very – yeah, but they’re not Hassidic or any – and that’s a – neither is my brother, but their children are very, very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s258">And wonderful, beautiful family, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Where in New York did you settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: In Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s261">Bensonhurst, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And talk about th – what was it like as a young child all of a sudden moving to a new country with a new language?</span> <span id="s263">Did you have any trouble adjusting to life in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: I was scared of a new language because I was able to pick it up no matter where we were I spoke hungar – not that I know it now.</span> <span id="s265">But I spoke German and Hungarian and Polish and you know, a little – a bissell(ph) here and a bissell(ph) there.</span> <span id="s266">But when I came to America, I said, oh I’m – I – I don’t know if I can learn the language, I was really scared.</span> <span id="s267">And my cousin insisted that I only speak English in front of him, or wherever I was going.</span> <span id="s268">And then I forgot all the other languages.</span> <span id="s269">I just never retained it.</span> <span id="s270">But my parents took English when we were in Gabersee in the DP camp, and they had a tutor come to the house.</span> <span id="s271">We had a one room place, and he would come to the house and teach my parents English, but it was English English, so it was somewhat different than when we came to the States.</span> <span id="s272">But it never helped, they wer – they managed with – with whatever they could speak.</span> <span id="s273">But one thing about my father, may he rest in peace, and God love him a million years, we came on a Shabbat, on a sa – Monday he already had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Was he able to work in his own field, shoemaker?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Shoemaker, mm-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And what was the reception of the other children at school to the fact that you were a newcomer from another country?</span> <span id="s277">Did they accept you immediately, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Ah, I never looked for it.</span> <span id="s279">I know – I had a small group of friends, but I didn’t have an extended group, so I ne – I never really looked into that.</span> <span id="s280">And I remember being in one class, where the teacher called upon me and asked for me to speak in front of the class, and I really couldn’t because I was so foreign, it was so unrelated to the classroom atmosphere.</span> <span id="s281">I was very difficult, I – I – I’ve always told bits and pieces, but I never – yeah.</span> <span id="s282">I don’t know if I’m even helping you with this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s284">Oh, very much.</span> <span id="s285">And your family, once they came to the United States, did they ever talk about the war years, or did they just put it behind them?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Not for awhile, not for awhile.</span> <span id="s287">Maybe they talked to their family privately, like to their sister – their sisters.</span> <span id="s288">My mother did not have family here – she had a cousin, I take that back.</span> <span id="s289">She had a – a – a – a very Hassidic cousin and an extended family.</span> <span id="s290">She did have a brother in Israel that settled there in 1933, but here in the States, it was mostly my father’s family.</span> <span id="s291">So, I’m sure they talked among themselves, but not really openly, not til later on.</span> <span id="s292">Not til later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: [indecipherable] different question.</span> <span id="s294">At which point do you start to identify – did it strike you that you were a Holocaust survivor and not just an immigrant?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Oh my God, it took years.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: It – I’ll tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s298">Oh, I – it took years, and I know exactly when I realized that.</span> <span id="s299">A number of years ago, there as a Holocaust renu – reunion here in Washington at the convention center.</span> <span id="s300">You must have been a baby then.</span> <span id="s301">I forget what year it was.</span> <span id="s302">I’ll tell you later. ’</span> <span id="s303">69, or maybe seven – well, when a – and I tried to get involved with that, I begged my husband to get involved with that.</span> <span id="s304">And we sang – we went to the – President Reagan spoke then – no, so it must have been much later, was in the 80s.</span> <span id="s305">Okay, early 80s.</span> <span id="s306">And President Reagan spoke in front of the Holocaust reunion group.</span> <span id="s307">And I signed up for a few seminars at the convention center in D.C. And I attended the second generation seminar.</span> <span id="s308">I don’t know what made me do that, but they spoke on children surviving, and families surviving.</span> <span id="s309">And I finally realized – the reason I wanted to get involved in this thing was because I just felt it.</span> <span id="s310">But what I realized at that time, and realized that I am a survivor, was that families of my – of my generation, did not survive.</span> <span id="s311">I realized I was very unique and very rare, because children my age did not survive.</span> <span id="s312">And – and my siblings as well, my sister and brother, who were sent out to God knows where.</span> <span id="s313">And how they reunited with their parents, and how my father survived all that.</span> <span id="s314">We were very unique, and I cherish that in my – in my head, I – I could not believe that as a family unit we survived, you know?</span> <span id="s315">So that’s when I realized I’m a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s316">We were in no camp.</span> <span id="s317">We were in no labor camp, but I think we survived many –</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: And do you think that affected the choices you made later in life, that realization?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: That I-I realized I’m a Holocaust survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Or, having gone through the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Selfishly, I feel like I’m a very special person.</span> <span id="s322">But my everyday life is, I’m just as normal as you or anybody else.</span> <span id="s323">But when I look back on it, I feel very special.</span> <span id="s324">I wish my husband would feel that way.</span> <span id="s325">He’s the silent one.</span> <span id="s326">He does not discuss it.</span> <span id="s327">So it makes our feelings very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s328">And things that I would get more involved in, that I would like to get more involved in, I feel like I can’t because I’m not getting his support.</span> <span id="s329">And he wouldn’t – he won’t accept my support.</span> <span id="s330">He lost his entire family, so he’s – he’s – he keeps everything inside.</span> <span id="s331">And it – I think he did a lot of damage to our children because he wasn’t open with them.</span> <span id="s332">But they always pursue, they always ask questions.</span> <span id="s333">But I find that a very, very difficult part of my life, yeah.</span> <span id="s334">My brother-in-law, he was liberated in Auschwitz, and for many, many, many years he would not speak of it.</span> <span id="s335">Like, I think it was a normal thing of many survivors at that time.</span> <span id="s336">But a few years ago, all of a sudden, everything came out.</span> <span id="s337">Everything came out.</span> <span id="s338">And he had a tremendous i-interview with Spielberg and the – I believe the Holocaust Museum as well, an extended one.</span> <span id="s339">He made several donations to the museum.</span> <span id="s340">I think one of his shirts is hanging there.</span> <span id="s341">It’s – it’s different than the others.</span> <span id="s342">I’m sure you have enough of them there.</span> <span id="s343">So, sometimes I envy people who can really speak out and be noticed for what they went through, where my husband is – yeah, I find that very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And he was from which city?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: He was from Kalomaya(ph).</span> <span id="s346">It was Poland at that time, but that area seems to be changing from the Ukraine, to Poland, to Russia, to Ukraine.</span> <span id="s347">I think it’s Ukraine now.</span> <span id="s348">But he was born Kalomaya(ph), Poland, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Let me just ask if you have any other last thoughts, anything that we didn’t talk about, that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: During the Holocaust period?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: [indecipherable] During the Holocaust, or the years right afterwards, coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: It was like a dream come true coming to the United States, because of all the availability of food and – and whatever we had.</span> <span id="s353">Clean bed.</span> <span id="s354">I remember getting into a bed, into a nice, clean sheet.</span> <span id="s355">That was – that was just delicious, it’s just delicious.</span> <span id="s356">And – and taking baths, that was delicious.</span> <span id="s357">And – but during the war years, I remember a few points where my mother had the most difficult hardships.</span> <span id="s358">How she had to be sent to the hospital because she had a – oh, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s359">Appendix.</span> <span id="s360">She had to have an appendix taken out.</span> <span id="s361">And how that came about, I – I don’t remem – I – I don’t know how she even survived that.</span> <span id="s362">And then one time we were crossing a – a border where she fell and just the difficulty of it all.</span> <span id="s363">And when I watch all these Holocaust movies and stories, so – na – well, I cannot do all of them.</span> <span id="s364">I choose and pick which ones I want to watch, and I don’t put myself in it.</span> <span id="s365">I – I – I can’t do that, because it’s just so horrible.</span> <span id="s366">So I don’t put myself in it.</span> <span id="s367">It’s like surreal, yeah.</span> <span id="s368">So, I hope I was able to help you.</span> <span id="s369">I – I – I really – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Oh, you – you’re very sweet, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s373">And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Firestone.</span> <span
