id="s2">PS: I'm interviewing Mr. Philip Bonner for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s3">Mr. Bonner is a Veteran of World War II.</span> <span id="s4">The date is November 29th, 1990.</span> <span id="s5">[tape off then on] Mr. Bonner, can you please tell me where in Europe, and in what unit, you were serving?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">PB: Yeah, Phil, Mr. Solomon.</span> <span id="s7">I was with the 159th Combat Engineer Battalion, and we were assigned to several corps, troops and several armies, mostly with the Third Army and the Ninth Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">PS: You entered France on the beach in...</span></p> <p><span id="s9">PB: In Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">PS: ...Normandy, was that...</span></p> <p><span id="s11">PB: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s12">We were there.</span> <span id="s13">We entered it there...</span></p> <p><span id="s14">PS: When you...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">PB: ...at Utah.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">PS: When you began your time in combat, were you aware at that time of the concentration camp that you would eventually liberate?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">PB: Never suspected anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">PS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">PB: Never had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">PS: Before, in your travels and combat through France, did you see any evidence at all of Nazi atrocities against humanity?</span> <span id="s21">Either against the French people, or prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">PB: Oh, we ran into one instance in a town as we were movin' up what they call the Brittany Peninsula.</span> <span id="s23">We had broke through and we were opening up a sea port called St. Malo.</span> <span id="s24">S-T, capital M-A-L-O.</span> <span id="s25">And in these towns, I can't recall the name, I think it is Dinan, D-, it's something like that famous song Dinah?</span> <span id="s26">It's D-I-N-A-N, and we were passing through these towns and the French underground realized who we were and they started to help us.</span> <span id="s27">And I think it was the town of Dinan or one of the towns that we had to surround the town.</span> <span id="s28">We couldn't go in and party at night because maybe the Germans would counterattack.</span> <span id="s29">But as the towns moved ahead, and it was either Dinan or up at, near Saint-Brieuc, but the word had passed that the Americans were on their way and the Free French started to take these towns.</span> <span id="s30">And the Free French were shootin' up the Germans and stealin' their uniforms and their shoes.</span> <span id="s31">There was a very scarcity of them hobnailed shoes that they wore.</span> <span id="s32">And the Germans, before we got there, we just didn't know what directions we were moving, and neither did they.</span> <span id="s33">But I guess they took it upon themselves that we were moving in great force.</span> <span id="s34">But there was only 550 of us.</span> <span id="s35">And we were playing cat and mouse.</span> <span id="s36">Our main objective was to get to Brest and open that sea port up.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">PB: So, this town was taken by the French underground, and the Germans did counterattack, and captured a lot of these Free French.</span> <span id="s39">And what they did is the same thing that the French did to them.</span> <span id="s40">They hung them on the poles, and they took all their clothes and they were gonna wipe out all the men in the town.</span> <span id="s41">Now whether we, we didn't know to find out, but there was an awful lot of Free French hangin' from poles.</span> <span id="s42">So, there was atrocities there.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">PS: Did you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">PB: Yes, we cut them down, but we couldn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">PS: Yeah, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s46">PB: ...stay to bury them.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">PS: ...Free French...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">PB: Free French underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">PS: ...who had been fighting...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PB: Well, once they found out, maybe they were fighting on their own, but they sort of came to, they wanted to hook up.</span> <span id="s51">A matter of fact, we did take some with us when we went up to Brest, and even through France we took some...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">PS: Some of the Free French.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">PB: Free French.</span> <span id="s54">As long as we knew that they were all right.</span> <span id="s55">We didn't know whether they might be spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">PS: Were they uniformed?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">PB: No, no uniforms.</span> <span id="s58">No, they had some type of a, we call them grease guns, that fired something like a .45 bullet.</span> <span id="s59">And they had a lot of them and grenades.</span> <span id="s60">And they helped us knock out one of the roadblocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">PS: Was that similar to the weapon we had we called "grease guns"?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">PS: It was a .45 caliber...</span></p> <p><span id="s64">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">PS: Automatic...</span></p> <p><span id="s66">PB: Yeah, it looked like...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">PS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s68">PB: It wasn't a pistol.</span> <span id="s69">It was a gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">PB: Something, looked like something like you would grease a car with.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">PS: Yeah we called them, in fact that was my personal weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">PB: Was it?</span> <span id="s74">Yeah, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">PS: We called them grease guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">PB: Well this is what the French, they must have [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">PS: It was like a Tommy gun only all...</span></p> <p><span id="s78">PB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">PS: ...metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">PB: But it didn't have like a wooden stock in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">PS: Yeah, that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">PB: It just had like a..</span> <span id="s83">.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">PS: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">PB: ...little metal in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">PS: That was my...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">PB: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">PS: ...personal weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">PB: Right.</span> <span id="s90">Well then you are familiar with it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">PS: So, going through France you did see that as one example...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">PB: Oh yeah, and where they...</span></p> <p><span id="s93">PS: ...of Naz-...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">PB: Cut all their women's hair off.</span> <span id="s95">Now, the French would get a hold of the women as we would capture them, and they would take them and undress them and cut all their hair off.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">PS: Did you see any...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">PB: And put them in the street.</span> <span id="s98">But they didn't torture them though.</span> <span id="s99">But I, we heard that they were torturing the French.</span> <span id="s100">We didn't witness it with our eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">PS: Then you entered Germany, and what area did you cross from France into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">PB: Well, what we did is when we first went into Germany here, we were at Bastogne in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s105">You know, we held a, the line there.</span> <span id="s106">And we did get commendation from a general.</span> <span id="s107">It's in our book here.</span> <span id="s108">He came back and said that we're one of the, oh yeah, the only outfit that he knew--he was I think general of the Sixth Army--that we're the only outfit that advanced on the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s109">We're the only ones that advanced on.</span> <span id="s110">And he brought us two cases of champagne.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">PS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s112">PB: I could read it to you later.</span> <span id="s113">But then, after Bastogne and the Battle of the Bulge we moved along into Germany and there was towns here, from Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s114">We went into Burg, Rhineland.</span> <span id="s115">And then we assaulted along the Mosel River and we captured a town called Koblenz, where the Mosel and the Rhine River came together.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">PB: And an infantry division hooked up with us.</span> <span id="s118">And then we were gonna go up and see if we could hold on to the Remagen Bridge, but they brought part of our outfit back, and Patton gave us orders to assault at night with assault boats at a town called Boppard.</span> <span id="s119">We assaulted with the 87th Division.</span> <span id="s120">It's a town, I think it's capital B-O-P-P-A-R-D.</span> <span id="s121">And we assaulted at night.</span> <span id="s122">And they told all the Christian boys and the Jewish boys to make sure that, you know, we see our rabbis and see the priest and things, because they expected 95% casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">PS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s124">PB: And I know why, because when we took the 87th across that night, the tracers, what saved our lives is the guns were set back on a line hill, and a 30 millimeter, something like our 50 caliber shell...</span></p> <p><span id="s125">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">PB: ...ricocheted off the roadside, and we were in these low, small, flat boats, and we had twelve men and two engineers.</span> <span id="s127">And then all of a sudden flares went up just like day light.</span> <span id="s128">But the tracers were...</span></p> <p><span id="s129">PS: Oh, the German flares.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">PB: German flares.</span> <span id="s131">They set them off.</span> <span id="s132">And there was barges all sunk...</span></p> <p><span id="s133">PS: That was the, what, Mosel River?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">PB: No, this was the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">PS: Oh, the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">PB: This was the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s137">Yeah, the Mosel was not too much trouble.</span> <span id="s138">We only had a, encountered a little, you know, fighting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">PB: This was at the Rhine River proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">PS: Then you...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">PB: That's when we...</span></p> <p><span id="s143">PS: Went deeper into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">PB: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">PS: At that time, when you were fighting within Germany, were you aware of the mass murder of millions of people as we later found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">PB: No.</span> <span id="s147">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">PS: You didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s149">PB: No.</span> <span id="s150">And according to these pictures I have here, I had a big brown camera.</span> <span id="s151">They called it a Brownie.</span> <span id="s152">It was a square box camera.</span> <span id="s153">And I was forbidden under law that I be shot if I took any pictures before we got into Germany.</span> <span id="s154">We got permission when we opened up this prison camp.</span> <span id="s155">That was, the infantry had gone in with the tank corps, and they were burying the bodies then, with bulldozers.</span> <span id="s156">Then, I have pictures I had here I took with...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">PB: ...this brown camera.</span> <span id="s159">You see them with your naked eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">PB: These pictures here.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">PS: Before you reached the concentration camp, did you liberate any prisoner-of-war-camps or...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">PB: No, we did liberate some of the prisoners who were working along railroads.</span> <span id="s164">And they were in all different kinds of, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s165">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">PB: Work...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">PS: They were mostly...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">PB: Eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">PS: What nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">PB: I would say Canadian, French, British, Australian, some Americans.</span> <span id="s171">But they were a little better fed.</span> <span id="s172">They musta got a piece of bread or something and a cup of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">PS: Yeah, I was just gonna ask you...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">PB: But they had all different kinds of...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">PS: About their physical...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">PB: They had of a, they musta gave them something to eat, these...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s178">What type of a..</span> <span id="s179">.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">PB: To keep the railroad going.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">PS: Oh, they were working, doing the rail...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">PB: Repairing...</span></p> <p><span id="s183">PS: Railroads.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">PB: Roads and railroads.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">PB: Well we would encounter maybe two or three hundred of them along the railroad.</span> <span id="s187">They didn't know who we were either, and then they found out we could speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">PB: They realized we were Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">PS: They were mostly prisoners-of-war or civ-...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">PB: Yeah, they had a..</span> <span id="s192">.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">PS: Slave laborers?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">PB: No, they were prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s195">This was slave labor in the prison camp we opened up with the infantry, called Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">PS: But at that point you had not heard, you knew nothing at all...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">PB: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">PS: ...about concentration camps...</span></p> <p><span id="s199">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">PS: Or that there had been mass murder...</span></p> <p><span id="s201">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">PS: ...of millions?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">PB: No.</span> <span id="s204">But we did, I heard that they did take the Burgermeister [mayor] from a town outside of Buchenwald and they brought him in, which is only about 17 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s205">And him and the wife, they showed him the atrocity.</span> <span id="s206">And he went home--they say, now I didn't see it with my own eyes--and hung himself with piano wire.</span> <span id="s207">But he didn't realize...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">PS: I heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">PB: Yeah, I didn't, I never got to see the Burgermeister.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">PS: So, prior to your arrival, at the site of the concentration camp, about the only liberated displaced persons or prisoners of war you saw was that one, the one incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">PB: Yeah, at Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">PS: The railroads.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">PB: Yeah, the real atrocities where the bodies were...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">PB: ...being burnt and...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">PS: You would say that they were in recently good physical condition prior to...</span></p> <p><span id="s217">PB: Where, in prison camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">PS: No, no, no in the railroad work.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">PB: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s220">No, they weren't...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">PS: Prior to...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">PB: ...what you call healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">PB: But they had a little stamina about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">PS: Yeah, probably because...</span></p> <p><span id="s226">PB: Where they could stand up and work.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">PS: They had to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s228">PB: They had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">PS: Work.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">PS: Now, can you please give the name of the camp that you liberated, and its location?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">PB: Well, we weren't the first ones in there to liberate.</span> <span id="s233">The infantry and the tank got in there before us, but we came up later in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s234">And that there Buchenwald, I'm trying to think what town it was near.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">PS: Weimar?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">PB: I think it was near Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">PS: Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">PB: Yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s239">W-E-I-M-A-R.</span> <span id="s240">Yes, it was near Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">PB: Yes.</span> <span id="s243">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s244">PS: Do you remember the...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">PB: We did go into a town too that we took, it was called Erfurt.</span> <span id="s246">It was The City of Flowers.</span> <span id="s247">And a beautiful city.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">PS: Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s249">PB: Now, we did encounter again prisoners there.</span> <span id="s250">And we had to capture, take the guns away from them and all kinds of cameras.</span> <span id="s251">And as we went up to different doors, this one fellow, who was working on the--we called them Limies, Englishmen, he said, "Aye, bloke, can you get me a Telefunken [brand name]?"</span></p> <p><span id="s252">PS: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s253">PB: I said, "What the H- is a Telefunken?"</span> <span id="s254">He said, "It's a bloomin' radio!"</span> <span id="s255">Well we were smashing any, with short waves.</span> <span id="s256">So I went in one house looking for guns and cameras.</span> <span id="s257">And this German here, he couldn't speak English, and I couldn't understand him.</span> <span id="s258">But when I told the Limey to pick the, the Englishman to pick the radio up, he just had no strength.</span> <span id="s259">So I carried this great, big Telefunken radio out and put in a jeep.</span> <span id="s260">And now we took him out to the airport, C-47s.</span> <span id="s261">They were allowed to take one thing back.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">PB: And he had no possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">PS: Do you remember the date of, that you entered Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">PB: Oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">PS: The approximate date?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">PB: No, but I came in...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">PS: April...</span></p> <p><span id="s269">PB: Wait a minute, I can, here is a date here in our book, Crossing the Rhine.</span> <span id="s270">I have to go back here.</span> <span id="s271">I haven't studied this book or anything.</span> <span id="s272">I haven't studied this book or anything.</span> <span id="s273">Now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s274">Let's see, this is on Hill 313.</span> <span id="s275">This is when we, the Germans came at us in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s276">They came at us in a V-shape, with the S.S. leading them.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">PB: We couldn't believe our eyes.</span> <span id="s279">Well, they had been shootin' our medics along with the 101st.</span> <span id="s280">Some of our outfit was in with the 101st.</span> <span id="s281">So we got word that they were shootin' our medics.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">PS: We must have been very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">PB: We must have been very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">PS: Because we were reconnaissance for the 101st.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">PB: Were ya?</span> <span id="s286">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">PS: In fact we were 101st Cavalry.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">PB: Were ya.</span> <span id="s289">O.K. Well then you knew you had to have a..</span> <span id="s290">.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">PS: And so we...</span></p> <p><span id="s292">PB: Countersign, a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">PS: Yeah, oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">PB: And if you ever mixed up one of these the 101st, they'd put a bullet in your stomach.</span> <span id="s295">Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s296">PS: Yeah, we were in...</span></p> <p><span id="s297">PB: This is what happened here.</span> <span id="s298">See, they came at us in that hill in a V-shape.</span> <span id="s299">We just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s300">But, I can't, now, if you hold on a second I'll find out.</span> <span id="s301">Here's Germany.</span> <span id="s302">Where we got into Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s303">.</span> <span id="s304">We were with the 8th Corps then I think.</span> <span id="s305">We took the 87th Division across.</span> <span id="s306">See, we bounced back between the 20th Corps and the 8th Corps.</span> <span id="s307">Now, with the Rhine here--after the Rhine.</span> <span id="s308">By mid-April the German army as such was broken, and they were in different small groups and let's see...</span></p> <p><span id="s309">PS: Yeah, I believe it was the third week...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">PB: In April.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">PS: The third week of April in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">PB: It says here April the 17th.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">PS: Yeah, that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">PB: It was something...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">PS: That's about...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">PB: It was around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">PB: It was in around that date.</span> <span id="s319">Somewhere, I just can't remember.</span> <span id="s320">It's been 47 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">PS: When you entered Buchenwald, to the best of your memory, can you please describe what you saw at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">PB: Well, when we first entered, the stench was atrocious.</span> <span id="s323">And they were trying to bury bodies with bulldozers.</span> <span id="s324">And then I did--I was allowed to bring out my big square camera, which was called a Brownie then, and I took these pictures that are in front of you here, with the bodies piled up.</span> <span id="s325">And, I took other pictures.</span> <span id="s326">And then we were there a day or two.</span> <span id="s327">And then, and the ones that had strength painted this sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">PS: Yeah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">PB: See, and that's when you stand there with a [unclear] on.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">PS: And can you...</span></p> <p><span id="s331">PB: But then...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">PS: Can you read the sign for us please?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">PB: Yeah, the sign here, I have a [unclear], it says here on a wooden building, "The German political prisoners welcome their American friends."</span> <span id="s334">In other words these were all prisoners of all different nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">PS: And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s336">PB: And even some were Germans that were in there too, but mostly Jewish and Polish and what they call Slovak, Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s337">And we were givin' em K rations and C rations and we didn't realize that it was killin' em.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">PS: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">PB: Because the food was too--and the medics gave us hell; our doctor said, "My God!</span> <span id="s340">They're, they've only been eating potato skins and water and their kidneys, they won't..."</span></p> <p><span id="s341">PS: Yeah, their...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">PB: Well, when someone's hungry, you're gonna feed 'em.</span> <span id="s343">And they were huggin' and kissin' us.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">PS: Even most of the doctors themselves didn't even...</span></p> <p><span id="s345">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">PS: ...realize...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">PB: We didn't realize.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">PS: That there was so little left of the, of their digestive systems so they couldn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s349">PB: They couldn't digest it.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">PS: They [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s351">PB: But they were so happy to get food.</span> <span id="s352">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s353">PS: Now, at Buchenwald, at the time you entered, you saw both some living and, of course, a lot of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">PS: Can you estimate like about how many dead you saw?</span> <span id="s356">That were still hadn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">PB: Well, these pictures I took here, this we-, now the bulldozer, I'd say they were pushing there maybe 100 in at a time, into this homemade grave.</span> <span id="s358">See, I think we come up on 'em faster than they expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">PB: And these pictures here I took, alongside the, these are like a crematory, where they cremated the bodies, you know?</span> <span id="s361">I would say they were in piles of 50 to 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">PS: So you would say there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">PB: Hundreds, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">PS: Hundreds and hundreds of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">PB: Hundreds of bodies, yes, all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">PS: And many had already been buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">PB: Yes, they were trying to bury them.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">PS: Did you see a..</span> <span id="s371">.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">PB: But they tried to cremate most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">Did you see at that time many living?</span> <span id="s375">Survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">PB: Yeah, they were speaking in all different languages, and they were crying, and they were happy, and they were huggin' us and everything, and they just couldn't even describe how happy they were, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">PS: And their physical condition was...</span></p> <p><span id="s378">PB: I never seen anybody, just skin and bones.</span> <span id="s379">Some of them were coming out, just like a skeleton you would see with your skin on.</span> <span id="s380">I never, never witnessed anything in this, like this in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">PS: Can you estimate how many living survivors you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">PB: Oh, I would say there was about maybe 500 or 1000.</span> <span id="s383">How many there were I couldn't, I was just totally, everybody was taken aback.</span> <span id="s384">We just weren't lookin' at numbers.</span> <span id="s385">You know I, everybody was in daze.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">PS: You really didn't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">PB: No, we just were...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">PS: ...the concentration camp was here until you really stumbled on it?</span> <span id="s389">Were you ready...</span></p> <p><span id="s390">PB: Well, no, no.</span> <span id="s391">We were always sent to where there was trouble...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">PB: Our outfit.</span> <span id="s394">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">PS: Well [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s396">PB: We never knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">PS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s398">PB: But we weren't the first ones to get in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">PB: Now, the infantry opened it up, broke the locks on the gate and, we got in there, you know, like late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s401">We were always at different locations, our outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">PB: We were like a bastard battalion.</span> <span id="s404">Wherever they needed us.</span> <span id="s405">And they told us that they needed us over at the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">PS: Do you think that many of the living survivors you saw later succumbed because their condition was too far gone to be saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">PB: I would say that, lack of food.</span> <span id="s408">Yes.</span> <span id="s409">I would say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">PS: You believe that this particular camp, Buchenwald, was set up for mixed groups?</span> <span id="s411">You say Jews and probably a lot of political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">PB: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s413">They're the ones that wrote on here...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">PS: All...</span></p> <p><span id="s415">PB: Anybody that was against his party.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">PB: Yeah, they were stuck in there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">PS: Did you see any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">PB: This I can't truly say.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">PS: Among either the living or the dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">PB: I was just taken aback.</span> <span id="s422">I didn't, I..</span> <span id="s423">.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">PB: Was dazed.</span> <span id="s426">I didn't really know that, whether there was children or not.</span> <span id="s427">I took no notice.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">PS: Could you see...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">PB: To me they were mostly adults, but they were just, to me they were living dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">PB: That's what they looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">PS: Did you see any women, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">PB: I can't recall.</span> <span id="s434">But we did go to another camp, and they were a little, had a little more fat on them.</span> <span id="s435">And we had to strip them down bare.</span> <span id="s436">But we had a line where we couldn't go across, and we're all standing there with the [chuckling] little pencil stickin' out our pants.</span> <span id="s437">And we're throwin' 'em over chocolate bars and oranges and things.</span> <span id="s438">But we weren't allowed to touch 'em.</span> <span id="s439">And then they had to spread their arms and legs and their crotch open so we could spray them with DDT.</span> <span id="s440">And we stood and watched the, and then some of them who could speak English told us that they worked in ammunition; they were fed a little bit better.</span> <span id="s441">And a lot of them got shot there because they would set the shell to go off, there would be a dud.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">PB: And we had many time a dud come in.</span> <span id="s444">And if they got caught doin' it, they were shot.</span> <span id="s445">So they did make the shells for the...</span></p> <p><span id="s446">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">PB: For the ammuni-...</span></p> <p><span id="s448">PS: This was a..</span> <span id="s449">.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">PB: This was a camp all girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">PS: Camp near, oh, oh, all...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">PB: Yeah, it wasn't far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">PS: Near, they were near Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">PB: Near Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s455">Yeah, it was all women in it.</span> <span id="s456">And we had a, we enjoyed watching them get sprayed, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">PS: [chuckles] Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">PB: They were all nude, but they had a little bit of meat on them.</span> <span id="s459">They were nothing like the ones in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">PB: The ones in Buchenwald were just, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">PS: They too were, probably felt a little, fed a little better for, as the railroad...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">PB: Because they were, right.</span> <span id="s464">That's 'cause they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s465">PS: As the railroad people.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">PB: They were working on the ammunition.</span> <span id="s467">Some of them told us that quite a few of them got shot, that they got caught, that, you know, making these shells that wouldn't go off.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">PS: What...</span></p> <p><span id="s469">PB: I think they did save quite a few American lives, because a lot of shells came in dud.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">PS: Were you given any responsibilities at all in connection with the prisoners--with the living?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">PB: Eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s472">PS: I mean as far as caring and...</span></p> <p><span id="s473">PB: No, that would seem to be taken care of by somebody.</span> <span id="s474">It wasn't our outfit.</span> <span id="s475">Maybe our doctors did, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">PB: Our ours was just to help them and say, clothe them, and see that they get washed and...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">PS: Were there any German guards still there when you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">PB: Not when we entered, but we heard that they turned the S.S. over to the people, and they threw water on the barrack floors.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">PB: But the people were gorging their eyes out, the ones that had strength, and pulling their arms off and, so we didn't allow this.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">PS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">PB: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s484">PS: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s485">PB: I didn't see this with my own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">PB: But they said that they let some of the prisoners, they let off some steam, and go after them, the S.S.</span> <span id="s488">They were the [unclear].</span> <span id="s489">See, the S.S. always had somewhere tattooed on them the S.S....</span></p> <p><span id="s490">PS: Yeah, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s491">PB: Thing, under their privates or...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">PB: Under their arm or somewhere they had S.S., and that's how we could tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">PS: Yeah, the, like two lightning bolts.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">PB: Right, that's right, yeah.</span> <span id="s496">So they were the head of the camp, the S.S. was, but there was regular soldiers in there.</span> <span id="s497">But you know they tried to hide too.</span> <span id="s498">They tried to put on prisoners' clothing.</span> <span id="s499">But they eventually...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">PS: Yeah, some...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">PB: They caught them.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">PS: Yeah some of them...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">PB: Well the prisoners knew who they...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">PS: ...tried to...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">PB: Well, the prisoners knew who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">PS: There were I think just a few cases where there were good guards, in other words, that had treated the prisoners re-, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">PB: Like human beings, yea.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">PS: ...the prisoners helped them to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">PB: Oh, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">PS: Probably there were very, very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">PB: Very few, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">PS: Your...</span></p> <p><span id="s515">PB: Well, there's good and bad in all nations.</span> <span id="s516">You know...</span></p> <p><span id="s517">PS: Yeah, there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">PB: I mean they, a lot of them didn't want to go to war, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">PS: So your outfit actually did not come prepared to handle this.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">PB: Nnn nnn.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">PS: As to medical supplies or food?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">PB: Well, that all, it was all brought up.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">PB: Days later.</span> <span id="s525">This was such a shock to everybody.</span> <span id="s526">Everybody was amazed.</span> <span id="s527">Now, a lot of things there you probably never heard of.</span> <span id="s528">But, there was a woman there, and they called her the...</span></p> <p><span id="s529">PS: Oh, the Bitch...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">PB: The Bitch of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">PS: Yeah, the, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">PB: Did you see the lampshade that she made out...</span></p> <p><span id="s533">PS: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">PB: Did you see the fingernails that she...</span></p> <p><span id="s535">PS: Yeah, right, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s536">PB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">She was a bitch.</span> <span id="s538">You know she only went to jail for about five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s540">She was the wife of the Commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">PB: Right!</span> <span id="s542">She was the wife of the Commandant, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">PS: The--I can't think of her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">PB: I can't either.</span> <span id="s545">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">PS: Claus or...</span></p> <p><span id="s547">PB: I can picture, I can visualize her...</span></p> <p><span id="s548">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">PB: And I can't...</span></p> <p><span id="s550">PS: No, I've heard the name so...</span></p> <p><span id="s551">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">PS: At the moment I just can't...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">PS: Remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">PB: You know, it's been 46 years, but I can still picture her face.</span> <span id="s556">I can still see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">PS: Is there anything, Phil, in addition to what you have described, anything else that you saw within the camp that you would like to mention?</span> <span id="s558">You saw the ovens and the crematory?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">PB: Yeah, I seen the ovens, the crematory...</span></p> <p><span id="s560">PS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s561">PB: The gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">PS: You saw the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">PB: Where they--you could see where their hands were...</span></p> <p><span id="s564">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">PB: ...scrapin' to get air, you know?</span> <span id="s566">And, I heard that everybody they put in, there they didn't come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">PB: You know, that must have been a terrible way to die.</span> <span id="s569">They packed them in there like sardines I heard.</span> <span id="s570">We didn't actually see any bodies in these gas chambers at the time.</span> <span id="s571">They were empty.</span> <span id="s572">But we did see bodies in the crematories, you know, where they were, the ovens were still hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">PB: And they were crematin' 'em.</span> <span id="s575">And then we seen where they had piles of little pieces of gold and silver where they knocked their teeth out...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">PB: And things, you know.</span> <span id="s578">Things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">PS: When you and your outfit, your engineering battalion entered, was that, do you recall about how, was it hours, just a matter of a few hours after the first troops entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">PB: No, it was quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">PS: It was the same day?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">PB: Well, according to the way, the information we got, that the infantry had opened it up early in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">PB: And we got there sort of, early evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">PS: In other words...</span></p> <p><span id="s586">PB: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s587">PS: They came in...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">PB: There were soldiers in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s590">So you saw it pretty much in the raw state.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">PS: You know, that what I mean is, there hadn't been much opportunity for a clean up.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">PB: Oh God, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">PS: You saw it pretty much...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">PB: Oh, they were still, they were huggin' and kissin' us and we were feedin' 'em, and, what it was is everybody, the infantry, the tank corps, everybody was just sick at their stomach.</span> <span id="s596">You know, nobody could believe that...</span></p> <p><span id="s597">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">PB: ...anybody could treat another human being like this.</span> <span id="s599">I mean, I was a young kid and we got in fights, you know, in this neighborhood, and we've, you know, we'd play cowboys and Indians, maybe tie a kid to the pole and...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">PB: ...maybe on mischief night pour a little shaving cream in his head, but we never did atrocities, you know.</span> <span id="s602">Nobody would ever think of, maybe you'd see something in a horror movie like this and it'd scare the heck out of you when you're a kid.</span> <span id="s603">But, when you see this with your own eyes, you just couldn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s604">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">PB: Believe that mankind could treat another human being this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">PS: Phil, now what you saw was actually only one of many, many concentration camps, and the dead that you saw were just, well, what I'm getting at, did you in your wildest imagination dream that this was just a very, very small part of the overall atrocity picture?</span> <span id="s607">You saw...</span></p> <p><span id="s608">PB: Well we didn't get any word of the atrocities all through Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">PB: ...until we were in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s611">We had been sent down, we were doin' moppin', and moppin' up, see.</span> <span id="s612">Now, Erfurt was a city of flowers, and then we went in at different cities that were still holdin' out.</span> <span id="s613">And then they sent us down into Pilsen, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s614">And what we were sent down there for is to get the heavy equipment out, machinery and everything.</span> <span id="s615">We had no idea that the Russians were takin' over all these towns that we had captured.</span> <span id="s616">Now, I think we coulda went all the way further and went in further into Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s617">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">PB: But we don't know whether General Montgomery was holdin' back, but they held gas back on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">PB: We were really movin'.</span> <span id="s621">And we didn't get the gas supply because we coulda really moved a lot faster than the Russians were movin'.</span> <span id="s622">But we don't know whether somebody was after headlines or what, but they finally slowed us down and sent us, instead of goin' to the Elbe River, they sent us down into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s623">And we got this heavy equipment and we moved it out on flatbed trucks.</span> <span id="s624">What it was is our officers in headquarters knew that the Russians were gonna take over these sections.</span> <span id="s625">It musta been all divided up ahead of time, you know?</span> <span id="s626">You know, where...</span></p> <p><span id="s627">PS: [unclear], during that period, you still didn't realize the tremendous scope...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">PB: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">PS: Of what later became known as the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">PB: No, never, never, never had no idea that...</span></p> <p><span id="s631">PS: And you [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s632">PB: ...like places like Auschwitz and things were...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">PB: We never knew anything like that existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">PS: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s636">PB: There was, this was a pinnacle of degradation.</span> <span id="s637">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s638">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">PB: Who would ever think that anybody could...</span></p> <p><span id="s640">PS: So when you saw Buchenwald and the atrocities there, you didn't realize in any way that this was just one small part...</span></p> <p><span id="s641">PB: Yeah, we had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">PS: ...of the overall picture of...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">PB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">PS: ...the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">PB: But you know what really surprised me is that this, to find out that there was Germans in there too.</span> <span id="s646">I mean we were really surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">PS: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">PB: But, most of them were speakin' Polish, see, cause some of the Polish fellows in our outfit could speak Polish.</span> <span id="s649">And we had some Italians with, speakin', there were Spanish in there.</span> <span id="s650">But most of 'em that were, were Ukrainian, and of Jewish extraction, and Polish, and German.</span> <span id="s651">And some of them had work duties, and that's how they survived.</span> <span id="s652">They had different assignments, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">PB: They would take the people to the crematories, to bury them and things.</span> <span id="s655">And they survived.</span> <span id="s656">And they were probably the ones that were very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">PS: Yeah, and how the...</span></p> <p><span id="s658">PB: And I don't know how many went through there and got executed.</span> <span id="s659">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">PS: Oh, thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">PB: But they told us that...</span></p> <p><span id="s662">PS: And had liberation been another month or two later, probably thousands more would have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">PB: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">PS: Phil, did the experience of seeing the horrors and the prisoners have any effect on your feeling about being part of the war and fighting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">PB: In what respect do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">PS: Well, you knew, I think you, while you were fighting you had a pretty good idea of what you were fighting for.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">PB: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">PS: Did this in any way show you, say, what you were fighting against?</span> <span id="s669">In other words, you were fighting for, we all know what.</span> <span id="s670">Did this show you that you were fighting, also fighting against probably the most vicious bunch of maniacs, of genocidal monsters that ever existed?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">PB: Yeah, well, we realized after we seen the things, you know, we knew they were good soldiers.</span> <span id="s672">We knew they were tough.</span> <span id="s673">Now some that we had captured, you know, like back in France and everything, they were telling us--they could speak English, like in Koblenz, the officers--that they were glad that it was over.</span> <span id="s674">They wanted no part but they were conscripted and everything.</span> <span id="s675">Well they were telling us and they said that they were glad to see Hitler coming to his knees.</span> <span id="s676">And then when we get into Germany, as we crossed the Rhine River, we found that the people weren't as nice as so many soldiers we had captured.</span> <span id="s677">Some of them were really happy, and one general, when we were goin' up the Brittany Peninsula, even tapped one of our soldiers.</span> <span id="s678">And he surrendered almost the whole division.</span> <span id="s679">And we couldn't tell him that we were only 550 men.</span> <span id="s680">But we did get in touch with headquarters there.</span> <span id="s681">And, but you would take, when we got into Germany, we found out that the people became more harder, and bitter.</span> <span id="s682">They seemed like the ones that were the holdouts.</span> <span id="s683">You follow me, Phil?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">PS: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">PB: In other words, they weren't like so many German soldiers we met.</span> <span id="s686">These were very bitter and, well, holdin' out, even in towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">PB: I mean, even towns that were supposed to surrender, we had snipers pickin' at us.</span> <span id="s689">You know, as we got in further, deeper into Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">PS: Yeah, this was after...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">PB: ...it must have been more...</span></p> <p><span id="s692">PS: After you crossed the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">PB: After the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s694">Very, a lot of them very bitter.</span> <span id="s695">And, well, I found this out, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">PS: Even though for all intents and purposes at that point the war was lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">PB: The war was lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">PS: But they still believed...</span></p> <p><span id="s699">PB: But they still held out, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">PS: Well they were told, I know we, our contact with German civilians, a lot of them told us that they were still being fed propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">PB: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">PS: That we had overextended ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">PS: We had overextended our supply lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">PS: And any minute, you know, it was gonna turn again in Germany's favor.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">PB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s708">Well, you know, some of them were very bitter that a lot of the cities were targeted, and a lot of the civilians were bombed and the factories were saved.</span> <span id="s709">And I said, "That's T.S." And they wanted to know what T.S. was.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">PB: And I said, "Tough Shit," because, "You bombed England and you bombed all these other cities..."</span></p> <p><span id="s712">PS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">PB: "And you didn't care about the civilians there."</span></p> <p><span id="s714">PS: They were very...</span></p> <p><span id="s715">PB: So they didn't want to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">PS: Yeah, they were very, very bitter about the...</span></p> <p><span id="s717">PB: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">PS: ...bombing of the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">PS: I know in some places in Germany when the American bombers were shot down, usually the...</span></p> <p><span id="s721">PB: They didn't [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s722">PS: The crew was not...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">PB: Taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">PS: Not too well, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">PS: Their--what they had, what they hoped for the most was that they would be captured by the German Army...</span></p> <p><span id="s727">PB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">PS: ...before the civilians...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">PB: Before the civilians got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">PS: ...got to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">PB: Yeah, we noticed that when I got into Germany.</span> <span id="s732">We ran into a lot of bitter ones, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">PS: Would you say that just about all the men in your outfit, they acted pretty much the same as you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">PB: Yeah, they were all bewildered, I'd say.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">PS: How long did you remain in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">PB: Just two days, that's all.</span> <span id="s737">Maybe three, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s738">See, I--with a war, you can't go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s739">PS: Yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">PB: You know how you...</span></p> <p><span id="s741">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">PB: You never keep track of anything, because you're constantly, what we were constantly watching for is, you're always on a, your eye, you're right now is hunting season for deer.</span> <span id="s743">You always got your ears and eyes open.</span> <span id="s744">You never know when you're gonna get- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s745">PS: Side two, Phil Solomon interviewing Mr. Philip Bonner.</span> <span id="s746">You were saying, Mr. Bonner?</span> <span id="s747">I've just asked you, well you were s-, mentioning about conditions when we completed the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">PB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">PS: To continue, I had just asked you how long you remained in the camp, and has it had any influence on your thinking as you look back on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">PB: Well, my nerves were shot after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">PB: And I was in a hospital there for about a month.</span> <span id="s753">And I did receive what they call shock treatment, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s754">Yeah, I was in a Veteran's Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">PS: And you would say that that was due to your own personal experiences in combat...</span></p> <p><span id="s756">PB: Yeah, in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">PS: As well as what you saw...</span></p> <p><span id="s758">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">PS: So that this was all...</span></p> <p><span id="s760">PB: But this was all built up when I went back to make up my high school credits, and went to the University of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s761">And my nerves cracked.</span> <span id="s762">You know, I just, I think it all piled up and I had what they called a slight nervous breakdown.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">PS: I hate to ask you this...</span></p> <p><span id="s764">PB: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">PS: But I myself, you went through pretty much the same experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">PS: Do you still have remembrance, recollections of this?</span> <span id="s768">Does it go through your mind or...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">PB: Yeah, but not as, as the years go on not as vivid as I did the first ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">PS: But you can still...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">PB: I even had bad dreams and...</span></p> <p><span id="s772">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">PB: Bad things, I, yeah, like a, friends dyin'.</span> <span id="s774">I had, one of my best friends died beside me in the Battle of the Bulge, beside me.</span> <span id="s775">We played football together, but he was a much better football, he made All Public for John Bartram in 1942.</span> <span id="s776">His name was Joe Collins.</span> <span id="s777">We went to West Catholic.</span> <span id="s778">And we couldn't make the team, because you had to be real big.</span> <span id="s779">And we were small.</span> <span id="s780">We went to this new high school called John Bartram High School.</span> <span id="s781">And he made the team, and I went back to West Catholic.</span> <span id="s782">And he made All Public.</span> <span id="s783">And we were like brothers together.</span> <span id="s784">And when shrapnel took his head off that kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s785">PS: Ohh.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">PB: ...made my nerves, the shrapnel just took his head off in the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">PS: So this did stay with you...</span></p> <p><span id="s788">PB: Yeah, for...</span></p> <p><span id="s789">PS: For...</span></p> <p><span id="s790">PB: Quite a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">PS: A long period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">PB: Yeah, yeah, about 15, 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">PS: Did you talk much?</span> <span id="s794">Again, you know, I..</span> <span id="s795">.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">PB: Not when I first came back...</span></p> <p><span id="s797">PS: Don't like to...</span></p> <p><span id="s798">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">PB: And I think after 20 years I did.</span> <span id="s801">I started to tell people.</span> <span id="s802">As a matter of fact I lost a lot of these pictures.</span> <span id="s803">When I had the reunion, this fellow lent me these pictures.</span> <span id="s804">I mailed him these, and you seen where I had some saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">PB: And as a matter of fact, I had one where a Messerschmidt was shot down in Germany.</span> <span id="s807">And a, I'm standing there and I got a German paratrooper jacket on, and I got two pistols.</span> <span id="s808">I had a P-38 and a Luger on each side.</span> <span id="s809">And my dad has sent me sea [unclear].</span> <span id="s810">And I had these put away down our cellar back over a little street over here I used to live, called Eden Street.</span> <span id="s811">And a sewer pipe broke.</span> <span id="s812">I made seats over top [unclear], and I didn't realize it, and it ruined a lot of these pictures I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">PB: And I..</span> <span id="s815">.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">PS: That's...</span></p> <p><span id="s817">PB: I was, and I, this fellow let me at the reunion take these pictures, because I mailed them to him, and he, I gotta mail these back to him.</span> <span id="s818">So, this is the ones at Buchenwald, all right.</span> <span id="s819">But I did want that one standin' [chuckling], it looked like I had shot the plane down!</span> <span id="s820">Well, it was still smokin'.</span> <span id="s821">But I didn't shoot it down.</span> <span id="s822">It got shot down.</span> <span id="s823">But it landed in a field and I had my picture taken on the wing of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">PS: And you do not mourn the loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">PB: Right, oh, I did.</span> <span id="s826">I kind of a, to me that was a, sort of a picture and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">PS: Did your, can you explain in any way in your own mind the German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps and this horrible atrocities committed on fellow humans in...</span></p> <p><span id="s828">PB: I have no idea what would go through a man's mind to do things like this.</span> <span id="s829">He had to be a real sick man.</span> <span id="s830">You know, I mean, he had to be possessed, as we would say in the goiya faith, in Christian faith...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">PB: He was possessed by the devil.</span> <span id="s833">You know, he must have been.</span> <span id="s834">You know, I mean, nobody could, how could anybody do anything like this to a human being?</span> <span id="s835">Not one, but thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s836">I mean, how did that man sleep at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">PS: And this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s838">PB: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">PS: And here was a country, too, that was deep in religion...</span></p> <p><span id="s840">PB: Oh very deep, beautiful churches.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">PB: As a matter of fact, in our religion, we took food over to a woman, and I used to tell the wife about her.</span> <span id="s843">And this fellow says to me, "Let's go over and see Theresa Newman."</span> <span id="s844">So I thought it was a girl.</span> <span id="s845">So we're--we had some chocolate bars, you know how, and these little packs of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s846">Remember the ones, the little ones they gave...</span></p> <p><span id="s847">PS: Yeah, the, with rations...</span></p> <p><span id="s848">PB: So I had to hand him some oranges and we happened to get some sugar.</span> <span id="s849">And I thought we're going to go to see a German broad [chuckling].</span> <span id="s850">You know, and we hadn't touched any because they were, they had no soap or anything.</span> <span id="s851">But he said, "This Theresa Newman's somethin' special."</span> <span id="s852">So we get in a jeep and we go and see her.</span> <span id="s853">Here it's a woman who has a, the marks, we call them stigs, stigmatas.</span> <span id="s854">She said she lives on the Holy Eucharist and water.</span> <span id="s855">So I thought she was B.S.'n us.</span> <span id="s856">But we couldn't touch her.</span> <span id="s857">We talked to her through an interpreter.</span> <span id="s858">And she told us, "The German people are hungry.</span> <span id="s859">Take the food to them."</span> <span id="s860">So we had these, remember the ten-in-one rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">PS: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">PB: And the K rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">PB: So we distribute them to the German people, and a priest told us that he had five priests that got put in Buchenwald that were executed--five priests.</span> <span id="s865">So, he didn't care about religion or nothin'.</span> <span id="s866">And they say he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s867">PS: Oh no, there were many...</span></p> <p><span id="s868">PB: They say he was a Catholic years ago, that nut.</span> <span id="s869">He was a paper hanger or something, wasn't he?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">PS: Yeah, he started like as a painter and...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">PS: ...paper hanger.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">PB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s874">I don't know what faith he was, if he was a Catholic, but they say he was a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">PS: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">PB: And he would do this to his own people too, I mean, put priests.</span> <span id="s877">You'd think he would have respect for religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">PS: See, I've read that he believed that he himself had the power of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">PB: Did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">PS: That people, when he conquered the world, that he would be the deity himself, that he would be God that people...</span></p> <p><span id="s881">PB: See?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">PS: ...would...</span></p> <p><span id="s883">PB: Well there's all kinds of bed bugs...</span></p> <p><span id="s884">PS: ...be worshiping.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">PB: ...like that.</span> <span id="s886">I can't, Phil, I just feel, I just can't imagine how man can create in the back of their mind to do things against men that way.</span> <span id="s887">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">PS: Now, for many, for a long time, you really couldn't speak about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">PB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">PS: Do you feel now the compulsion that we who were witness...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">PB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">PS: ...should, really should speak about it because...</span></p> <p><span id="s893">PB: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">PS: Even while there are now, say a half a million witnesses who saw this...</span></p> <p><span id="s895">PB: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">PS: ...already there are the, those who claim that it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">PB: Who?</span> <span id="s898">Who've seen it?</span> <span id="s899">My God!</span></p> <p><span id="s900">PS: No, no, no, no, not those who saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">PB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">PS: No, I mean like neo-Nazi...</span></p> <p><span id="s903">PB: Oh, these younger generation in Ger-...</span></p> <p><span id="s904">PS: You know, the skinheads...</span></p> <p><span id="s905">PB: Oh.</span> <span id="s906">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">PS: These...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">PB: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s909">PS: You know, supremacist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">PB: Yes, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">PS: And if they have the guts to disclaim that it ever happened, while we and maybe a half a million others are still living who actually saw it...</span></p> <p><span id="s912">PB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">PS: And the German government itself is providing all the facts and figures, and admitting to every part of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">PB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">PS: They have provided Gratz College, our Holocaust Archive Department, with books documenting all peoples who were taken from their homes and transported out of their hometowns.</span> <span id="s916">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s917">PB: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s918">PS: ...even the German government admits to all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">PB: Well, see, don't you think, Phil, that this was built up over the years?</span> <span id="s920">See, they had come from what you call a Prussian people, and their, they used to be warriors, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">PB: And they're very militaristic.</span> <span id="s923">You know, and he just got in there at the time we were sufferin' in this country too, a Depression, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">PB: And the country was probably poor, and he came along, and he got this government goin', and he started this Stormtrooper stuff, what they call the S.S., you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">PB: And he had this party, and what he did is he just grew it up over night, like a mushroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">PS: Yeah, it started with a little handful.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">PB: A little handful.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">PS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s931">PB: And he got so big so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">PS: Germany was just ripe.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">PB: Just ripe at the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">PS: After you left Buchenwald...</span></p> <p><span id="s935">PB: Because we had some German fellows in our outfit.</span> <span id="s936">They were very good, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s937">PS: Oh yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">PB: An interpreter and everything.</span> <span id="s939">And man, they hated Hitler with a passion.</span> <span id="s940">He says, "You know, it's givin' our people a bad name."</span> <span id="s941">We had Germans in our outfit.</span> <span id="s942">You know, they used them to try to decipher or when we got prisoners to talk to them.</span> <span id="s943">You know, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s944">PS: Was there any...</span></p> <p><span id="s945">PB: You know, not all the German people were that bad, you know.</span> <span id="s946">It's like anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">PS: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">PB: We got, like I'm part Irish and part Swedish.</span> <span id="s949">We got bastards in our family line.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">PS: Oh in all, in mine and everybody...</span></p> <p><span id="s951">PB: Oh, you find 'em, sure, everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">PS: Everybody else's.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">PB: But see how this nut got into power, my God, I can't figure it out.</span> <span id="s954">He's nothing but a two-bit wallpaper guy.</span> <span id="s955">How he got in power I don't know.</span> <span id="s956">He must have been brilliant to take over.</span> <span id="s957">The power of the country must have been really weak at the time, don't you think, Phil?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">PS: Yeah, I guess Germany, see they, I think they too, not that I'm a historian, but I think they blamed a lot of their difficulties on the penalties inflicted on them as a result of losing World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">PB: I heard this, yeah.</span> <span id="s960">I heard this.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">PS: And I think by World War II they, I don't think they in any way conceived that they could possibly lose the war, and they would regain...</span></p> <p><span id="s962">PB: The world.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">PS: Everything, the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">PB: Just think...</span></p> <p><span id="s965">PS: Do you know if...</span></p> <p><span id="s966">PB: ...if that nut woulda got a hold of the A-bomb, eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">PS: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">PB: Oh, he woulda wiped us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">PS: And he wasn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s970">PB: You know, we did capture some towns that were in a cave, that they were supposed to be makin' this heavy water.</span> <span id="s971">And I didn't know what the hell heavy water was.</span> <span id="s972">I heard 'em talkin' about it.</span> <span id="s973">One time we were down in Tennessee takin' maneuvers.</span> <span id="s974">And we had to guard a plant called Oak Ridge.</span> <span id="s975">And I heard they were makin'...</span></p> <p><span id="s976">PS: Yeah, that's Oak Ridge.</span> <span id="s977">I remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s978">PB: Yeah, you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">PS: The name.</span> <span id="s980">Well, I remember the, you know, Oak Ridge...</span></p> <p><span id="s981">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">PS: In Tennessee.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">PB: And we were guardin' that for about a week one time.</span> <span id="s984">We had to guard that one night when we were on maneuvers.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">PS: Do you know if the experience your outfit had with Buchenwald, do you know if that became a part of your regimental history?</span> <span id="s986">The book you have is that mentioned?</span> <span id="s987">The book...</span></p> <p><span id="s988">PB: Yeah, the 159th.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">PS: All your engineer...</span></p> <p><span id="s990">PB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s991">It does have it here on a map as a, right here, see we have all the, see this little, where the heck's this little map?</span> <span id="s992">It's drawn where we all were travelin'.</span> <span id="s993">See, we were the first outfit to break through the German lines in Saint Lô.</span> <span id="s994">See, here we are pinned down.</span> <span id="s995">This is what we used to do, open up these road blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">PB: See?</span> <span id="s998">This was that Company A, that was our Company, at Saint-Malo.</span> <span id="s999">We were pinned down here, but we had to blow these apart to keep the army goin'.</span> <span id="s1000">We did lose through snipers.</span> <span id="s1001">You see here?</span> <span id="s1002">This was out in a, see how they used to put the railroad ties in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">PS: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">PB: So we used to get, see this is a mine detector.</span> <span id="s1005">Now here we are, the ones, you know, and this is right before we went across at Boppard.</span> <span id="s1006">See them all kneelin' there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">PS: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">PB: They, now these boats came up, but they came up three days later.</span> <span id="s1009">The Navy brought them up.</span> <span id="s1010">We had already had the Army in, the 87th across.</span> <span id="s1011">The Navy was supposed to bring.</span> <span id="s1012">Now they woulda got hit.</span> <span id="s1013">They were that high.</span> <span id="s1014">We had these, you ever see these little fishin' boats...</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">PS: Oh yeah, this is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">PB: ...they sell in Sears?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">PB: Well that's what we went across in.</span> <span id="s1019">And we, they wanted us to take motors.</span> <span id="s1020">But we wanted to go across real quiet the Mose-, eh, Rhine River.</span> <span id="s1021">But I think the Germans were signaling, because as we started to go across with the infantry, we had paddles, and then they put on mae west [inflatable life jacket].</span> <span id="s1022">Remember they used to call these?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">PS: Yeah, the mae west.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">PB: The mae west...</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">PS: Were the beachheads established when you put the bridge in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">PB: No, we established the beachhead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">PB: We established it.</span> <span id="s1029">But we went across at night, and these bells started to go off on these barges that were sunk, these coal barges.</span> <span id="s1030">And they all started to go along simultaneously.</span> <span id="s1031">And some one hollered out, "There musta be, there, or a signal on the other side."</span> <span id="s1032">We said, "Oh, no, no, no, we don't need--they can't even see us."</span> <span id="s1033">We had our faces all dark and we had the infantry in front.</span> <span id="s1034">And we're paddlin' across.</span> <span id="s1035">And you know, the current's pretty...</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">PS: Oh I know when we crossed the Rhine...</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">PB: Yeah!</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">PS: I [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">PB: Oh, that current was wicked.</span> <span id="s1040">So, when we crossed at night, we took this 87th across.</span> <span id="s1041">All of a sudden we're out in the middle and these flares shot up, just like daylight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">PS: German flares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">PB: German flares!</span> <span id="s1044">And they took their time comin' down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1046">While, it was [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">PB: And, oh, I knew we were done, but the only thing that saved us is they set their guns back in the [unclear] too high.</span> <span id="s1048">And the bullets were ricocheting off the road.</span> <span id="s1049">And we were low enough.</span> <span id="s1050">Now these here comin' up, that would have been just high enough.</span> <span id="s1051">We woulda caught them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">PS: Eh, Phil...</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">PB: But, we do mention in this map here where Buchenwald is, and let me show you the map, O.K.?</span> <span id="s1054">Now where, what the heck did I do with the map?</span> <span id="s1055">Here's our map of our outfit here.</span> <span id="s1056">See, here's pictures of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1058">Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">PB: You see, these are other pictures of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">PS: Oh, that's in your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">PB: That's in our book, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">PB: We Saw Germany.</span> <span id="s1064">See, the trucks [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">PS: That is mentioned and also photographed and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">PB: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">PS: Phil, how long did you remain in Europe after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">PB: What we did, Phil, is that they took us back to a town called Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">PS: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">PB: In Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">PS: Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">PB: And we used to go in the morning with our trucks, and the British were up there.</span> <span id="s1073">And we used to get 25 to each man.</span> <span id="s1074">I'd have 25 prisoners.</span> <span id="s1075">And I would have them all day.</span> <span id="s1076">And we would go to this compound and put them on the trucks.</span> <span id="s1077">And I'd have a pistol and a carbine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">PS: These were German prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">PB: German prisoners, right.</span> <span id="s1080">Now they didn't want to escape, because the war's over.</span> <span id="s1081">What good would it do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">PS: Yeah, there's no place...</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">PB: No place to go, and they were eatin' good.</span> <span id="s1084">And we built what they call nissen huts.</span> <span id="s1085">They would dig out the dirt...</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">PB: And then put in a foundation and put in a pipe for the plumbing, and then put some bolts up where they could put the beams.</span> <span id="s1088">Then a, in two days they could put a nissen hut [prefabricated shelter of corrugated iron with a cement floor] up, 25 men.</span> <span id="s1089">And that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1090">We built a camp what they call a dedownbarkation [phonetic] camp.</span> <span id="s1091">They come back with all the tanks and the jeeps, and they'd leave them in the fields.</span> <span id="s1092">And we would build this camp.</span> <span id="s1093">It was called Prince Top Hat [phonetic], you know?</span> <span id="s1094">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">PS: Yeah, we did exactly, we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">PB: You did the same thing too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">PS: We were scheduled for re-deployment to the Pacific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">PB: Oh, were ya?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">PS: So we left our entire squadron of armored vehicles...</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">PS: Hundreds of, you know, tanks, armored cars...</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">PB: The top hats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">PS: The top hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">PB: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">PS: No, this was at...</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">PB: Oh, probably down in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">PS: No, we left all the vehicles at Metz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">PB: Oh did you, at Metz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">PS: And then we were taken from Metz by a long line of trucks...</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">PS: ...into Le Havre...</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">PB: Oh, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">PS: For embarkation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">PB: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">PS: Well, during the period that you were there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">PB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">PS: ...did you witness the handling of any of these concentration camp survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">PB: They treated them, I think, with the greatest of care.</span> <span id="s1119">They were so worried that they were losin' 'em.</span> <span id="s1120">See, they were losin' 'em through us feedin' 'em.</span> <span id="s1121">You follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">PB: And the medics and everybody moved up.</span> <span id="s1124">And Patton came up and all kinds of photographers, and everything come up.</span> <span id="s1125">In other words, the camp was just a Mecca of people, you couldn't believe, like in a matter of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">PB: The place was just nothin' but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">PS: While you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">PB: They, but when we were there, they were, they treated the prisoners the best they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">PB: They didn't realize it there, but they gave us hell.</span> <span id="s1132">The medics gave or chewed our, what we call chewed our ass out.</span> <span id="s1133">"You dumb son of a bitch," they would say.</span> <span id="s1134">Well how the heck did we know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">PS: But they didn't, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">PB: When someone's hungry, you oughta feed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">PS: A lot of doctors, a lot of doctors did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">PB: Sure, we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">PS: They didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">PB: But see, what they had to do, is they had to give them soft diets, I guess like soft bread and soft soups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">PS: Some they were so far gone...</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">PB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">PS: ...they had to feed them...</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">PB: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">PS: ...quite a few intravenously and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">PB: Well you know what I seen too, Phil?</span> <span id="s1147">They were huggin' and kissin' and some of them had human waste around their mouths.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">PB: That, to stay alive, they were eatin' anything, Jesus, God!</span> <span id="s1150">I mean they, could you?</span> <span id="s1151">See, this must have been the plane I was tellin' you about I had a..</span> <span id="s1152">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">PS: Oh, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">PB: A picture on, see?</span> <span

in mind.</span> <span id="s1159">Would you like to add anything at all to what we have discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">PB: No, what I would like to see, if this is going to be going in the archive or anything, is that this should go down in history that this should never happen to a human being again in the life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">PS: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">PB: I think the world should be smart enough to know that nobody should be that powerful that, to do atrocities like this again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">PS: Well, let us...</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">PB: Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">PS: ...hope and pray.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">PB: Let's hope and pray, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">PS:
