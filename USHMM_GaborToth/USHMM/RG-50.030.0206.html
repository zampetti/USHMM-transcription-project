Tell me, when you say "we," were you married by this time?</span> <span id="s53">What was it like first growing up in that family?</span> <span id="s54">About your courtship a little.</span> <span id="s55">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I was originally... You know, my parents wanted me to get...learn a trade.</span> <span id="s57">So I..</span> <span id="s58">.</span> <span id="s59">they send me to the big cities.</span> <span id="s60">First I was in very big stores in Breslau; and after I finished there, they sent me to Berlin--what was at that time the capital...Capital of Germany--where I worked in the largest store...largest firm what was in the wholesale in porcelain.</span> <span id="s61">They always also had to have their own factory; and I took care of the business and I sold there.</span> <span id="s62">And I was very happy there.</span> <span id="s63">But one day, one of my uncles came to visit.</span> <span id="s64">And he said, "Better come home, because this will get worse and worse.</span> <span id="s65">The business...was the time already the Nazis started in 1933.</span> <span id="s66">And it got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s67">So I had to come back.</span> <span id="s68">That was in...in the year of 1926.</span> <span id="s69">And help my father in the business.</span> <span id="s70">So it went...but it went worse and worse, and it was impossible to continue for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s72">So this is in... Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s73">You came back in 1926?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I came back.</span> <span id="s75">I was in Berlin from 1924 'til 1926.</span> <span id="s76">But I came back, because I unk...uh...about the situation, what was very unbearable in the small towns.</span> <span id="s77">Much...it was much worse than living in the big city, what not everybody know the other person.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s79">How do you mean worse?</span> <span id="s80">Because in '26, it was...it not yet Hitler in full power, but things were happening.</span> <span id="s81">That's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s83">I tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s84">The people...it was not Hitler didn't come to power, but also it was the anti-Semitism was very worse.</span> <span id="s85">And they made on the big...opposite our... We was, as I mentioned before, in the main marketplace, opposite the city hall.</span> <span id="s86">And they erected in the...in front of the city hall, a special sign for Streicher.</span> <span id="s87">Everybody knew who Streicher was.</span> <span id="s88">He was one of the worst Nazi.</span> <span id="s89">He had a paper they called the Der St√ºrmer; and the put all the pictures.</span> <span id="s90">And they put on a sign: "Kauft Nicht bei Juden"--"Don't buy in Jewish stores."</span> <span id="s91">So in other word, people should sabotage the Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s92">We were only a few.</span> <span id="s93">We were not many Jews families.</span> <span id="s94">Just a few families.</span> <span id="s95">And there was opposite our store also a little department store belong to Jews.</span> <span id="s96">And they had signs there, and said, "Go to Palestine!"</span> <span id="s97">They put it even in front of the railway station.</span> <span id="s98">"Jews get out!</span> <span id="s99">Go to Palestine!"</span> <span id="s100">So in other word, it was not that Hitler was in power, but it was the anti-Semitism was always in.</span> <span id="s101">.</span> <span id="s102">in Germany a big factor.</span> <span id="s103">It also in this...in this schule, I went there to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s104">In Germany, they call the high school... They don't call it high school; they call it "gymnasium."</span> <span id="s105">And it was when you was only one of the few Jewish people, you got ignored.</span> <span id="s106">Or the people didn't like the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s108">Thank you.</span> <span id="s109">That's very important.</span> <span id="s110">It's very interesting.</span> <span id="s111">Alright.</span> <span id="s112">So it's...so the year is 1926.</span> <span id="s113">You are back helping your father.</span> <span id="s114">What happened?</span> <span id="s115">Now move it forward for us.</span> <span id="s116">Tell us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: What happened.</span> <span id="s118">It...year by year...I mean I tried the best.</span> <span id="s119">We had a big window and one night, the Nazis just destroyed all the windows.</span> <span id="s120">They throw stones and also...what happened...you couldn't have...they brought laws out...you couldn't hire...only employee Aryan people.</span> <span id="s121">That mean...Aryan mean German people.</span> <span id="s122">We had in our household what you call a maid, and the father came there and said...told her, "Get out.</span> <span id="s123">You shouldn't work for the Jews."</span> <span id="s124">So big...so it was the anti-semitism that they all was afraid or there was special to the propaganda was so big that Gentile shouldn't work.</span> <span id="s125">Now I tell you another story.</span> <span id="s126">I used to go in the evening after the store closed to work.</span> <span id="s127">And it was geting worse and worse.</span> <span id="s128">And we know in the small town, everybody knew everybody.</span> <span id="s129">The other...the Gentile people didn't even look at you and didn't greet you.</span> <span id="s130">I remember one night I went to the railway station to pick up my parents who went to the big city...to pick...picked them up.</span> <span id="s131">I was followed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s132">They followed me everyday and they...I was afraid to go out especially in the evening.</span> <span id="s133">It was getting worse and worse.</span> <span id="s134">That what happened between 1926 and '37.</span> <span id="s135">So we had...even my father said, "This business is for hundred ten years in the family.</span> <span id="s136">It should be in the family.</span> <span id="s137">You shouldn't sell it."</span> <span id="s138">Now I have to make an interruption.</span> <span id="s139">When we had our hundred anniversary-- and this was in 1926.</span> <span id="s140">It was a big celebration in that little town, because there was no other business was...was that long hundred years existing.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">So not only the mayor came, and everybody, all the big.</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">the big uh people in the town.</span> <span id="s144">And it was real...a big celebration.</span> <span id="s145">And this paper, the largest paper...there were two papers in the town...they both made all big stories about the business.</span> <span id="s146">They even made the poem and it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s147">And as.</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">as a matter of fact, the editor came the day before to me and interviewed me and the...the whole paper was full about our hundred year anniversary.</span> <span id="s150">But it changed radically.</span> <span id="s151">Just after this, a few years...years later, people didn't come in the store.</span> <span id="s152">In other words, we were unable to exist because people were afraid because our store was direct on the...on the...most visible place at the marketplace so they were afraid to come in the store.</span> <span id="s153">And then became the big boycott.</span> <span id="s154">That was on the 1st of April 1933.</span> <span id="s155">They put Nazis in front of the store and say don't buy at Jews...buy Jews.</span> <span id="s156">So in other words, people were afraid to come and buy.</span> <span id="s157">So in other words, we had to make the very difficult decision.</span> <span id="s158">We couldn't get on see as big...as good as possible and we.</span> <span id="s159">.</span> <span id="s160">uh.</span> <span id="s161">organized a sale.</span> <span id="s162">There was only allowed if the sale is for giving up the store.</span> <span id="s163">So...and that was on the end of 1937 when we had to sell our store, and we had a big house there too.</span> <span id="s164">And, uh, even the people who lived there as our renters were afraid to live in the house what belonged to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s166">So when you sold the business finally, you had to sell the house as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: We had to sell the house, and we sold the house together with the.</span> <span id="s168">.</span> <span id="s169">with the.</span> <span id="s170">.</span> <span id="s171">with the business, and as you can imagine, they gave very little because they know that the...that we had to do it.</span> <span id="s172">So in other words, the price was...was not what the house was worth and what the...what the.</span> <span id="s173">.</span> <span id="s174">business was worth.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Now...you said, now you go to Breslau from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s177">We moved...we moved to Breslau.</span> <span id="s178">That is not far away, is about 25 miles, 35 kilometers, and we settled weeks before.</span> <span id="s179">We went there.</span> <span id="s180">My mother went there and...uh...we found a apartment in a house what were Jewish...owned by Jewish people.</span> <span id="s181">It was next to the Jewish community center.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Who is we?</span> <span id="s183">Who is with you?</span> <span id="s184">Who is part of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: This I tell you.</span> <span id="s186">We were only 2 children, and my parents and...and...my...my...my sister and me.</span> <span id="s187">That was 4 people.</span> <span id="s188">And the apartment was not...it was...belonged to...to others...to...to...to Jewish sisters, so we...we rented it from them, but were were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s189">It was.</span> <span id="s190">.</span> <span id="s191">uh.</span> <span id="s192">.</span> <span id="s193">not big.</span> <span id="s194">It was a few rooms, but we were glad that we was in a, in a place where we...nobody knew us.</span> <span id="s195">And that was the advantage that in the beginning in the big city you could go on the street and nobody called you names of the Jew because in the big city opposite in this war, everyone in the city....this small city had only about 10,000 population.</span> <span id="s196">So in other words, we were relieved.</span> <span id="s197">But it didn't last long.</span> <span id="s198">As you know, that...Hitler gave all the laws against the Jews, and that was in...in 1938.</span> <span id="s199">To just remind you that what happened in Paris, a Jew by the name of Hershel Grynszpan shot an officer in Paris, you know, from the German Embassy.</span> <span id="s200">And then that what happened the Aktion against the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s202">Let's talk about you.</span> <span id="s203">Where were you during Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s204">What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span> <span id="s206">I'll tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s207">When we moved to the big city, I didn't want to sit and do nothing.</span> <span id="s208">So, we had in our business a lot of people what we know who came from the other places and showed what...we had somebody in Breslow who owned a wholesale...a glass business.</span> <span id="s209">So I went to them and, uh, I got a job there.</span> <span id="s210">I worked there to go around in the city...go out...go to several enterprises and sold them...and that what what I did.</span> <span id="s211">Sold the glassware what.</span> <span id="s212">.</span> <span id="s213">what the...what their business was.</span> <span id="s214">And then, in the meantime, the Nazis had prepared also already what to do in the case of emergency.</span> <span id="s215">What did they do?</span> <span id="s216">They had registered at all the Jews at the.</span> <span id="s217">.</span> <span id="s218">the headquarters.</span> <span id="s219">In other words, when the Kristallnacht started and the order by Goebbels to arrest all the Jews.</span> <span id="s220">They had the names.</span> <span id="s221">So they went to every apartment, every house, and picked them up.</span> <span id="s222">But what happened...I wasn't there, because I was in the business--which was about maybe 10 blocks away.</span> <span id="s223">So they came to my father; and they asked him, "Where's your son?"</span> <span id="s224">And he said, "He works in a place."</span> <span id="s225">"Give us the address."</span> <span id="s226">He said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s227">Even if he know, he didn't want to tell them.</span> <span id="s228">So I was safe at that time.</span> <span id="s229">As a matter of fact, when I came home that night they were surprised that I was surprised.</span> <span id="s230">Because I was hiding.</span> <span id="s231">I know what was... what happened, what went on.</span> <span id="s232">So I was hiding in the attic all day, when I went home.</span> <span id="s233">I didn't imagine it would it would continue the next day.</span> <span id="s234">But at first, I want to tell you what happened in the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Just to you.</span> <span id="s236">Just to you.</span> <span id="s237">A: Just to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Just to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: So I had my own room in that building what I told you was just next door.</span> <span id="s240">When in the night, middle of the night, I hear that terrible noise and I didn't know what...what happened.</span> <span id="s241">What happened was that the Nazis came in the back of the Jewish community center.</span> <span id="s242">.</span> <span id="s243">was the orthodox synagogue of Breslau.</span> <span id="s244">And they called it Storch Synagogue.</span> <span id="s245">But the Nazis was afraid.</span> <span id="s246">It was this building was direct in the middle of...of many apartment houses, and they were afraid to put it afire...sit afire, because it would have burned out the whole neighborhood.</span> <span id="s247">So what they did, they just crushed and destroyed the windows and the interior and that was that noise.</span> <span id="s248">But in the meantime, that was the main synagogue that was about 10 blocks away, they called the new Synagogue.</span> <span id="s249">The most beautiful building with a big cupola, and they set it afire.</span> <span id="s250">And this was what I saw and what I heard in the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s251">But the main thing happened the next day, they not only went to the every house...and in that neighborhood, there was only Jews living...in the streets where we lived, but they went also in the street in the buses and they.</span> <span id="s252">.</span> <span id="s253">they caught all on the street.</span> <span id="s254">Jews what they caught.</span> <span id="s255">And brought them...brought them to the police stations.</span> <span id="s256">Now, I tell you what happened with me.</span> <span id="s257">I went the next morning to a business because I was the impression that the razzia against the Jews was finished, but I made a big mistake.</span> <span id="s258">They continued and so when I made the mistake at lunchtime to go out of our complex where the business were.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">When I run direct in the hands of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s260">When I came out I saw four people.</span> <span id="s261">Two Gestapo who just had arrested two Jews.</span> <span id="s262">They asked me, "Are you a Jew?"</span> <span id="s263">Well, no; I couldn't say not.</span> <span id="s264">"So...so come with us."</span> <span id="s265">If I would run away, they would they would have shoot at me...shoot me.</span> <span id="s266">.</span> <span id="s267">shot me.</span> <span id="s268">So there was about.</span> <span id="s269">.</span> <span id="s270">from there a few blocks away was the local police station.</span> <span id="s271">And when we came there we found a lot of people already there.</span> <span id="s272">So they called up the main headquarters...police headquarters...was just opposite where the new synagogue was.</span> <span id="s273">Please send us a big truck.</span> <span id="s274">We have a lot of people here.</span> <span id="s275">And we all was brought to the headquarters from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s276">They took all our belongings and they took the fingerprints and we had downstairs was a big garden or a place.</span> <span id="s277">There was thousand and thousand people and they kept us there the whole day...the evening.</span> <span id="s278">And they had a big reason for that.</span> <span id="s279">They wanted to wait til it was dark because they didn't want to show the population what's going on.</span> <span id="s280">When it was dark, they put us in a big column.</span> <span id="s281">There was a few thousand people and they walked with us through the whole city to the main railway station.</span> <span id="s282">But we came by the...the synagogue and we were so shocked to see what happened to that beautiful place.</span> <span id="s283">It was all burned out.</span> <span id="s284">When we came finally, after walking a half hour, to the main station, there was always already a train waiting so they put us all in a train and in each place they put a special of their people, a police man.</span> <span id="s285">And I was surprised.</span> <span id="s286">I met a lot of people there, and we went...we had no idea where the train would go.</span> <span id="s287">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s288">We traveled the whole night, about 20...over 20 hours.</span> <span id="s289">And finally we arrived at a very famous place, the city of Weimar.</span> <span id="s290">Weimar is very famous by two big poets, Goethe and Schiller.</span> <span id="s291">And we knew exactly that here that city was a big concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: You knew about the camp before you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I tell you exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s294">I knew, because an uncle of mine was about 6 months before there.</span> <span id="s295">And they had arrested him in Berlin and sent him there.</span> <span id="s296">And he died there, because he was on a special diet and he couldn't get the food.</span> <span id="s297">And I went special...I told my father, I went to... When they sent the ashes to Berlin, I went special there; and it was there on the big cemetery in Weissensee (ph) in Berlin and they had a big chapel.</span> <span id="s298">And I had my case...briefcase; but the whole ceremony were observed... witnessed by the Nazi, by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s299">So I was afraid to move around, because they was looking for something.</span> <span id="s300">So that is why I know that my uncle was there.</span> <span id="s301">And what...what was his crime?</span> <span id="s302">He went one evening to the synagogue, he had a yahrtzeit [Yidd: remembrance of a deceased person on the anniversary of his or her death] for his father--my grandfather.</span> <span id="s303">And when he came there, the place was closed.</span> <span id="s304">And he want to know...and he went around to the Gestapo watched him.</span> <span id="s305">"What...what you want to do here?"</span> <span id="s306">So they arrested him; and they took him right away to the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin and they sent him to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s307">And there where he died.</span> <span id="s308">So in other words, I knew about Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s309">I heard about Buchenwald, so he was there before I came there.</span> <span id="s310">So what...what happened now?</span> <span id="s311">We had to ran in Weimar.</span> <span id="s312">They put us in the station; and they warn, "Don't move."</span> <span id="s313">And then we had to run through an underground tunnel.</span> <span id="s314">And there was on both sides Gestapo Nazi men with [Gemitkolben (ph)], with uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Clubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: With clubs.</span> <span id="s317">And they beat us, beat up.</span> <span id="s318">Everybody beat up.</span> <span id="s319">And I know I saw when people fell down, among them was my boss where I worked in Breslau.</span> <span id="s320">He was a wonderful Jewish man and he also died in Buchenwald because they beat him...they beat him to death.</span> <span id="s321">That went before we came to the buses.</span> <span id="s322">Then they loaded us on the buses.</span> <span id="s323">And they shouted, "Don't look.</span> <span id="s324">Don't look on this side."</span> <span id="s325">And I made the mistake.</span> <span id="s326">I looked and they threw a stone at me.</span> <span id="s327">And it was a miracle the stone didn't...didn't hit me.</span> <span id="s328">So finally we arrived in Buchenwald and there was already 20,000 people there.</span> <span id="s329">When we came they didn't know that so many people were coming.</span> <span id="s330">They came from all over Germany.</span> <span id="s331">So the...our place where we were supposed to stay wasn't finished.</span> <span id="s332">And they were still building.</span> <span id="s333">So we...we had to...out...the whole day sitting outside on the grass and sitting and waiting.</span> <span id="s334">Then in the evening we went in that place and people got crazy.</span> <span id="s335">They had around watchtowers and they had a electric fence.</span> <span id="s336">I remember the first three nights was worst night I ever remember because people were not allowed to go outside.</span> <span id="s337">The people lost their mind.</span> <span id="s338">They run around.</span> <span id="s339">There was five buildings.</span> <span id="s340">They run around the buildings and just from the watchtowers, the people on the watchtowers starting shooting them...shot them and the people shouted and cried and I heard that all night.</span> <span id="s341">But the worst thing happened the next day.</span> <span id="s342">We were allowed on the day to go out, but many people didn't go out.</span> <span id="s343">It was terrible cold.</span> <span id="s344">Buchenwald is...is high in the mountains... that camp, and it was special built for this purpose.</span> <span id="s345">What happened people went and went to the electric fence.</span> <span id="s346">.</span> <span id="s347">fence.</span> <span id="s348">As soon as they touched them, they got killed, automatically.</span> <span id="s349">But not only this, everybody who touched this same person got also killed.</span> <span id="s350">When I saw that, how people fell down on the floor.</span> <span id="s351">When they let them laying there.</span> <span id="s352">And it was a terrible sight, but there was a much worse thing.</span> <span id="s353">It was impossible to escape from there.</span> <span id="s354">Every morning we had appeal at 6:00.</span> <span id="s355">They called us out and we had to stay there and they counted us, and when somebody was missing we had to stay there the whole day until they found the person, brought.</span> <span id="s356">But some people were able to escape, and they escaped to Czechoslovakia, and the...the German government what was already the Nazi government demanded to send them back.</span> <span id="s357">So the worse day was...in Buchenwald was when this man was sent back and he was condemned to die on the gallows.</span> <span id="s358">And we were forced...there was an announcement through the loud speaker [and] everybody from all the barracks had to come out and watch.</span> <span id="s359">And, of course, it was a terrible thing to see what happened.</span> <span id="s360">And we were supposed to watch this, the hanging of this man.</span> <span id="s361">So you can imagine what the mood was.</span> <span id="s362">We were not allowed to walk to work because...but they wanted us to do something, so we had to move everyday the stones from one place to the other, to the other corner, and we was busy this.</span> <span id="s363">The food, of course, the food were terrible.</span> <span id="s364">In the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and get the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people, they brought the food.</span> <span id="s365">But, of course, the dishes, we all had to drink the soup from the same bowl-- everybody.</span> <span id="s366">And they gave us [wall fish (ph)]...[wall fish (ph)] food.</span> <span id="s367">So the conditions were worse and worse.</span> <span id="s368">We had special arranged services and the Rabbis there went around and say "Please eat" because there was many people they didn't want to eat the food because it wasn't kosher.</span> <span id="s369">So the rabbis went around and told the people, but some didn't...they didn't do it anyway.</span> <span id="s370">But what happened is that we had secretly arranged services.</span> <span id="s371">Every morning we put outside...somebody watched that nobody came from the...from the people there...from the Nazis...and we had our prayers.</span> <span id="s372">But another thing happened every day on the appell.</span> <span id="s373">On the morning appell, that the Nazi what were in charge, they took off and counted and they punched the people.</span> <span id="s374">So I was smart enough not to stand in the first row that I didn't get punched.</span> <span id="s375">But what happened that the people...the conditions got everyday worse, and people died from starving.</span> <span id="s376">We was...the conditions in the barracks was even worse.</span> <span id="s377">We were laying on just wood.</span> <span id="s378">There was no blanket.</span> <span id="s379">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s380">And there was some people had food.</span> <span id="s381">Some people had money.</span> <span id="s382">They could buy.</span> <span id="s383">So they helped the people, the others.</span> <span id="s384">Now we come to the first Erev of Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s385">I was there; and that was a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s386">We were sitting in our barracks and sung the Hanukkah songs.</span> <span id="s387">And we also had prepared... The people had money.</span> <span id="s388">They brought special cookies and a cake.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: How did they get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: There was a store.</span> <span id="s391">They had a store there; and the people who got money, they could go and buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: But for me, the most surprise happened on the second day of Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s394">In the morning, I heard over the loudspeaker my name called.</span> <span id="s395">And they said, "Please..." Not "please."</span> <span id="s396">"Come all the people..."--I was not the only one--"Come after, to the office."</span> <span id="s397">So when I came to the office, they told me that they got a paper from Breslau, from my parents, that they had booked for me a passage to Panama.</span> <span id="s398">And that was the one what my cousin told him [that] my mother went to the Consulate.</span> <span id="s399">And I have the documents; and so that was the only reason that they let me go.</span> <span id="s400">So after that, in the afternoon, they put us on buses.</span> <span id="s401">They gave us even some money; because it was a long, a long trip with the railway.</span> <span id="s402">So we went first with the bus to Weimar, and they put us there in that...in that train.</span> <span id="s403">On this train, was the first station was Leipzig.</span> <span id="s404">That was a very big city.</span> <span id="s405">It's very famous.</span> <span id="s406">There goes to there every year a very big fair.</span> <span id="s407">And there lived a lot of Jews, maybe...mostly Jews from the east from Poland.</span> <span id="s408">And they had prepared for us a special reception; and they gave us some... And so we was on the, of course, on this station was a very large station.</span> <span id="s409">But I wanted to go out, because I know this city very well.</span> <span id="s410">Because I went every...every year to that fair.</span> <span id="s411">And I went in the night for a walk.</span> <span id="s412">And I was amazed I saw how the Jewish store was all destroyed, all the windows.</span> <span id="s413">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s414">I went all the places and all the streets; and I saw it.</span> <span id="s415">And so it happened in every city in Germany.</span> <span id="s416">They destroyed in the night from the 8th to the 9th of November 1938.</span> <span id="s417">That was the day of the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s418">So they destroyed it.</span> <span id="s419">Then I went back to the station and back to the train; and we arrived in the morning.</span> <span id="s420">In the morning, the next morning, we arrived in the...in the Breslau, in the railway station.</span> <span id="s421">But in...they had told us in Buchenwald before they let us go.</span> <span id="s422">They say, "The first thing you come...you arrive at home, you have to go to the Gestapo and report.</span> <span id="s423">And they will tell you what to do."</span> <span id="s424">But we made a very big mistake, and I make the biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s425">In this...in this.</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">in the station...in the train, we talked to the other people.</span> <span id="s428">And we said, "No, it is Friday."</span> <span id="s429">You know, Friday.</span> <span id="s430">We came on Friday.</span> <span id="s431">"We will go...we will not go.</span> <span id="s432">We will go on..." I mean, Friday night, we thought we wait for Monday.</span> <span id="s433">And what happened with me, when I came Monday to the Gestapo, they said, "When did you come?"</span> <span id="s434">I said, "We came Friday night."</span> <span id="s435">"Why didn't you come the next morning?"</span> <span id="s436">I say the reason was that I was very dirty and all, the...when we was in Buchenwald we had...we couldn't change our clothes.</span> <span id="s437">We couldn't take no bath, no shower; and I wanted to be clean.</span> <span id="s438">But they didn't...they said, "Wait here."</span> <span id="s439">And I waited and waited and waited.</span> <span id="s440">And my parents were worried...were very worried, because I say early I will come back.</span> <span id="s441">So what happened?</span> <span id="s442">It was a Saturday.</span> <span id="s443">And they left me wait the whole morning from 9 o'clock til 1 o'clock.</span> <span id="s444">And then they called me in and said, "Why didn't you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">You know what we will do.</span> <span id="s446">We will send you to Dachau.</span> <span id="s447">To another concentration camp, because you didn't obey the order."</span> <span id="s448">And I was very scared.</span> <span id="s449">So finally I went home, and my parents...what happened.</span> <span id="s450">I had to wait.</span> <span id="s451">I was the last one but everybody...all was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What do you mean were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Everybody was gone.</span> <span id="s454">So finally, we had to report every week.</span> <span id="s455">That was the order.</span> <span id="s456">Every week, we had to come to the Gestapo and tell them what we have done to get out.</span> <span id="s457">That was the condition to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s458">And I was the one who really were in charge, because when the other people came on the day when everybody was asked the most people didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s459">And they threatened them.</span> <span id="s460">But I had prepared already a lot.</span> <span id="s461">I wrote to all the...to all the ship lines and everybody.</span> <span id="s462">And I..</span> <span id="s463">.</span> <span id="s464">they promised me as soon as they have a passage... So, in other words, they were satisfied.</span> <span id="s465">So finally I went to the Gestapo: "Do you have a ship for me.</span> <span id="s466">I want to get out."</span> <span id="s467">So anyway, I got one day a telegram from the Italian airline what was in Munich.</span> <span id="s468">And they said, "We have a passage for you."</span> <span id="s469">It was just a holiday of Shavuos [NB: Shavuot] in the same week; and when I came home my parents were very upset.</span> <span id="s470">I said, "I have...I just got a..</span> <span id="s471">.</span> <span id="s472">a..</span> <span id="s473">.</span> <span id="s474">telegram.</span> <span id="s475">And I went to Jewish Community because I had paid for them a lot money to help me for my immigration.</span> <span id="s476">And what happened, they give me...they gave me the rest.</span> <span id="s477">So they say, "It is too late to come to Munich.</span> <span id="s478">You go direct to Genoa."</span> <span id="s479">Not Geneva...Genoa.</span> <span id="s480">That was the port where the largest ship called the Bianca Mano...the largest ship from the Italian airline...ship line.</span> <span id="s481">And I went...I went with the bus...with the train from Breslau to Genoa.</span> <span id="s482">But in the meantime, we went over the Alps and it was a very long trip.</span> <span id="s483">And they didn't allow us any money.</span> <span id="s484">We were all only allowed one dollar.</span> <span id="s485">That was 4 [deutsche]mark in that time.</span> <span id="s486">And the rest I had to pay for the first train.</span> <span id="s487">So when I arrived, I had nothing left.</span> <span id="s488">So when we came on at night in Genova... It wasn't night.</span> <span id="s489">And we had no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s490">We was a whole...it was maybe 20, 25 people.</span> <span id="s491">We walked around the streets and we looked for a place where to stay.</span> <span id="s492">And all the places were full because this was...thousands of people went there, left there for the trip.</span> <span id="s493">So we went...I went finally I got a room was a attic, was not even a window.</span> <span id="s494">When the next morning I left for the headquarters of the airline what was...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Airline or ship line?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s497">The ship line.</span> <span id="s498">And when I came in the middle of the town, it was a sign at the window "We moved today to the Harbor because on account that the boat is leaving."</span> <span id="s499">So in other words, I had to...to...to walk to the harbor.</span> <span id="s500">And what happened when I came there nobody understood English or no German, only Italian.</span> <span id="s501">Because they had written to me, "Pick up your ticket there."</span> <span id="s502">So finally somebody helped me with the language and I got it.</span> <span id="s503">I got my ticket.</span> <span id="s504">But they say, "Don't go back to the hotel because that you don't miss the ship."</span> <span id="s505">This was in the noontime...in the morning...ship left at 4:00.</span> <span id="s506">And I got plenty trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Because when I left in the morning, I hadn't paid for my room.</span> <span id="s508">And somebody had to pay.</span> <span id="s509">And they looked for me, and they wanted to arrest me.</span> <span id="s510">And, you know, because they said, "Stay here.</span> <span id="s511">Stay here and don't go back.</span> <span id="s512">Stay here, because you are here already; and go on the boat and you'll get there this."</span> <span id="s513">But there was several classes there.</span> <span id="s514">A first class, a second class, and a third class.</span> <span id="s515">And so the other people, they were looking for me; but they couldn't find me.</span> <span id="s516">So when they came on our date, they wanted to get me arrested that I hadn't paid my hotel bill.</span> <span id="s517">Anyway, the trip was very painful.</span> <span id="s518">Because it was terrible hot and we came to the...the...Red Sea, and it...it took a long time.</span> <span id="s519">We was impossible to sleep in the room.</span> <span id="s520">It was too hot.</span> <span id="s521">We had to sleep on the...on the deck.</span> <span id="s522">But finally we arrived in.</span> <span id="s523">.</span> <span id="s524">in.</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s528">Back up a moment.</span> <span id="s529">You had the...this pass to Panama, but you found yourself on a boat to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s530">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I tell you.</span> <span id="s532">That this was only...I met...I got the original document.</span> <span id="s533">Maybe I have it here too.</span> <span id="s534">And what happened they said you have to come in person to Amsterdam and to introduce yourself, you know.</span> <span id="s535">But this was only, you know, a matter to get me out from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s536">I mean because otherwise I never would get out from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s537">So in other words and what many people didn't know, Shanghai was the only place where people could go without any papers.</span> <span id="s538">No visa.</span> <span id="s539">No affidavit.</span> <span id="s540">My parents, especially my mother, they tried to write to all the family.</span> <span id="s541">She had family in America, all over, to get a visa affidavit, but they all was in such a state I mean in such that they couldn't afford it.</span> <span id="s542">So we didn't get no...and that was the only...that is the reason I never had the idea to go to Shanghai because Shanghai had a very bad name.</span> <span id="s543">But Shanghai this was the only thing...and that is the most people who went there, they went there because they had no other choice.</span> <span id="s544">So that's the reason why I couldn't take about from Panama you know.</span> <span id="s545">You want to know anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s547">Can you... We'll talk about Shanghai in a minute.</span> <span id="s548">But you brought documents with you that...that...uh... that allowed you to leave.</span> <span id="s549">Can you show me just the German ones at this point?</span> <span id="s550">I'll deal with Shanghai later.</span> <span id="s551">Just the passes and hold them up and explain what each one is.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: This is the pass, what you call identification, I mean, this of course in...in...German.</span> <span id="s553">And they put...there's a fingerprint and a picture and this is the President of the Police and there's the Jew because every passport had to read the Jew in and say the name on the...all the...uh... where I came for and for Breslau.</span> <span id="s554">So this was the identification to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s555">This is called the Heimatschein.</span> <span id="s556">And this...it proves that I am a citizen, that I am a..</span> <span id="s557">.</span> <span id="s558">was still a citizen.</span> <span id="s559">And that was important when you go outside in other country, that I prove I am a citizen of Germany.</span> <span id="s560">This is here in Chinese, the fingerprints.</span> <span id="s561">This is the identification from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s562">Because we had to, every time we go there to uh...to our uh...uh to some organization or to some office we had to identify that we are allowed, that we as...allowed to stay there.</span> <span id="s563">The picture of the fingerprint and the Chinese, that's a Chinese identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Hold it back up.</span> <span id="s565">Straight like this.</span> <span id="s566">That's right.</span> <span id="s567">And move to your right so the camera can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s570">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: And this is a very interesting.</span> <span id="s572">This is a document, Directory of Jewish Refugees.</span> <span id="s573">That shows you that I am and everybody who was there--there was about 20,000 refugees in...Shanghai.</span> <span id="s574">And everybody...the Chinese government, the government of Shanghai, gave everybody this; because you have to show that.</span> <span id="s575">Otherwise, you would be expelled.</span> <span id="s576">So this is the Directory of Jewish Refugees in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s577">I think that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: This is a interesting document.</span> <span id="s580">This is the Reichlands in Germany.</span> <span id="s581">And this was an application, because they wanted to help the Jews that came from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s582">When they have no other way where to go, [then] Durchgangslager [Ger: "transit camp"]-- that means a place in England.</span> <span id="s583">To go to a place in England, just for the time being to get out from Germany.</span> <span id="s584">And in other words...</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Who made these.</span> <span id="s586">Who created this pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: They created this.</span> <span id="s588">Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutscheland.</span> <span id="s589">This is the main organization who represented the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s590">And they gave that out.</span> <span id="s591">But after I got the idea to Shanghai to go... So many people went there--but only temporary--to England; because England wasn't safe at all.</span> <span id="s592">So I thought...so people asked me--my friends and my relatives-- "Why didn't you go there, instead [of] to Shanghai?"</span> <span id="s593">So I thought they said you had to wait about maybe a month to get an answer.</span> <span id="s594">In the meantime, it was already the rumor that pretty soon the war will bring out...break out.</span> <span id="s595">And I thought I don't want to wait any longer.</span> <span id="s596">The other one I got right away.</span> <span id="s597">And that's the reason that I didn't go to England, and I went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s598">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s600">Let's change the tape now.</span> <span id="s601">They have to change the tape, and then we'll talk about Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s604">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s606">I think we are ready to start again.</span> <span id="s607">Mr. Schnell, would you describe...you have described the ship coming into Shanghai.</span> <span id="s608">Describe what it was like getting off the ship and your first day there please.</span> <span id="s609">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: I tell you when we arrived in Shanghai, of course we was welcomed because we were not the first one.</span> <span id="s611">The interesting thing is there were many people there specially from Austria, Vienna.</span> <span id="s612">And what I didn't mention before, on the boat there was 2,000 refuges...was the largest ship whatever went to.</span> <span id="s613">And there was not a good...uh...uh...feeling between the German, towards, you know, Jewish.</span> <span id="s614">And there their meetings on the boat and we had our meeting....</span> <span id="s615">was not a good relationship.</span> <span id="s616">As a matter of fact, in Shanghai--because we came in...in the middle of '39--we arrived 27 of June, I think.</span> <span id="s617">And the other one, you remember in Austria happened the terrible thing when Hitler came and took over and the Jews...treated terribly Jews.</span> <span id="s618">So in other words, the right of the...the Jews from Vienna, Austria--the many of them went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s619">So they took over the committees and everything, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">They were in charge.</span> <span id="s621">There was already established the Joint Distribution Committee, HIAS; and they had all taken over.</span> <span id="s622">They were in charge.</span> <span id="s623">So they had prepared for us, ordered big trucks where they put us in, and they had already... Already there was many Jews in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s624">They were already a big community.</span> <span id="s625">It was mostly Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s626">The Jews that came from Vladivostok.</span> <span id="s627">And they arrived.</span> <span id="s628">They uh had everything organized.</span> <span id="s629">I just writing a big story.</span> <span id="s630">You know, we have in...in our home our uh wonderful magazine...</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: This is the Hebrew home?</span> <span id="s632">Tell us the name where you live.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: ...called the Resident...Resident High Journal.</span> <span id="s634">And I write...I write many stories of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">And I just this week, I wrote a big story and that fits in this report.</span> <span id="s636">And is called "The Sassoon Family."</span> <span id="s637">Maybe you heard the name.</span> <span id="s638">And I write my own experience, there's also years in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s639">And in that story, I mentioned that.</span> <span id="s640">And there was a gentlemen with the name of Sir Victor Sassoon.</span> <span id="s641">And he is the one who real... The Sassoon family was always famous for philantrophy.</span> <span id="s642">Philantrophist.</span> <span id="s643">And he real did a big job.</span> <span id="s644">I met him right in the beginning, because he provided not only the homes--they.</span> <span id="s645">.</span> <span id="s646">they...they called it, in English, "the camps."</span> <span id="s647">But in...in...in German, "Heime"--that mean "homes."</span> <span id="s648">There was several homes; and they brought us first to a home [in] Kinchow [Road].</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And you now are in Shanghai?</span> <span id="s650">A: In Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: And.</span> <span id="s653">.</span> <span id="s654">uh.</span> <span id="s655">.</span> <span id="s656">but what happened... As a matter of fact, they brought all the most of the Jews...in the beginning, the Jews to a suburb called Hongkou [NB: Hongkew]...Hongkou.</span> <span id="s657">And this is of interest.</span> <span id="s658">The name is the street...after the street.</span> <span id="s659">There was a Kinchow [Road] home, and a Seward [Road] home, Pingliang [Road] home.</span> <span id="s660">So anyway, this Mr. Victor Sassoon, he was the one who from his property he prepared.</span> <span id="s661">So we was in the beginning there.</span> <span id="s662">We couldn't stay there long, because they needed what originally school...school uh there.</span> <span id="s663">But it was beginning.</span> <span id="s664">And it was a nice place; but later on, they put us to uh Pingliang--what I didn't like it from the beginning.</span> <span id="s665">It was the whole ...whole thing I didn't like.</span> <span id="s666">It was far out.</span> <span id="s667">And I thought I would like to get in touch with a family what had a private place, because it's nicer to live...live with a family there in a home.</span> <span id="s668">So what happened, several people had money there in the bank.</span> <span id="s669">And I also got from a cousin, he sent... He was able to...to Holland, to escape to Holland.</span> <span id="s670">And he worked for a big Jewish firm from Breslau, what he sent...he sent money for me.</span> <span id="s671">And I had it there in the Shanghai bank.</span> <span id="s672">So I had a little money.</span> <span id="s673">And I went to a Jewish family--also in Hongkou--and they give me a room in the attic.</span> <span id="s674">So they...they had a restaurant in the...in the...in the first floor, they had a little restaurant.</span> <span id="s675">So that was...that was much better.</span> <span id="s676">But then came the proclamation.</span> <span id="s677">The Japanese put out a proclamation that all the Jews had to live in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s678">And they made a ghetto all the people, the many Jews were able to live in.</span> <span id="s679">.</span> <span id="s680">in...Shanghai in the French Concession--French district in Shanghai--and they all was forced to move back.</span> <span id="s681">Of course, this was very difficult, because they took advantage and...and ask a lot of money.</span> <span id="s682">And I had a few bosses there; because I was lucky enough to get a job...find a job.</span> <span id="s683">And, as I told you before, we founded a kitchen.</span> <span id="s684">We founded after Pearl Harbor a kosher kitchen in Shanghai...in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Before you get to that, tell me about what happened at Pearl Harbor from your end.</span> <span id="s686">Because your memoirs talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s688">I tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s689">When we was in Pearl Harbor, I was already in another...in another camp...I mean in other camp.</span> <span id="s690">And I heard a nice night of Pearl Harbor a very big noise because we didn't live far...very far from the ocean...from the river, Yangtze River.</span> <span id="s691">When we heard what happened, the...the Japanese had sunk British ship.</span> <span id="s692">Shanghai was one of the biggest, largest ports and harbors in the world.</span> <span id="s693">And there was everyday came ships from all over the world, and there was in the harbor British ships and they sunk.</span> <span id="s694">.</span> <span id="s695">sunk the ships.</span> <span id="s696">And went the next morning on the street, I think I went to the service, I was surprised to see Japanese guards standing on every corner and to clear the traffic, and they had taken over.</span> <span id="s697">Before the Japanese had only...they had one section.</span> <span id="s698">But after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese took over all Shanghai and they all... There was a police station there, and they got.</span> <span id="s699">.</span> <span id="s700">took over...and there was a man with the name of Ghoya.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Tell me about Ghoya.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: And he was the most rigorous person you have thought of.</span> <span id="s703">The Jews called him the "King of the Jews."</span> <span id="s704">What happened, get...every Jew, after the Japanese took over, had no right to move freely.</span> <span id="s705">As I mentioned before, when they wanted to go to Shanghai, as I said, we all lived in Hongkou.</span> <span id="s706">Was a suburb.</span> <span id="s707">And they could go on the...on the bus.</span> <span id="s708">They had to have a pass.</span> <span id="s709">And the.</span> <span id="s710">.</span> <span id="s711">Japanese ordered a Pao Chia--that is a special...a special organization what consisted from the refugees.They had to watch on all the exits that nobody leaves...leaves the...the place where they lived.</span> <span id="s712">And what happened, when they had to come and make application to come in the morning to that police station, what I saw it with my own eyes, because the place where I worked was just on the same street.</span> <span id="s713">And.</span> <span id="s714">.</span> <span id="s715">uh.</span> <span id="s716">.</span> <span id="s717">they had to...made application, they had to stand in line.</span> <span id="s718">And he came out, and he punched everybody or hit everybody.</span> <span id="s719">Because if he didn't like a face or somebody and he.</span> <span id="s720">.</span> <span id="s721">they were depended on him to get the permission.</span> <span id="s722">Many of them had shop.</span> <span id="s723">That is the reason.</span> <span id="s724">They had a shop in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s725">But they couldn't own it.</span> <span id="s726">They had to special....every month to get a new...a new pass.</span> <span id="s727">So he treated them...he treated them terrible.</span> <span id="s728">And he came...he came to our kitchen also and to...to...uh...to give the permission of...we have to get a permit.</span> <span id="s729">And he tasted it, you know, and he asked me so many questions about food but I had to answer them you know, because we...we had to have a special permit to have that kitchen.</span> <span id="s730">So anyway I had to go to Police station and get...uh, they interviewed me because he them I am the manager of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s731">So that what happened.</span> <span id="s732">So anyway the refugees had it...had it very hard.</span> <span id="s733">Very hard in...in all the...the.</span> <span id="s734">.</span> <span id="s735">because they were watched...uh...and nobody were allowed to talk anything.</span> <span id="s736">And the same thing happened with the... we had two newspaper...our newspapers, what the refugees gave.</span> <span id="s737">And they were under censorship.</span> <span id="s738">They were not allowed to write anything.</span> <span id="s739">But there was a very interesting thing.</span> <span id="s740">This section where we lived, Hongkou, was destroyed in the civil war in China.</span> <span id="s741">And it was terrible when we arrived.</span> <span id="s742">We saw the whole...the buildings, everything was.</span> <span id="s743">.</span> <span id="s744">was either hole the buildings.</span> <span id="s745">And they had a little street there--at the moment, I don't...the name--and what the refuges did is unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">They made from this condition a wonderful business street.</span> <span id="s747">The people, not only the Jews, they came from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s748">They came special there.</span> <span id="s749">They had wonderful cafes and restaurants and bakeries and grocery stores and that was all...they did it all them by themselves.</span> <span id="s750">They even had in.</span> <span id="s751">.</span> <span id="s752">a night club, where they danced at night.</span> <span id="s753">So that was...people came from all over Shanghai.</span> <span id="s754">And that was a wonderful, wonderful thing what...what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s756">It was indeed!</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: So that was...that was the life in Shanghai, you know.</span> <span id="s758">And uh.</span> <span id="s759">.</span> <span id="s760">in the evening the people went a little out, you know, had a little...went to a cafe and.</span> <span id="s761">.</span> <span id="s762">and...but now one terrible thing happened and that is the most thing what you should know about it.</span> <span id="s763">After the...about in the year 1944, the Americans started to bomb Shanghai.</span> <span id="s764">But one day they made a terrible mistake.</span> <span id="s765">They bombed the...the quarters, the Jewish quarters.</span> <span id="s766">But we knew that the American came every morning exactly at 10:00.</span> <span id="s767">And we were ordered, all the refugees, to go the worse.</span> <span id="s768">.</span> <span id="s769">the biggest jail in that...where we lived...at the biggest jail.</span> <span id="s770">And we have to get there and go in the basement to be protected from the bombing.</span> <span id="s771">So went everything morning at 10 o'clock and we went...we went in the basement and an hour later we went out and everything burned up But one day they came a different time.</span> <span id="s772">And I remember that special.</span> <span id="s773">As I told you before, the kitchen what I had the.</span> <span id="s774">.</span> <span id="s775">was a thousand people.</span> <span id="s776">But the most people 2 Jewish police force in the ghetto which was supervised by the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">didn't own...a few people ate there.</span> <span id="s778">Much of it, they came and they picked up their meal.</span> <span id="s779">And they came from all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: This is the Jewish community kitchen.</span> <span id="s781">This is the kitchen of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s783">Not the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s784">The Jewish community was something else.</span> <span id="s785">But we...we had our own.</span> <span id="s786">The Jewish community fed many more people.</span> <span id="s787">When I met Victor Sassoon when he came.</span> <span id="s788">He came direct, and looked in the kitchen and saw how everything went on.</span> <span id="s789">But I talk now about the kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s790">So I remembered exactly and this is the worse day whatever happened.</span> <span id="s791">It was at noontime and we had just fed the people and the people were on the way home from the kitchen when the bombs.</span> <span id="s792">Many people got killed.</span> <span id="s793">I mean for the refugees.</span> <span id="s794">And I was...I mean I was in the...I was still there.</span> <span id="s795">But we found out after that, there's a lot people...beside of that, of course, many Chinese people, too.</span> <span id="s796">They...because it was a Chinese neighbourhood.</span> <span id="s797">And that was the worst day whatever happened.</span> <span id="s798">And what happened must be some mistake that the American...the American, they...they bombed it.</span> <span id="s799">The same thing what with Auschwitz, you know.</span> <span id="s800">They always say, "Why didn't they bomb Auschwitz?"</span> <span id="s801">So...and this was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s802">Because we knew, of course, we knew all the people, you know.</span> <span id="s803">And later on, when I came home, to my place where I lived... I lived that time with Chinese people because we were not allowed to live anymore in the Jewish neighbourhood and in the camps.</span> <span id="s804">We had to live in the...outside...you know and I got permission to live outside...outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s805">So I lived with Chinese people.</span> <span id="s806">When I come home I wanted to know what happened to you...happened with the other people, you know, and, uh, so because a lot of people got up in flames by the bombing.</span> <span id="s807">A lot of people got destroyed.</span> <span id="s808">That was the 14th of June in 1944 when that...when that happened.</span> <span id="s809">And.</span> <span id="s810">.</span> <span id="s811">uh...then after this...what happened after this, the...the American came to liberate, you know, after...when the war was finished.</span> <span id="s812">And they came special.</span> <span id="s813">.</span> <span id="s814">and that the first time that we also Negros, you know, they in the army.</span> <span id="s815">And they came the...they came in the camps and we.</span> <span id="s816">.</span> <span id="s817">we had big celebration.</span> <span id="s818">As a matter of fact, when the war over, we heard it over the radio, you know.</span> <span id="s819">It was broadcast.</span> <span id="s820">And we all.</span> <span id="s821">.</span> <span id="s822">we...we had always in the night somebody put on a..</span> <span id="s823">.</span> <span id="s824">put on a radio.</span> <span id="s825">And when it said, the war is finished, we danced in the street, you know, and, of course, that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s826">That we knew the war was over and we had a chance...a chance to go.</span> <span id="s827">.</span> <span id="s828">to go and we.</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">we could go, of course, that we go to...Shanghai to the city, and.</span> <span id="s831">.</span> <span id="s832">uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Yes, that was...that was...uh... beautiful.</span> <span id="s834">Also, I want to tell you now about the famous Jewish families there.</span> <span id="s835">There was a very famous families.</span> <span id="s836">One of the most famous was Kadoories.</span> <span id="s837">And they did also a lot for the refugees.</span> <span id="s838">They founded...made a special school.</span> <span id="s839">And that school was wonderful.</span> <span id="s840">Because all the...there was so many Jewish children, and they...they all went to that...to that school--in...in the Kadoorie school.And as I say, the...the Sassoons.</span> <span id="s841">There was also others, they real...they real... But when we...when we founded the kitchen, they sent me to the rich Russian Jews to get them interested, you know.</span> <span id="s842">And as a matter of fact, they real...the realy gave...gave... They helped us.</span> <span id="s843">They gave money, you know; because to make such a kitchen to keep... And...and I was in charge for 4...4 years of 3 This was the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School on Tongshan Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">that kitchen.</span> <span id="s845">And...and as I said before, our kitchen was famous, because our food was excellent compared with the community kitchen.</span> <span id="s846">So the many people, they...they didn't even care about kosher food, they came just... And we didn't ask no questions, you know.</span> <span id="s847">But they had to pay.</span> <span id="s848">They had to pay you, know.</span> <span id="s849">Not...they didn't get it for free.</span> <span id="s850">So, I think this the...what you are interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Tell me... Tell me about how you got kosher food there.</span> <span id="s854">You are in the middle of Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">What did you do about a mashkiach,all of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s857">This is very interesting.</span> <span id="s858">I tell you we had...in our...the one room was interesting in that meeting to about a kitchen was a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s859">What I didn't mention that we had in Shanghai about 900 Yeshivas.</span> <span id="s860">And why did they come there?</span> <span id="s861">They never had the intentions to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s862">They were caught up with Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s863">And they were originally in Kobe.</span> <span id="s864">Kobe, [Japan]... And they had to leave, and they came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s865">And they real...they real contributed to the Jewish life during the...that time, that terrible time...the years in the war a lot.</span> <span id="s866">Because they not only created the organizations, the Agudath Israel, but they also...uh...was very active with Kashruth.</span> <span id="s867">And they had the one what was in our...in our Rabbi Margulies.</span> <span id="s868">And he were appointed Mashkiach; and he came every morning.</span> <span id="s869">And also not only that our home that where the kitchen was--and I told you it was about on the same street where the police station was.</span> <span id="s870">They also had, you know, in the...the holidays wonderful services.</span> <span id="s871">And I remember, opposite lived White Russians.</span> <span id="s872">And they are the worst...the worst anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s873">And they real.</span> <span id="s874">.</span> <span id="s875">they made...they give us a lot of trouble and they all lived in the same neighborhood.</span> <span id="s876">And I had the man opposite, he asked me the next morning, "Tell me what you had last night.</span> <span id="s877">You had a wonderful choir, you know."</span> <span id="s878">We had choir, and hazzanen [NB: cantors] and beautiful.</span> <span id="s879">So anyway, the holidays were wonderful.</span> <span id="s880">And...and I say the...the Yeshivas, they were very active and they had, of course, an interesting...the had in our place...in our...they had weddings, you know.</span> <span id="s881">And when they have weddings, you know, a Hassidishe wedding--that is the most remarkable thing.</span> <span id="s882">So anyway they all took place in our kitchen, because they knew it was kosher.</span> <span id="s883">So anyway, there was about 900.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">They came from different Yeshivas.</span> <span id="s885">And they had to stay.</span> <span id="s886">But what happened, when the war was over, they were the first to leave; because they got the first opportunity to leave the uh...Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: You are describing your kitchen as sort of a major gathering place for religious Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s889">As a matter of fact, we had, you know, services.</span> <span id="s890">There was, as a matter of fact, a..</span> <span id="s891">from 4 Yidd: a person responsible for oversight of kosher kitchens, for ensuring compliance with the Jewish dietary laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">our kitchen, there was not far of the original synagogue.</span> <span id="s893">They called it...what would I mean... And this was...the synagogue existed a long time ago.</span> <span id="s894">And as I told you, they had...the real service took place there.</span> <span id="s895">Also, they had the organization Betar--you know, a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s896">And so this took place in...in the... They had also in Shanghai several synagogues.</span> <span id="s897">But Askenazim, and also the Sephardim, you know.</span> <span id="s898">The Sephardim.</span> <span id="s899">And so uh...in other words, there was real Jewish life.</span> <span id="s900">I mean, it...Jewish life went on.</span> <span id="s901">And they had many, many uh places there.</span> <span id="s902">On holidays, they had special place, because in the Jewish persons...with the German Jews, many people who don't go to the whole year.</span> <span id="s903">Mainly Americans even worst.</span> <span id="s904">They...but they go in the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s905">So for the High Holidays, we...we rented special places for the people.</span> <span id="s906">So anyway, Jewish life was very, very active all the years, you know.</span> <span id="s907">And they had...they had the...minyan every day.</span> <span id="s908">I remember once on a Sunday, I..</span> <span id="s909">.</span> <span id="s910">I walked on the street and there was someone: "Please, come in."</span> <span id="s911">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">So in other words, the uh Jewish life went on very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: How did you handle new refugees?</span> <span id="s914">Were there refugees... Jewish refugees coming in all the time throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: No.</span> <span id="s916">I tell you what happened finally.</span> <span id="s917">The Chinese or the Japanese--especially Chinese-- complained that they leaved...that they let in all the people in Shanghai, you know.</span> <span id="s918">Because after all, Shanghai was the...the largest city in China.</span> <span id="s919">When they complained, they say we want to stop it.</span> <span id="s920">And they stopped it.</span> <span id="s921">I mean, after I came there was maybe one or two more boats.</span> <span id="s922">And there were nobody... Otherwise, they would have everybody.</span> <span id="s923">So they didn't.</span> <span id="s924">They didn't allow it.</span> <span id="s925">They didn't allow it anymore, you know.</span> <span id="s926">And... uh, so it only the what were there.</span> <span id="s927">And now you will ask how they make a living?</span> <span id="s928">That's also a curious, because most people couldn't get...couldn't get a job.</span> <span id="s929">So what they did--they had a lot of people came, what they brought belongings.</span> <span id="s930">So they went on the street, and they put up a table and sold second hand.</span> <span id="s931">Second hand.</span> <span id="s932">So that was the only one, because most people couldn't... I was lucky enough, because the Rabbi what I say they needed somebody.</span> <span id="s933">He said, "Nobody is honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Nobody is honest."</span> <span id="s935">As a matter of fact, they had in the kitchen people and they couldn't trust them.</span> <span id="s936">So...and they took me; and that is why I got the job as manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s938">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s941">You talked about synagogue, and it's the original synagogue.</span> <span id="s942">Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">What was it like from the inside and the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: I tell you.</span> <span id="s945">The synagogue, the one what was in that little place called Hongkou.</span> <span id="s946">It was on one of the main streets, and it was not a large one.</span> <span id="s947">It was not a large one.</span> <span id="s948">And as a matter of fact, you know, in.</span> <span id="s949">.</span> <span id="s950">in.</span> <span id="s951">.</span> <span id="s952">in the original...in mainly most Sephardim there.</span> <span id="s953">But this was Askenazi; this was a small, but it was...it was nice.</span> <span id="s954">But they had one in...in Shanghai, and that was a very... Called uh Museum Road.And this was where the Yeshivas had all their... They had all their...where they learned, you know.</span> <span id="s955">Also, the matzahs, you know, they made there.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">There was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s957">As a matter of fact, there is a lady in the home and she is...she come from Shanghai...but she is not a refugee.</span> <span id="s958">They lived for three...four generations there.</span> <span id="s959">So...and...her son was still a year ago the...a Israel Consul General in Washington, you know.</span> <span id="s960">Maybe, his name was Jacob...Jacob.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s962">Yes.</span> <span id="s963">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: You see.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: And he was a wonderful... And he came here to visit his mother, and he real...told the people everything.</span> <span id="s967">And he lived...I think he went back to Israel.</span> <span id="s968">As a matter, she told me yesterday, her grandson comes to visit her this week.</span> <span id="s969">So anyway, they...they were original, and they had everything in...in...in that synagogue there was a beautiful synagogue, and they had the services there.</span> <span id="s970">As a matter of fact, we walked every Saturday afternoon.</span> <span id="s971">We walked all the way from--that was before the...before the...the ghetto--from Hongkou, we walked the way the people called Broadway.</span> <span id="s972">But it was not a broad way, it was just a street called Broadway.</span> <span id="s973">Over the Garden Bridge; and that was about an hour walk.</span> <span id="s974">And every Saturday afternoon, there was a very orthodox family.</span> <span id="s975">And they real...they had a real Oneg Shabbat, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">And also on...on Sukkos [NB: Sukkot].</span> <span id="s977">The Sukkos in ... is not like in...in America.</span> <span id="s978">The sukkahs in...in...in China is all from bamboo.</span> <span id="s979">The whole building.</span> <span id="s980">And...and this family, they were also philantrophists.</span> <span id="s981">And they invited us; and they have...after that, they had refreshments.</span> <span id="s982">So we went every day and we had a good...we singing there.</span> <span id="s983">That was... But it is also a very...the largest synagogue is...was in the French sector.</span> <span id="s984">And there were real...the real service took place.</span> <span id="s985">Because I know one of the men of our kitchen what was from the boat, he got married there.</span> <span id="s986">So we went there to the wedding.</span> <span id="s987">And that was a beautiful synagogue.</span> <span id="s988">And that was the largest Sephardic synagogue.</span> <span id="s989">They had a big choir, and...and... So, in...in other words, there was Russian Jews; but many Jews came from...from Iran, you know, the...the...the...the original Jews that lived there.</span> <span id="s990">But now you will say what happened to the Jews?</span> <span id="s991">Today, there is no more Jews in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s992">Because even after the war, they made a special old age home--and I had several people there what I visited--just for the European Jews.</span> <span id="s993">And they took care of the...of the old people.</span> <span id="s994">But after the war, you know, they all left; and the few that were left over during the...during the years, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s995">And there is...there was a few years ago here a big exhibition about...about the...the Jews from the...the original Jews from the...the original Jews they showed...so they had it here in the [Sherburn (ph)] Museum.</span> <span id="s996">They had that exhibition.</span> <span id="s997">Okay.</span> <span id="s998">So I think I..</span> <span id="s999">.</span> <span id="s1000">I give you the most fact of life in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">5 This was the Beth Aharon synagogue, a Sephardic congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1003">You did indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Not only Jewish life, but also general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: You did indeed.</span> <span id="s1006">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1007">Tell us what happened to you.</span> <span id="s1008">What happened to Walter Schnell when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: What happened when the war was over?</span> <span id="s1010">Finally, my...I heard from my mother...two cousins of my mother in New York.</span> <span id="s1011">And finally, they were able to send me affidavit, the visa; because I didn't want to stay in China.</span> <span id="s1012">I hated it.</span> <span id="s1013">I mean, to stay there.</span> <span id="s1014">Because I wasn't interested to...to learn the language, either.</span> <span id="s1015">Even I had to go every morning to the market and buy everything for the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1016">But a interesting thing is what you never know that the Chinese there, they.</span> <span id="s1017">.</span> <span id="s1018">they spoke a language--ping liang in English.</span> <span id="s1019">Ping liang, they called it.</span> <span id="s1020">So in other words, I could communicate.</span> <span id="s1021">So what happened I was called to the Consul General in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1022">And I went there.</span> <span id="s1023">That was right after the war.</span> <span id="s1024">And the Consul interviewed me, and he gave me a visa.</span> <span id="s1025">But it was not so easy because, as I told you, many people want to leave, and there wasn't so many, you know, ship available.</span> <span id="s1026">I had to wait til I get a boat, but there is a..</span> <span id="s1027">.</span> <span id="s1028">a company was...was very famous.</span> <span id="s1029">American... American Lines what you called it; and they called every boat with a different name.</span> <span id="s1030">My ship was called General Gordon.</span> <span id="s1031">So...America President Lines, they called it.</span> <span id="s1032">And...so they called all their ships.</span> <span id="s1033">So finally, I got...I got the... I mean, they called me...and that was a..</span> <span id="s1034">.</span> <span id="s1035">that I have a place on the boat.</span> <span id="s1036">But I tell you, all my friends came to the harbor.</span> <span id="s1037">When I went to the top of the boat, and I was crying, you know.</span> <span id="s1038">They all was still dance you know, and they were a little bit jealous because, you know, they had to stay there because the most people they had to stay a few more years.</span> <span id="s1039">I was one of the first one to leave.</span> <span id="s1040">That was, in...in...I think, in April 47, I think.</span> <span id="s1041">So anyway, we went on the boat...over Hawaii, and we had special...see that we got before...we had...uh...rations what they call it...and they saw that we got rations that we could eat.</span> <span id="s1042">Otherwise, we couldn't eat the food on the boat.</span> <span id="s1043">So we saw that we got rations-- kosher rations--from Shanghai, what we used.</span> <span id="s1044">Because they didn't have like they have now, you can order kosher food.</span> <span id="s1045">But what happened when we came to...when we came to Hawaii- -and the main city is Honolulu--they...they...they were informed that we are coming.</span> <span id="s1046">And we had special... They came, and they sent us all kosher food, wine--everything.</span> <span id="s1047">So they...was a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1048">And we...we...stayed... stayed overnight there.</span> <span id="s1049">No, we stayed on the...on the boat; but they brought us from the boat to the...the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1050">And they had prepared for us a wonderful reception.</span> <span id="s1051">We spent there the evening and...uh...and...they gave us.</span> <span id="s1052">On the next day, we...they had arranged buses for us to made a round trip, so we could see the whole Waikiki Beach.</span> <span id="s1053">And everything was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1054">And...uh...we took...we took pictures and...uh...
