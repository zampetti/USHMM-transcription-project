2008</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Annette Fein, conducted by Ina Navazelskis, on November 7th, 2008, in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you, Annette, for agreeing to talk with us today.</span> <span id="s13">As – as you know, we are interested in recording the stories of people who experienced and survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s14">And since we are here at the child survivor’s conference, we are very grateful that you’ve agreed to tell – to talk to us.</span> <span id="s15">Can you give me a little bit of background about your s – your whole – your story; where – where you were born; where your family came from?</span> <span id="s16">And we’ll start from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">My family came from Poland.</span> <span id="s19">I don’t remember the exact location, but my brother Jack would be able to tell you.</span> <span id="s20">And they moved to – to Paris, where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: In – I-I was born in 1940, so I assume like a year or so before, maybe two years before, because Jack was also born in Paris.</span> <span id="s23">And then, by the age of around two, we were put in hiding in a place called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and I have absolutely no memory of that time.</span> <span id="s24">And after I think about – well, I guess around 1945, we were brought by relatives to an orphanage.</span> <span id="s25">I just today learned that we were in several places, but I only know of one place, Taverne, an orphanage in Taverne, a Jewish orphanage, where I was until the age of [indecipherable] until 1948, when – where I then was adopted by American citizens, who were bo-both born in Russia, but they were both – they were both already American citizens, and we – I believe that happened in 1947, and it took about a year for the whole process to be finished, and I moved to America at the age of eight, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Do you – do you know anything about your birth parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well, we have photographs of them, and I know that they were both sew – tailors.</span> <span id="s28">I have photographs, but I – I dil – I don’t remember them.</span> <span id="s29">I rem – it’s all blocked out, basically, the whole time.</span> <span id="s30">I don’t know ti – a-anything, except what –</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Do you know their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Calpeak(ph).</span> <span id="s33">Rose and Joseph Calpeak(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And do you – do you know – did they have any relatives that you were ever able to identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Not that we’ve been – yes, well, we had a – my father had a sister who also perished – or it was my mother, I think it was my mother’s sist – sister.</span> <span id="s36">You’ll have – I – I can’t – I have to verify, I – I – I don’t remember all these things, I forget them.</span> <span id="s37">I mean, I – I put them out of my mind, pretty much.</span> <span id="s38">They – and there was – there was another relation o – th-that – the daughters – the – the sister’s daughter is still alive – is alive in – in Paris.</span> <span id="s39">We’re in contact with.</span> <span id="s40">And there’s another cousin also in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: So would this suggest that when your family left Poland, it wasn’t just your immediate family, your father and your mother, but a larger group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Perhaps, perhaps, but I have no – no idea.</span> <span id="s43">I t – I have never really delved into the details of that.</span> <span id="s44">I know the fa – th-the minimal facts, and that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Have you been happy knowing just the minimal facts?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: It’s been –</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Maybe happy isn’t the right word, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, yeah, no, I do – I don’t think it is the right word.</span> <span id="s49">For me it’s been – i-it’s something that was, and I accepted, and I don’t feel that I can just delve on it all the time.</span> <span id="s50">Or even to know if it – I don’t believe that it can help me personally in my life, so I just don’t bother.</span> <span id="s51">I do – I go forward, not backwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Do you know what happened, though, to your parents specifically?</span> <span id="s53">Were you able to learn that?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: That, yes.</span> <span id="s55">We – basically.</span> <span id="s56">I know that my father was put in a camp much earlier, I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s57">It’s not that I don’t know it, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s58">And my mother, evidently – I keep hearing stories that she would cu – she had put us in hiding, in this village called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and she lived there as well, with the family and evidently there were other children there.</span> <span id="s59">And she went back to Paris, I – I believe and got caught and then sent to a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: But you don’t know whi – where –</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Again, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s62">It’s over and down, I just don’t remember these names, because they – they’re long and complicated things.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So you don’t – yeah, but you know, you – they’re not recognizable, you don’t know that it would have been Auschwitz she was sent to –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: No, it’s not Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s66">Okay.</span> <span id="s67">What’s your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: [indecipherable] mental, it’s a mental block, so – which I – I accept that it’s there, and I – it doesn’t bother me too much, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Well, you know, who’s to – who is anybody else to say how another person should deal with – with their stories and their lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Hm, right, right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Do – do you have an earliest memory in your mind, of anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: None, no.</span> <span id="s73">The only – I-I used to – I used to have a memory or – or – of something like a place with a lot of trees, and we – I remember something – hearing – hearing people or children say something about Jews, and I never knew what that was about until I moved to Israel, and I would – any time I met French people, I would ask them if – because I only remember the tap – or the name, at that time, Taverne, the – the pla – the – where the orphanage was.</span> <span id="s74">And, I would – any time I would meet French people, I would ask them if they knew of the place.</span> <span id="s75">And it happens that – actually the first job I had in Israel was with an architect, and one of the partners was an interior decorator, Frenchman, and he – he tur – his name was Josh Goldsta – is Josh Goldstein.</span> <span id="s76">And he said yes, of cour – he of – he knows the place, and it turns out that he and his wife both worked at this orphanage, but once – after we’d already left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: So, would –</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: And so he described the – the setting, and that kind of made more sense, why that was stuck in my head, of the trees, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So, until you had that conversation with him, did you know that this is – you – could you place it in a town o – when you had this image of trees, or you didn’t even know where that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No, I didn't know where it was.</span> <span id="s81">I didn’t know where it was, because I never –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s83">It was putting two and two together.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yeah, I never came across anyone – cause I – when – whenever I would ask if they kn – i-it only started in – in Israel when I asked people where Taverne was.</span> <span id="s85">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What was your first language that you spoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: French.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: French.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: French.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And was – how long was that the only language that you spoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Until the age of eight, and once we moved to America, I think within about two months we learned English.</span> <span id="s92">I learned English perhaps faster than my brother.</span> <span id="s93">And, in fact I got very low grades in French when I studied, because I used to talk in class.</span> <span id="s94">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: – I’ve put that – I’ve also blocked that out, I mean, I – I know that, I – I accept it, I – now, i-if I absolutely have to talk French, I might understand some.</span> <span id="s97">I understand a bit.</span> <span id="s98">But I don’t – I mean, I – in – in fact, in Israel, in Mitzpe Ramon there are a lot of French people, and I find the French very snobby about the language, so I don’t – I say, okay, I don’t talk French.</span> <span id="s99">But [indecipherable] I can understand a little, because I studied a bit, right?</span> <span id="s100">When I wa – when I’m in France, I – the few times that I was in France, I was able to talk to people in the street, but not to people that I know.</span> <span id="s101">Mental – good mental block.</span> <span id="s102">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Why do you think that mental block’s there?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Probably there are things that I don’t want to remember, I mean, that’s quite clear, you know.</span> <span id="s105">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: But it’s interesting, you know, when one has a mental block, when I think about it in my own life, there are har – there are some – there are some parts that have been hard, and if someone were to ask me to reconstruct them, it would not be easy.</span> <span id="s107">I remember that they existed.</span> <span id="s108">I remember, let’s say, a basic story about them, but not necessarily a specific within it, or certainly not a timeline.</span> <span id="s109">But I know that they were there, you know, I – I was conscious when these events happened.</span> <span id="s110">And that’s what’s surprising for me is, when you’re not conscious, you don’t – you just don’t remember something.</span> <span id="s111">Then the question is – is, is there a reason why you have no curiosity about it, or do you think you have no curiosity about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I’ve kind of never went too deeply into it because I just like my life, and I – I said, this is what happened, and I – you don’t go back.</span> <span id="s113">You don’t go back.</span> <span id="s114">You cannot solve – you’re right, you can find out, yes, your roots, and – and things like that, but I’m sure like there are reasons why I-I – I do – I do a lot of sewing so I can say, oh yeah, well, my parents were also –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: In that profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: – tailors, in that profession.</span> <span id="s117">I do a lot of – I – I do artwork.</span> <span id="s118">I don’t know whether there’s a connection there.</span> <span id="s119">But to me that’s just to go – you can’t go backwards, you can only go forwards.</span> <span id="s120">So that’s why I don’t – I don’t s –</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So, isn’t it difficult sometimes, being with people who – who have another need, the – the need to go backwards?</span> <span id="s122">How do you – how does that –</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: That’s [indecipherable] had become difficult for me, that difficult perhaps for them, but not for – I don’t find it – that it’s difficult for me.</span> <span id="s124">I look at it, you know, it – these are facts that you can’t change, and I don’t – I don’t feel that knowing more about it – I learned now from – from my brother, who seems to know much – so much more.</span> <span id="s125">But he’s a – for instance, he doesn’t remember me as part of – in his – in his life, and I don’t remember him in that wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: In that early life in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: – in – yeah.</span> <span id="s128">So there’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: That was going to be one of my questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yeah, so it’s – it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: – I mean, that’s a – I say, okay, I mean, I’ve totally blocked it out, but – and he hasn’t, but there’s still a lot of things that he also doesn’t – hasn’t been able to relate to or to see clearly, or to understand clearly.</span> <span id="s133">And again, that for some – maybe because I live in Israel, and that’s – it’s a – my life is – is my life as it is, and without complications of my past.</span> <span id="s134">For me, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: When you got – what I guess I’d like to try and trace is, when you got to the United States, or even if it was earlier, even though you were a child, a young child earlier, do you remember conversations coming up, about the war, about the Holocaust, about murders?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did your paren – your adopted parents, what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh, they were very good people, very nice people, very giving.</span> <span id="s139">I don’t remember too much, if they talked very much about the war, but was – it was always a – it was not like – it wasn’t a hidden fact that we were adopted, we were – it was something that we were – we knew about.</span> <span id="s140">It wasn’t sudden – suddenly we learned that we were adopted, and where we came from.</span> <span id="s141">But I – I think I just kind of like, you know, fit in as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s142">Like for instance, learning English.</span> <span id="s143">I – I believe that within about two months I was talking English, I was fluent in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And do you have memories of your brother being able to, or having – struggling with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s147">How did your adoptive parents cross your path?</span> <span id="s148">Do you remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: How did they what?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How did they cross your path?</span> <span id="s151">Do you have memories of the first time you met them?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No.</span> <span id="s153">Only through what they once – what they – my father told me – both of them, that when they came to the orphanage – they came to visit your – in yo – they came to Europe and my father, who was very – an ardent Zionist, decided that the best way to find out what the situation was, was by going to an – a Jewish orphanage, and that’s how he – I-I don’t know exactly what the procedure was, but that’s how he came to that orphanage, and he always said that he – he saw me, and decided because they didn’t have children of their own, he decided to ad – to adopt me.</span> <span id="s154">And my mother at the time didn’t want – my adopted mother didn’t want anything to do with it, because she was not feeling well at – at that – this was in ’47.</span> <span id="s155">And – but he – it was his decision, basically, and they said there’s also a brother.</span> <span id="s156">[indecipherable] said, okay, we’ll take both of them.</span> <span id="s157">But I don’t remember the situation, I don’t in – in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Aside from the trees, what would be other early memories that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Only – yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: It doesn’t have to be Holocaust related, they could be about anything, just – just – what – what – what comes to your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Ah, there was – okay, there was one – as I said before, there was – hearing children yell out something about Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Was it a mean yelling out?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Maybe – yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s164">And, again this – this interior decorator said to me that we went to school, evidently, and in order to go to school, we left the orphanage and passed a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s165">So, perhaps that kind of – so, for – at that point, that explained to me why I remember something like that.</span> <span id="s166">The details, nothing at all, right.</span> <span id="s167">And there was one other thing of someone – and again, I’ve never delved into it, because it’s – I don’t think it’s a pleasant thing to remember, about – something about a tree, and a – interestingly enough, I had a time when I di – I would paint a lot of trees.</span> <span id="s168">And someone once decided that it wou – it showed that I – my – I hadn’t – that I didn’t have roots, and that was why I was drawing trees.</span> <span id="s169">And I said, fine, that’s, you know, pretty clear, and understandable.</span> <span id="s170">But there was one thing that there was a mat – someone who had a lot of keys, and I think there was a name called zoo or zoe or something like that.</span> <span id="s171">And this could have been a dream, or it could have been something in detail, that someone was hanging from a tree, that’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s172">I mean, that’s – it was never made – never clear, and I really don’t – I’m not all that interested to know too much about that.</span> <span id="s173">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Was it a shadow?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: A shadow, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: A shadow of a person on that tree, was it – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I can’t even say.</span> <span id="s178">Just someone hanging on a tree, or hanging on a tree.</span> <span id="s179">Like a –</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s181">It doesn’t bring – it doesn’t bring up a – a – a pleasant image whatso – at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s183">So, I put it out – I mean, I – it was there.</span> <span id="s184">When I was much younger, it would – it would – I would think about it now and then, but I – I pushed it out, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did you feel different than other children in the United States?</span> <span id="s186">A: I think only in the – well, that’s – I think that’s why I se – I learned English very quickly, because kids in the s – in the neighborhood would call me Frenchie, and I decided I didn’t – I wanted to be American, again, as quickly as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And did you feel different than other children because you were adopted, and you knew you were adopted?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No, I don’t remember that feeling.</span> <span id="s189">Maybe in the first few months, or the first year, because we did go to a private school for one year.</span> <span id="s190">And then, when we went to grammar school, we would put – we were put back a year.</span> <span id="s191">And I never made up that year, whereas Jack did, because it wasn’t – because I’d become friends with – with kids that were – I was with, so, it was enough, I-I didn’t need to go – go ahead one year.</span> <span id="s192">So no, I don’t think I felt too different.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Can you describe to me a little bit about – I mean, I don’t know how to express this in a way that doesn’t sound much too – too many big words.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: But how does – how did you form your – I mean, most of the time children form their identity from all of these building blocks that are part of their past.</span> <span id="s196">That doesn’t necessarily mean they stay there, but that’s what they have to start with.</span> <span id="s197">They have this building block, this one, this one, this one, and then later they can say, well, I want part of this one, I want part of that one, I don’t want the rest.</span> <span id="s198">And little by little they start forming their identity.</span> <span id="s199">What formed yours?</span> <span id="s200">How did you form yours?</span> <span id="s201">What things did you choose to become who you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I think I was very influenced by the – by the Israeli – I think also – okay, we’re – when I came to America, I remember my father would – used to make records of us, he – he liked to sing and we – he made records of – of us talking in – and I remember one of the – even – no, even before I spoke English, I mensh – I thi – from the orphanage, we were ma – we were oriented to think about Israel, and I think that that was like – that was always my – my direction, is to come to Israel, which I did, very – as soon as I-I finished at th – sorry.</span> <span id="s203">When I ca – when I – in one of the tapes that we made, I said that I wanted to come to Palestine.</span> <span id="s204">And this was like very early in – in the process.</span> <span id="s205">So I think that was always what pushed me along.</span> <span id="s206">And because my parents, especially my father, was so much into Israel himself, it always –</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: It was natural.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: It was very natural.</span> <span id="s209">And I became involved in youth groups, Young Judaea, as in high school, before high school, you know, in high school at least –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Where did you grow up here?</span> <span id="s211">What – what si –</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: In Union – well, we started out in Newark, New Jersey, and then in Union, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s213">And in – when I was in my last year, or my la – no, I think in my se – or junior – between my junior and senior year of high school, I came – I went to Israel with Young Judaea.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: That was the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: That was the first time.</span> <span id="s216">And afterwards I said I was moving – I was coming back to Israel.</span> <span id="s217">And, in fact, in my year book it says I’m known for wanting to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s218">So, I – I was ac – active in young Judea, wa – I decided to go to u – I went to university for – first, and – because my parents had said, you know, finish university, and then do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s219">And I realized that was a good a – good –</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Where did you go to school?</span> <span id="s221">A: Temple University.</span> <span id="s222">Studied art, fine arts, and art education.</span> <span id="s223">And I finished and I went to Israel for a year, and I’m now – that was in ’63, and I’m still living there, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And does – is – is Israel more home than the United States ever was?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Israel is home.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t – I can’t say more home, because I feel very much at home in – in America because I grew up here.</span> <span id="s227">Yet, not here in this area, but in – in Jersey for instance, there’s no more a – when my parents were alive, New Jersey felt very much part of me, and it was – it’s always easier – easy for me to come to America, because I love it, right, I speak English, and there’s no problem there, so – and I – I like some of the things that I see in America, but oh, you, the sun is in your eyes.</span> <span id="s228">Do you want to move?</span> <span id="s229">Do you edit afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: I stopped it, right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: I paused it.</span> <span id="s233">Or, put it this way, I paused it, and we’ll just move to these chairs here.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Oops.</span> <span id="s236">Well, put it this way, I’ll move to this chair here.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: And you don’t have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: I’m okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s241">If you’re fine, then – then we can stay that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s243">Now I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s245">Here we go.</span> <span id="s246">I was hoping the sun was going to go in the other direction.</span> <span id="s247">So, record, okay.</span> <span id="s248">So, you were saying that Israel is home, but you felt at home here as well, having grown up here.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes, yes, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So how did – how did these other parts of that early life that you don’t remember, that – that was blocked out, at what point did they come in – at what point would you be reminded, or would some pe – point, some piece of information come up?</span> <span id="s251">Do you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Only when I come here and – no, basically only when I come here and I hear about things that my brother knows about and reads ab – o-or has been involved with.</span> <span id="s253">So, it’s all.</span> <span id="s254">I was part of that too, but that’s as far as it goes, because I go back home and – and – home to Israel, and get into my work and –</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And your – your parents from Poland came to France, your brother wasn’t that much older than you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Two years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Two years older.</span> <span id="s258">But did he have any direct memories of them, that he would tell you, or that he would share with you, as you were kids still?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s260">I – he may have had, yes, but we were not close to – we didn’t – I do – we – for instance, we – we lived in Newark, we went to grammar school, but then we moved to Union, and he was already in high school, but – and still in Newark, and I – when we moved to Union, I started high school in Union, some – our paths wa-wa-was like, you know, I didn’t know his friends, because he was in a different high school.</span> <span id="s261">So we were very much apart, and then he went off to college, and I was still in high school, and we were very, very much apart, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Well, you had – when – if you were eight years old when you came to the United States, and let’s say normally it – you know, a teenager finishes high school at 17, you had less than a decade where you were living together.</span> <span id="s263">A decade is still a decade, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah, but not – no, really –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Not really, less.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: – there was too many aga – because he went to a different high school, so our paths weren’t similar.</span> <span id="s267">I became very involved in – in youth group in Young Judaea, he didn’t want – it didn’t happen with him.</span> <span id="s268">I went to overnight camps, I don’t think he did.</span> <span id="s269">Well, maybe he did one time.</span> <span id="s270">I used to love to go, and he didn’t, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Can you tell me what those camps gave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: He’s a math – he’s a mathematician, I’m into art.</span> <span id="s273">It’s like, you know, we’re two planets apart.</span> <span id="s274">I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Well, here’s an irony, without knowing – without knowing you at all, and not having talked to your brother, it sounds that you were the person who certainly found an identity in being Jewish, and then looking to Israel as a place that would be for you, your direction, and he did not.</span> <span id="s276">And yet –</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: – when you look at the Holocaust, and looking at what were those early years that are so murky, you have less interest in it, and he has more.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: And there’s a certain irony in that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: In –</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I’m also the only one in the whole family that – that moved to Israel and that became – that decided Israel was the place for me.</span> <span id="s284">Which probably came from my adopted – well, no, I think that came way before, from the orphanage.</span> <span id="s285">Because again, when I came I said, I’m coming to – I wi – want to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s286">I was even, I think, kosher at the time, as I – I was very concerned about what I was eating when I first came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: No teachers you remember from the orphanage, or no – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: – other individuals who cross your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No, nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Well, it’s just unu – it’s unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: That, even when I think in my own life, again, I have some memories of age three.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: And you’re younger, really, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: A little, a little, but – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: But I remember some – I don’t remember more than an episode, but I remember the episode, and it – some kind of a context of that episode.</span> <span id="s298">And then there’s a next memory that could have been a year later, could have been a year and a half later.</span> <span id="s299">But some – a little bit is – something is there.</span> <span id="s300">And so that’s why when you see me perplexed, I am – I’m truly perplexed, you know, of –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Because it’s never als – it’s never really bothered me that I don’t remember these things, because I’ve always believed for myself that I’m – I can’t relive my past, and it’s not going to change really, who I am, for me.</span> <span id="s302">I – I accept anyone who wants to delve into – into that, and – and to dig out things, and – like, I’ll accept people that feel that if they go to psychiatric treatment, you know, and find out what their past was, and they – they – I accept that people need that, and somehow, for some reason – I don’t say I don’t need it, I just don’t – haven’t felt that I need to – to search that.</span> <span id="s303">Which is perhaps perplexing.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Well, it’s perplexing, but it’s also a choice that no one else can say you should or should not do, you know, it is – it is an each individual choice.</span> <span id="s305">It is – but these things that happen, in some way or another, they form our identity.</span> <span id="s306">So what kind of a person do we become using those various pieces?</span> <span id="s307">And I think that that’s one of the – I think that’s one of the reasons why people do go back into that, they ta – they take something that they remembered, or experienced, and it shaped them, you know, and how did it shape them?</span> <span id="s308">And so that’s what, you know, sometimes we –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, I think – I think that wa – what did shape me was the fact that we were – what I – I don’t remember details, but I know that I came to America with the idea that I was going to move to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: And where from that –</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: So that did shape me.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: And I don’t understand how it didn’t affect my brother, but that’s because, again, when we – we’d been so different, and always were very different.</span> <span id="s314">And that’s what – that’s what guided me.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Can you tell me, what did – and – and I say this from complete ignorance: I’m not Jewish, and I’ve not – not been to Israel, and I’d like to hear what about it spoke to you.</span> <span id="s316">What articulated in a certain way, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: At the time – look, I – again, I came the first time with a youth group.</span> <span id="s318">I was not a – I wa – hadn’t finished high school yet, and it was very exciting, I remember this – also a very young country still.</span> <span id="s319">In ’50 – it was ’57 that I went, right, so it was only what, not even 10 years old.</span> <span id="s320">And it was – it was just li – we traveled a lot, and is a – as a – as a young person just traveling like that, it just affected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: It’s a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: And it was also a very free feel – a very – it’s not what it is today, right?</span> <span id="s323">It was very free, very easy, very warm.</span> <span id="s324">If you ask someone how to get someplace, they take you there at the time.</span> <span id="s325">It ma – it may not happen today, but there is an easiness about Israelis, a warmness like, about Israelis that – that really pulls you.</span> <span id="s326">And again, today it’s very different because it’s become much more Americanized as well [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s327">And bigger.</span> <span id="s328">So, it’s not the same thing that it was when I first – when I first came to Israel, and I was – excitedly, I mean, I – you know, oh, I’m gonna come back to Israel, and I just did that, that’s all I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I – yeah.</span> <span id="s331">I didn’t have to identify as a Jew, I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s332">Everyone is a Jew, basically [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s333">You didn’t have to – I don’t have to go to synagogue in order to prove that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s334">I don’t like religion to start out with, so I don’t know when – if that happened then, or now, but I’m very – I’m not anti-religious, but I don’t – I think religion is a very big problem in our world, so – but, I mean, that’s – that’s now my feelings today, after being the age that I am, and seeing what I – what I see, everything.</span> <span id="s335">But it always just felt very much at home.</span> <span id="s336">So I came back, after being two months with a bunch of kids, you know, and having a great time.</span> <span id="s337">And I was still belonging to – to Young Judaea at the time, and I became a leader in the movement.</span> <span id="s338">And I got kicked out because I would tell the truth.</span> <span id="s339">I li – I liked si – you know, I liked the facts to be clear.</span> <span id="s340">It wasn’t a great, easy place to be, and I’m – I would tell kids this, you know, that’s not good, you have to tell them to – you know, to come.</span> <span id="s341">And I don’t see the point in doing that, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What was it that got you kicked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Because I – I just never – I didn’t want to lie about what Israel was.</span> <span id="s344">It wasn’t an easy place to come to live in.</span> <span id="s345">It still isn’t an easy place to come to live in.</span> <span id="s346">And if you want – decide that you want to come, you ha – I think you have to be aware of that, and not what the Jewish agency will tell you, because that’s a bunch of lies sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: But you know, it’s pretty harsh to kick someone out who has such a passion for a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: No, it’s okay, it’s okay, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: You got over it, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: – I’d se – I – yeah, I – it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s351">I mean, it was fa – it was funny to me, fine at the time, you know.</span> <span id="s352">It didn’t stop me from doing what I wanted to do, was fine.</span> <span id="s353">I have – I’m going in my direction.</span> <span id="s354">And that’s what I did, I mean, I finished university, I studied art and art education so that I would have something to ba – to fall on if I needed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Did your parents support this?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: It sounds like they would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s359">They have – they – they had no choice really, because my father was always Israel, Israel.</span> <span id="s360">And they never – they never con – came to live in Israel because my mother actually didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s361">My father wanted to come.</span> <span id="s362">He would – he, in fact, left Russia when he was 14 –</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: 1905 - 1910 –</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: – something like –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: And he came to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: To Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: To Palestine.</span> <span id="s369">And he stud – he studied in th – in school there for a couple years, until he got kicked out because he was illegally there.</span> <span id="s370">So in – and then he – he was kicked out and then he came back to Israel.</span> <span id="s371">And then eventually, I think when he was 19, he wa – he came to America.</span> <span id="s372">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: So you – d – what year was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: – he was always –</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: What year was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: He was born, I believe sometime early 1900s, I don’t remember exactly –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So did – did you learn about his story and his family, and all of –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: – where they came from in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yeah, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s381">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Oh, near the Black Sea.</span> <span id="s385">And what propelled them out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Well, I don’t remember what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: It’s all there, it’s all there, but I just don’t remember [indecipherable] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: But did you – do you remember that he told you – was your mother also from Odessa?</span> <span id="s390">You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s392">She came – my mother came to America very young, so she didn’t go through the same thing.</span> <span id="s393">And she was in – because of her, he didn’t come back – he didn’t move to Israel, because she didn’t want – her family was already in America.</span> <span id="s394">His family was in Russia, except for a brother, who eventually moved to America, they were all in Russia.</span> <span id="s395">So they would never – he never moved to Israel, but we always had Israelis at our house.</span> <span id="s396">He spoke Hebrew fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Oh, you did?</span> <span id="s398">A: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I studied Hebrew in high school – in – in Hebrew school, but I didn’t – I don’t think I could s-speak it until I came to Israel and went to ulpan.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s404">What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: A – a place to learn only Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: What’s it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: It’s ulpan.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Oopahn(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Ulpan.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Ulpan.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: U-l-p-a-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Ulpan.</span> <span id="s414">It’s like five days a week, six days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Intensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Five hours a day [indecipherable] I studied there when I first ca – I mean, I knew some Hebrew, but I don’t think I could really speak it.</span> <span id="s417">When I moved to Israel, the first thing I did was go to ulpan.</span> <span id="s418">The si – for f – I ended up – it’s usually six we – six months, and I went for five months, because I simply then got a job and I decided to – to take the job.</span> <span id="s419">But I mean, you know, that was always my direction, and that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s420">And it came from our home, so the fact that my brother wa – I – it always also amazes me, and no one really, in the family came to that decision to do that.</span> <span id="s421">It was only me, which I [indecipherable] comes all back from France, and that was – that was what pulled me [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: It’s interesting, it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s423">What’s the – when you – when you look at the American milieu, the American life, and I take that to be primarily Jewish American life, and you look at that sort of ethos and spirit and people there, and Israeli, could you expand a little bit on – on where you see the differences, where you see the similarities as far as –</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: That’s very complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s426">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Look, when I first came to Israel, I found it very – I mean, it was very different.</span> <span id="s428">There was, again, in o –</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Different than the United States you left, or different than now?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Than the United States.</span> <span id="s431">Different then than the United States.</span> <span id="s432">Today it’s much more like – not like, but much more influenced by the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: What were some of those differences?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s435">It’s a much warmer place, not just – not just physically, but people are very giving, very, very tough, but very soft inside.</span> <span id="s436">Like this – what they call the sabra, which is the fruit of Israel, and it’s prickly on the outside, and soft and sweet on the inside.</span> <span id="s437">And this is what the sabra – that’s what an Israeli born person is like.</span> <span id="s438">And that’s, I think, probably one of the things that – that attracted me.</span> <span id="s439">There was – you didn’t have t – you know, you – you – you don’t have to make an appointment – you didn’t have to make appointments with people, you could just stop in and visit.</span> <span id="s440">Which you could – you can’t do – couldn’t do in America, and you still can’t do in America.</span> <span id="s441">I remember a few times some visits I would have to call up people and say oh, well, they have no time to see me.</span> <span id="s442">Yeah, I’m just here on a vacation, you know, you’re coming to visit, I mean, I’m not living here any more.</span> <span id="s443">And that type of thing is very like to – in Israel, even today, if I come ba – when I come back, I’ll call up and say I’m coming over, there’s never – almost never a problem with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: I can tell you I miss that in the United States too.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Of people just dropping by.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: It used to be in another time and another place, but not necessarily here.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: At the time also, which isn’t happening – you can’t do now, because of the situation, you could get out on the road and hitchhike without any problem.</span> <span id="s450">You could walk in almost any neighborhood without any problem.</span> <span id="s451">Again, this is all changed, by little, by little, there – it’s not like that every place.</span> <span id="s452">You don’t hitchhike so much today because of the – the situation.</span> <span id="s453">I unfortunately think that Israels – Israel has picked up on a lot of the bad things about America, rather than the good things.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Su – such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I don’t know exactly wha-what the good things are.</span> <span id="s456">An efficiency that – that’s here, that can be, I think, very helpful.</span> <span id="s457">I love going to supermarkets here, which I don’t love it – especially not where I live now.</span> <span id="s458">I love the fact that they’ll pack the things for you, where in Israel you have to do everything, except the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: That’s very European, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yeah, okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: In Europe it’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: – yeah, yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s463">Do – all the red tape that you sometimes have to go through just to – like, for instance, when I first came to Israel, just to get a telephone, you would have to wait three years.</span> <span id="s464">Two, three years.</span> <span id="s465">Which was good.</span> <span id="s466">It’s not like that today, but at the time, you know, you say, wow, look at – in America, within 24 hours you would have it, so – the – again, I mean, everything has become so Americanized there.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So tell me about those things that are American influences that you have more reservations about.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Oh, the whole – the whole – cell phones, the computers, that’s all – it all comes from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s469">Cable TV, needing to ha – buying more than – living above your – your means, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So kind of a – a consumer –</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: – as a consumer [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: It’s true.</span> <span id="s474">Even when I fir – when I first came to – to Israel, I would – there were things like – that would bother me.</span> <span id="s475">For instance, I remember walking in the street, and – and people come and they push you out of the way to get to the bus stop, you know?</span> <span id="s476">Things like that would bother me, and – until I ended up, I remember once, passing someone who pushed me, and I pushed her back.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: You’ve become Israeli.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I’ve become Israeli.</span> <span id="s479">And now we have like an – a different thing in that – are you Russian?</span> <span id="s480">No, you’re not Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Me?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No, no, you’re Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Oh, Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Actually Lithuanian [indecipherable] I’m American [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: No [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s487">So, today, for instance, the Russians tend to do th-the things that – you know, they just [indecipherable] you don’t know that you have to stand on line and they push ahead, and things like that.</span> <span id="s488">Then again, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: I could tell you stories.</span> <span id="s490">I’ve lived – I’ve lived in eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And the American part of me is just shocked.</span> <span id="s493">Absolutely shocked by the – the – the lack of behavior, you know, the – the impoliteness –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Of Americans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: – of – of – of eastern Europeans.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Because in public life, people are very rude to one another.</span> <span id="s498">Privately they’re not, because privately you’ve gone out – you’ve been – you’ve gone over a barrier of trust.</span> <span id="s499">That is, they now trust you once you’re inside their home, and the behavior is different.</span> <span id="s500">But in public, it is atrocious.</span> <span id="s501">It is just – you know, it would flabbergast me –</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: But you also have here in is –</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: – are Israelis, I’d say if I’m – when I’m – especially in New York –</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: – if I hear Hebrew, which you hear so – a lot of, and you know they’re Israelis, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s507">I also, for instance, back sometime in the 80s, I – I – I went to buffal – to [indecipherable] South Africa to teach bla – blacks there.</span> <span id="s508">And via the gov – Israeli government.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Do you have dual citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s511">And I remember being very [indecipherable] these who were on staff that was there, because it was a – a project to teach blacks their crafts, so that they could then go on and –</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Make money.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: – earn money, right.</span> <span id="s514">And it was extremely frustrating because what I could see, what was s-spending a fortune, the government was spending a fortune of money on us, training these people, and not giving them anything, and that really [indecipherable] me, and I – I would get so annoyed by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: It t – it’s typical for all governments.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s517">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: I was part of – when I lived in eastern Europe and i – and in Europe between 1990 and 2000, I worked for a lot of organizations, and that was – what your insight was, is exactly something I shared.</span> <span id="s519">They would say there’s aid for this or that project, and it was to help bring freedom and democracy and all those other nice things, but the money didn't go into the pockets of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Into the pockets, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: – yeah.</span> <span id="s522">It went into the pockets of the contractors who knew how to get the – the assignment.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Assignment, exactly.</span> <span id="s524">So that – that type of thing, and I – I – I remember when I first came there they immediately, a party for the newcomers.</span> <span id="s525">It was a project of two years, I came in only for two months.</span> <span id="s526">I was supposed to be for three months, but they kind of messed up on it, and I said, I’m t – here for two months and that’s it.</span> <span id="s527">They pa – bu – very wonder – good salary, a car.</span> <span id="s528">All I had to do is pay for my food.</span> <span id="s529">A-And, I would end up going back to the school in the evening to – because I n – I found that – I realized that the – the girls, they were mainly young ki – younger girls, were from villages, and they had – they had nothing to do after four or fi – after the school closed at four or five o’clock, there was nothing for them to do.</span> <span id="s530">So I would come back to work, and they learned that I would be there, and I would bring dried f-food or coffee, and I would share it with them.</span> <span id="s531">You know, and the other Israelis got very annoyed with me when I was giving so much to them.</span> <span id="s532">You know, this is – we’re here to help them, not for us t-to take.</span> <span id="s533">So, that – that kind of thing is, you know, where – I don’t think that’s an Israeli thing, that’s just bad government policies.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Well, it’s – it’s – I also – it’s endemic for th – with all such structures, and those are the structures that exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Whether it’s the European Union, or whether it’s the United States, or whatever.</span> <span id="s537">Whatever country is giving the aid, usually benefits its own citizens through that aid.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s539">Cause I – I remember also once there – basically, we were teaching them so that they could teach people from villages, you know?</span> <span id="s540">And I kept saying, well, I want to go to these – I want to go to a village, to see what conditions they will be teaching in.</span> <span id="s541">Because if I – suddenly I’m demanding that we have proper seats, and proper lighting.</span> <span id="s542">But then I said, what – what – what goes on in the village?</span> <span id="s543">They’re sitting outside, on – they don’t have chairs, they don’t have lights.</span> <span id="s544">They work until – they can work until – until it’s su – sundown and then they have no electricity, so how – how – why –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: But it wasn’t – this experience wasn’t sufficient to get you turned off from –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s547">This was just – look, I – I think I’m not very good with – with institutions altogether.</span> <span id="s548">I – I never taught in school, because of what I saw of the school system here in America, not – not just in Israel.</span> <span id="s549">I never taught in Israel – and in – in America I only student taught, and that was quite enough for me.</span> <span id="s550">I-I – I’m not – I-I – I – also, even when I worked, I’ve been inde – independent more or less since 70s.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Tell me a little bit about – about your life –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: What I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: – because we – no, well, no, we star – we started at 1963, and then kind of – what happened sequentially, sort of.</span> <span id="s554">When you moved there in ’63 to live, what happened, and then [indecipherable] rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Okay, basically, the first six months I learned Hebrew, and then I just wanted to ge-get work, and I found work in a silks – doing silkscreen printing.</span> <span id="s556">Outsi – I was living with this – ulpan was in Jerusalem, and this job was outside of – near Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s557">So I moved there.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Did you have friends or family from the U.S. that were already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No family, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: No family.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Well, a – very good friends of the family.</span> <span id="s562">And I had friends from Young Judaea that were in Israel already.</span> <span id="s563">And I quickly made friends with Israelis.</span> <span id="s564">I knew more Israelis than I knew Americans.</span> <span id="s565">And I just say – I mean, I – I – I just went from – basically from – okay, I – I got ja – a job working in this – in doing silkscreen printing, and I was more or less in charge of the woman, the worker that was there.</span> <span id="s566">And that pushed me to – to speak Hebrew qui – more quickly because I was in charge of her, and she always spoke – or French, or Hebrew.</span> <span id="s567">So I spoke French.</span> <span id="s568">And [indecipherable] and after about three months, my boss said, maybe in five years we’ll become partners.</span> <span id="s569">And I looked at him and I said, this is not the place for me.</span> <span id="s570">Because this was outside of Tel Aviv, it was in a little place that was – I s – I – I don’t know what I was doing there.</span> <span id="s571">I would come back every weekend to Jerusalem because that’s where I had friends.</span> <span id="s572">And after three months – af – when he said this I moved back to Jerusalem, and I – I had several – I mean, I went from – like a year I worked for a s – a publishing company doing graphic work.</span> <span id="s573">And I worked for “The Jerusalem Post” doing graphic work.</span> <span id="s574">And I was always painting or doing art work, but I wasn’t doing it full time because I was working in places, until about the early 70s, or – just about the 70s, yeah, I think late 60s, beginning of the 70s, I decided to go and work on my own.</span> <span id="s575">And I became partners with a Danish guy, he was going to si – he did silkscreen printing, I did more of the graphic work, and he did – he did printing for – for artists and all sorts of things like that, until he left.</span> <span id="s576">And I just continued being independent, because I’m not – again, I’m not good with institutions of any kind, I – I don’t like – like even when I worked for the – for the Post, or for the publishing company, I had – I know what I had to do.</span> <span id="s577">I had never liked clocking in.</span> <span id="s578">I didn't have to clock in at the time.</span> <span id="s579">I did the work that I had to do, and you – more, if it was necessary.</span> <span id="s580">But don’t tell me what – you know, i-if my work is not good, I’m willing to hear it, but if – the hours I had to put in, I’m not good with that.</span> <span id="s581">So it’s as – the same ki – I – I needed to be always independent, and I guess that’s part of my – my whole makeup, is just to be, you know, where I need to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Did your adoptive parents have those sorts of artistic streaks?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: My mother, evidently, at some – of one – had wanted to be an interior decorator, my adopted mother.</span> <span id="s584">My father, no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Was he a businessman?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: But he would – yeah, businessman, but he was more – yeah, he sang and he s – he loved telling about himself, of his – his whole background and that.</span> <span id="s587">So he was very vocal.</span> <span id="s588">And my mother, they had a – a – a business, a furniture shop, and she kept the books and all that, they worked together, but he was more outside, talking to people, she was [indecipherable] the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Well, there’s the salesman, and the person who keeps it going.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you have a curiosity about your birth parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Only what they did, and what they looked like, which I, at some point, I don’t remember, I got photos from my cousins in Paris.</span> <span id="s593">And she told – th-the cousin – this cousin told me a little, because she didn – she’s older than – than – she’s about s-six years older than – than myself, six or eight years.</span> <span id="s594">So she has much more – she remembers much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: How did –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: And I met her and she told me a bit more about they would – they were – but not details like my – like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s597">I don’t remember where she was in connection to where we were.</span> <span id="s598">But again, I cou –</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: How did she enter your life?</span> <span id="s600">After you left to the e –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: It sounds to me like there is – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: This – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: – be-before America and after –</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: And after America, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: – America.</span> <span id="s607">And – and so when – before America went away, how did it – how did these things, even though you didn't seek them –</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Okay, because my – okay, because our parents, our adoptive parents, kept in touch with the family in – in France, that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Which – which hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s613">It’s a family that’s our family, our immediate family.</span> <span id="s614">Cousin – two sets of cousins.</span> <span id="s615">They helped them out financially, they helped [indecipherable] daughters – one of the fa – one of the cousins, their daughters came to visit America and they stayed with my parents.</span> <span id="s616">In fact, by then, when I was in Israel, they also came to visit me in Israel.</span> <span id="s617">And I had no contact with them, with that part of the family.</span> <span id="s618">But there was – there was connection without being very to – they never made any great effort, so that this is one of the reasons that I believe that I don’t speak French, is that this one relative, the father, who’s since passed away, I was there, I think in ’64, coming back from the States, from the visit, it was a year later that I would move there.</span> <span id="s619">And I stopped in – in France, and I stayed with them, and they were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: This was a blood relative</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: [indecipherable] relative, yeah.</span> <span id="s622">And he just went on – I got very upset, he went on about how he blamed my – our adoptive parents for the fact that we didn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s623">And I got really very annoyed with him.</span> <span id="s624">And since then I just never made any great effort to keep in contact, nor did they.</span> <span id="s625">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: The French relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Now, that I – the French relatives.</span> <span id="s628">Now, there’s another cousin, who today we’re in touch with, but at the time I had met – her father was still alive, her mother was my aunt – my second aunt.</span> <span id="s629">My aunt which he wa – she was, I think my father’s sister, but I don’t remember exactly now.</span> <span id="s630">And it just – cause it doesn’t really matter to me.</span> <span id="s631">The fa – her father, who was still alive when I came to visit, he was – he was very pleasant, he was okay.</span> <span id="s632">And I don’t know wha – I don’t know if – I guess I – yeah, I probably met – he had a – a – okay, I have a cousin, and his brother.</span> <span id="s633">We met at the time.</span> <span id="s634">But then when I – when I – when I was living in Israel, and he knew I was living in Israel, and I came back to Israel, and then for years I had – we had no contact at all.</span> <span id="s635">And then suddenly they – I get – sh-she called, she was in Israel, and she didn’t know how to find me.</span> <span id="s636">And I alw – I said, how can that be?</span> <span id="s637">I mean, you knew I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s638">The father – your father knew I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s639">My parents at the time were still alive, so there was no problem finding out where I was.</span> <span id="s640">And she went to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in – in Jerusalem to try to find me.</span> <span id="s641">And they said, well what – why not look in the phone book?</span> <span id="s642">And they found me in the phone book, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s643">And that’s how we came in contact again.</span> <span id="s644">And they’ve been very, very nice.</span> <span id="s645">I mean, they’re very pleasant people, and I like them.</span> <span id="s646">We meet.</span> <span id="s647">We – they’ve been to Mitzpe Ramon since I moved there, they come to visit.</span> <span id="s648">Three years ago I was – I came to the States, and then I went for two weeks to Paris, so we just met for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: But did they feel more –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I didn't stay with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Do they feel more like people who are not in your inner circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Very definitely.</span> <span id="s653">The-They’re – let’s say they could be, but they’re not.</span> <span id="s654">I like them very much, they’re very warm, but there’s – I think again Jack is much more – much closer to them than I am.</span> <span id="s655">I probably at si – in some place said okay, I know they’re my relatives, but it’s – it’s a – a statement, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s656">It’s not all that strong relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Sounds like relatives without being family.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Without being family, right.</span> <span id="s659">I feel much closer to whatever relatives I have left here than I do them.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: From your adopted family.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: But yeah – but they’re – but, I mean, this couple again, I like them very much, but – and I enjoy being with them when I see them, but it’s always a very brief kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Did they ever tell you anything?</span> <span id="s663">Did they know anything about your parents?</span> <span id="s664">Did they ever share anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Well, yes, she – the cousin knew my par – knew – remembers my – my mother very much, she remembers her.</span> <span id="s666">She described her and the fact that they were both se-seamstress – sewers and all that.</span> <span id="s667">But we’ve never real – well, again, I don’t think I made any great effort to sit with them and get all that information.</span> <span id="s668">And if you te – aga – last – the last time I was in Paris, they were busy, and we – I had – we met once for dinner at their house.</span> <span id="s669">I slept one weekend there, because the place where I was staying, I had to – I-I couldn’t stay with who – it was a friend of mine, I couldn’t stay that weekend so, they allowed me to stay.</span> <span id="s670">I didn’t feel [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s671">I pushed myself on them, I needed a place to stay that night, so I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s672">But they were then going on vacation, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: So – excuse me, it sounds like there aren’t – there weren't any really warm connections to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, I – that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: From any –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s679">For instance, this other girl, they’ve made an effort, this one cousin, and her husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: And her name is –</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: – they’ve made – Sallah(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Sallah(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: She’s made – they’ve – she and her husband George have made efforts to make connection with me.</span> <span id="s684">I know he’s – they’re much closer with Jack.</span> <span id="s685">The other cousins, I’ve manage – I’ve – a few times, in fact, let’s – the father – the father, who passed away already a long time ago, who put – blamed my parents for the fact that we didn’t speak French, I never – after that I never have come – I haven’t had contact with them.</span> <span id="s686">And there was one time like about, I don’t know, I think 10 - 11 - 12 years ago that I went with Jack and his wife Judy, we went to France, and we went – my cousins Sallah(ph) and George for dinner, and this man who knew we were coming – the – well, she’s the cousin, actually, his wife, but they were on vacation.</span> <span id="s687">They knew we were coming.</span> <span id="s688">I – to me, that’s enough to not even search for them.</span> <span id="s689">And Jack, without a – he-he-he calls them up, they were in Nice, and then he asks – he puts me on the phone, and the guy just starts out about how quelle domage, I don’t speak – don’t speak French.</span> <span id="s690">And I said, well, it’s too bad you don’t speak English, and I gave the phone back to my brother.</span> <span id="s691">He wants to make contact with the – with these people, fine.</span> <span id="s692">I have no – no problem with that.</span> <span id="s693">I don’t need the contact with someone like that.</span> <span id="s694">And again, they made no great effort to – to keep us in contact, and they knew how to – to reach us, how to find us.</span> <span id="s695">They knew where we were.</span> <span id="s696">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: You know –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: – I felt – me – I think I’m sure that’s part of the – obviously part of the – it’s blocked out because it’s not – I mean – in fact, I’m also [background noise] happy that I didn’t grow up in France, you know?</span> <span id="s699">I find the French very sloppy, that language, and a lot of things, even though –</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: We’ve got to – I mean, this machine, it will –</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: – it will pick up everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: What time is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: It’s 25 to five.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s707">You know there’s a – hang on a second.</span> <span id="s708">Vida(ph)?</span> <span id="s709">It’s Viva(ph), sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Okay, she –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Is no one coming up, or are there other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q2: There are other people.</span> <span id="s713">I was just wondering how much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: I’d say about another 15 minutes, and that will be it, may – yeah, something like that, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I haven’t talked so much in a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Well, I – it’s interesting, you know?</span> <span id="s717">It – it – and I – and I appreciate that you’re talking to me and I’m a total stranger, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Perhaps that’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: That – sometimes that happens, you know.</span> <span id="s720">I re – I remember – and one of the reasons I don’t put my voice on the recorder is because, one of the things that’s artificial, is that I’d love to jump in and so – you know, you say something and I want to say, oh yeah, that reminds me of x,y,z and I have to remember that 10 years down the line, if someone’s listening to this, they don’t care about my x,y,z, you know.</span> <span id="s721">But let me run this thought by you.</span> <span id="s722">They say that very often, psychologists say that children who were adopted have a sense – well, this I will put out, cause it’s – here’s the – here’s the thought that occurs to me, and I wonder whether any of it fits.</span> <span id="s723">Okay, another one of [background noise] Okay.</span> <span id="s724">I hope that – I hope that this is fine and we’re – we’re recording.</span> <span id="s725">There are – there is this thought among psychologists that children who have been adopted, and know that they are adopted, and had the good luck to grow up in a – in a loving family, sometimes nevertheless have a feeling inside that someone at one point rejected them, because they were adopted in the first place.</span> <span id="s726">Somebody in the early part of their lives.</span> <span id="s727">It doesn’t – it sometimes doesn’t have any connection to reality.</span> <span id="s728">I mean, they may know, for example, that my mother did not want to give me up, my mother would have preferred to keep me, but she gave me up.</span> <span id="s729">But that there was a certain kind of rejection, and – that was experienced anyway, even though consciously you know that that other person’s, the birth mother’s circumstances could have been such that they had no choice.</span> <span id="s730">And when I hear you speak about the relatives that were blood relatives in France, it sounds that they had no great interest to keep up ties.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: That, definitely yes, I mean, I – I see that, I feel that.</span> <span id="s732">And, again, I’ve given – if they annoyed me enough – also, very – I think make decisions, you know, it’s – it’s not making – not always logical, but this is fact for me.</span> <span id="s733">I don’t – I would not go out of my way to change these facts.</span> <span id="s734">This is what it is, and that’s okay, but I will not go begging to these people to be – to what, to accept me?</span> <span id="s735">I mean, this – I’m your relative.</span> <span id="s736">To this day we have no – I’ve been to their home, stayed with them once while back there, some years way, way back.</span> <span id="s737">I made the effort to come to visit them.</span> <span id="s738">Their daughters then came to me in – in Israel.</span> <span id="s739">They were – I was – they really annoyed me, because they just expected that you – to – to do everything.</span> <span id="s740">I’m not used to that kind of thing, I was – didn’t grow up that way.</span> <span id="s741">So it would – it just – and they – again, they never made any more effort to keep in touch with me, at least this particular set of relatives.</span> <span id="s742">The others, yes, they’ve made every effort, and we stay in touch.</span> <span id="s743">So they’re – they’re fine.</span> <span id="s744">I – I – we’re not that close, but still it’s – it’s a feeling that they – yes, they’re my relatives, I accept them that way.</span> <span id="s745">I can’t – I don’t feel as close to them, perhaps, as relatives in America, but what they are, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s746">S – not – I do – I’m not angry with them, I am probably angry – I definitely, not probably, I – of course, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Well, I guess that’s – I wasn’t putting – I wasn’t going to put the word on it, but there was a certain kind of – yeah, something there which is – I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Especially when the – the father of these – these relatives, blame people who – who gave so much to me, and to Jack and to them.</span> <span id="s751">So, and then to blame them?</span> <span id="s752">Well, but did you make any effort to bring me to France, to remind me of who – who – what my background is?</span> <span id="s753">Nothing.</span> <span id="s754">So, why –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Well, that might be one of those answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yes, well that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: [indecipherable] so interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s759">But I – I never had a chance to – I never bothered to talk to them.</span> <span id="s760">Jack isn’t bothered by that.</span> <span id="s761">We’ve – again, we’re very different –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: – in our reactions to things.</span> <span id="s764">We’re very different in everything, so it’s not unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: What about the French family that hid you?</span> <span id="s766">Do you have any contact or knowledge of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yeah, no, I don’t – he – he did.</span> <span id="s768">He went to – he went to meet them, he – he even – in fact, he’s – he gave me a letter that they wrote.</span> <span id="s769">I think that the – the parents have since passed away, but their daughters and they – they’re alive, and he – he did meet with them, and I never – I never – I never made the contact.</span> <span id="s770">I said, it’s like, you know – I didn’t want to, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: S-So when you find yourself at a place like this, the child survivor’s conference, does it speak to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I don’t know, it’s the first time that I – I happened to be here.</span> <span id="s773">I’m not s – I didn’t come especially for this.</span> <span id="s774">I – I was here because my – Jack’s wife’s dau – daughter got married, so they kept saying please come, please come, and I came.</span> <span id="s775">And then there was the conference, I said, okay I’ll come to the conference as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Have you ever been any – to any other Holocaust related conference?</span> <span id="s777">And when –</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s779">And I don’t think that I would make an effort to come.</span> <span id="s780">Maybe after – after this time, I might.</span> <span id="s781">I know there was one in Jerusalem last year, I didn’t – didn’t go to it.</span> <span id="s782">I don’t – I also – I don’t like even seeing movies of – of that time.</span> <span id="s783">I don’t like repetitions of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s784">I know it happened, I know it was, but okay, I – I think – again, I believe that we should go forward, and not to –</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So where – yes, but where is – where – what about it is where you say, how could – I don’t know exactly how – how to phrase this, but what about it is repetitious?</span> <span id="s786">It’s not the best way of phrasing this, but di – I wa – yeah, what about it is so –</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I was born here, I grew up here, I was hidden, I was – it’s so much of – I – I can’t – I can’t really answer that, because I have to think much more about it.</span> <span id="s788">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: But it seems key.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: It’s – it’s – doesn’t push me any place, it’s – to me it says, okay, it’s like – there are things that you need to repeat, like if I want to learn how to work with this, with a certain material, that’s important for me to repeat it so that I get to know what the material is like, how to work with it.</span> <span id="s791">To make contact wi – this to me doesn’t – for me personally, it’s not going to make me a better person, a better artist, just by –</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: What do you think it gives other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s794">Everyone, I – I believe it gives everyone something.</span> <span id="s795">Everyone something that will fi-fill them in some way, and again I have no problem with that.</span> <span id="s796">I’m not one – I will – I’m the last person who will say, you shouldn’t talk about it, you shouldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s797">No, if it fills you and it gives you some meaning, I think you should do as much as you can.</span> <span id="s798">Which is, for instance, one thing that I’ve said to Jack, well, you know, you need that, go and do it, it’s – but don’t involve me in something that I don’t feel that I could do.</span> <span id="s799">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: It sounds – in – in some ways it sounds also like – now, again, I’m not casting aspersions on – on the people who have that need.</span> <span id="s801">I mean, I work in an organization which is dedicated to this.</span> <span id="s802">But there are fundamental Christians who need to bring the gospel to everybody.</span> <span id="s803">And part of how they interpret fundamental Christ – how they interpret their mission as Christians is that they’re not good Christians unless they share the gospels, you know?</span> <span id="s804">And they’re gonna share those gospels with you whether –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Whether you want [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: – you want it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah, I w – I would end up keeping away from it, because I will – don’t want – also, religious Jews, I – you know, leave me be.</span> <span id="s808">I don’t care, be religious.</span> <span id="s809">If it gives you something, do it.</span> <span id="s810">But I don’t – for me, it’s not my way.</span> <span id="s811">I – I think sometimes I’m more religious some – than these all that, you know, because I think what I – what I say is my – my word is definitely my word, I don’t go back on it.</span> <span id="s812">I don’t think that if you’re going to fast it makes you a better person.</span> <span id="s813">Many things that I just think you have to be wi – you have to be straight with yourself in your life, and that’s what’s important to me.</span> <span id="s814">And again, anyone else, do what you need to do.</span> <span id="s815">I’ll respect you, but don’t force it on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Were you ever curious about having a conversation with this – the mother you never knew?</span> <span id="s817">Were you – would – what – if there ever had been anything you would have wanted to tell her?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s819">No, I don’t know whether I would want to tell her something, but once I went to – in – in Israel we have a lot of people that read coffee cups, and I used to love to go to the, like coffee cups or cards, tarot cards or – not tarot cards, but mainly coffee cups.</span> <span id="s820">And especially at that time when in – when I was in Israel at first, these were usually very primitive women, who were so wise.</span> <span id="s821">My – but one woman said to me – I came there and she said, she wa – suddenly said, you have two mothers.</span> <span id="s822">And she said I would meet my – my – the – the other mother like in 15 years, right?</span> <span id="s823">And, well, I was tripped out by it.</span> <span id="s824">I-I said, wow, this, you know, this is going to be very interesting.</span> <span id="s825">I know that it’s not right, but still, maybe – maybe it was.</span> <span id="s826">[indecipherable] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Must have been in the mid-60s or late 60s or something like that.</span> <span id="s829">Of course, 15 years passed and nothing ever happened, so – but it was – it – for a long time it was in my head, but why?</span> <span id="s830">What would happen if I did meet her, if the –</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: If she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: [indecipherable] But I never, never brought it to any – because I didn’t really believe that this – that it could be, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: But nevertheless, she was uncanny that she knew you had two mothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s835">Uncanny, but again I think – no, she wasn’t – she was just very wise in that I believe she asked me what, at first, what my mother’s name was.</span> <span id="s836">And I stupidly said Rose, but it’s not my real mother’s name.</span> <span id="s837">So, maybe I said that.</span> <span id="s838">Something, something made it clear to her, because a-again, they pick up on your – the way you sit, the way you talk, what you say.</span> <span id="s839">You know, every little thing, they knew exactly how to – how to interpret it, and I – I remember once after this, I was visiting friends in Tel Aviv, and I said to them, oh I can – I – I could read your coffee cup, you know.</span> <span id="s840">And I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s841">And they said [indecipherable] I said, don’t be ridiculous, I just – I’m telling you what you want to hear, you know, and so it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Look at human beings, how much we need that.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Sure, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: We really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: But it –</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Rose, also [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Your birth mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah, and my adopted mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: And your adopted?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Thank you for talking to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: You’re welcome, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: If there are any other questions that would come up, you know, that I’d have – even if we – if they’re long distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Welcome, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Sure, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Thank you, thank you, I really appreciate the time you took.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Okay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s863">And I’m going to now just read the end, which is, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Annette Fein, on November 7th, 2008, in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s864">Thank you
