<p><span id="s13">Q: Please give us your name, your place of birth, and the date of your birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name is Joseph Levine, and I was born on July 20, 1907, in the small town of Malodezna in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And will you now give us a little background of your childhood, growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Well, I..</span> <span id="s17">.</span> <span id="s18">in 1914, when I was 7 years old, my father and five children were already in America, and they sent passports to my mother and the other four children, including me, to come to America.</span> <span id="s19">Because of the war we could not go into France or Germany, so we were stuck.</span> <span id="s20">By early 1915, as the Germans approached our town, we had to flee for our lives.</span> <span id="s21">So I recall how the whole town, we left on an open coal car in the rain not knowing where we were going.</span> <span id="s22">We came to the city of Minsk and there the whole...other people in the train were marched to the central square...square where there were three synagogues.</span> <span id="s23">We spent a few nights in the synagogues which were filled with refugees and what few belongings they had, and my mother find a relative and we moved into a crowded, small apartment where we stayed for at least 6 months or longer because I recall I went to Cheder, the Hebrew school in Minsk.</span> <span id="s24">When things got so bad that we stood in line for a piece of black bread with Zeppelins overhead, my courageous mother took her four children and we started a journey in freight cars.</span> <span id="s25">I don't...I'm sure she didn't know where we're gonna end up, and the...the trains took us across Russia, Siberia, and into Ha Binh, China.</span> <span id="s26">We lived in Harbinat least for 4, 5 months.</span> <span id="s27">We finally made contact with the family in America, and once contacts were made through an uncle of mine...he who was one of the founders of the UJA, very prominent in Jewish life in New York.</span> <span id="s28">A man named Abe Edelberg.</span> <span id="s29">Uncle Abe arranged for us to try to leave Harbine, and we then traveled from Harbine to Korea, and then we came to Japan and lived in Kobe for a little while and then we sailed from Yokohama and we arrived in San Francisco on February 12, 1917.</span> <span id="s30">From there, we traveled by train to...overnight stay in New York City and then to New Haven, Connecticut, where we joined my grandparents and my family.</span> <span id="s31">So that my first years, my early life in America was spent in New Haven where I graduated from elementary school and high school.</span> <span id="s32">In 1930...uh...in 1926, I entered Franklin and Marshall College, graduated in 1930, was admitted to the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work, which is no longer in existence.</span> <span id="s33">And at the end of my first year, I was offered a job with the Jewish Board of Guardians, which was then the largest Jewish Psychiatric Clinic in New York.</span> <span id="s34">I spent 6 years with the clinic.</span> <span id="s35">In 41, I took a civil service exam for parole officer, started as a parole officer by '41.</span> <span id="s36">I had to beat everybody in the state, and was appointed to the position of executive case supervisor, and I had that job 'til '43.</span> <span id="s37">In 1943, one of my brothers was involved in very important war work.</span> <span id="s38">Sol, I left the division and went to work with him, and at the end of the war in '45, the American Jewish Joint Distribution 1 located approx. 800 km north of Pyongyang in the Heilonjiang Province in Manchuria, China.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Committee issued an appeal for social workers to work overseas.</span> <span id="s40">So I got a job with the Joint, as it was known, and after a month's indoctrination or so, I was sent to Europe and I was member of the first group of Jewish social workers that came to Germany to work with the survivors of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: When you arrived in Germany, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, originally I understand my orders were to work in Munich.</span> <span id="s43">I might say that when I got to Europe, we spent a week or so in Paris and nobody really knew what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s44">I was in Munich where I was supposed to work, but reports came in that there were hundreds of Jews in trouble and needing food, clothing, and so forth in a little town in Schwandorf in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s45">So I went up to Schwandorf.</span> <span id="s46">I found these Jews and they needed...they weren't registered with UNRRASo it was a question of getting them jobs, getting them food, and getting them registered and later on helping them to meet their needs.</span> <span id="s47">So I began to work in Schwandorf.</span> <span id="s48">And slowly, I discovered Jews were living in the small towns in the area so I began traveling to these towns and there again I found an interesting thing that in a number of these towns, the handful of Jews living there were the survivors of the infamous, what I call infamous, death marches.</span> <span id="s49">The Germans at the end of the war marched thousands of Jews through the forests.</span> <span id="s50">And at the end when they decided to leave, they killed half of the survivors and those that survived dug mass graves and got into the nearest town.</span> <span id="s51">So as I got into these towns I found the Jews living in the old barns, over manure piles, and cellars and my job was to get them housing and food and shelter, clothing and...I had Eisenhower's...General Eisenhower's orders in my pocket for the Germans to provide decent housing for them so I was able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s53">And what happened...what happened then when you started working with these people?</span> <span id="s54">What were some of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, I had many experiences.</span> <span id="s56">It should be noted that almost 95 or 99 percent of these Jews were Polish Jews and apparently they came to communities used to organized life, so one of the first thing they did wherever they settled, they formed their own organizations, so I worked through an organization so I had somebody to talk to, committees who wanted food, clothing, money; who needed help.</span> <span id="s57">They had trouble with UNRRA.</span> <span id="s58">UNRRA, with the United States Army.</span> <span id="s59">Uh...I left my wife and two children home.</span> <span id="s60">I'll never forget one of the first experiences was being from the little town of Burglengenfeld where I met a little, small child named Ruthie.</span> <span id="s61">Ruth Fleischer, who had been in hiding...hidden with a Polish family.</span> <span id="s62">Her father was killed.</span> <span id="s63">Her mother lived in this little town.</span> <span id="s64">She went back to Poland and found Ruth.</span> <span id="s65">And when I met Ruth, I'll never forget the little one said to me, "Mr. Levine," in Yiddish, "I am 10 years old and I don't know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s66">Please help me go to school."</span> <span id="s67">First thing the child asked me.</span> <span id="s68">But at the beginning, as I said, we had Jews coming and going.</span> <span id="s69">There were Jews drifting in from Poland.</span> <span id="s70">There was always the question of 2 The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">housing for these people.</span> <span id="s72">At one point, not too long after I came, we had to open a tent city...tent city near the city of Cham, C-H-A-M.</span> <span id="s73">I want to digress for a moment to say that I was...God was good to me because on the first day of my work in Schwandorf, in this little town where Jews hadn't lived for...maybe never lived, German town where the church was built in the 1400s.</span> <span id="s74">I met a young man named Moshe, M-0-S-H-E, Rechnitz, R-E-C-H-N-I-T-</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Z. Moshe was about 21 or 22 years old.</span> <span id="s76">He spoke a number of languages.</span> <span id="s77">He came from the city of Katowice in Poland and I employed him right there.</span> <span id="s78">Moshe was my driver and my assistant almost like my son.</span> <span id="s79">Wonderful young man, so I was...he...he was really my right arm.</span> <span id="s80">And while I'm talking about Moshe, I might say that he himself spent...was in 5, 6 slave camps, slave labor camps.</span> <span id="s81">His mother was killed in one of the labor camps, munitions plant.</span> <span id="s82">He was in Buchenwald and he was on one of these death marches.</span> <span id="s83">And one morning he and I were driving through these beautiful Bavarian hills when we came to beautiful spot.</span> <span id="s84">He stopped the Jeep and he asked me to follow him, went down a little...a little brook and there I saw shoes, odd shoes laying on the ground and he told that he was...when he was on a death march, when they came to this little...this area outside of the town of Stamsreid, the Germans killed half of the handful of survivors.</span> <span id="s85">And he was one of the living on these people the survivors dug a grave, there was a mass grave and Moshe was freed in Stamsreid.</span> <span id="s86">Now, I traveled from town to town because these where Jews were organized and these people needed money for food for programs that they ran, and the Joint really financed most of their stuff.</span> <span id="s87">I worked mostly with UNRRA, which provided food and clothing, and the United States Army, so I ended up being the spokesman for the Jews.</span> <span id="s88">I had a simulated rank of lieutenant colonel which meant nothing except that it gave me entree to top headquarters.</span> <span id="s89">I dealt with the generals in the area, general 4th Armored Division, so that I had no trouble there.</span> <span id="s90">Now, many...of course, I have many memories of a lot of things happening.</span> <span id="s91">I want: to describe some of them.</span> <span id="s92">One morning I was in my office when two men came in.</span> <span id="s93">One of them turned to me and said, "Levine, you and the Joint are doing a good job providing food, clothing and shelter, but we need something for the Geist."</span> <span id="s94">I think this happened later in the year.</span> <span id="s95">At any rate, this incident happened.</span> <span id="s96">I said, "What do you mean by Geist?"</span> <span id="s97">He said, "Something for the spirit of the Jews."</span> <span id="s98">I looked at the man and I said, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s99">He said, "We need a Yiddish newspaper."</span> <span id="s100">I might digress for a moment to say that I was fortunate to have been in Munich, shortly after...after my arrival and was at that printing plant when the first copy of the...called Unser Weg, the Yiddish paper, came off the press, and I brought a copy to give to the Museum.</span> <span id="s101">So there's a man who wants a paper published in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s102">So I asked who he was, and he says, "My name is Silverberg,and I was the editor of the Moment in Warsaw, which meant nothing to me, but I later learned that the Moment was the New York Times of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s103">And he said, "What you need is a newspaper."</span> <span id="s104">I thought the guy was crazy.</span> <span id="s105">I had visions of, you know, what's involved in printing a paper.</span> <span id="s106">So I said, "How are you going to print a paper?"</span> <span id="s107">So he then told me that before the war, he dealt with a firm in Frankfurt that supplied types for European countries.</span> <span id="s108">He was confident that even though the building was bombed...it was bombed, he knew where in the basement he'd find Yiddish type.</span> <span id="s109">Then the said, "If...if you pay for this thing, and pay the expenses...this man introduced me, and now I will go around...we're gonna find hand typesetters."</span> <span id="s110">I said, "Fine.</span> <span id="s111">What are you going to print it on?"</span> <span id="s112">"Oh," he says, "I've already found a local German printer and made arrangements where if we pay him, he'll print it."</span> <span id="s113">I said, "That's fine.</span> <span id="s114">What about a paper and ink?"</span> <span id="s115">He said, "That's where you gotta come in.</span> <span id="s116">We already located a German who has a lot of paper and ink hidden.</span> <span id="s117">You'll have to get the requisition to...through the United States Army.</span> <span id="s118">I believed I involved Rabbi Gene Lipman in this deal.</span> <span id="s119">At any rate, the paper finally came out called Der Najer Moment.</span> <span id="s120">And a interesting thing happened.</span> <span id="s121">Shortly before I left for America, I got...received a telephone call from an excited Jew, claiming that there were hundreds of Jews at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s122">This was in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s123">And that the commotion, couple of them were shot and there was trouble at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s124">So I grabbed the man, Abe Cohn, he came to replace me and we jump in a Jeep and I had one of the UNRRA men drive the Jeep and I don't think any Jeep ever cut across the city faster.</span> <span id="s125">Lucky we weren't killed.</span> <span id="s126">When I got to the railroad station and found six hundred Jews.</span> <span id="s127">Apparently, these people were being transported I later learned from Austria to a camp near the Czech border.</span> <span id="s128">The locomotive broke down in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s129">So when I arrived Jews are sleeping on the ground, some in the box cars, couple tried to make fires to light something.</span> <span id="s130">On the far end, there were railroad and German police surrounding young kids, and I understand one young kid was shot in the legs and now...a day later brought him back from the hospital.</span> <span id="s131">I learned that these six hundred people --this was in Linz, Austria --were given a couple hours notice to get on the train.</span> <span id="s132">There were no chaplains on the train.</span> <span id="s133">It was a shameful thing.</span> <span id="s134">They were given a couple slices of meat and bread and no water.</span> <span id="s135">And I learned that at night some of the young G.I.'s shot their guns in the air so the Jews in each freight car thought they were killing Jews so he told me this story.</span> <span id="s136">At any rate, as soon as I learned all this I had all my food I had in my litlle warehouse sent over.</span> <span id="s137">Emptied my warehouse.</span> <span id="s138">Got a hold of the UNRRA, which sent me huge cans of soup and bread and they finally fixed the locomotive, and as the train pulled out I wished at that moment that every [American] Jew could have been with me as these Jews, American Jews who made all this possible, as they waved, thanking me.</span> <span id="s139">Then I went back to my home in order to get Munich, spent a hour on the telephone just to be connected.</span> <span id="s140">I reported this to my headquarters.</span> <span id="s141">A day later checked...I made arrangements and in the future no transports went out without a chaplain.</span> <span id="s142">Now, I didn't get into my pajamas until about 12 o'clock at night when I received a telephone call from Silverberg, the editor of the Moment, asking that I come to his home immediately.</span> <span id="s143">I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s144">Said something very important happened.</span> <span id="s145">I rushed to his apartment, and he introduced me to two men who escaped from the transport who knew Silverberg.</span> <span id="s146">One was Schlomoberl Berlinsky, who was supposed to have been one of the leading novelists in Poland, and a man named Mendel Mann, who was one of the rising Yiddish poets in Poland.</span> <span id="s147">He introduced me and he wanted me to meet them because these men had no identification.</span> <span id="s148">They had nothing.</span> <span id="s149">To make sure the next morning I could take care of them so they wouldn't be picked up.</span> <span id="s150">While we were talking, Silverberg told me that he would like to print something by these two men to let the world know that they are alive, but he said this presents a problem because I've got the paper set for publication.</span> <span id="s151">And it would cost money to reset the paper.</span> <span id="s152">And I said, "Go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s153">."</span> <span id="s154">Well, to make the story short, the paper came out and shortly thereafter, I was driving to Silverberg's home where outside I saw two young men, one of whom I recognized and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s155">Was a member of Kibbutz Nahum, it was a kibbutz about 20 kids, Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'irand I 3 Hebrew: "the Young Guard"; a collectivist and utopian Zionist youth movement.</span> <span id="s156">Mostly active was like their substitute father.</span> <span id="s157">And the kids rushed over to me, and the strange kid held the Moment like a hot coal in his hand.</span> <span id="s158">And the kid that knew me asked me, "Where did...where does the editor live?"</span> <span id="s159">Silverberg.</span> <span id="s160">So I said, "What's the excitement about?"</span> <span id="s161">He said, "Let him tell you."</span> <span id="s162">This kid told me that before the war, he and his mother and sister and, I think, and father, lived in Warsaw [or] in Lodz; either of the two.</span> <span id="s163">At any rate, while his father was awlay seeing his publishers, he and his mother and sister were put in the camp.</span> <span id="s164">He lost his mother and sister, never saw his father, and he said that after the war he and another buddy decided to go to Poland to look for their relatives.</span> <span id="s165">They came to the city of Bamberg in Germany after the war, and from there they went to Poland.</span> <span id="s166">He told me how he went to Poland looking for his father.</span> <span id="s167">He knew his mother died and sister.</span> <span id="s168">He came back from Poland to Bamberg and went to bed that night, got up in the morning and found our paper, the Moment, which was distributed.</span> <span id="s169">He took the Moment, and there's an article about his father.</span> <span id="s170">He said, "Where is my father?"</span> <span id="s171">So that night we reunited father and son, if did nothing else with the paper.</span> <span id="s172">Well, at any rate, that's the newspapers.</span> <span id="s173">A number of other interesting things happened.</span> <span id="s174">For instance, in '46 most of...for all these Jews, for almost all of them, it was the first free...I mean it was the first time they could observe Pesach as free man.</span> <span id="s175">You know, the war is 39, 46 and so forth.</span> <span id="s176">So for days, the Joint sent me in a shipment of matzoh and wine and I spent my travel money to make arrangements with communities to come in and pick up their requisitions.</span> <span id="s177">And for a week or two Moshe and I spent time doling out matzoh and wines and Haggadot and they gave them money to buy fish.</span> <span id="s178">And several things happened.</span> <span id="s179">When I..</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">after I got through meeting with the last delegation, I went up to my room to call Munich and I reported that everything was distributed.</span> <span id="s182">They then asked whether I gave...distributed wine or matzoh to the camp Deggendorf...1200 Jews.</span> <span id="s183">So I told them they hadn't sent it...they didn't send me anything.</span> <span id="s184">I felt so wonderful and suddenly the bottom fell out.</span> <span id="s185">No wine for 1200 people.</span> <span id="s186">So I called Deggendorf and they were smart.</span> <span id="s187">They made their own wine, and they baked their own matzoh.</span> <span id="s188">Well the reason I tell this story is that at that time the chief medical officer for the area which had 300,000 DPs...there were only a very small number of Jews, like I don't know many thousands...4 thousand, 5 thousand, where the Jewish doctor, woman doctor from Chicago a Dr. Anna Monatov (ph).</span> <span id="s189">I remembered her.</span> <span id="s190">I also had working with me a nurse sent by the Jewish Agency, Becky Lyons, who is still alive.</span> <span id="s191">She is now...she has a doctorate, which she is now a world authority in hospital administration.</span> <span id="s192">Lectures all over the world.</span> <span id="s193">And then there was the Jewish town major from the Bronx, a kid named Badian.</span> <span id="s194">And I invited these three to be my guest, you know, for seder to join the people I was with.</span> <span id="s195">After the service in the makeshift synagogue, oh, yes, and the president of the Gemeinde, of the community was the man named Jacob Gottlieb, who unfortunately was my age but his hair was white because I was told he watched his wife and two children thrown in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s196">At any rate, so we went to the first seder...to seder with the kids in the kibbutz and it was heartbreaking for me because there were 20 kids, no mother, no father, no nothing.</span> <span id="s197">We had a comparatively short service.</span> <span id="s198">No meat of course, just simple seder, but what we lacked in food the kids made up in spirit in Poland and Galicia before Second World War and formed many kibbutzim in Palestine after the War.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">as they did all...every time I was with them, their singing and their dancing, and they singing like they're going to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s200">Wonderful singing.</span> <span id="s201">When I..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">we left the kids about lO o'clock at night, my guests and I walked toward the Jewish center.</span> <span id="s204">Now, Regensburg is a city which has streets like those in...in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s205">The city is a thousand years old or more.</span> <span id="s206">So as we approached...it was a moonlight night, and as we approached the...the Jewish Center building which, incidently, was in the shadow of a hugh cathedral built 4 or 5 hundred years ago, we heard noises coming from the building.</span> <span id="s207">And came to the Center and we found that they had a community seder on the second floor.</span> <span id="s208">They cleaned out all the furniture, put up these wooden tables and as we walked in, they had just finished their meal and I saw a sea of men and women and this little child and they weren't happy.</span> <span id="s209">But as soon as they saw us, they began to sing and then sang another song.</span> <span id="s210">Suddenly, they were not alone.</span> <span id="s211">Within a few minutes four guys ran downstairs and they brought up a piano.</span> <span id="s212">This was a seder.</span> <span id="s213">The guy began...one of of the men sat at the piano, began to play.</span> <span id="s214">The other was singing.</span> <span id="s215">Then two or three couples got on the top of the tables and began to dance.</span> <span id="s216">While this was going on, I saw one man throw...they had huge windows, German windows.</span> <span id="s217">He threw them out as if to let the world know that the Jews are still alive and they sang as loud as they could as if to let the Germans and the world know that they were alive.</span> <span id="s218">At any rate, this seder went on til about another hour or so, then I went home and wrote a letter to my wife describing that.</span> <span id="s219">That was the first seder.</span> <span id="s220">I think it's important to describe the first Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s221">The first Hanukkah, this is in 45.</span> <span id="s222">This was in Schwandorf.</span> <span id="s223">The Jews had no Jewish center there so I got a..</span> <span id="s224">.</span> <span id="s225">I requisitioned an old beer hall which...when the Germans stopped using a building, you can imagine what condition it was in.</span> <span id="s226">But the Jews cleaned it up, repainted the walls, and had the section put up...the section for a synagogue, and the rest was for a social hall.</span> <span id="s227">And I got military permission --there was a curfew-- for the Jews to stay out late that night, and we had our first Hanukkah light lit in the synagogue, in the makeshift synagogue in Schwandorf.</span> <span id="s228">It happened that at that time...first I got to say that before this synagogue...before Schwandorf, our service, I might tell you that I came back to Schwandorf with a bunch of mail and letters and so forth, and while I was...came into the room of the President Schwarzfuchs, I noticed a gentleman sitting there.</span> <span id="s229">He was a bearded man sitting like this.</span> <span id="s230">He suddenly turned to me and say, "Was für ein Joint ist da?"</span> <span id="s231">The Joint is our organization.</span> <span id="s232">So I turned to Schwarzfuchs, I said, "Who is this man?"</span> <span id="s233">He says, "He is a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s234">He came from Warsaw."</span> <span id="s235">Survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s236">So I said, "Was meint ihr?</span> <span id="s237">What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s238">He says, "Wo ist die Mikvah für die Weiber?"</span> <span id="s239">You know the mikvah.</span> <span id="s240">I'm in this stinking little town.</span> <span id="s241">"Und wo sind die Hanukkah-Lichter für Hanukkah?"</span> <span id="s242">.</span> <span id="s243">I didn't realize Hanukkah was in another week.</span> <span id="s244">So I went down...so within a few days I went to a warehouse, military warehouse, in a place called Walhalla, on the Danube, not from Regensburg.</span> <span id="s245">And when the supply man wouldn't give me any candles...I figured I'd get candles and cut them half and distribute them.</span> <span id="s246">So he wouldn't give me that so I got the...called Munich.</span> <span id="s247">Took me an hour to get through.</span> <span id="s248">And the man in charge gave me...gave this guy permission to give me some cases of candles.</span> <span id="s249">So my driver and I then went back and we were cutting candles in half when I got phone call from Munich and advising me that the Rabbi, Chaplain Gene Lipman, had been to Palestine, brought back Palestinian candles, and holders, the Menorahs, and was on the way and within a short time Gene came with his assistant, Si Pava, and the four of us were sorting bundles of candles and we distributed them to the area.</span> <span id="s250">Now let me go back to the synagogue in Schwandorf So the first Hanukkah light I thought I'd spend it with the Jews in Schwandorf.</span> <span id="s251">It was my own...almost just like my home.</span> <span id="s252">And this Rabbi was still there, so he gave a address.</span> <span id="s253">He spoke about a half an hour, and then there was joy and we had kegs of beer and we celebrated.</span> <span id="s254">I spent...went a few other towns for different Hannukahs.</span> <span id="s255">But the ]ast Hanukkah candle lighting and I attended the Synagogue in Straubing.</span> <span id="s256">Straubing was not too far from Regensburg.</span> <span id="s257">And the head of the community was man named by Steven Schwartz, who was an engineer.</span> <span id="s258">Wonderful gentleman.</span> <span id="s259">And I took with me from Regensburg, I think I brought the Rabbi, Joseph Glazer, who...later we gave him the title of Oberrabbi, Chief Rabbi.</span> <span id="s260">He's alive and lives in Cedarhurst, Long Island.</span> <span id="s261">And we came to...to Straubing.</span> <span id="s262">I walked in to a magnificent, newly painted synagogue.</span> <span id="s263">I learned that during...the synagogue was built in 1907.</span> <span id="s264">During the war the Germans turned it into a warehouse.</span> <span id="s265">After a war, the young man appeared and told Steven Schwartz that he was a native of Straubing.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">His grandfather, I think, built the synagogue.</span> <span id="s267">That in the cellar of the synagogue they would find the original plans for it, and sure enough in a case they found the original, you know, architectural and drawing plans.</span> <span id="s268">And there's a Jewish town major and they forced the Germans to redo the synagogue as it was.</span> <span id="s269">So Steven Schwartz used that...used this oocasion of the last candle almost like a rededication of the synagogue I'll never forget Steven had a huge Menorah built in the back of the synagogue and he had huge candles in it.</span> <span id="s270">Must have been stolen from some church.</span> <span id="s271">On the Bimah, he had covered with velvet, he had this beautiful, little, hand carved Menorah I bought...you know, the Gene Lipman from Palestine, and Palestinian candles were lit.</span> <span id="s272">Can you picture the scene?</span> <span id="s273">In the audience were the Jews from Schwandorf, from Straubing, a few Jewish GIs, and Schwartz arranged a program which included music by the first musical group in the area, from Camp Deggendorf.</span> <span id="s274">And as I listened to them, there were tears down my eyes to think that thousands and thousands and thousands of Jews with that kind of talent were burned in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s275">I was the last speaker, and I'll never forget looking into these sad faces.</span> <span id="s276">And when I got through, it was like a wind came in and slowly they drifted out.</span> <span id="s277">And when I came home I sat down and wrote my wife a letter and I, of course, realized what do they have to be happy about?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Hanukkah, the joyous moment.</span> <span id="s279">So that was the Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s280">I went one later on, but I missed my first great experience and I better tel] it now, and that is my visit to Dachau.</span> <span id="s281">On October 6, 1945, the day before I left Schwandorf, I heard there is a camp at Dachau.</span> <span id="s282">I didn't know too much about it.</span> <span id="s283">The Joint at that time had a pool of two or three drivers so one of the men was assigned to drive me and it was obvious he was very reluctant to do it.</span> <span id="s284">We came to Dachau.</span> <span id="s285">It was a beautiful morning.</span> <span id="s286">We parked the car at the far end of the lot.</span> <span id="s287">We didn't know what we're going to find.</span> <span id="s288">It was a large installation, barracks you know.</span> <span id="s289">As it turned out that the first building I walked into was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s290">And the driver, this man was in back of me...I believe there was a German guide.</span> <span id="s291">I can't say for sure.</span> <span id="s292">At any rate, we walked into what I learned was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s293">The walls were covered with blood.</span> <span id="s294">Now, it's beautiful, painted white if you go there.</span> <span id="s295">It's a museum.</span> <span id="s296">From the gas chamber, I walked into the next room that had three ovens.</span> <span id="s297">I recall turning back and looking at this man's face.</span> <span id="s298">It was green.</span> <span id="s299">And mine...mine must have been the same way.</span> <span id="s300">I walked into a third room, and the room was lined with shelves with small earten jars.</span> <span id="s301">And I looked down and in front of me were two barrels of human ashes.</span> <span id="s302">My blood must have been frozen.</span> <span id="s303">I turned to my right and I wanted to grab the first thing I could and there was a barrel with these earthen jar covers, which I brought.</span> <span id="s304">And by that point I wanted to get out into the sunlight.</span> <span id="s305">And I didn't want to see anything of the camp.</span> <span id="s306">And we walked to the far end of the lot and we got to the car.</span> <span id="s307">And the man turned to me and said, "Levine, look what you got in your hands?"</span> <span id="s308">The jar covers were just almost like glued.</span> <span id="s309">So we finally calmed down, both of us and I might say that as we were leaving, we saw Germans playing Fußball, soccer.</span> <span id="s310">They were guards who were prisoners of the United States army.</span> <span id="s311">They were being fed 4,000 calories a day as prisoners, while the Jews were getting 1700 calories a day from UNRRA and the military, most of it potatoes.</span> <span id="s312">At any rate, as we left, we got in the car.</span> <span id="s313">We both calmed down.</span> <span id="s314">And after 5 minutes or so the man turned...said to me, "Levine, did you notice that I was reluctant to drive you?"</span> <span id="s315">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s316">"So, I'll tell you why."</span> <span id="s317">He says, "I was on the last transport...last transport that was brought to Dachau.</span> <span id="s318">The Americans were approaching.</span> <span id="s319">They couldn't even talke us in the camp.</span> <span id="s320">They took us on a march about 30 kilometers.</span> <span id="s321">I was on the march from Dachau to Munich.</span> <span id="s322">Almost half of the people dropped dead or were shot on the way.</span> <span id="s323">And before the Germans ran away...this was the pattern...they'd shot half of the survivors."</span> <span id="s324">And he said, "I was among the living and I ended up in Munich.</span> <span id="s325">That's why you found me in Munich."</span> <span id="s326">Then he said, "Who would have thought that I who was brought to Dachau to be exterminated would walk through and come out alive."</span> <span id="s327">So that's; just one of the incidents.</span> <span id="s328">I want to say something about my dear friend, Chaim Diamond.</span> <span id="s329">Chaim Diamond was a young man who, with his younger brother, were survivors of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s330">Chaim was the president of the little community of Eggenfelden.</span> <span id="s331">He later became active and was a member of the Central Committee.</span> <span id="s332">And I left him in '46.</span> <span id="s333">We renewed friendship in '56 in New York, where he is a successful businessman and we've been friends ever since.</span> <span id="s334">And while talking about Chaim, I can also talk about Eggenfelden because this is an example of what kind of work I did.</span> <span id="s335">For instanae, one day I received a telephone call from the UNRRA Director, who was a gentlemen from Virgin Islands named Johnson.</span> <span id="s336">He called me up.</span> <span id="s337">I'd never heard of Eggenfelden but he called me up and told me the story that there were Jews living in Eggenfelden under horrible living conditions and that there was a hotel...I thought he said it was owned by a Jew.</span> <span id="s338">At any rate, which is about to be turned over to the Germans by the town major, and he suggested that I try to come down and maybe try to get the hotel for the Jews.</span> <span id="s339">So I drove to Eggenfelden and I had my notes home, and I took inventory of how Jews lived.</span> <span id="s340">Six people in the basement, five people in one little room with one twin bed.</span> <span id="s341">It was horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s342">So I talked to the Jews, came back, saw the colonel in charge of this department for the army, gave him the report at 9 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s343">By 4 o'clock in the afternoon he sent over a message to me, "You can have the hotel."</span> <span id="s344">So they arranged for the Jews to move into the hotel.</span> <span id="s345">That wasn't all.</span> <span id="s346">After the Jews settled, the delegation came to me, "We need a Jewish center."</span> <span id="s347">So we found an abandoned building not...almost a block away from the hotel, and I got that from the military.</span> <span id="s348">And the Jews again cleaned it up, painted it, so forth.</span> <span id="s349">I took some people with me for the...on the official opening, and what a joy it was to walk into this newly-painted hall.</span> <span id="s350">The fixtures were made by a man who was in the business in Poland before the war, and they made the fixtures from planes...parts of parts of airplanes, and there were Jewish musicians singing and dancing until about 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s351">That was in the town of Eggenfelden where Chaim Diamond was one of the leaders.</span> <span id="s352">Deggendorf has to be mentioned.</span> <span id="s353">Deggendorf was a camp of 400 Jews in the area, mostly German Jews who were rescued from Theresienstadt and Chaplain Lipman had a lot to do with them coming there.</span> <span id="s354">And I must say that I met Gene Lipman in Munich and he said, "We'll get together."</span> <span id="s355">Two days after I was in the little town of Schwandorf, Gene Lipman appeared with his assistant, Si, Simon Pava, P-A-V-A, wonderful Chaplain's assistant.</span> <span id="s356">And he said, "Joe, what did you bring with you from America?</span> <span id="s357">Can you take it with you?</span> <span id="s358">We're going to a birthday party."</span> <span id="s359">And, of course, I was there only one day, so I had stuff that I brought from the United States.</span> <span id="s360">Canned stuff to give away.</span> <span id="s361">Put it in the Jeep and we road to the little town of Terschenreuth (ph) where there were four sisters whom Gene helped to live.</span> <span id="s362">He realled saved their lives.</span> <span id="s363">We had a wonderful party.</span> <span id="s364">That night I slept with Gene in a small bed.</span> <span id="s365">At 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by Gene.</span> <span id="s366">He said, "Joe, we're going to Deggendorf," which meant nothing to me.</span> <span id="s367">And it was my first four hour ride in a Jeep.</span> <span id="s368">Almost killed my insides.</span> <span id="s369">We got to Deggendorf and when people saw Gene and his assistant, it was almost that noise like a messiah came.</span> <span id="s370">Hundreds of people suddenly began approaching.</span> <span id="s371">See, Gene was one of the saviors.</span> <span id="s372">The camp was well- organized.</span> <span id="s373">A woman named Kitty Rothschild ran it til the end.</span> <span id="s374">At any rate, what happened...I'm telling you the story of Deggendorf because when Gene appeared he carried bags of mail.</span> <span id="s375">The Jews had no mail service, so Gene...and these people had a lot of American relatives.</span> <span id="s376">So Gene arranged with these Jews to address letters to Americans.</span> <span id="s377">He sent them out in his own envelopes, with a note: Send your reply to me and I'll deliver it.</span> <span id="s378">So he set up a mail service which I inherited.</span> <span id="s379">And that was part of my job.</span> <span id="s380">I did that too.</span> <span id="s381">I might say that while doing that Jews came over to me to ask me to find their relatives in America.</span> <span id="s382">So the mail would come and I had an uncle named Jake Bernstein.</span> <span id="s383">He moved to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s384">So some guy would give me a name Izzy Cohen, he moved to New York.</span> <span id="s385">Go find Izzy Cohen I didn't have any copying machine, damn it, but I cabled to America and got telephone books and with my boy and I..</span> <span id="s386">.</span> <span id="s387">with Moshe and I would sit sometime most of the night copying all the Goldbergs like J. Goldberg from Brooklyn, and I sent him a letter with a note that so and so comes from this town.</span> <span id="s388">He's looking for his uncle.</span> <span id="s389">Maybe you're his relative.</span> <span id="s390">Once in a while I got a reply.</span> <span id="s391">That was part of the mail service.</span> <span id="s392">My work, as I said, required providing food, clothing and shelter.</span> <span id="s393">We faced a situation where Jews after the Kielce Pogrom, we had hundreds of Jews coming into the United States Zone.</span> <span id="s394">We lacked housing for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Where was the Kielce Pogrom from?</span> <span id="s396">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Where was the Kielce Pogrom from?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: In Poland.</span> <span id="s399">The Jews returned to Poland, and there was antisemitism and they killed a number of Jews, so Jews fled from Poland.</span> <span id="s400">And this was already in '46 and I got to tell you a story how I was in...at the Czech border, came home tired, when I found a message.</span> <span id="s401">Report to 4 The Kielce Pogrom took place on 4 July 1946.</span> <span id="s402">Forty-two Jews were killed, and the incident initiated a mass migration of surviving Eastern European Jews to the West.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">General Perkins, 4th Armored Division, immediately upon your arrival.</span> <span id="s404">So as tired as I was, I jumped in my Jeep and went to headquarters.</span> <span id="s405">And when I came in...I'm not trying to impress you, but it's interesting that there were Colonels and Majors waiting to see the General, Chief of Staff a man named Erzag (ph).</span> <span id="s406">I remember him.</span> <span id="s407">As soon as he saw me, he went into the General's office, out marched a couple of colonels and I was ushered into the General's office.</span> <span id="s408">There was another General with him, Robert (ph).</span> <span id="s409">I came in.</span> <span id="s410">The General greeted me and he did something he never did before.</span> <span id="s411">He had a basket of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s412">He said, "Joe, sit down.</span> <span id="s413">Have a cigarette."</span> <span id="s414">I smelled something.</span> <span id="s415">I said, "You wanted to see me immediately on my arrival."</span> <span id="s416">So he said...he told me then what happened.</span> <span id="s417">He said, "While you were gone, the General and I discussed the problem of housing for the Jews."</span> <span id="s418">You see the Army was responsible for a lot of this.</span> <span id="s419">And they wanted efficiency and they then told me...so he then said, "We decided we found a way to solve the problem."</span> <span id="s420">I said, "What do you have in mind?"</span> <span id="s421">he said, "Well in the town of Pocking (P-O-C-K-I-N-G) down near Passau, southern part of Bavaria, we have a camp where there are four thousand Hungarians and two thousand Poles now occupying that."</span> <span id="s422">He said, "We're going to ship the Hungarians out.</span> <span id="s423">We'll take the Poles and send them to some other...there were thousand of Poles...Polish camps."</span> <span id="s424">He said, "We'll turn that camp into a Jewish camp."</span> <span id="s425">He said, "We'll take all the Jews who live in these little towns and put them in this camp."</span> <span id="s426">And I blew my top.</span> <span id="s427">When I walked out, I really pinched myself, saying "Did you dare do it?"</span> <span id="s428">I talked to these Generals and I said, "Are you guys crazy or nuts?"</span> <span id="s429">I said, "Number one, you'll have to take every Jew and carry him bodily.</span> <span id="s430">Secondly, I'll have nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s431">Thirdly, I'll let my headquarters know in New York what you want to do.</span> <span id="s432">You're talking about people who came out of...came out of the death camps, and you want: to put them in another camp."</span> <span id="s433">Well, they saw my reasoning, but they said, "Joe, we're still going to get rid of the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s434">We'll still get rid of the Poles.</span> <span id="s435">We've got to provide space for the new Jews coming in.</span> <span id="s436">Now, mind you, a lot of these people were not...caught in this camp.</span> <span id="s437">They came from Poland, so he suggested that Gene Lipman, Rabbi Lipman and I drive down.</span> <span id="s438">So we drove to Pocking, and we found these Hungarians.</span> <span id="s439">It was maddening for me to see these beautiful, well-dressed women with beautiful expensive fur coats.</span> <span id="s440">The Hungarians worked for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s441">And there were Poles there, but we found that this was a huge air base, used by Hermann Göring, with hundreds of planes that had been bombed Installation of lO or 15 thousand people were with hospitals, halls, and so forth.</span> <span id="s442">The facilities that were there, many of them bombed out.</span> <span id="s443">To make a long story short, they got rid of the Hungarians, who I might say took very movable item that they could.</span> <span id="s444">They ripped the walls.</span> <span id="s445">They took the pipes.</span> <span id="s446">They took the sinks.</span> <span id="s447">They took light fixtures.</span> <span id="s448">The Army had to rebuild them.</span> <span id="s449">They got rid of the Poles, who took all the cut wood with them.</span> <span id="s450">And then we began shipping Jews into the camp.</span> <span id="s451">Shortly after the camp opened, the General again sent a message to me: wants to see me.</span> <span id="s452">He said, "Joe, we'll having trouble with the camp.</span> <span id="s453">The Jews are burning beds, which is presenting a problem to the military.</span> <span id="s454">Go down and see what's what."</span> <span id="s455">So I went down and I..</span> <span id="s456">.</span> <span id="s457">sure enough when the Poles left they took all the wood and the saws and everything else that the Jews were supposed to get, the GIs sold them on the route, and the Jews were freezing so they burned beds.</span> <span id="s458">And they complained; well, we took care of that.</span> <span id="s459">I might say that two things happened during that visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Joe, we have to stop right now temporarily because they're gonna take....they finished the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Joe, we are ready now to recommence.</span> <span id="s463">A: Can I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Now during this trip to Pocking, I recall several things happened.</span> <span id="s466">Number one, if I haven't mentioned it, I want to say that I took along with me...I brought to this camp Becky Lyons, the nurse who came from Palestine sent by the Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s467">I called a meeting of all the people of the camp to explain to them that I was working with the military and will see that they will get whatever they need to make life more comfortable.</span> <span id="s468">As we were waiting for this group to get together, I found myself sitting next to a man and little son, about 10 or 11 years old, and I got in a conversation with the man and he told me that he was a partisan.</span> <span id="s469">You know, through most of the war he lived in the forest with his son.</span> <span id="s470">His wife was killed.</span> <span id="s471">And I turned to the little boy and I said, "What did you do?"</span> <span id="s472">He said, "I was a partisanchik."</span> <span id="s473">I was a little partisan.</span> <span id="s474">And then he said, "The other two kids who were there with me used to join me and at night we'd sneak into the nearest town to steal food."</span> <span id="s475">And then in Yiddish he said, "If we had to shoot, we shot."</span> <span id="s476">This was a little kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: How old about?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: About ll, 12 years old.</span> <span id="s479">And then his father said to him in Yiddish, "Show them where they shot you."</span> <span id="s480">And the kid picked up his sleeve, and he slowed me where he had been shot through the arm.</span> <span id="s481">This is a little kid.</span> <span id="s482">At any rate, I still remember standing on the platform with Becky Lyons with me, and when I introduced Becky as coming from Palestine, the symbol, a living person from Palestine where they wanted to go, I saw a sea of smiles as she said "Shalom."</span> <span id="s483">Just that one word, shalom, lit up the faces of the whole crowd.</span> <span id="s484">Another thing that happened that day, I remember, was I found that: there was a transport of about 20 children, the first transport.</span> <span id="s485">Later on there were hundreds of children brought in.</span> <span id="s486">I'll tell you where they came from.</span> <span id="s487">And I walked into a barrack where these kids were sleeping on straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s488">I spoke to the leader called Amadrich, a young girl about 18 years old and I'll never forget when I asked her what I could provide that the kids needed most, and her reply was, "Get me paper.</span> <span id="s489">Get me pencils.</span> <span id="s490">Maybe books.</span> <span id="s491">These children have to learn."</span> <span id="s492">This was the first thing she asked me for.</span> <span id="s493">Well, to end the story of Pocking, I might say that Pocking grew to a camp with about 6 or 8 thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s494">You see, Jews were fleeing from Poland and other parts of Europe into the United States Zone.</span> <span id="s495">Since they had not been in camps, you know, this was better than sleeping outdoors.</span> <span id="s496">Children appeared because the Jewish Brigade boys brought them.</span> <span id="s497">You know, people don't know the story that after the war, members of the Jewish Brigade in Palestine volunteered to go into Europe to find children, and they went into Rumania and Hungary, and Poland and they found Jewish children that were living in monasteries or whatever, and they brought them into the United States Zone.</span> <span id="s498">And that explains why there were so many children in Pocking.</span> <span id="s499">UNRRA threw a large team into Pocking, a Jewish member of the Joint named, I think the first name was Ruth, Fisher.</span> <span id="s500">F-I-S- H-E-R, from Chicago was the Joint worker in Pocking.</span> <span id="s501">At any rate, that's the story of Pocking, and at home I have the figures of population....I'll turn it over to the Museum...in Pocking by the end of the time I left.</span> <span id="s502">And one unforgettable thing that happened...I don't know whether I gave it to her for...to show here, but I brought it with me is the story of the Barhovich siddur.</span> <span id="s503">Now Moshe Barhovich was the head of the Vad Hadati, extreme organized Jews in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s504">I worked with Moshe.</span> <span id="s505">To give you an example of the kind of work he did, when a Polish young man whom I helped to become a director opened up a small camp in the middle of the forest where they took over the barracks where Hitler trained some of his toughest men for murder, a small camp was opened.</span> <span id="s506">And I went on the day when the first transport arrived, and Tony did a beautiful job of fixing the place liveable, and within 10 minutes a delegation came to me, saying, "The camp is fine, but where is the kosher kitchen?"</span> <span id="s507">So Tony, as a Polish Catholic, didn't think of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s508">The army didn't think of the kitchen, and I didn't mention it.</span> <span id="s509">So I had quite a job to convince the Jews that I'm going back to Regensburg, and I'll see that everything was sent up within a day or two for a kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s510">When I came back to my office, Moshe...I mean this man Bohovich, was waiting for me, and he wanted to know what about the kosher kitchen in the camp.</span> <span id="s511">So I told him the problem I had.</span> <span id="s512">I found there was no kitchen, but we gotta go out and buy the pots and pans, and we'll do it.</span> <span id="s513">He said, "You give me the money and I'll go out and get it."</span> <span id="s514">Three hours later.</span> <span id="s515">I looked out of my office and I saw a sight I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s516">This fellow, Bohovich, and two men with him apparently rented a hugh Mercedes, one of the big ones.</span> <span id="s517">I looked out of my window and there is Bohovich sitting in this car, surrounded with pots and pans, came to tell he that he was on the way to the camp.</span> <span id="s518">That night they had their kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s519">They made a kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s520">Well, at any rate, I think it was Purim, where I went to the services in the makeship synagogue.</span> <span id="s521">Moshe showed up with his two young boys.</span> <span id="s522">He had maybe 13 or 14 year-old boys.</span> <span id="s523">We had few siddurim, prayer books, and as the service started, Moshe pulled out a siddur, a book.</span> <span id="s524">And I was sitting next to them, and the three of them, all of them doven, prayed, from this one book.</span> <span id="s525">After the service I examined the book and I found that it had...I later counted them...148 pages of a hand- printed siddur.</span> <span id="s526">So as to the story of the siddur, which I asked him later to write out, which I have here in Yiddish and I ought to translate into English.</span> <span id="s527">And the story was that he and his family lived in the town of Zelechow, in Poland.</span> <span id="s528">The Germans entered....captured the town, and the Poles worked with the Germans.</span> <span id="s529">He recalls how the synagogue was destroyed, Torahs they ripped up, and how....he describes in this letter how his daughter and wife and sister and children were killed, mentioned to me that he thought he was among only a handful of survivors of 15,000 Jews in Zelechow.</span> <span id="s530">He had been a partisan, but when the wrote the siddur, he said he was living in hiding in the cellar of a Pole, who also took advantage of him he said.</span> <span id="s531">At any rate, being a former.</span> <span id="s532">.</span> <span id="s533">a pious Jew who worshiped three times a day, fearing that he may die and his boys would not have prayer book to doven, he said I didn't even have room to stand up because I got...somehow he got paper and ink well and ink and from memory he wrote this siddur, Bohovich siddur.</span> <span id="s534">So I cabled America, and I got the proper paper and I got a hold of a German who made several copies.</span> <span id="s535">I have one copy.</span> <span id="s536">I gave Rabbi Lipman the small copy which the German first experimented and I had another copy which I gave to the archives in Munich, so that it is now in the Yad VaShem.</span> <span id="s537">My copy was taken by Rabbi Lipman to the Hebrew Union College.</span> <span id="s538">They copied it and it is now in their collection of rare books.</span> <span id="s539">Now this was all in....</span> <span id="s540">Now, after the war when I got home, I made efforts and I contacted a number of these people: Americans, Palestine, Israel, New York, elsewhere.</span> <span id="s541">I kept on a correspondence and I began looking for Moshe Bohovich.</span> <span id="s542">And one day I wrote to Yivo, you know, in New York, and asked them if they heard about it, and they told me that in the memorial book on Zelechow, you know, after the war there were hundreds of memorial books published by groups to memorialize their towns...the pictures of the dead.</span> <span id="s543">And they told me if I went to the memorial book on Zelechow, there is something by Moshe Bohovich.</span> <span id="s544">And then they said...they suggested I write to a guy named Kaplan Cohn in Chicago.</span> <span id="s545">So I wrote to Cohn, and within a week I got a letter from a guy.</span> <span id="s546">He said, "I'm Moshe Bohovich.</span> <span id="s547">I understand you're looking for me.</span> <span id="s548">I live at 233 Grand Street, New York.</span> <span id="s549">Within a short time, I was in New York and I met Moshe.</span> <span id="s550">Now because he had two chiLdren, he was among the earliest ones I helped to get the heck out of Germany.</span> <span id="s551">Of course, I..</span> <span id="s552">.</span> <span id="s553">when he left I assumed he was going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s554">When I met him in New York, he told me that he and his children ended up in San Jose, Costa Rica.</span> <span id="s555">He started an export business.</span> <span id="s556">By that time, his two sons were grown.</span> <span id="s557">He had a son with 4, 5 children who was running the business.</span> <span id="s558">He spent 4 months in Costa Rica, 4 months in Miami, and 4 months in New York.</span> <span id="s559">Goodness.</span> <span id="s560">His other son, Bernado, graduated Harvard, got a degree from University of Barcelona, was one of the leading attorneys in Costa Rica; still practices under the name of Baruch Bohovich Abstein.</span> <span id="s561">In Costa Rica, was represented Costa Rica, in the UN.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s563">Hold on a minute.</span> <span id="s564">They're having a problem with someone doing some drilling.</span> <span id="s565">Q: We're going to have to hold it for a couple of minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">[Technical pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Hold it.</span> <span id="s568">Okay.</span> <span id="s569">We're almost ready.</span> <span id="s570">Allright:.</span> <span id="s571">Come back to 1950.</span> <span id="s572">All right.</span> <span id="s573">Okay, Joe we are now back on.</span> <span id="s574">Come back to 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Now as I say, in the 50s, I met Moshe Bohovich.</span> <span id="s576">We corresponded.</span> <span id="s577">Since early 70...in 73, when I first...after I retired, I went to Florida and I met him in Florida where he was living with his wife.</span> <span id="s578">For a number of subsequent years I'd see him.</span> <span id="s579">I have this wonderful story about his siddur, and as a Federation Director, I brought many outstanding writers and other peoples to lecture in Fort Wayne and when they heard the story, their answer was, "Joe, write it.</span> <span id="s580">I'll help you print it in a magazine."</span> <span id="s581">The old gentleman refused to give me permission until a few years ago when I last saw him and he finally told me why.</span> <span id="s582">He said that when he was a partisan, the Germans put a price of 100,000 Marks on his head for capture.</span> <span id="s583">He must have done something to antagonize the Germans.</span> <span id="s584">To make a long story short, he said...told me that he didn't want anything written about him, so that anybody who know where he was.</span> <span id="s585">At the age of 87, when he knew he didn't have long to live, he went to Ipala, Israel, where he died.</span> <span id="s586">And after his death, his son gave me permission.</span> <span id="s587">And I wrote the article which was published in the Jewish Spectator.</span> <span id="s588">The editor, Trudy Weis, who died shortly after the article was published.</span> <span id="s589">So it was the last thing she did was include the article about the Bohovich siddur in the Spectator.</span> <span id="s590">I published the story in the publication of our Indiana Jewish Historical Society.</span> <span id="s591">I didn't mention that I'd been directing the work of the Indiana Jewish Historical Society since 1972.</span> <span id="s592">So that's the story of the Bohovich siddur.</span> <span id="s593">I brought a picture of the Slota, S-L-O-T-A, family.</span> <span id="s594">It's worth mentioning because I was in my office in Regensburg when I got a call advising me that there was some Jews from a transport of Germans that were brought to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s595">I located where they placed these people.</span> <span id="s596">It was in an old, abandoned school house.</span> <span id="s597">When the Germans abandoned school house, you know, 100 years old, you know, the walls were thick and damp, it was cold, and I found 10 Jews in one room, where one double bed occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Slota and two children, Mita and Yana.</span> <span id="s598">They must have been about 11 years old.</span> <span id="s599">I remember I helped the others and I took this family and got them an apartment, clothing for the children and so forth.</span> <span id="s600">And on my last day...and this was before I left that all this happened, I went to say goodbye to the family and by that time we had a little kindergarten.</span> <span id="s601">I'll never forget I went to the kindergarten and there were these two little girls with starched dresses, ribbons in their hair and they turned to me like a record, both of them, says, "You love me.</span> <span id="s602">Yes?"</span> <span id="s603">So I bought a picture of this family.</span> <span id="s604">Both of these girls are now mothers.</span> <span id="s605">One has 5 children and is a grandmother.</span> <span id="s606">The other has four children.</span> <span id="s607">Leo Slota died in New York.</span> <span id="s608">There is a third beautiful daughter that they had in America, and I been in touch with them.</span> <span id="s609">I want to mention that family because again similar to other stories.</span> <span id="s610">I had a experience in the city of Furth, F-U-R-T-H, which is outside of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s611">This was just shortly after I got to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s612">I found that there was a transport of Jews arriving in Furth.</span> <span id="s613">Now Furth had a..</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">apparently there was a collection of houses used by German slave laborers and I remember being there as these Jews arrived, doling out a cup of soup and potatoes.</span> <span id="s616">The Jews moved into these houses.</span> <span id="s617">Later on, we found that they were in a very unsanitary, unhealthy conditions, so the whole bunch was moved to a place in Bamberg, camp in Bamberg where the Jews lived.</span> <span id="s618">I mention to you because an interesting thing happened.</span> <span id="s619">In the '50s, Becky Lyon whom I mentioned, Israeli Nurse, was in New York.</span> <span id="s620">I arranged to meet her in a Greenwich Village Hotel.</span> <span id="s621">When I called her, she told me that her sister, who was a well known writer, was going to have dinner with us and she said, "I'm gonna have a friend there."</span> <span id="s622">Well, I came there, called her room, and while I was waiting, a gentleman walked up to ne and he said, "Mr. Levine, do you remember me?"</span> <span id="s623">I looked at the guy, and he looked like a thousand other Polish Jews, and I said, "I really don't."</span> <span id="s624">He said, "My name is Ignatz Eichler, E-I-C-H-L-E-R. ]</span> <span id="s625">He says, "You gave me a cup of soup and a piece of bread in Furth."</span> <span id="s626">Well, he finally came to America, and he opened an electrical appliance store.</span> <span id="s627">Becky had helped him and in gratitude he shipped over a lot of appliances and we were joined by the two sisters.</span> <span id="s628">We went to a wonderful restaurant on 14th Street...no, 12th Street, where there were these singing waiters and the chorus from the Metropolitan Opera was there, and there was wonderful singing and Ignatz insisted to pay the bill.</span> <span id="s629">After that dinner, then we went to...I forget the name of a well known nightclub where Molly Lyons Bar David, Becky's sister, met a well known American writer.</span> <span id="s630">He was crippled and in a wheel chair.</span> <span id="s631">I forget his names.</span> <span id="s632">We were there til 3 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s633">Ignatz insisted on paying.</span> <span id="s634">I was glad that he was able to do it, but... That's the memories of Furth.</span> <span id="s635">Uh...As I said, most of my time was spent traveling with the problems of the Jews and so forth.</span> <span id="s636">I am just giving you some of the highlights of things that happened to me.</span> <span id="s637">Uh...I talked...I talked about the death marches.</span> <span id="s638">I should mention that I have photographs for myself dedicating monuments.</span> <span id="s639">After a while, the Jews, under some law, had the Germans erect monuments.</span> <span id="s640">So I brought a picture.</span> <span id="s641">You will have it.</span> <span id="s642">How they placed...that's right.</span> <span id="s643">I have pictures of a place in Ergoldsbach, a little town where the Jews put up a series of monuments and this was the dedication service.</span> <span id="s644">I was one of the speakers.</span> <span id="s645">Another one was a professor from Austria, Jew who had been in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s646">This was a dedication of 78...where 78 people were killed on the last day before the survivors walked into Ergoldsbach.</span> <span id="s647">And this happened in a number of towns.</span> <span id="s648">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: You mentioned something about...wanting to talk about Nuremberg Trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s651">I will talk about Nuremberg Trial.</span> <span id="s652">I want to say too that the Jews, as I mentioned earlier, came from Poland where they were highly organized.</span> <span id="s653">In Regensburg, they already formed a Central Committee to work with all these towns.</span> <span id="s654">The Central Committee also worked with the large committee in Munich.</span> <span id="s655">See, there was a Committee of Liberated Jews.</span> <span id="s656">In Regensburg, they had the Central Committee of Niederbayern and Oberpfalz.</span> <span id="s657">That was the name of it.</span> <span id="s658">From the district.</span> <span id="s659">It's amazing the set of committees, they had assignments made.</span> <span id="s660">They had a lot of battles too.</span> <span id="s661">There were a lot of fights for power, because if you are committee man you have power to distribute funds and food which the Joint provided.</span> <span id="s662">So that there was a lot of times spent through the local committee, some sad things happened as well as good things happened, working with them.</span> <span id="s663">.</span> <span id="s664">I want to...Let me close with two stories.</span> <span id="s665">Number one, I say I got talk about the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s666">The people should know.</span> <span id="s667">The Joint Distribution Committee was a Jewish American relief agency.</span> <span id="s668">The major food did not come from us.</span> <span id="s669">They came from UNRRA and the Army.</span> <span id="s670">We supplemented.</span> <span id="s671">We supplemented with money to enable...enable the people to buy stuff that they needed.</span> <span id="s672">I think to illustrate the meaning of the Joint people, I want to tell a story how in January of 1946, there was the first Conference of Liberated Jews in Europe, called in Munich.</span> <span id="s673">Ironically, it was held in the Rathaus, the city hall in Munich.</span> <span id="s674">Everything around it was kaputt.</span> <span id="s675">Delegates from United States, French, American zones lived in straw mattress camps came to this conference, and the great of the world came.</span> <span id="s676">I remember.</span> <span id="s677">On Sunday morning, I was way up on the top of the rafter.</span> <span id="s678">I wanted...I didn't want to take a seat from these people.</span> <span id="s679">A little man appeared on the platform I wasn't an ardent Zionist; I was interested.</span> <span id="s680">I didn't know the man.</span> <span id="s681">And speaking in Yiddish at one point, he turned to them, he waved his fist, and his white hair flew around and he said in Yiddish, "You cannot remain, nor will you remain in this hated Germany.</span> <span id="s682">You cannot return to blood covered Poland where the millions have died.</span> <span id="s683">Or Rumania."</span> <span id="s684">And he waved his fist and he said in Yiddish, "There's one little tiny piece of land in this world where," in Yiddish he said, "your brothers and sisters are willing to share their homes, their food."</span> <span id="s685">And he waved his arm again, "If we have to fight and die to bring you to Eretz, we'll do it."</span> <span id="s686">This hall was electrified.</span> <span id="s687">Electrified!</span> <span id="s688">And as I drove...we drove back to Regensburg in that cold and in an open Jeep, Moshe drove me back, I tried to analyze what happened there and I decided that the most important thing that happened was that Ben Gurion let them know they're not alone.</span> <span id="s689">And I'm using this story to point out that that was the role of the Joint.</span> <span id="s690">We Were there.</span> <span id="s691">There was somebody represented American Jewry to help, and that was exciting.</span> <span id="s692">Just one or two other things, two stories and I'll quit.</span> <span id="s693">My experience in Nuremberg at the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s694">Streicherthe worst...one of the worst of the Nazi had a magnificent mansion outside of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s695">It was taken over and made into a Kibbutz.</span> <span id="s696">And I should say that before long young Jews began to marry, as if they're going to let the world know we're going to make more Jews.</span> <span id="s697">Interesting, there was a number of marriages going on.</span> <span id="s698">And there was a wedding in Streicher's home, in the kibbutz and me being the Director of the Joint...they had no father, so I was...you know like the...whatever it was...the guy...the substitute father.</span> <span id="s699">So I attended that wedding.</span> <span id="s700">The next morning we drove to Nuremberg and two things happened.</span> <span id="s701">We came to an area where we saw blocks and blocks with piles of cut marble.</span> <span id="s702">We suddenly came to a..</span> <span id="s703">.</span> <span id="s704">what looked like an entrance to a huge field.</span> <span id="s705">We drove into this field that we drove around, just two Jews in a little Jeep.</span> <span id="s706">I learned later that all that marble was cut for Hitler's monument he was going to erect to last a thousand years.</span> <span id="s707">And later that I learned that we were on that field that you've seen on television where Hitler addressed a quarter of a million Germans, in that field.</span> <span id="s708">That was one thing that happened that morning.</span> <span id="s709">Then we passed, what I discovered, was the Court of Justice where the Nuremberg Trial was going on.</span> <span id="s710">So I said "Moshe, stop."</span> <span id="s711">I was in uniform.</span> <span id="s712">I had a revolver which I carried all through my time, walked in and I talked to a Colonel at the desk and I asked whether I'd be admitted into the trial and he said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s713">Of course, you could."</span> <span id="s714">So I went out and gave my gun to Moshe.</span> <span id="s715">Took a seat in the front.</span> <span id="s716">Oh yes, took a seat in the front row.</span> <span id="s717">On my left, incidentally, when I went in I bought a chart how they sat, was where the prisoners sat on benches.</span> <span id="s718">When I got there, they were still standing around with briefcases, papers, I think it was the board of directors of the Chase National Bank.</span> <span id="s719">In walked Hermann Göring and Hess.</span> <span id="s720">I saw a little Beispiel: one or two guys turned their back to Hess, to Göring.</span> <span id="s721">Others clicked their heels, bowed and shook hands with Göring.</span> <span id="s722">Five minutes later, court was called to order, so these men took their seats.</span> <span id="s723">Hermann Goring who sat in the front row facing me, took a huge blanket and wrapped it around his big fanny, sat down and dropped his head and throughout the Trial looked like he feel asleep.</span> <span id="s724">Sitting next to him was Hess, and he had a lot of papers and he kept on writing.</span> <span id="s725">Nobody was paying any attention to the Jews.</span> <span id="s726">I remember Schachtstaring at something at the ceiling all though this thing.</span> <span id="s727">You know, the top, except Bormann and Hitler and the little guy, whatever his name was.</span> <span id="s728">.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Göbbels.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Göbbels.</span> <span id="s731">All the others were there.</span> <span id="s732">That morning a Jew was on the stand and the case was being handled --they were taking turns-- the French were prosecuting.</span> <span id="s733">This was on November 26th or 27th...I have a transcript of the evidence of 1945...a Jew was on the stand 5 Julius Streicher, publisher of the antisemitic Nazi Party newspaper Der Stürmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">6 German: example.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">7 Hjalmar Schacht, the Reich Minister of Economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">and he testified about the killings in Vilna.</span> <span id="s737">He described how the Germans filled up a park with Jews and how the Germans practiced dive bombing, killing the Jews.</span> <span id="s738">He described how they filled up a synagogue, set it on fire, and they had machine gunners surrounding the synagogue and as the Jews fled, they killed them.</span> <span id="s739">By that time, I'm sitting there.</span> <span id="s740">My blood must have been frozen to the spot, and as this Jew was describing all these murders and he threw out a figure of 68,000 Jews were killed...I later met a man who said 120,000 were killed...Göring was sleeping; Hess was writing, and they really --I hate to use the vulgar expression-- seemed bored.</span> <span id="s741">I must admit I'm not a murdering man, but I had my revolver I wouldn't be alive here now.</span> <span id="s742">I would have taken shots at these guys.</span> <span id="s743">That was my experience in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s744">Now, let me conclude...there's a lot to talk about...</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: You still have a little time.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s747">I don't know whether I told the story how I came to the city of Weiden, W-E-I-D-E-N, and at the community center.</span> <span id="s748">I mean I was in the community center.</span> <span id="s749">There were a lot of people I know, and suddenly two young women dashed at...at Moshe, grabbed him and kissed him and hugged him.</span> <span id="s750">We ended up having lunch with these two young women.</span> <span id="s751">And I got this story.</span> <span id="s752">Moshe mentioned that he worked in a munitions plant, slave labor camp, and I got the following story.</span> <span id="s753">They worked in...these two girls were in the same camp with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">They were separated, but in this camp apparently, the commander was a drunk and one must have started a fire and his quarters were destroyed...part of it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s755">The next morning during the Appell...and Appell means the counting, they had the whole camp lined up.</span> <span id="s756">The commander walked down the line and picked out a hundred young men.</span> <span id="s757">He had machine gunners lined up, and they killed most of them in the presence of everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">When Moshe's good luck, the head or foreman of one of the shops, suddenly appeared and began screaming, "Don't kill him.</span> <span id="s759">I need him."</span> <span id="s760">Moshe and a group of kids, young men, just kids working in the shops.</span> <span id="s761">Moshe was number 98 or number 99 of 100.</span> <span id="s762">And these girls witnessed this.</span> <span id="s763">You can imagine what kind of reunion they had.</span> <span id="s764">They told me how they survived.</span> <span id="s765">One of them...yes, they told me how they were both...they're blond and didn't look...they looked Polish and they were in the slave camp with Polish girls and these women...I think they told me was they had to get something in Yiddish out of their system, so they sang operatic music with Yiddish words, so the Germans didn't know it, but at any rate, that was the meeting; one little thing in Weiden.</span> <span id="s766">I talked about a Nuremberg Trial.</span> <span id="s767">At any rate before I left, I was told that they were going to have what is called a banquet to say farewell to Joe Levine.</span> <span id="s768">I forget where it was, but when I came to this place where delegates from every community came to say farewell to Joe Levine.</span> <span id="s769">It was like my living wake.</span> <span id="s770">I sat through hours listening to the Rabbi, to every President of every community had to get in the act.</span> <span id="s771">You can't ignore them, president of the committee.</span> <span id="s772">The chairman of the cultural committees started to get in the act.</span> <span id="s773">At any rate, we had lunch.</span> <span id="s774">We continued and the total length of the affairs, Chaim Diamond whom I mentioned...he was the president of the Central Committee at that time, bent down an picked up a piece of paper, cardboard.</span> <span id="s775">I brought it.</span> <span id="s776">You have it.</span> <span id="s777">And he turned to me and said, "Levine, you...now you know about...appreciate...how we feel about you.</span> <span id="s778">We want to give you something as a token of...to remember us.</span> <span id="s779">And he gave me this diploma.</span> <span id="s780">They went to German and in a broken English expressed their appreciation and made me what I think the only non-Holocaust survivor a honorary member of the Central Committee of Niedrbayern and Oberpfalz, typical German with four signatures and stamps.</span> <span id="s781">One name was Chaim Diamond; the other was Silverberg, the editor of the Moment; the other name was Steven Schwartz from Straubing.</span> <span id="s782">These were officials from the Central Committee, and a man named Schachler.</span> <span id="s783">Years later...I don't know if I described how I met Chaim.</span> <span id="s784">Did I?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Well, in 56 I learned that Chaim Diamond was in New York.</span> <span id="s787">I was at a meeting on 38th street and Rabbi Lipman gave me a note: "had lunch yesterday with Chaim."</span> <span id="s788">I said "Where?"</span> <span id="s789">He said, "545 Fifth Avenue."</span> <span id="s790">Two minutes later, there's Levine running up Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s791">I had a wonderful reunion with Chaim.</span> <span id="s792">At that time he was married and his, brother was with him, he had a successful watch business.</span> <span id="s793">Chaim and I have been friends ever since.</span> <span id="s794">Now what was I talking about before?</span> <span id="s795">I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You were talking about the certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s798">So Chaim opened his vault during our meeting and he showed me copies of all the letters I wrote and he was arrested by an American town major because he objected to the anti-semitic signs.</span> <span id="s799">I had to go to General McNarney's office to get him out of jail.</span> <span id="s800">At any rate, we were talking about papers and he came...we talked about the diploma.</span> <span id="s801">So he said, "Joe, I want you to know that before the meeting I met with the Committee and we discussed what can we give Levine as a token of appreciation?"</span> <span id="s802">So one man suggested, "Let's give him a diamond ring."</span> <span id="s803">Now some of the Jews...I didn't say it, but were on the black market and doing very well.</span> <span id="s804">A lot of these Jews were in the black market business in Poland before the war, so it's nothing new.</span> <span id="s805">Another one said, "Let's give him a Leica with all the lenses."</span> <span id="s806">Another said, "Let's give him money."</span> <span id="s807">Finally, somebody said, "Let's give him something that no money can buy that he can hand down to his children."</span> <span id="s808">And how right he was.</span> <span id="s809">So that diploma which you have here...I gave you a copy of it, is what they gave me, which I treasure as a memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay, we have about 5 more minutes if you think of anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Well, while I'm here I want to talk about the fact that I'm delighted that the United States Memorial the United States Holocaust Memorial is being built.</span> <span id="s812">The world shouldn't forget.</span> <span id="s813">I'm deeply appreciative of the fact that I was asked to make what little contribution I cam make on this program.</span> <span id="s814">I hope to turn over...I turned over some materials...some more materials for the Museum.</span> <span id="s815">Uh...The world has to remember.</span> <span id="s816">The world shall not forget.</span> <span id="s817">And I certainly feel that the Museum will render an important...make an important contribution to the world in the coming years.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Thank you, Joseph Levine.</span> <span id="s819">It has been very, very interesting listening to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
