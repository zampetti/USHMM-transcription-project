my father being a French Jew from Lorraine in eastern France.</span> <span id="s21">And uh they went to Marseille at the fall of France--it's [in the] south of France--and from there to Le Chambon in the fall of 1943.</span> <span id="s22">My mother being pregnant at the time with me, and uh that is where I had the good fortune to be born.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Uh what were the circumstances, do you know, of their getting to Le Chambon?</span> <span id="s24">How did they reach it?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Uh in their case they uh heard about Le Chambon from a friend, who suggested it to my father.</span> <span id="s26">My father had a particularly uh hard task, because not only did he have to find a place where they would be safe--my mother being particularly vulnerable as a foreign Jew.</span> <span id="s27">And, of course, the French were focusing uh much of their collaborative efforts in terms of turning over Jews on the foreign Jews.</span> <span id="s28">So my mother was particularly vulnerable.</span> <span id="s29">Uh, but in addition she had a problem pregnancy; and apparently the only chance she had of bringing the baby safely into the world was if she had as much peace and quiet and food as possible, which is a bit of a tall order for Nazi-occupied Europe.</span> <span id="s30">Uh, and this friend uh suggested Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s31">He...he knew the place; and my father went there and found a room to rent, and uh went back to uh get my mother.</span> <span id="s32">And they came on a little steam engine train that uh brought many Jews there, as we know.</span> <span id="s33">And uh...uh it was uh singularly fortunate, because I'll uh...I'll also mention that uh the doctor who took care of my mother in Le Chambon was exactly for me the right doctor in the right place.</span> <span id="s34">Not only did he happen to be a whiz of a doctor who had trained under Albert Schweitzer in Africa, dealing with all sorts of problems and apparently had a reputation as a bit of a medical genius, but in addition he was a a committed Christian--one of the first uh of the area to be committed to non-violent resis...resistance against the Nazis--and had a special stake in my mother's situation and this baby that she wanted to bring into the world.</span> <span id="s35">I don't think that uh she would have gotten better medical attention if I had been born in the most modern American facility today.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: So you were, or your mother was, brought to this town in the apartment.</span> <span id="s37">Where...where...the room that your parents rented, uh from whom did they rent it?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: They rented it from a peasant couple in a uh little hamlet which is a part of Le Chambon called La Fayolle (ph).</span> <span id="s39">Uh, I was known as the baby that used to wake up the neighborhood early in the morning.</span> <span id="s40">Uh, they uh...uh, well as I mentioned in my film, "Weapons of the Spirit," I..</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">I..</span> <span id="s43">.</span> <span id="s44">my parents didn't remain in touch, actually, with the farmers who rented that room.</span> <span id="s45">But I tracked them down.</span> <span id="s46">And the widow of the farmer who did rent the room is in my film.</span> <span id="s47">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s49">Where...where did your parents go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: They went to uh Saint-Étienne for a year--which is not far from Le Chambon--where my father was a journalist.</span> <span id="s51">My father was already a journalist.</span> <span id="s52">He had been a journalist before the war.</span> <span id="s53">And then to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Let's stay a minute [in] Saint-Étienne for that year.</span> <span id="s55">Uh, they were in Le Chambon, in the area of Le Chambon, for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: They were there from the fall of 1943 'til the end of the war.</span> <span id="s57">I don't know exactly when they leave, come to think of it... when they left, come to think of it.</span> <span id="s58">But it...I think it was around uh August of '44.</span> <span id="s59">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You talk, obviously, a lot about this in your film.</span> <span id="s61">Uh, but for the purposes of this interview, would you tell me more about the people with whom your parents came in contact, as they told it to you?</span> <span id="s62">You were, of course, an infant.</span> <span id="s63">And did they know your parents were Jewish, and what that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: (Pause) I've got to go about it... It's complicated, because there...there are presuppositions in the question that I have to actually address.</span> <span id="s65">That's the uh... I was not raised with stories about Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s66">Uh, I was uh not raised with stories about the war, with stories about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s67">I was raised by parents who wanted to put all that behind them.</span> <span id="s68">So, much of what I've come to know about Le Chambon--although I've since spoken quite a bit about my parents, and I've gotten certainly information that is relevant.</span> <span id="s69">Uh, but it's not uh...a lot of my information is really information that I got as an adult, uh talking to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s71">Then we'll do this, as it were, at the end of the interview rather than at the beginning.</span> <span id="s72">And let's talk about uh... And we'll talk about Le Chambon, as such, at the end.</span> <span id="s73">Uh tell me where your parents went.</span> <span id="s74">They went to Paris, you said.</span> <span id="s75">Uh, what did they do there and for how long were they there?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Well, they were there 'til uh after the war.</span> <span id="s77">They were 'til 1948, when they came to New York.</span> <span id="s78">Uh, my father, among other things, edited a uh intellectual weekly called "[La Rue (ph)]," which was uh quite prominent, had very prestigious uh writers--uh, including uh Sartre, Camus, and Raymond [Quenot (ph)]--and people like that contributed articles to it.</span> <span id="s79">But uh it was a very difficult time to launch a..</span> <span id="s80">.</span> <span id="s81">a publication and there were all sorts of restrictions, including paper restrictions.</span> <span id="s82">And uh ultimately it had to fold after about ten or twelve issues.</span> <span id="s83">And uh my father uh had to find work; and ultimately he decided to go to America, and went to New York where he shortly thereafter became the correspondent of Le Figaro--a French daily--which he was for twenty-five years.</span> <span id="s84">Uh, [he was] also writing a number of books and also uh contributing to a number of other publications.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Going back to Paris, uh by the time you left Paris or were about to leave Paris, you would be four years--or close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Do you remember anything about Paris as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Oh, I think I have a few uh memories that must go back to that time.</span> <span id="s89">But I'm really stunned by how much difficulty I have remembering much of my childhood; and I think that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised with memory being uh bad.</span> <span id="s90">Uh, I was discouraged from...from remembering.</span> <span id="s91">I was discouraged from asking questions.</span> <span id="s92">And I think that's tampered with my ability to remember.</span> <span id="s93">And maybe that's what's given me a..</span> <span id="s94">.</span> <span id="s95">a compelling need to...to document precisely, because I don't trust memory.</span> <span id="s96">Or maybe even to tell stories such as I do.</span> <span id="s97">Uh, so I remember uh startling little.</span> <span id="s98">In fact, the most startling thing I..</span> <span id="s99">.</span> <span id="s100">I've thought about sometimes is that uh--particularly I have a two and a half year old daughter now--and...and is that I realize I was four when I came to America, and I cannot until then... Obviously, I did not speak English.</span> <span id="s101">And I cannot remember ever...I cannot remember the experience of having been in a foreign land and not speaking the language.</span> <span id="s102">I have absolutely no recollection of it.</span> <span id="s103">And that, to me--and...and I can't imagine that that wasn't a traumatic experience, and I cannot connect with it.</span> <span id="s104">I cannot remember it.</span> <span id="s105">And I realize that four is already not, you know, it's not a baby anymore.</span> <span id="s106">So uh I..</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">I do view myself as a..</span> <span id="s109">.</span> <span id="s110">as a product of a uh...of a traumatized childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Well, let's talk about that, and talk more about that.</span> <span id="s112">Uh, when you came to New York, uh what do you remember about those yearly, early years and in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Opposed to what you were told?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">01:10:45</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Very little?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Very little, very little.</span> <span id="s119">Uh, as I get older I remember more, of course.</span> <span id="s120">But uh I..</span> <span id="s121">.</span> <span id="s122">uh I think that the fact that uh my parents withheld from me vital information as to my identity-- as to who they were, as to why we were there, as to uh why they were who they were--uh really uh confused all my...all normal relationships with the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Who did you believe your parents were?</span> <span id="s124">How did... They were in New York.</span> <span id="s125">You were with them.</span> <span id="s126">You had no memory of before.</span> <span id="s127">Did you believe you were Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No.</span> <span id="s129">I knew that uh... No.</span> <span id="s130">In fact, I was raised very French.</span> <span id="s131">Uh, the uh...I..</span> <span id="s132">.</span> <span id="s133">I now believe that part of the reason I was raised so French was that it was a way of obliterating the Jewish.</span> <span id="s134">Uh, I went to a French school.</span> <span id="s135">We spoke French at home; although I shouldn't overstate that, because there was also my...my mother.</span> <span id="s136">Even though she was originally from Poland had a great love of France.</span> <span id="s137">By the way, she spoke French uh impeccably; and that had something to do with her survival during the war, too.</span> <span id="s138">She was able successfully to impersonate a Frenchwoman.</span> <span id="s139">I have uh come from a family with great linguistic skills.</span> <span id="s140">Uh, my sister later became an actress in Mexico, uh playing Mexicans on the screen, you know.</span> <span id="s141">And as anyone who knows about acting knows, there's nothing more difficult than that.</span> <span id="s142">So it's...it's like, it's funny how you see these things follow through.</span> <span id="s143">Uh no, but we...I didn't...I knew we weren't Americans.</span> <span id="s144">I knew that we were...we were uh... In fact, interestingly, uh although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I was Jewish, we...I always knew we were different.</span> <span id="s145">We were foreign.</span> <span id="s146">It's almost a way in which my parents prepared me to...to then absorb the truth.</span> <span id="s147">If they had been people who completely assimilated, I certainly would have been a different person.</span> <span id="s148">They never did.</span> <span id="s149">Uh, just by remaining French, by remaining different, by not even being immigrants...my parents, I..</span> <span id="s150">.</span> <span id="s151">they never really identified them[selves] as immigrants.</span> <span id="s152">I always had the feeling in the back of my mind that one day we would go back to France.</span> <span id="s153">My father was a correspondent.</span> <span id="s154">You know, that this was not necessarily, you know, the...the final move.</span> <span id="s155">I never viewed them as like part of the, you know, immigrant flow into America.</span> <span id="s156">Uh, very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What about religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Uh, no religion.</span> <span id="s159">Uh I remember we...uh I was what might be called a "nothing."</span> <span id="s160">In other words, when I'd ask my parents, "What...what are we?</span> <span id="s161">," they'd say, "We're nothing."</span> <span id="s162">And then they would move on; try to, you know, dismiss...dismiss the question.</span> <span id="s163">Uh, not long ago my sister mentioned, by the way, that she was not the only "nothing" in her class.</span> <span id="s164">Uh, you know, there...there are people who...who find themselves in... in that situation.</span> <span id="s165">Uh, but no.</span> <span id="s166">We were not...we were not Christians.</span> <span id="s167">I never assumed that, although it was confusing.</span> <span id="s168">I guess I assumed that uh... (Pause) I guess I must have assumed that we were uh, you know, originally Christian; but my father was violently anti-religious, as was my mother, in fact.</span> <span id="s169">And uh that meant nothing.</span> <span id="s170">I mean, there was nothing Christian about us.</span> <span id="s171">Uh we were nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How did it feel to be a nothing, to be of no religion and no place ?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, at the time uh I thought that was fine; or I..</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">I thought ...I thought that was fine.</span> <span id="s176">Uh, I've come to feel very differently about that.</span> <span id="s177">But that's uh...I uh, you know, people often uh ask me--since I've mentioned the fact that I only learned I was Jewish when I was eighteen--uh, "How did it...?"</span> <span id="s178">And what happened is that my parents sat me down and told me.</span> <span id="s179">I was about to go off to Paris to study, and uh was going to be staying with a cousin of mine, uh who happens to be a survivor of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s180">To compound the irony, a rather prominent gentlemen at that, Samuel [Pisar (ph)].</span> <span id="s181">And uh people will sometimes say, "Well, was it a real shock?"</span> <span id="s182">You know, "How did you react?"</span> <span id="s183">And I..</span> <span id="s184">.</span> <span id="s185">they're surprised that it --I don't even remember exactly how I reacted.</span> <span id="s186">And basically the information never really got through to me, but the facts got through to me.</span> <span id="s187">But when you are raised with taboos, the taboos are so internalized that you don't fully absorb the information even when it is given to you.</span> <span id="s188">You...your...your filtering mechanisms keep working.</span> <span id="s189">Not only was I in the course of...of maintaining this...this lie about who we were, part of what that entailed is that I was completely cut off from almost all of my family.</span> <span id="s190">Uh, it was a great...except for a few members who joined in this conspiracy of not, of keeping the secret from the children.</span> <span id="s191">Uh, but uh it's still stunning to me to realize that my mother had aunts and uncles in...in New York whom I never knew, because they couldn't be counted on to maintain the secret of our being Jewish.</span> <span id="s192">And now as I reconnect with those family members, I still...there's a part of me that finds it very difficult to absorb their identities and their names.</span> <span id="s193">It's like I..</span> <span id="s194">.</span> <span id="s195">I'm...I still feel this is information I'm not supposed to have, and I have to fight to to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: When did you start... Let's keep going with this.</span> <span id="s197">When... when you went uh to your...your relative uh Samuel [Pisar (ph)], what was that like?</span> <span id="s198">Did the information become a little more internalized for you?</span> <span id="s199">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No, it really didn't.</span> <span id="s201">It really didn't.</span> <span id="s202">It took a long time.</span> <span id="s203">And uh I was in Paris ten years, and I had no interest in...in any of this.</span> <span id="s204">Uh...uh Sam at the time was uh uh...(pause) like many survivors, uh concerned with building his life; and he's an ambitious man.</span> <span id="s205">And focusing on...on that, uh although he would he would tell me stories.</span> <span id="s206">I think the...the main effect of that was he...he...he... Although he doesn't really remember it, uh he...he did tell me stories about the camps and about his experiences.</span> <span id="s207">And uh they had a profound effect on me.</span> <span id="s208">Uh but I still didn't really...I couldn't even...I'm not sure I could define what it was.</span> <span id="s209">I..</span> <span id="s210">.</span> <span id="s211">I still... No, I didn't uh...uh I had no Jewish identity when I was in Paris.</span> <span id="s212">None.</span> <span id="s213">Uh, and no Jewish involvements.</span> <span id="s214">And uh...uh I..</span> <span id="s215">.</span> <span id="s216">that really only started... The key influence in my life, in that respect, was my wife--whom I married uh not long after I moved to Los Angeles in 1971--who's a uh Los Angeles native, uh uh very Jewish if one can speak in those terms, and very comfortable being Jewish.</span> <span id="s217">And uh who worked on me for years and years and years.</span> <span id="s218">And uh...and then the most decisive influence of all was ultimately having children and realizing that I wanted them to have a very secure and comfortable sense of identity.</span> <span id="s219">And uh we uh...my wife wanted to send our son to a Reform day school, which is where he goes now and where he thrives.</span> <span id="s220">And uh that has had an influence on me as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: As you began to discover your own identity and who you were, did you discuss this with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">01:20:00</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes, we...we had uh a number of discussions uh over the years.</span> <span id="s224">Uh, this was a very difficult subject for my father.</span> <span id="s225">My father died in uh October of 1988, not long before my film on Le Chambon--"Weapons of the Spirit"--was released.</span> <span id="s226">Although he did see it uh before he died, and the whole process that I was involved in was a very difficult one for him and a very scary one for him.</span> <span id="s227">Uh, after all, he had built his whole public persona on not being Jewish.</span> <span id="s228">And uh...and as a journalist this was, you know, sort of a compounded irony.</span> <span id="s229">Not only was he a journalist, he was a good journalist; and he was also a crusader for truth and had been all his life.</span> <span id="s230">Uh, with this one big lie in his life.</span> <span id="s231">And here he had bred, as these things sometimes happen; this increasingly public Jew - not only a Jew, but somebody who was even insistent on being quite public about it.</span> <span id="s232">And uh I'll never forget one day uh in the early '80's, uh and I had this French film director who was visiting in L[os] A[ngeles] and we had dinner or whatever.</span> <span id="s233">And I talked about myself, and just coincidentally he went to New York shortly thereafter and he met my father.</span> <span id="s234">And uh in a phone conversation the following Sunday, my father said, "Why did you say that I..</span> <span id="s235">."</span> <span id="s236">--that my father--"was Jewish?"</span> <span id="s237">I thought, "What...what was he talking about?"</span> <span id="s238">And I said, "I..</span> <span id="s239">.</span> <span id="s240">I didn't talk about...I don't even remember talking about you."</span> <span id="s241">And then he said, "Well, I met this director.</span> <span id="s242">And he mentioned..." And then I realized I had talked about myself; but talking about myself exposed my father.</span> <span id="s243">And I'll never forget that conversation.</span> <span id="s244">This was my...my dilemma, and it was in fact my dilemma in making the film - to preserve their privacy, their right to have some control over how they led their lives, which I basically believe was my obligation.</span> <span id="s245">At the same time, not to allow that to cripple my own ability to lead my own life and uh pass a healthy heritage on to my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: It was quite a balancing act.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s248">It was it was a very difficult balancing act.</span> <span id="s249">Now the film itself was very much uh... Interestingly, the film was very much negotiated with my parents.</span> <span id="s250">They asked me to take out certain things.</span> <span id="s251">Which I did; including things that I thought it was wrong to take out.</span> <span id="s252">Uh, I'll mention one.</span> <span id="s253">Uh (pause) I'll start again on that one.</span> <span id="s254">Uh the film was...the film was ...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Let's hold it one second, if we could... (Technical Conversation) OK.</span> <span id="s256">Fine.</span> <span id="s257">Let's pick up with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: The film was uh negotiated with my parents.</span> <span id="s259">They uh, for instance, asked me to take out certain things.</span> <span id="s260">My mother...in particular, my mother asked me to take out very specific things.</span> <span id="s261">And I remember she asked me to take out three things.</span> <span id="s262">And I thought about it; and I ended up...ended up taking out all three.</span> <span id="s263">And they hurt.</span> <span id="s264">And they hurt on various levels.</span> <span id="s265">I'll mention one, because it was interesting the sort of dilemma I was facing.</span> <span id="s266">Uh in the film, I initially...I..</span> <span id="s267">.</span> <span id="s268">I referred to my mother losing much of her family, and I show a photograph of my mother surrounded by her family.</span> <span id="s269">And originally I had named all the dead relatives.</span> <span id="s270">And my mother asked me to take out the names.</span> <span id="s271">And I really thought that was, I mean, the greatest honor I could do to these people was to name them, to give them that identity--my grandmother, Feige Sucholosky.</span> <span id="s272">But I just decided, in that instance, that uh my respect for my mother would take precedence.</span> <span id="s273">And I did.</span> <span id="s274">I took out the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Since this is not a commercial film but will be a scholarly film, would you like to tell us the names of your mother's relatives who died, to preserve their memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, the...the...the...the...the key ones that uh that I allude to are my grandmother, Feige Sucholosky, my uh... (Pause) You know, it's...it's amazing.</span> <span id="s277">I really don't normally freeze in any sort of interview situation, and I've done it a number of them.</span> <span id="s278">And I realize it's absolutely no coincidence that even though I have gone over those names so often, that there's a part of me that like shuts off because I'm...I'm not supposed to...to do it in some way.</span> <span id="s279">Uh but yes, my...my uncle, Memel (ph) Sucholosky; my mother's sister... How can I, how can I not, how can I freeze on her...on her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: It's OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: It's OK.</span> <span id="s283">You have been trained since childhood not to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">Amazing how effective uh those things are.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Let's go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: We can come back to this later.</span> <span id="s289">Uh, can you tell me... You've talked a good bit about the relations with your family.</span> <span id="s290">I have one more question about your parents, and then we'll leave that phase.</span> <span id="s291">Have you managed through all this to remain close to your parents, or has it separated you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: There were tense moments with my father, as I was developing into a person different from what he had anticipated.</span> <span id="s293">Uh my father ended up liking the film quite a bit, which is really in a..</span> <span id="s294">.</span> <span id="s295">in a way the strongest endorsement of the film I ever had.</span> <span id="s296">Because with his mind-set, uh for him to say that the film was, you know, basically correct, I thought, "My God, it really must be pretty...pretty correct."</span> <span id="s297">Uh, he used to argue, though, that uh the film--and he's the only person who's ever said this to me, which is sort of funny.</span> <span id="s298">But he always argued that the film would have been better if I had left myself completely out of it.</span> <span id="s299">Uh, but uh hard to say.</span> <span id="s300">We ...we never broke relations ever.</span> <span id="s301">We would have regular Sunday conversations.</span> <span id="s302">Uh, I don't... Let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s303">I hope that I will have a closer relationship with my own children than I had with my parents.</span> <span id="s304">I think that uh people are punished for their sins.</span> <span id="s305">I think the way they raised me was wrong.</span> <span id="s306">And I think it impaired our ability to bond.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s308">I think that should sit a bit.</span> <span id="s309">And go back to a young man growing up in New York.</span> <span id="s310">Uh, along the way--uh, again, for the record--I'd like to know a little bit more about the kind of schooling you had in New York, and what you did as a young man.</span> <span id="s311">What was your family life like?</span> <span id="s312">Let's start with school and friends.</span> <span id="s313">It's easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: I'll tell you, the most striking thing about...about my childhood friends is that I realized a few years ago that of my closest friends when I was a young child, uh a high percentage uh were if not children of Holocaust survivors-- although there were...there were...there were some... In fact, my closest friend for a number of years was.</span> <span id="s315">Uh, at least uh related [to the Holocaust] in the sense that some of them, their parents had come like in the '30's.</span> <span id="s316">And often those people don't identify as survivors, because they came earlier, even though they still lost a lot of their relatives.</span> <span id="s317">And often the effects are not efficiently...uh, sufficiently acknowledged as still being Holocaust-related effects.</span> <span id="s318">Certainly, in terms of the children.</span> <span id="s319">Children almost never identify as children of Holocaust survivors, if their parents came in the mid-'30's.</span> <span id="s320">Although often they have a lot more in common with children of survivors than they realize.</span> <span id="s321">And this ...this is all the more striking since I didn't...not only did I not know I was the parents...the child...the child of Holocaust survivors, I didn't even know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s322">So it's funny that it was with these people that the relationships uh developed.</span> <span id="s323">But I..</span> <span id="s324">.</span> <span id="s325">I think that's just a measure of the inescapable commonalities that...that were there even though the labels, you know, weren't there.</span> <span id="s326">It wasn't relationships based on labels.</span> <span id="s327">It was relationships based on, uh I guess, similar attitudes or similar things in common.</span> <span id="s328">Uh, I identify very strongly with uh second generation children of survivors.</span> <span id="s329">I have been intermittently active in such groups.</span> <span id="s330">Uh I think uh I have learned a lot from uh other children of survivors, even though my parents' case was different in many respects.</span> <span id="s331">And, of course, I use "survivor"--"Holocaust survivor"--in the broadest sense, which encompasses people who weren't in... My parents were never in camps.</span> <span id="s332">But they were in hiding, they were in fear, they lost family.</span> <span id="s333">And I find that they...the result of those...those times have uh set in motion a certain number of things that uh we children of survivors have in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Such as...?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">01:32:00</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Uh, well, some strengths, some weaknesses.</span> <span id="s337">And uh I think uh what I am most insistent on--in fact, I've been quite incendiary about it at times--is that uh we need to find our own way towards those memories, our own paths, uh fully respectful of the experience of our parents.</span> <span id="s338">Uh, needing to learn from it, needing to hear them, needing to hear that testimony as much as everybo...everybody needs to hear that testimony; but at the same time, not to be...feel dwarfed by it, to acknowledge our own childhood hurts, to realize that in some respects uh we have been victims of the Holocaust in our own right, victims of the effect of the Holocaust through our parents, and uh sometimes our parents have not been able to acknowledge.</span> <span id="s339">This was too painful to them, that such hurts occurred; and that often they--unwillingly, unwittingly, simply because they went through the experience that they went through--were the cause of some of this...this pain.</span> <span id="s340">Children of survivors need to acknowledge that pain, need to acknowledge that need to...to form their own identities.</span> <span id="s341">Uh and that does involve, if they're interested in psychology, I I believe nothing is more important than to be able to get in touch with your...your childhood pains and acknowledge its existence and identify it.</span> <span id="s342">And that is the only way it will not be passed on to your own children.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: In doing that, in attempting to reach yourself, as it were, you have, among other things, chosen to become a Jew.</span> <span id="s344">How did you actually... You talked about your wife.</span> <span id="s345">But how...how does...how did that process develop, and how has that interact[ed] with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The question of my Jewish identity is such an...my Jewish identity is such an evolving one that it really changes; not only from year to year, but probably from month to month.</span> <span id="s347">And I have no idea what exactly that identity will be uh five years from now.</span> <span id="s348">Whether it will be a very pronounced one, or whether I will decide enough of this and this really doesn't matter to me that much.</span> <span id="s349">I..</span> <span id="s350">.</span> <span id="s351">I really don't...I really don't know.</span> <span id="s352">I know that uh I felt a need to have an identity, that the only identity that it made sense for me to have was the identity of my ancestors.</span> <span id="s353">Uh, and that I have indeed become increasingly comfortable with it, that I realize that a lot of who I am is indeed uh wrapped up in...in Judaism and uh its influences on my family.</span> <span id="s354">You know, the influence...the influences exist whether they're identified or not.</span> <span id="s355">The fact that my parents uh never acknowledged being Jewish doesn't mean they weren't, in very fundamental ways, very Jewish.</span> <span id="s356">Uh, and uh and that influence was probably there.</span> <span id="s357">Uh, but uh... (Pause) You know, it's interesting how these things work.</span> <span id="s358">I think the people of Le Chambon made me more Jewish.</span> <span id="s359">They... First of all, I came to believe that at bottom, when you've cut through all the specifics of why they did what they did or all the conjecture--one can do all the factors that come into this--uh at bottom everything flowed from their own inescapable sense of their own identity.</span> <span id="s360">Their own sense of comfort at being who they were, at having no questions about who they were.</span> <span id="s361">And everything flowed, almost inescapably, incredibly naturally and very spontaneously, from that.</span> <span id="s362">That sense of identity.</span> <span id="s363">And if one derived strength from that, that rootedness, uh well then I had to try to aspire--particularly as a parent, and wanting to be able to raise strong children--had to aspire to a similar rootedness and had to find my roots.</span> <span id="s364">And my roots were in being a Jew, so that was the only way to go.</span> <span id="s365">In addition, when I was making "Weapons of the Spirit," I realized that the way in which the film would be most effective would be if it was a Jewish film in praise of a group of Christians.</span> <span id="s366">It couldn't be a..</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">a neutered film...wouldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s369">And that forced me to ...to absorb and understand as much as I could, to...to really be as Jewish as I could be in the making of that film.</span> <span id="s370">But that it's...it had to mirror, in a way, the...the reunion that took place in Le Chambon between Jews and Christians, that it had to emb...embody it.</span> <span id="s371">As best as I could, as ignorant as I am still about so much of Judaism, it had to be uh Jewish.</span> <span id="s372">And I'm very touched, by the way, when uh orthodox Jews are responsive to the film, as indeed the few who have spoken to me have been.</span> <span id="s373">Uh, that means a lot to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: How do your parents react to your being Jewish, openly and publicly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: My father was very uncomfortable with it.</span> <span id="s376">My mother, particularly since my father passed away, has uh really jettisoned a lot of the past taboos.</span> <span id="s377">In fact, she's probably made changes faster than I've been able to accept her changes.</span> <span id="s378">Uh, that often happens that way.</span> <span id="s379">Uh, I'm almost locked into my image of her; and she probably is far readier to change than than I am ready to accept her changes.</span> <span id="s380">So she really, I I must say, now is...is...seems to be quite comfortable with all of this uh...and uh loves the film.</span> <span id="s381">Has a tape of it which she looks at periodically, and uh very, very supportive and uh uh uh...and uh apparently quite comfortable with all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: You had mentioned... And now let's move more to the film itself.</span> <span id="s383">Uh, you had mentioned that there were three segments that you had left out.</span> <span id="s384">You had described one.</span> <span id="s385">Can you describe the other two?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: It's funny.</span> <span id="s387">Somebody asked me that a while back.</span> <span id="s388">And I..</span> <span id="s389">.</span> <span id="s390">I was afraid when I mentioned that that you were going to ask me that question, because uh I tried to remember what the three were the other day and I couldn't.</span> <span id="s391">I remembered two of them, and I was missing a third.</span> <span id="s392">I..</span> <span id="s393">.</span> <span id="s394">I know I'm going to be able to to... One was the names of the...of my dead relatives.</span> <span id="s395">The other one was the uh place they were from--Bialystok, Poland.</span> <span id="s396">Uh, the original narration said my mother's family in...in Bialystok; and...and...and I took out Bialystok because I was asked to.</span> <span id="s397">And it's the third request that, at this point, I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Uh, let's talk a bit now about the making of...of "Weapons of the Spirit."</span> <span id="s399">What kind...when you started to...to uh do the personal interviews, can you tell me something about the people who...who would have been the most important?</span> <span id="s400">Uh, certainly to your parents, even if they didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s401">Uh, for instance, uh Magda Trocmé, who comes across in the film as this wonderfully determined woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: She's an extraordinary woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Can you describe your relationship with her, and what she is like now, in her old age?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">01:42:00</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: It's funny.</span> <span id="s406">I'm just moved thinking about Magda.</span> <span id="s407">I love her.</span> <span id="s408">I love her.</span> <span id="s409">Uh, she is an extraordinary woman, extraordinary woman.</span> <span id="s410">Uh... (Pause) If I may, I'm...I'm tempted to...to interject real quickly that we really live in a sexist society, uh one form of which is to discount often the...the female influence.</span> <span id="s411">You know, when it comes to rescue in particular, when it comes to rescuers, uh I'm convinced that women played a far more important role than men.</span> <span id="s412">It was often the woman who would be literally at the door if somebody knocked on it.</span> <span id="s413">It was in...often into it in the mother's home, you know.</span> <span id="s414">When the story of Le Chambon is told, you know, one tends to focus--when...when it's talking about leadership--on Pastor Trocmé, who was an extraordinary figure whom I..</span> <span id="s415">.</span> <span id="s416">I..</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">I admire inordinately.</span> <span id="s419">A brilliant, brilliant man.</span> <span id="s420">Uh, but really, that...that combination of Pastor Trocmé and Magda Trocmé was an extraordinary combination.</span> <span id="s421">She is the most direct, uh efficient, uh focused person I have ever known.</span> <span id="s422">Uh, she uh... (Pause) She cuts through to things.</span> <span id="s423">Uh, im...immediately.</span> <span id="s424">She is an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinarily practical person.</span> <span id="s425">Uh, she really... You know, Trocmé--Pastor Trocmé--was a..</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">a thinker.</span> <span id="s428">Uh, some of that thinking ended up producing tremendous results; and he would...he did things.</span> <span id="s429">But uh Magda Trocmé is truly a..</span> <span id="s430">.</span> <span id="s431">a doer.</span> <span id="s432">You know, "What do you need now?</span> <span id="s433">What has to be done now?"</span> <span id="s434">You know, "How are you going to solve that problem?"</span> <span id="s435">It...it... All practical.</span> <span id="s436">And uh I..</span> <span id="s437">.</span> <span id="s438">I..</span> <span id="s439">.</span> <span id="s440">I really sort of absorbed from her the sense in which that is what is most important in any given situation, in any situation of crisis.</span> <span id="s441">Don't make a big deal about it.</span> <span id="s442">Just, you know, figure out, you know, what needs to be done and do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And that came through in the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: She is...she is a..</span> <span id="s445">.</span> <span id="s446">a uh...she is a..</span> <span id="s447">.</span> <span id="s448">a extraordinary woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: In the film, one of the things that you do is to develop an understanding that events took place not only in Le Chambon but in all the surrounding hamlets.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Can you talk about some of the people that you interviewed uh in those hamlets that did some rather special things?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: You know it's a very important point, a very important point.</span> <span id="s453">And I'm particularly interested in addressing it, even for history; because, in a way, I may be culpable of having uh obscured things even in...in the film.</span> <span id="s454">You know, films are not footnoted.</span> <span id="s455">Uh, they...they have to be somewhat linear - the form has certain requirements.</span> <span id="s456">And to be sure, Le Chambon was the centerpiece of what occurred.</span> <span id="s457">It was where Pastor Trocmé and Assistant Pastor [Édouard] Theis and Magda Trocmé were at the heart of what did occur.</span> <span id="s458">Uh, and the railway station was in Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s459">But really what...when it's talking about ...and you talk to Jews who were in the area, they are talking about the area.</span> <span id="s460">They are talking about "Le Plateau".</span> <span id="s461">They are talking about all the surrounding hamlets, and indeed some of the neighboring villages.</span> <span id="s462">Uh, what happened is symbols get created, and Le Chambon is the symbol.</span> <span id="s463">Le Chambon inescapably will be the symbol.</span> <span id="s464">But I hope that soon enough we will be able, having absorbed the symbol--the symbol having become sufficiently familiar to us--we will then be able to realize and acknowledge that it is merely a symbol.</span> <span id="s465">And, in fact, it's a symbol for the area.</span> <span id="s466">And in Le Chambon itself, there is very much that concern.</span> <span id="s467">Le Chambon itself doesn't want it to appear that it is trumpeting itself in any way, particularly Le Chambon versus Le Mazet or versus Fay.</span> <span id="s468">You know, there were pastors in all those areas who were actively involved in what went on.</span> <span id="s469">Uh, and for posterity it is certainly, it is crucially important that that point be made.</span> <span id="s470">In fact, it amazes me the point is made in the film... You know, it...it...it...I thought it was made quite strongly in the film, about that surrounding area was involved.</span> <span id="s471">And it almost amazed me how uh every reviewer ignores that and says Le Chambon, and talks, you know.</span> <span id="s472">And I say five thousand Christians in the area, but it it often becomes the five thousand villagers of Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s473">People have great difficulty focusing on what, to them, are details.</span> <span id="s474">Uh, but certainly for history [it] is important to...to underscore.</span> <span id="s475">Yes, it was...it was the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Do you remember individuals?</span> <span id="s477">Your camera does, but what I would like is, can you talk about one or two individuals in different towns, for this purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, I met people from...from all over the area.</span> <span id="s479">I don't...I don't really think of them in terms of uh... I..</span> <span id="s480">.</span> <span id="s481">I mainly...I found no differences, you know.</span> <span id="s482">The people in...in Le Mazet, uh which is the sister village to...to Le Chambon... Uh, which by the way, Le Mazet was even more densely Protestant than Le Chambon, if that is possible.</span> <span id="s483">Uh, Le Chambon may have had...I don't know, maybe roughly ten percent of Catholics.</span> <span id="s484">I don't know if that figure is exactly accurate.</span> <span id="s485">Uh, Le Mazet was almost, I pre...I imagine ninety-nine percent, you know, Protestant.</span> <span id="s486">And there were Jews hidden throughout uh Le Mazet.</span> <span id="s487">Uh, but when I think of individuals, it's hard for me to...to think of in...in particular places.</span> <span id="s488">I..</span> <span id="s489">.</span> <span id="s490">I really think of some of the people... Well, probably, the people in Le Chambon that I probably feel closest to, besides uh...besides the Trocmé family, uh are uh Henri et Anne Heritier (ph), who play a very imp...very important role in the film, uh who open and close the film, but who...who also... And played a very important role in the life of the village, uh although nobody knew it at the time; because they were harboring the young Jew who was the forger for the village.</span> <span id="s491">And that was a key component in what went on there.</span> <span id="s492">People--Jews--needed false...false ID's.</span> <span id="s493">Uh, but they played an important role in my life, because my parents had a very surprisingly close relationship with Heritiers.</span> <span id="s494">They did not have a close relationship with the peasants with whom they were staying.</span> <span id="s495">Uh, and didn't...maintained no contact with ...with them.</span> <span id="s496">Whereas the Heritiers, they did maintain a contact.</span> <span id="s497">When I went back to Le Chambon in the '60's with my parents, which I did, uh we visited the Heritiers and uh said hello to them.</span> <span id="s498">And my...my parents always thought the Heritiers were the the salt of the earth.</span> <span id="s499">They always felt that way about them.</span> <span id="s500">And uh...and the Heritiers's daughter, as I mentioned in the film, Eva uh had taken care of me as a baby.</span> <span id="s501">And uh I am convinced, by the way, now more and more as I uh pursue my interests in psychology and...and realize the extent to which we are shaped...shaped by early influences, uh that uh in...in...on some deep level, I was probably uh very much influenced by the Heritiers as a baby and as an infant.</span> <span id="s502">Uh I was actually uh left with the Heritiers for a certain period of time when my parents were busy.</span> <span id="s503">And Eva, when my parents were in Saint-Étienne--a near-by town--they...Eva took me back to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s504">And I stayed with her and her parents, you know, for a period of time.</span> <span id="s505">In the film, Madame Heritier...</span></p> <p><span id="s506">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION)</span></p> <p><span id="s507">01:52:30</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s509">You were saying that you had been left with them for significant periods of time while your parents were working in Saint-Étienne.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s511">That's right.</span> <span id="s512">I was actually uh... Eva Heritier, who was the Heritiers' daughter, who was uh...went with my parents when they went to Saint-Étienne.</span> <span id="s513">My mother asked to take Eva with her to help her out, which was a big deal for the Heritiers.</span> <span id="s514">Their daughter going to the big city.</span> <span id="s515">And they trusted.</span> <span id="s516">It's an interesting symbolism of that actually, because they...they trusted my parents to take their daughter away with them to...to the big city.</span> <span id="s517">Trust ends up going both ways.</span> <span id="s518">Uh, but at one point, Eva took me back to... to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s519">Uh, just her alone.</span> <span id="s520">And I stayed with her parents and with her.</span> <span id="s521">And in "Weapons of the Spirit," Madame Heritier mentions the fact that that's where I learned to walk.</span> <span id="s522">Apparently, my first steps were taken under their auspices.</span> <span id="s523">And, you know, it was very moving to me when she ...she mentioned that.</span> <span id="s524">I..</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">I..</span> <span id="s527">.</span> <span id="s528">I don't know.</span> <span id="s529">I..</span> <span id="s530">.</span> <span id="s531">I can't help wondering whether there isn't something faintly symbolic about that, that somehow uh... Well, that's where I started to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: I suspect there's something symbolic, indeed.</span> <span id="s533">Uh, you just said something very interesting.</span> <span id="s534">You said that in the 1960's you went back with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: But your parents had raised you...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: ...uh not to be a Jew, and not to know your background.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Tell me how that visit in the '60's came about, and what your parents told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: That visit was a part of my uh period in the desert, so to speak, uh where I..</span> <span id="s542">.</span> <span id="s543">I was a traumatized young man who didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s544">So that is...it's enshrouded in the same sort of uh mystery that much of my early life is.</span> <span id="s545">I..</span> <span id="s546">.</span> <span id="s547">I..</span> <span id="s548">.</span> <span id="s549">and I remember very little about it.</span> <span id="s550">All I knew was that we were going back to the uh town where my parents happened to be.</span> <span id="s551">I didn't know why they were there.</span> <span id="s552">I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s553">I had been taught not to ask questions.</span> <span id="s554">I was a very good, dutiful child, who didn't ask questions.</span> <span id="s555">Uh, and uh I was brought to the hospital where my...I was born.</span> <span id="s556">And we visited the Heritiers, and uh... But none of this had any context, and uh really influenced me; except that it may have without my realizing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: How old were at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: I'm not sure of the exact date.</span> <span id="s559">I think it was probably around '65, '66.</span> <span id="s560">So I was twenty uh...twenty-one, twenty-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And your parents never told you more than that you were going to visit a place they had been...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span> <span id="s563">In...</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Not that people rescued them, or none of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: No.</span> <span id="s566">Of course, interestingly, uh it shows how taboos linger on long after they've been ostensibly lifted.</span> <span id="s567">This was a time when I already knew I was Jewish and they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s568">But it was nevertheless a time when I still didn't push, didn't... My parents, probably at that time they...they had imparted the information, but they didn't want it to matter to me.</span> <span id="s569">They still didn't want me to ask questions.</span> <span id="s570">They still didn't want to... So I..</span> <span id="s571">.</span> <span id="s572">I..</span> <span id="s573">.</span> <span id="s574">I still never asked questions.</span> <span id="s575">Uh, "How did you survive?</span> <span id="s576">Where...?"</span> <span id="s577">You know.</span> <span id="s578">And uh, you know, I didn't uh...and I didn't realize the...the extent of what had happened in...in Le Chambon there.</span> <span id="s579">So uh I..</span> <span id="s580">.</span> <span id="s581">I really don't remember that...that visit very well.</span> <span id="s582">Uh, I remember...I remember so much better, and I will share with you, uh a visit uh...the first visit that I made to the Heritiers uh as I was uh emerging from my taboos and was uh... I went with my wife in in the early '80's, and we knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s583">You know, in a small village you don't always call ahead.</span> <span id="s584">You know, you just drop by.</span> <span id="s585">And we did.</span> <span id="s586">And I introduced Barbara, my wife, to...to the Heritiers.</span> <span id="s587">And uh Madame Heritier immediately left and went into another room, and came back with this beautiful framed photograph of me as a baby.</span> <span id="s588">And it's something I will never remember.</span> <span id="s589">It was so touching that she had that photograph, and that she knew immediately, you know, where it was.</span> <span id="s590">That it had been in some very accessible place that she could bring it out so quickly.</span> <span id="s591">And uh uh...I uh...I do feel a very, very, very special bond with...with those people and with that community.</span> <span id="s592">Free association here, but I..</span> <span id="s593">.</span> <span id="s594">I just thought of.</span> <span id="s595">I've never mentioned this, really.</span> <span id="s596">But a line that will be forever with me which was so typically Chambonais, in a way.</span> <span id="s597">Another wonderful woman who was in the film was Madame Bareau (ph), who was a very old woman even then when I interviewed her.</span> <span id="s598">And uh in fact, the problem I had as the filmmaker was pinning her down and to sit for the interview, because she was always running around.</span> <span id="s599">And as she would describe it, she was always running around visiting the old people.</span> <span id="s600">Uh, and she being uh already 89.</span> <span id="s601">Uh, but I remember I had borrowed all her...her photographs; and all these people entrusted me with all their photographs, and even their childhood photographs.</span> <span id="s602">Which is ... They really trusted me.</span> <span id="s603">And I remember...I'll never forget uh going to her house to return her photographs, and she opened the door.</span> <span id="s604">And I was thanking her, and she was anxious to say something to me.</span> <span id="s605">And uh she interrupted me, and she said, "You know, I was talking to Madame Caritienne (ph)..."--another person.</span> <span id="s606">And she said, "I just wanted you to know that we both agreed it would have been a shame if you hadn't been born."</span> <span id="s607">--"S'aurait domage que vous ne soyez né."</span> <span id="s608">And I've thought about line so often.</span> <span id="s609">It...it's so typically Chambonais, in a way.</span> <span id="s610">Because, of course, it would be a shame if...if anybody wasn't born.</span> <span id="s611">But it was both very, very personal and very, very broad.</span> <span id="s612">I still don't even know what the line means.</span> <span id="s613">All I know is uh it sparked me, it's part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What would you like to add for the purposes of this film we have done ?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">02:00:30</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Well, I'd like to say something about righteous Christians, such as the people of Le Chambon, to which I am increasingly devoting part of my life.</span> <span id="s617">And perhaps particularly this: as we come to attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall into a trap.</span> <span id="s618">The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to consider that all this was so uh...they were so few in number that they're not important.</span> <span id="s619">Because they were few in number.</span> <span id="s620">And, of course, they were few in number.</span> <span id="s621">But that's precisely what makes them important.</span> <span id="s622">Uh, and that somehow focusing on them will whitewash that period, that somehow it will make...give the world an excuse to feel better about itself.</span> <span id="s623">Well, that's not the way it works.</span> <span id="s624">On the contrary, they make us accountable.</span> <span id="s625">They prove that it was possible to care.</span> <span id="s626">And that is what is necessary.</span> <span id="s627">If we hand on only a memory of...of...of bitterness and hopelessness, then the world is off the hook.</span> <span id="s628">If the world ends up thinking that it is not possible to combat evil, that it is not possible to stand up, then...then it's off the hook.</span> <span id="s629">Then it's not possible to do anything.</span> <span id="s630">So that that...all those things we will quickly come to understand.</span> <span id="s631">But the...the...the trap is that we not, in focusing on them, start idealizing them.</span> <span id="s632">That we not put them on pedestals.</span> <span id="s633">That we not make heros of them.</span> <span id="s634">Of course, they appear to us unusual because they weren't many and there's something inescapably moving about them.</span> <span id="s635">But it is crucial that we take their word for it, that what they did came naturally to them.</span> <span id="s636">It was normal.</span> <span id="s637">It was no big deal.</span> <span id="s638">That these people are no different from us.</span> <span id="s639">That what they did is...we are capable of doing.</span> <span id="s640">Uh, that uh they acted out of emotions and attitudes that were not heroic, larger than life uh...you know, emotions; but just very small normal emotions.</span> <span id="s641">Uh, there were...there were hero-types also during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s642">There were people like Raoul Wallenberg or Andre Trocmé.</span> <span id="s643">These were people who had a..</span> <span id="s644">.</span> <span id="s645">a compelling need to make their mark, to...to... These were heros.</span> <span id="s646">Most rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust were not that sort.</span> <span id="s647">They were very ordinary people, who simply responded appropriately to the challenge that they faced.</span> <span id="s648">And they are the most relevant to us.</span> <span id="s649">Very few of us are going to be Raoul Wallenbergs.</span> <span id="s650">All of us, every day, are faced with choices that involve recognizing that there is a need to help, uh a need not to turn away, a need to realize that we are responsible for something that is going on around us.</span> <span id="s651">That we can influence positively.</span> <span id="s652">And we need to know--in a way, in the most selfish...for the most selfish reasons--that responding to that need will make us feel good, will make us feel uh peaceful, happy, uh will prolong our lives.</span> <span id="s653">Uh to care about other people is fundamentally to care about yourself.</span> <span id="s654">And that is part of what I hope uh people will derive from contact with...through museums, through books, through films, will derive from learning about the righteous gentiles of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s655">And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s656">Because they existed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s660">One of the questions I'd like to ask is...does concern making "Weapons of the Spirit."</span> <span id="s661">Uh, can you tell us why you made it?</span> <span id="s662">How you came about to make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: I think it is no coincidence that somebody who was raised to forget ended up making a documentary record of what happened in Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s664">I think that uh maybe people who are raised with stories all their lives sometimes take them for granted.</span> <span id="s665">Uh, people who trust their memory often have maybe less of a need to document.</span> <span id="s666">Because I have such a precarious memory, because it's such a challenge for me to...to...to remember things, I only feel secure if it's in some way recorded.</span> <span id="s667">To me, it only exists when it's recorded.</span> <span id="s668">And uh I think that may have been a big part of this compulsive need to document uh the story of Le Chambon and--forgive me for saying so, but--to really document it as accurately as I possibly could.</span> <span id="s669">You cannot footnote a film, but I love history.</span> <span id="s670">Uh, I love academic research.</span> <span id="s671">I..</span> <span id="s672">.</span> <span id="s673">I really wanted this to be as uh accurate as it possibly could be; bearing in mind that any film has to have a dramatic flow, even a documentary.</span> <span id="s674">So, you know, you...you tell; but at the same time--and that was part of the reason that it took so long and was such a challenge, in terms of putting it together--to both respect the history, respect all the details, have every detail right, and yet not have it be boring.</span> <span id="s675">Which was my primary obligation as a filmmaker.</span> <span id="s676">It had to...the film had to work.</span> <span id="s677">I think that uh my traumatized upbringing probably had a lot to do with my need to tell the story, and probably had a lot to do...certainly had a lot to do with the effect that the people of Le Chambon had on me.</span> <span id="s678">Uh, you know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Chambon on my life is that it really uh...it happened twice.</span> <span id="s679">It happened at my birth; but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really changed my life.</span> <span id="s680">And I really feel that they rescued me twice.</span> <span id="s681">And perhaps it is that second form of rescue--the rescue of me as a lost, rootless, depressed adult--that gives "Weapons of the Spirit" something of a universal message.</span> <span id="s682">Because I do believe that many of us, even though my case may have been exteme, that many of us do have a need for positive stories to hold on to.</span> <span id="s683">Legitimate, real realistic sources of hope.</span> <span id="s684">And that I had that need.</span> <span id="s685">And... and the film--the making of the film and the film itself--responded to that need.</span> <span id="s686">And maybe that it's how to give the story whatever universal ramifications it may have.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s688">OK.</span> <span id="s689">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s690">Yeah, that does it.</span> <span id="s691">Ok, that's it.</span> <span id="s692">Thanks.</span> <span id="s693">No, that's good.</span> <span id="s694">That's good.</span> <span id="s695">That's the one question I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">02:10:45</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">The area surrounding Le Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299 PAGE 2 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 page \* arabic2</span></p></body></html>
