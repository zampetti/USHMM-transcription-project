mostly they’re not Jewish people, mostly.</span> <span id="s935">Hardly any of them -- if you would see how they hate, you wouldn’t believe it in the United States of America.</span> <span id="s936">I tried to figure them out a little bit.</span> <span id="s937">It’s unbelievable [indecipherable] they hate, no reason at all.</span> <span id="s938">To hate Jews you don’t need a reason.</span> <span id="s939">They were Jews, that’s all we -- Jews have money, Jews have good business, Jews have this, Jews have this.</span> <span id="s940">Like they don’t have anything.</span></p> <p><span

Because I deserted the Polish army, and I didn’t want them they find me, and then they still have the English army, so I didn’t want to have this name, because I was a deserter at this time.</span> <span id="s965">Not only me, the greatest part of the Jews, see, people who were in the Polish army, they deserved it, too.</span> <span id="s966">I’m positive you know something about it.</span> <span id="s967">A bunch of haters.</span> <span id="s968">Could you imagine I was sleeping with them in one -- in one t -- tent, and all the time they were reading how many Jews they killed.</span> <span id="s969">Is this a civilized ki -- people?</span> <span id="s970">Even today they tell you about hating Jews, and they’re not afraid.</span> <span id="s971">In this United States I have the last couple of weeks such experience with American about hating.</span> <span id="s972">Hating open, open, not hi -- hi -- they don’t hide it.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Wha-What was that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: What is the exper -- this is the experience.</span> <span id="s975">They hate you.</span> <span id="s976">They hate you because Jews.</span> <span id="s977">They don’t do it for any other -- do you know, one guy, he came over to me, and he said -- one guy to me he came over and he said, tha-that I -- I could not remember everything, that is my problem right now.</span> <span id="s978">If my problem would be what I could remember a little bit more, I could tell you a book.</span> <span id="s979">Because I was one time telling this story, and he said, you know, with your vocabulary and your what -- with your stories, you should write a book.</span> <span id="s980">I loved it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: I loved it.</span> <span id="s983">You see, I make an effort to tell you whatever I told you, but I don’t remember everything.</span> <span id="s984">My memory is not too good any more.</span> <span id="s985">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Well, I’m sure your daughter remember -- knows your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: I’m sure your daughter knows your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: No, no, she doesn’t ru -- I told her many stories at the time I remember I used to go over to her for dinner somewhere and I used to tell them the stories.</span> <span id="s990">So that they used to wait for me to come and -- all the time for dinner, and I would tell them again the stories, but it’s all gone with the wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Well, your daughter knows it, so it’s not gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: What?</span> <span id="s993">Q: Your daughter knows your stories, so it’s not gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I told her a lot of stories, yeah.</span> <span id="s995">I told her the truth.</span> <span id="s996">And everything what I say, I swear, every word is true what I say.</span> <span id="s997">I never told a lie.</span> <span id="s998">I’m not a bra -- a -- what you call it, a bre-breaking about it.</span> <span id="s999">Bra --</span></p> <p><span

Okay.</span> <span id="s1013">Is there anything you wanted to say, any more -- did you want to sa -- any message to your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Yeah, you are a very lovely lady.</span> <span id="s1015">You behave very nice.</span> <span id="s1016">You don’t try to press me too much because you want the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Is there any -- any message or advice to give to your grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1018">You said you have two grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Th-This -- this is a good message what I have, but I couldn’t
