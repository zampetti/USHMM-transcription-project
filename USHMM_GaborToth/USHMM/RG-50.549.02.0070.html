I -- I saw your video interview recently, and it ended with you and Sonia coming to the United States, you mentioned it briefly, but I would like to go back a little bit in time, and talk a little more about the time you spent at Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And I’m wondering if you might be willing to start there, and tell me if you remember when you came to Landsberg roughly, if you remember the month, and tell me how you -- what you were like, what your -- what sh -- kind of shape you were in when you got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Well, we got there, I think the war ended in May and there we spent some times in Czechoslovakia, because you were in the te -- terezin -- Theresienstadt, and we were getting ready to be like -- there was like a resettlement place to go -- some people went to their respective countries, and some people refused to go back to their own country, bad memories, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: And we were not treated very nicely when we came back to Poland.</span> <span id="s22">People would say, you still alive?</span> <span id="s23">A lot of goods were confiscated, and they thought we were gonna try to get it back, so that was not very popular thing to go back, especially to Poland, you know, and that welcome.</span> <span id="s24">So they start asking people -- they tried to send out the people from that area, like some people were from Russia, they going back here and there.</span> <span id="s25">And I decided to actually go to Russia, cause I didn’t know -- I didn’t know about America, if we can go here.</span> <span id="s26">So I knew Russians at the time, so I said I was from Minsk, cause I didn’t want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s27">So they had a truck picking us up, and taking us somewhere, to a train station.</span> <span id="s28">And I forgot something, a sweater or something, I went back in the building.</span> <span id="s29">When I come, the truck was gone.</span> <span id="s30">So I was stranded in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s31">And then they deci -- start talking about going to Israel, so they were giving us like false papers, because the English Intelligence was checking so people don’t go to -- which wasn’t Israel then, it was Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: They didn’t want the people go that way, you remember Exodus and all.</span> <span id="s34">So they were giving us, like telling us that we Italians or Greek, so we can go that direction, toward the sea, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Whose they?</span> <span id="s36">Who was facilitating this?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Well, the Jewish organizations, you know, I -- I couldn’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: But we -- we s -- so we were in a train going to Italy like, just to get closer to the sea, to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s40">And we supposed to be -- and I think, Italians and Greeks, or something like that, because they don’t want to know we exist, because that would be obvious that we go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s41">So what happened, we r -- we ran out of food, so we talked to a American rabbi, which was in a uniform, if he can help us.</span> <span id="s42">He say, you’re supposed to be Greeks or Italians -- I don’t know how it came about, all of a sudden we got surrounded by a bunch of military vehicles, English, and they turned the train around, and we went back to Germany, which we w -- that -- at the time, I think we were in Austria.</span> <span id="s43">And end up in lan -- Landsberg [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s44">And there was ex-military camp where they t -- converted to a resettlement camp.</span> <span id="s45">W -- when we got there, things were very primitive.</span> <span id="s46">There were nothing -- we met the American commander, who was over that camp at the time, Mr. mi -- Meyerhoffer.</span> <span id="s47">I met him here in a reunion, and I even got a book he wrote, that was a book with letters he wrote to his wife.</span> <span id="s48">And he says there was not toilet paper, there was nothing in there he ordered from -- from American supplies to send us toilet paper.</span> <span id="s49">You know, they put a lot of people in there, and there was no facilities, no nothing.</span> <span id="s50">So we started off a police department, and a employment, like bureau to get people jobs, and sanitary, and -- and like -- and a cafeteria so people eat there.</span> <span id="s51">Everything was s --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Were there a lot of people there when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yeah, was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s54">Now, I couldn’t tell you the numbers, I don’t have no idea about numbers at the time, how many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Today everything is statistics, but that was camp in Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Yeah, well I know that at -- at one point that they had at least 5000 people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: That’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Yeah, I don’t -- do you think it was that many when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I -- I couldn’t really tell you, I had no recollection in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It was a lot of people, and of course, a-at times they fenced us around because there was a lot of disgusted ex-prisoners going around in the German city, robbing, and stuff, you know, people were on the loose.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: So they even put G.I.s, you know, watching the camp, and one day we had the uprising over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Over what?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Because s -- we were contained and -- and -- and they wouldn’t let us out, so we just di -- di -- a whole bunch of people got together like a big march, and tried to break out.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yeah, they didn’t want to be imprisoned again, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah, so there’s a lot of going on at the time.</span> <span id="s69">But anyway, we stayed there, and I don’t -- I cannot tell you, that’s where I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Well tell me about your job, you got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, I went to the employment office trying to get a job, and the guy who was running the employment office was nominated -- he was a Jewish fellow, and a police chief, they got the same name.</span> <span id="s72">So instead of working in an employment office, I work in a police station.</span> <span id="s73">And you couldn’t tell it’s police, because at the time there were no uniforms, everybody was -- she’s got a -- you know.</span> <span id="s74">So I said no, I don’t want to be a policeman, you know, I’ve got bad taste of police -- policemen from the war, you know, and -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: They were usually working for the other side.</span> <span id="s77">But he said, “That’s not that kind police force,” he said, “We just watch warehouses.</span> <span id="s78">But,” he says, “you get a suit, and you can eat in the cafeteria now.”</span> <span id="s79">So I said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s80">So anyway, I stayed about four years in the police department, and that’s where I met her, because she was 16, and her and a girlfriend went to a dance.</span> <span id="s81">And they supposed to been kinda cute, s-so one of the musicians followed them home, and broke in in their rooms, and they s-scream, and people call the police.</span> <span id="s82">So I was one of the rescuers, me and another policeman.</span> <span id="s83">So next day I come to see how they are doing, see?</span> <span id="s84">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you take that guy away?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Oh yeah, we arrest him.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Put him in jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: He pull -- he pulled a knife on -- he got a stiletto on the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: He was threatening her?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I -- I don’t know what he was trying to do, but they were screaming, and they called the police, and next day I came to see how they were doing, you know, and th-that’s where is started.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So you stayed there for quite awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: About four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: And then we went to Munich, and we start registering.</span> <span id="s95">Then I have no desire go to Poland, she went to Poland, came back, before she met me.</span> <span id="s96">She says -- she probably told you about it, it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Yeah, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: So there was different offices you can register, go to the United States, Australia, Canada, I don’t know, different places.</span> <span id="s99">So I put -- put my name different places, you know.</span> <span id="s100">We had to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s101">So we got a letter, which we were accepted, in the Richmond -- [indecipherable] in the United States.</span> <span id="s102">So I don’t know if should put that on the tape, but I ask -- when the American soldiers -- we were driving around with the military police, I said, “Did you heard of Richmond, Virginia?”</span> <span id="s103">He says, “Oh, you’re not going there.”</span> <span id="s104">And I said [indecipherable] you know, so -- I -- that’s just what -- I don’t know what’s going on, you know.</span> <span id="s105">When -- when I got -- we got the letter, we went to Munich, and of course there were arrangements to fly to United States.</span> <span id="s106">But when I came to Richmond, I was unaware of the segregation.</span> <span id="s107">You know, when I was little, we -- we had the book about Uncle Tom, you know -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Uncle Tom’s cabin?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yeah, cabin.</span> <span id="s110">I wasn’t aware that there was a segregation, I would keep getting in trouble.</span> <span id="s111">I went to a black -- black barbershop, and then when I met the barber on the -- on the bus, I sat with him, and the guy said, “You better get up because they’re gonna stop the bus, because black people should sit in the back.”</span> <span id="s112">And you know, so I kept getting in trouble, because we -- after the war we didn’t like discrimination at all, so that’s wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Let me go back and ask you a couple more questions about Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What kind of things did you do in your job as a policeman?</span> <span id="s116">I mean, you went and -- and inner -- stopped this disturbance, but what other kinds of things did it turn out to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well, most of the time we were -- we were watching warehouses.</span> <span id="s118">Then a lot of times they were giving out food and supplies, so we had to stay there, keep order, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Di -- did you notice the conditions getting better at the camp, over time?</span> <span id="s122">You said they were pretty bad when you first got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well yeah, yeah, yeah, they were getting better, because it was getting a little more organized.</span> <span id="s124">And we also had a lot of trouble with black market.</span> <span id="s125">I guess a lot of people were -- you see, you couldn’t use banks, so all the smugglers, you know, they -- they had people carrying money, and they were s -- well, we had a lot of trouble with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: And -- and that was not official, because we couldn’t go to the official places and prosecute them or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: You know?</span> <span id="s130">And there was a lot of smuggle, with the cooperation of the American army.</span> <span id="s131">They were getting money together, getting the -- what do they call it, care packages.</span> <span id="s132">And what happened, those care packages were bought by groups of people, and when they came back to Germany, there was a crew unpacking everything and selling it on the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Before it got to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Oh yeah, because it wasn’t really meant for the people, they were -- they were meant for s -- they were using as a cover up for smuggling.</span> <span id="s135">Because sum -- they didn’t have no license to sell cigarettes.</span> <span id="s136">And -- and they said, like Belgian or something, that was legal to sell American cigarettes when they -- wh -- where the trailer came with cigarettes, the destination was somewhere else, we stop there, and there unload, you know, there was -- there was a lot of that stuff.</span> <span id="s137">And United States, I mean, you hear about a lot of offices were involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s139">What other kinds of things were -- you’ve mentioned cigarettes, but what other kind of things were available or desirable on the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Chocolate, clothing.</span> <span id="s141">Most anything can be transported.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And -- and was there a place where you could go that you knew you could buy something, was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yeah, in like private homes.</span> <span id="s144">Some women had a restaurant in their house, they were cooking, and go there and buy a meal.</span> <span id="s145">There was nothing official, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s147">But people -- because people were there for --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Then the ORT come in, the head of the ORT organization.</span> <span id="s149">They were trying to teach people trades, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s151">And they had schools, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah, they had courses for people to, you know, to learn, although how much you can learn in a short time, but it was a beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s154">Tell me what you remember about your wedding.</span> <span id="s155">It was, I understand, probably one of the first weddings.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yeah, we had the whole place show up.</span> <span id="s157">You know, like in America they ca -- call it covered dish party.</span> <span id="s158">Everybody brought something.</span> <span id="s159">And we even have a band.</span> <span id="s160">There’s a lot of people call themself musicians but they’re not, and they -- and we have a band t -- that you could die laughing when they were playing, they were making false notes, and -- and everything.</span> <span id="s161">And there was a lot of people wini -- I never seen in my life.</span> <span id="s162">There’s two floors with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: But it must have been a very happy occasion for everybody to experience a wedding --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: -- even though they didn’t know you.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Just to know that life goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s170">Same thing when your son was born.</span> <span id="s171">I’m sure that was vicarious thrill for a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yeah, we got in trouble, I was out of town, and s -- and a neighbor of ours, she say that she got the pain, and a certain, you know, how you call it --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Labor pains.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s175">And she went to hospital and they said they didn’t have babies born this particular hospital, there was another place which called San Cotilion, where they were taking women over there.</span> <span id="s176">She when she went to the hospital, they told her to come back tomorrow, some like that.</span> <span id="s177">So she went back crying, she said, we have a neighbor, Dolly, or something, and she was a hostile person, she came back, she says, she gotta be here.</span> <span id="s178">And matter of fact, they called the police, because was some kind of a dispute, she wouldn’t leave, she cry, and said the policemen were my friends.</span> <span id="s179">[indecipherable] So then when -- at -- at that time they didn’t give them anesthesia, anything, so they tell them to pull, or something.</span> <span id="s180">So when she -- I was told that when she got in bed, the doctor, who was standing [indecipherable] when he bend over, see how she doing, she gave him a slap in the face.</span> <span id="s181">But it was a dum -- it was a l -- a l -- litfak -- I mean, a -- a -- a Jewish fellow from Lithow, so she gave him a slap in the face.</span> <span id="s182">But anyway, that’s the way it went, and when I came back, she -- he was born the 12th of December, and I’m superstitious, and I finally got to the hospital, it was like 30 minutes -- 11:30 or something, and I said to the nurse, “I want to see the baby.”</span> <span id="s183">She said, “Take your time.”</span> <span id="s184">And I said, “It’s getting close to midnight, it gonna be the 13th,” so I called the nurse and say you go -- she say, “What are you crazy, sir?”</span> <span id="s185">I say I want to see the baby now, you know, about five minutes to midnight, and I made it.</span> <span id="s186">Yeah, there was a lot going on in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s188">That must have been a happy time for you, after everything you’d been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: But I tell you, when we were liberated, when we li-liberated in Theresienstadt, nobody was happy, because you were kind of [indecipherable] and say why me, how about my family, you know, there was no joy.</span> <span id="s192">Took a little time to get over the whole ordeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s194">But by the time you got married, and by the time your son was born, were you able to feel that joy?</span> <span id="s195">A: Oh yeah, I guess so.</span> <span id="s196">I -- I -- you know, after all these years, today people analyze feelings, and everyth -- in those days we didn’t think about all those things, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Yeah, yeah, that’s true.</span> <span id="s198">I’ve heard a lot of people say that.</span> <span id="s199">So you came -- you -- tell me how it was that you got to come to Richmond.</span> <span id="s200">Was it through a c -- a certain organization that brought you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Ah, H-Hebrew Ladies Benevolent, which is now Jewish Family Services were -- we were accepted in this community, of course, oh it was fake, there was no job, or no -- no place to stay.</span> <span id="s202">After we got here, they started accommodating us.</span> <span id="s203">But they -- you need somebody to guarantee they will -- you won’t fall on nobody’s mercy, that you will have a place to stay, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: -- and place to work, you know, so when we came here, [indecipherable] not 19th Street, and that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Do you remember arriving at the airport?</span> <span id="s207">A: Ah, where?</span> <span id="s208">In New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Is that where you came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Well, we came in New York, and I -- oh, there was go -- some going on over there, screaming, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s211">Were the Union Station over there wa -- they call it.</span> <span id="s212">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: You flew in, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yeah, we flew in, and then they took us to the Union Station to bring us back to Richmond.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Mm-hm, the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: So we stayed there, I don’t know, several hours, overnight, and then we were put on a train that’s coming to Richmond.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Now we came to Richmond, there was a railroad station which is now a museum, and we got off, and this guy from the Ladies Hebrew Benevolent took us, and ask if we were hungry, so he went across the street to a restaurant.</span> <span id="s219">And we are not -- we -- we were not used to that food, see?</span> <span id="s220">They gave you the sliced bread, and I take a butter, and I put the butter, and the butter went through the bread.</span> <span id="s221">You know, and we were eating rye bread and stuff, so we were not used to this kind of s --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: It was white, thin -- thin, white bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah, the sliced bread.</span> <span id="s224">I don’t know who invented it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: So, that was kind of funny.</span> <span id="s227">And then we were end up in na -- North 19th Street, and she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s228">Like -- like Mickey Rooney said one time, he was -- he was made in England, assembled in the United States.</span> <span id="s229">That’s what happened with our daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Your little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: And you had a little baby boy, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: So, that’s what happened, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did they find you a job right away, or did you have to go out and find it yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yeah, they -- they took me to a factory, and the place went on strike, and the people I work with were real nice to me, you know, they were happy, and I -- gave me rides home.</span> <span id="s238">So when people went on strike, I went with them.</span> <span id="s239">And the guy who owns the place, there was a Polish immigrant from World War One, I don’t know, he came from New York, and sat in a chair and he tripped me.</span> <span id="s240">If you don’t get off, I send you back to Poland.</span> <span id="s241">So that was a mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What kind of factory was it?</span> <span id="s243">A: There was tobacco machinery.</span> <span id="s244">I had the experience because during the war, in some concentration camps, I work in a machinery place.</span> <span id="s245">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s247">It was processing?</span> <span id="s248">Like, was it a processing tobacco?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A:[indecipherable] machine, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: So, you know, when I work in ge -- in Germany, in the machinery place, I was a prisoner, but everything has to be, like 30 minutes before quitting we had clean the machines, and I -- I came in here, and it’s the biggest mess I every seen in my life.</span> <span id="s252">Tools were laying on the fl -- you know, how they waste stuff in here.</span> <span id="s253">Tools were laying on floor, you know?</span> <span id="s254">So I asked this guy, his name was Rudy Star, he was also a German newcomer, if I can clean up, two, three weeks, pick up all the tools, you know, put them in a tool room.</span> <span id="s255">Then they went on strike.</span> <span id="s256">So I went to electronics.</span> <span id="s257">So from then on, I worked for -- you -- you heard of Circuit City?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Well, Circuit City started in Richmond.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: What happened, there was two -- I don’t know if you want to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: There was two guys, was Mr. Sainwerso.</span> <span id="s264">Sainwerso had relatives in Richmond, and he was on the way to North Carolina buying land.</span> <span id="s265">So when he stop in Richmond, see his relatives, there was no TV stores, that was 1948.</span> <span id="s266">So he got a friend working for -- a relative, for a TV factory in New York, which was called at the time, Olimpy.</span> <span id="s267">And he says, that’s a good place to move.</span> <span id="s268">So he went back to New York, brought TVs in his trunk.</span> <span id="s269">And there was a tire store here downtown, in [indecipherable] and there was a Jewish fellow, he says -- he gave him a corner to sell some TVs.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: In a tire store?</span> <span id="s271">A: Yeah, and those TVs went kind of fast --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: -- so he went and got more TVs, then he brought his partner, which was ha -- Mr. Haig from New York, and they open a store next to Sears, and call it Ward’s company.</span> <span id="s274">The reason called Ward’s, because Wardsell was his name.</span> <span id="s275">At that time was Montgomery Wards, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: But -- but they start Ward’s, you know, W, Wardsell.</span> <span id="s278">Alan was his son, Ruth was his wife, and -- and s -- that he used to name the comp --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: -- make Ward’s.</span> <span id="s281">And then they went suing Montgomery Ward, because they -- they didn’t put Montgomery on the front.</span> <span id="s282">So he got some -- I don’t remember all the details, they sued Montgomery Ward, and he won.</span> <span id="s283">And -- and that’s the way it went, and then they start up in more stores, and clothing, and all kind of finagling, and all of a sudden got a lot of employers, and everything and then they bought Lafayette stores, I don’t know if you remember.</span> <span id="s284">Like Radio Shack, there was Lafayette stores, so he bought them.</span> <span id="s285">And -- and the [indecipherable] they were getting bigger, and bigger, that’s what Circuit City is now.</span> <span id="s286">So we used to have lunch with the bosses every day, you know, with Mr. Wardsell.</span> <span id="s287">Matter of fact, when I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And you -- did you go to work for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I we -- wor --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And -- and what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I repair TVs and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: In ’40 -- when you -- in ’49, or ’50 --</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Yeah, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well -- and two of my witnesses when I become citizen, Mr. Haig and Mr. Wardsell, the -- the founders of Circuit City.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s299">So you worked for them for -- for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: For about -- almost 11 years.</span> <span id="s301">Then I went in my own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s303">Well, what was it like for you to be here?</span> <span id="s304">Where -- whe -- did you speak very much English?</span> <span id="s305">A: Little by little, I was learning, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s306">I keep checking at that time that I learn English, then I met some people from Poland, they tell me I speak Polish with the English accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Really, huh.</span> <span id="s308">When you came, did you speak anything -- any English at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s310">Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: We didn’t have much connections with Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: And what were your first impressions of this country, or did you -- did you have time to stop and think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Well, I don’t know, it was kind of commercial, everything was money.</span> <span id="s315">You go in a restaurant, you want the jukebox play, you had to put a money in it.</span> <span id="s316">Everything was -- can -- then there was a lot of waste.</span> <span id="s317">I see somebody write with the pencil and then right there throw it away.</span> <span id="s318">I went and picked it up, I said hey, that’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Even then, it was like that?</span> <span id="s320">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s321">People throwing stuff away.</span> <span id="s322">You go now in a thrift store, you’d be surprised at the stuff people get rid of, I mean like valuables, expensive stuff, and -- and they do that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s323">They don’t have no patience.</span> <span id="s324">People who call me gave me TVs for nothing.</span> <span id="s325">Right now here, day before yesterday I pick up two TVs.</span> <span id="s326">The lady says -- from New York, she says, “I don’t want them.</span> <span id="s327">You don’t want to take them, I’ll put them in a dumpster.”</span> <span id="s328">I says, “I’ll take them.”</span> <span id="s329">And they three or four year old TVs.</span> <span id="s330">People waste a lot of stuff here.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s332">What was it like for you socially?</span> <span id="s333">Did you socialize with other survivors, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Well, we were kind of pushed together because they keep us more or less together, but we had here new American Jewish club, which was really founded by the German immigrants.</span> <span id="s335">So we belong to that club, and everybody was meeting in there, and for several years, and -- but a lot of people left Richmond, because Richmond was really dominated by the -- we’re -- we’re supposed to be Ashkenazis, I don’t know, and they were dominated here by the Sephardic Jews, you know, from Spain and Portugal.</span> <span id="s336">And then the German Jews came in, and they kind of got on the top of everything.</span> <span id="s337">I don’t know, they elect me president, I was the only Polish.</span> <span id="s338">They all -- there was a German club, and they -- they elect me president, I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s339">So -- so a lot of people just left.</span> <span id="s340">[indecipherable] people stayed and open grocery stores, because lab -- if you were a laborer, or something, there’s a lot anti-sem -- anti-Semitism here, Jew this, and Jew that, Jew ‘em down, Jew ‘em up.</span> <span id="s341">I had several fights.</span> <span id="s342">I was mad after the war, somebody call me a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Boleslaw Brodecki.</span> <span id="s345">This is tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s346">You said that there was -- you encountered some anti-Semitism on the job here.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Oh yeah, there -- there was -- on the job.</span> <span id="s348">And as a laborer, you -- I mean like one guy, which was retired from [indecipherable] company, went to work for there for driving a taxi, and they call him Hebrew, you know?</span> <span id="s349">There w -- there wa -- it -- it -- I don’t see it now as much as then.</span> <span id="s350">And they said during the war, they drew swastikas in the s -- they vandalized synagogues, but we didn’t make too much fuss about it, even lately.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: During which war?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: World War Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s354">There was vandalism here.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yeah, they put swastikas in -- in the departments to elevator and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s356">And vandalized some synagogues in a -- so I was in the Jewish community center, and it brought -- a lot of time they wouldn’t advertise it, because you say if you put it in the paper, it’s getting kind of contagious.</span> <span id="s357">They just -- small vandalizing of the Holocaust Museum here a few weeks ago, but we kind of keep it under cover.</span> <span id="s358">That was a few weeks ago, they vandalized the museum.</span> <span id="s359">And then we had committee in the Jewish Community Center examining newspapers from all over Virginia to find if it was anti-Semitic text.</span> <span id="s360">And they were trying to publish a Christian telephone book, [indecipherable] buy it from [indecipherable] so that was a fight over that, and then we had another thing which, with high schools, like during Jewish holidays, so they don’t -- they get credits, they can make up because th-this people of Jewish faith, that they wouldn’t go to school during the Jewish hol --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: On the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: That was a whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: And this was in the 50’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No, that was lately in le --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: -- last 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s368">What about i -- was -- was the anti-Semitism such that -- were you afraid?</span> <span id="s369">Or was it just annoying?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: It was annoying, because like I -- I grew up in Warsaw, and I -- we are on the warpath, I mean there was anti-Semites in Warsaw, but we’re -- the Jewish guys, we were -- like I was carrying a wrench and a chain with me, somebody hit me, then I get him.</span> <span id="s371">We were -- we -- we were used to it, you know?</span> <span id="s372">And then there were Jewish stores in Poland where they -- they were working with signs, don’t buy -- don’t buy from a Jew, you know, so we were beating them up.</span> <span id="s373">I mean, there was a la -- th-that’s why I was in a place here friends of ours, and -- and her son told her that they were talking something against Jews on the bus, the kids.</span> <span id="s374">So she says, “Did you get off?”</span> <span id="s375">And he says yeah.</span> <span id="s376">And I say, “When I was in Poland, we got in a fight, we didn’t get off.”</span> <span id="s377">But here, was a different attitude, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: So, we were annoyed, we still get annoyed with that kind of stuff, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: But it never got to the point -- there was never so much that you were afraid that something would happen to you or your family, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Why?</span> <span id="s382">Y-You get afraid because some things will overpower you, no matter what you do, you get overpowered.</span> <span id="s383">If you see somebody seven foot tall, a giant, and you’re a little fellow, sure, you’re going to run.</span> <span id="s384">Like David and Goliath.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s386">But were there things that you would avoid doing, or places you would avoid going, or something, because you were afraid there might be a confrontation?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: In Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Here, I’m talking about here.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I -- I -- I really couldn’t recall it.</span> <span id="s390">I never been that bad, you know, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Uh-huh, that’s what I’m trying to understand, you know, the degree of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No, no, no they weren’t that bad, just mostly vandalism, or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s393">And it happened now with the -- they say it’s on the increase.</span> <span id="s394">So, read it in the paper, they say it’s on the increase [indecipherable] this -- i-i-it’s complicated because, you know, in the United States, in the -- in the Congress, or what, they vote, and they try to -- people be against Israel, against Jews, so they spend money now, try to push that propaganda because everything if -- they [indecipherable] last summer, and they -- they voted on.</span> <span id="s395">So they try to turn people opinion of it.</span> <span id="s396">So it’s nice when -- when the Saudi Arabian prince was trying to give six million dollars to -- at New York, to the mayor, he refused to take it, you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: When -- when your kids started to get older --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: It was Giuliani was -- what I am talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Giuliani is --</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Giuliani, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: He refused -- they give him six million dollars, he refused to take it, even after 9-11.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s406">When your kids started getting old enough to wonder where their grandparents were, you know, why don’t we have relatives here, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s407">Did they ask you questions, did you tell them, did you want to tell them what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Wh -- when they were little we didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s409">Now when they started getting mature, th-they were going to that center and all that, they were finding out things for themselves.</span> <span id="s410">It was -- I don’t know, the fir -- the la -- last -- first 10 or 15 years, nobody was really talking about.</span> <span id="s411">And people really picked up interest after the ’67 war in Israel.</span> <span id="s412">Even here we had troubles.</span> <span id="s413">We were collecting money for Jewish welfare for Israel, and one guy who is a lawyer said, “I don’t give to causes like that,” you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s414">And I ask one time, ah -- I -- owner of a big Jewish company store, he’s retired, so I said now you ca -- you can visit Israel.</span> <span id="s415">He says, “That’s the last place I want to be.”</span> <span id="s416">You know?</span> <span id="s417">So there was, even among the Jews, there was some kind of a way, when they was talking from years ago when delegation went to Roosevelt about what’s going on and -- and it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: During the war, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: -- some ga -- and he says kee -- keep him out of here.</span> <span id="s420">You know, I mean the -- so where they making the mistake is like that you try to be loyal to a country, right?</span> <span id="s421">Like the Germans, right?</span> <span id="s422">They were fighting World War One, they were loyal Germans, they got iron crosses, it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s423">Yo -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s424">And here is s -- well, we love America and everything, but you cannot forget that it’s still -- you got forces against you.</span> <span id="s425">No matter which -- you remember Rikover?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Rikover?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: He was a Jewish admiral.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Yeah, Hyman Rikover.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah, he -- he went with the [indecipherable] with the -- to the North Pole, the first --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: He was a nuclear submarine admiral.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yeah, and he was day and night on the train checking out, and they -- and they say, “I hope you get enough medals to fall in the water and drown.”</span> <span id="s432">They even took him for congressional hearings.</span> <span id="s433">They said, “Are you ready?”</span> <span id="s434">He says, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s435">I took a shave, and I shower and put a clean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: When you were young, before the war, were you active in pro Zionist kinds of causes, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yeah, we got -- we had that.</span> <span id="s438">We had Maccabi, that was a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s439">And there were -- there were two kinds, there were Zionists, and ba -- Betarof Jews.</span> <span id="s440">Betar -- there was guy who was -- they said that he was a military kind of a -- matter of fact, we were in Israel, and we couldn’t get to his grave, they say.</span> <span id="s441">They were against it for some reason.</span> <span id="s442">I don’t know, like s -- you got parties, like here Republicans.</span> <span id="s443">Jeez, over there you got a labor party, you got differen -- different -- but we were Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s445">And your father, too, your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I -- I couldn’t tell you really.</span> <span id="s447">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: But as a -- as a young man, you were a -- a teenager, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: You di -- you were active in those things.</span> <span id="s451">So this was a natural extension of your interests from before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: -- when you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well, we have one cousin who is [indecipherable] and they got uniforms and things, and they were marching across Poland, going to Israel to fight.</span> <span id="s455">But they broke it up at the -- that was Lola’s brother.</span> <span id="s456">He wa -- he was a lawyer, and then he turn Communist.</span> <span id="s457">In Poland they were -- a lot of the Jews were Communist, and -- and first of May, he slept in our house, so he didn’t get arrested for being Communist.</span> <span id="s458">You see the ru -- Russia was a big disappointment.</span> <span id="s459">I ran o -- ran off on the Russian side during the war, because Poland was kind of chopped in half.</span> <span id="s460">And when we got there they said they were the -- everybody’s equal and all that, but still was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s461">And they put you in jail if you call somebody like here a Jew.</span> <span id="s462">They say evrai.</span> <span id="s463">That was against the law to do that, but they still were doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s465">Given that you were active, what -- what -- what was it that made you want to come to the United States instead of go to Israel, when you had a choice?</span> <span id="s466">Or was it just that U.S. --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I ha -- I -- I -- I didn’t have a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: That was -- we were -- first of all, where everybody wants to go United States because, you know, is a -- gold is in the streets, you know.</span> <span id="s470">But what happened, I told you we were turned back from Israel -- we were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Oh that’s right, when you were by yourself, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s473">And then when we register, I was married then, when we register.</span> <span id="s474">We were accepted in here to come only to Richmond -- come only [indecipherable] we went here.</span> <span id="s475">You know, when I was in Germany after the war, we were -- we were actually preparing go to Israel.</span> <span id="s476">We were even -- had the underground.</span> <span id="s477">There was [indecipherable] and -- and other organizations, so we -- like we was -- I was a policeman, and we had duty with American soldiers, and you know, we were talking about waste?</span> <span id="s478">Three hours later the -- the truck come and brang these soldiers, and pick them up, they left the coats, the guns, the shoes, they went -- so we were -- we were taking all that and -- and sending it to Israel.</span> <span id="s479">We -- we were buying guns, and grenades, you know, that -- the-there was kind of smuggle --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Everything was working for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: While you were a policeman?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s485">I guess that was pretty common then.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s488">I want to go back to something you started to talk about before when you came to Richmond and you found out that there was segregation here, racial segregation, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: -- it was very disappointing for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah, we -- we really didn’t have no idea about it, but there were booklet given to us, and they says that we will encounter that, and they advised us that we always should be on the side of the right team, we shouldn’t worry about it -- I mean, we should be against it in our government.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Who wrote this booklet?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: I don’t know, the U.S. government.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: They gave us a book that we will encounter this kind of stuff, we were not to be afraid to be against it, this a free country, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s496">But we really run into that.</span> <span id="s497">And what would -- what got me is something we remembered from Germany, you know, the -- they paint a picture for Jews, terrible thing, but then if you were a friend with a German, he going to say, “The Jews are no good, but you are different.”</span> <span id="s498">Because he didn’t know the o-others.</span> <span id="s499">And we encountered the same thing, like I worked for Ward’s, and we went -- the Windsor farms is the -- here that was exclusive area, no Catholics, no Jews, no blacks.</span> <span id="s500">And is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: And what was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Windsor Farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Windsor Farms.</span> <span id="s504">What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s506">It’s just a area, you know, like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Subdivision, like where people live --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: No, no, it’s in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: But they -- they were like a -- there was no Jews, no blacks, no Catholics, you know, even then.</span> <span id="s511">So I go to service TV, and -- and the maid, and the lady of the house, and all watch TV soap operas.</span> <span id="s512">On the buses they couldn’t sit together, so I say, what’s that?</span> <span id="s513">Oh, Mary is different, you know?</span> <span id="s514">When I worked for Ward’s, there were black drivers, you know, who were real -- a real low grade of people, not because they were black, but they were alcohol, this, that.</span> <span id="s515">During lunch all the women from the office, everybody sits together, so I say, “You -- you hate them, why do you sit with them?”</span> <span id="s516">“Oh, Norman, Jimmy, they are different,” you know?</span> <span id="s517">Then one day they -- they send me to service a TV, some black men brought a TV, and the TV broke down, and that was surprise for his wife.</span> <span id="s518">So they want me to go first there and fix the TV, and it was lunchtime, so I said, “I get there, I gonna make him fix me lunch.”</span> <span id="s519">And -- and -- and the girl in the office say, “You can’t eat at a nigger’s.”</span> <span id="s520">So I say, “Every restaurant you go, they’re work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s521">What the heck is the different?”</span> <span id="s522">That was -- wa-was a story, which I don’t know if it’s true, but it’s more or less a joke, you might heard it.</span> <span id="s523">Can I tell you?</span> <span id="s524">This -- during the war, all the men was in the army in Europe, here there, and there was a graduation here, in the Windsor Farms, which is -- so the lady called Camp Lee, and asked the general to send some GI’s to ask all the girls to graduation.</span> <span id="s525">And before she finished, she says, “We -- we a nice Christian family, and please don’t send any Jews.”</span> <span id="s526">So here the graduation day, a bus pulls up full of black people.</span> <span id="s527">And one black guy knock on the door and says to the lady -- and she said, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s528">“We came here to ask out the girls to graduation.”</span> <span id="s529">She says, “That must be a mistake.”</span> <span id="s530">“Well,” he said, “the general send us.”</span> <span id="s531">She said, “The general must made a mistake.”</span> <span id="s532">He says, “Lady, General Schwartz never made a mistake in his life.”</span> <span id="s533">And I got a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What the heck.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: You can [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: They said they --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: So what -- when the -- when your kids went to school, were the public schools all segregated?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s541">And what --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: We would have a problem here, because they were signing a petition th -- when they went to the public school here, the lower school, they were segregated, so they call all the parents to sign a petition that they don’t want any black people in here.</span> <span id="s543">I refused to sign it.</span> <span id="s544">But they took it wrong.</span> <span id="s545">They say, “They will come in, it’s serious, you better sign it.”</span> <span id="s546">And I -- I say, “I didn’t sign it on account of that, I just don’t believe in it.”</span> <span id="s547">They say, “If you don’t sign it, they couldn’t go to school.”</span> <span id="s548">I still didn’t sign it.</span> <span id="s549">I was stubborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And the kids still went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Now when I see black people who are anti-Semites, I say I don’t know which way [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: But did your kids go to that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Kreschee elementary.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: What year was that?</span> <span id="s557">In the 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah, there wa -- there was -- in ’58 - ’59, or something like that.</span> <span id="s559">She went there wi -- to school, she parked the car, and she came on the other side of the building, told her the car was stolen.</span> <span id="s560">She called the police.</span> <span id="s561">She came in from one end, and come out the other end, and no car.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Whoops.</span> <span id="s563">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: So, she didn’t see the [indecipherable] there was a green car, now there was another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: During those years, the 50’s and the 60’s, I -- I gather that their knowledge -- public knowledge about the Holocaust in this country was very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yeah, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: People either did -- often didn’t -- claimed that they didn’t know, or it just was not discussed.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No, it wa-wasn’t -- ver-very little knowledge, and -- and that’s why the museum is doing a great job, have teacher seminars here, they’re doing a great job.</span> <span id="s569">Th-Th-They got seminars for teachers all the time, we talk to schools -- I’ve been speaking schools and churches.</span> <span id="s570">Of course, not as much as some people who are retired, but I -- like some guy tows -- we were in Rockfield, and he says too many museums open up, but the idea is just like a lot of Walmart open up, to reach more people, and the same thing a Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s571">For example, people which come here, would never go to Washington, so the knowledge is important that people know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Not only on account of the Jews, there was a lot of, you know, especially in the Middle East, they killing people off in Africa.</span> <span id="s574">You know, the Tutsis and the Hutus?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Rwanda, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: It cha -- Rwanda they chop hundreds of heads off and -- right now, and -- and it’s not a territorial kind of thing, it’s just ra-racist kind of thing, because you know, so the knowledge, you know, tolerance is very important, and they do a heck of a job here.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Hang on a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Tours, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: We were talking about your -- when you came and -- and you were unhappy, very discouraged about the racial discrimination that you saw here.</span> <span id="s580">Did you join in any marches, or do anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: There was nothing of that kind here.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: There wasn’t?</span> <span id="s583">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, I mean, I did not like it, but the -- there wasn’t much you could do about it, but you just did no -- disagree with the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Wa -- one day when we move over here, we invited the people who helped us move to the table, and there was black man and all, and -- and there was one -- a white guy, and I keep him in the other room.</span> <span id="s587">And then he said, “How come you didn’t invite me to the kitchen?”</span> <span id="s588">I say, “You are southern, and you don’t like black people, I didn’t want to offend you, we don’t mind.”</span> <span id="s589">He says, “Damn it, let me go in there.”</span> <span id="s590">And he came in and sat with us, remember?</span> <span id="s591">Because we said he came in later, we sit down, there was Jimmy Glynn, there was a couple who help us move, and we had dinner with them, and this white guy, he said, “How come you don’t invite me there?”</span> <span id="s592">“Well,” I say, “you a southerner, you don’t like black people, I didn’t want to have any friction.”</span> <span id="s593">“Damn it, I’m going.”</span> <span id="s594">And he came in and sat with us.</span> <span id="s595">But I mean, that is -- there weren’t much you can do about it, because we were guests over here.</span> <span id="s596">Couple of times people said, “You don’t like it, why don’t you go back home?”</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: They did?</span> <span id="s598">People said that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s602">Ak -- a few times that -- and they say, if you don’t like it, why don’t you go back where you came from?</span> <span id="s603">Like I interfere with somebody else’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: So, we were kind -- in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s607">What about when -- when -- when the Vietnam war happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: You must have had -- any kind of war must have brought out some strong feelings in you, I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Well, basically, we understood -- I don’t know everybody did, Nixon wrote an article in Reader’s Digest at the time, if the Communists take over there, all the routes, trade and commerce, everything going to be affected, if -- if the Vietnam turned Communist, then -- we -- we didn’t like what was going on, but it looked to us like it was the right thing to do at the time.</span> <span id="s611">But we didn’t know that so much politics were involved, because -- what was [indecipherable] was that port [indecipherable] and now the supplies were coming in, and they never bombed that, they bombed it somewhere else.</span> <span id="s612">Then when Nixon went to Cambodia with the universities here protest, and it was -- you had to study the whole thing, really, to understand what was going on there.</span> <span id="s613">We didn’t like -- the lot of people -- a lot of guys went to Canada, they don’t want to get drafted, and we didn’t like it either, our son was in college, so he had a college deferments, though, and he was a heck of a baseball player, they were trying to get him in major leagues.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Baseball?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s616">We had scouts about him, oh, we had New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, and -- and we had a friend here, Eddie Casko, he was a major league player, and he came, and we beg him to talk Gerard go into baseball, because he would had to quit college, if he quit college, they send him to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s617">We came out of a war, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s618">They -- so he came in here, and talked to Joe, he says, and the major league is only 500 people, and half of them are black, and another part is South American, and a red blooded American boy don’t really get a chance to get in the major league, and that’s the only way to be, if you get in.</span> <span id="s619">And -- and tried talk him out of doing it, you see.</span> <span id="s620">S-So he kept in college, and he went to the National Guard.</span> <span id="s621">By that time, the war ended.</span> <span id="s622">But we didn’t really want him go to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s623">He went to Israel twice when the war started, he volunteer.</span> <span id="s624">Well, I cou -- we couldn’t stop him then.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Did you want to stop him?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah, she want to stop him.</span> <span id="s627">We didn’t like him to do that, but we have friends in Israel, and their kids were in the army, and I just didn’t feel like morally, I have the right to stop him.</span> <span id="s628">He sold everything, he went to Israel, and a --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And he was a volunteer in a kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yeah, but the idea is -- yeah, but the idea is that Israel is very particular about their soldiers.</span> <span id="s631">If you go there they don’t take you in the army, because you have no experience.</span> <span id="s632">They di -- put you in the kibbutz and different places.</span> <span id="s633">And he was in one kibbutz, there were rats, there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s634">Yeah, you know, it’s -- but he went, he went.</span> <span id="s635">We couldn’t stop him.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Did you try to st -- talk him out of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, she was trying to talk him out of it as a mother, but I never said a word, because I just morally I feel like I have no right to do it.</span> <span id="s638">Cause a mother is a mother, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Hang on.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: That was the ’67 -- not, that was the ’83, I think.</span> <span id="s641">Wa -- wa -- one of the wars.</span> <span id="s642">I think ’67 he was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: ’73?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Maybe, yeah.</span> <span id="s647">Boy, he -- the war didn’t take very long, so that was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Ra -- in the sevend -- late -- late 70’s, or early 80’s, there was -- when there started to be a lot of awareness in this country, a lot of public discussion about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: There was a television program about the Holocaust, and a lot of people, you know, who didn’t know about it before, or didn’t learn about it, became aware of it.</span> <span id="s651">And it’s been getting more and more in the -- in the people’s consciousness since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: What -- what -- what was happening with you at that time?</span> <span id="s654">Did -- did you feel the need to speak out more?</span> <span id="s655">Were you aware of this going on around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, there was -- there -- there was a general trend between [indecipherable] and Jewish community to have speakers go to schools, I went to several schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Uh-huh, oh yeah, I -- I got the -- I got that many letters, I know, from different places where I was speaking.</span> <span id="s659">I got a whole library of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: What did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: About the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: About what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: What happened to me, and -- and other ways in the -- after we through, I’ll show you something.</span> <span id="s664">I spoke to the governor’s school several times.</span> <span id="s665">You know where the governor’s school is.</span> <span id="s666">Outstanding students, above average.</span> <span id="s667">They have a separate school for them, they call it governor’s school.</span> <span id="s668">And because they cannot survive in a regular school, because they are above average, you know?</span> <span id="s669">So they call it the governor’s school.</span> <span id="s670">Matter of fact, they just build thas -- got a new building just for that.</span> <span id="s671">So I talked to the governor’s school couple times, and University of Richmond.</span> <span id="s672">And I went to Lutheran church, high schools.</span> <span id="s673">At the beginning I took my son a couple of times, because I need some criticism.</span> <span id="s674">And so he gave me some hints, he -- the SS is storm troop, th -- that was the bad people in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Storm troopers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah, so like Gestapo, SS.</span> <span id="s677">So he says, “Don’t say that, say German guards, because when s -- y-you use SS here, it’s like support Saddam.</span> <span id="s678">You know, like -- said don’t use that term because the kids don’t know what the SS.</span> <span id="s679">And then -- and then people would say if I have any narrow escapes, and he says, “Well tell them that you had one foot in the grave, and one on a banana peel.”</span> <span id="s680">So that was his advice to -- I want them to listen, I want to tell them, because my English was limited, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: What was that like for you to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I don’t know, I just kept talking.</span> <span id="s683">I -- I didn’t have no -- any script, you know.</span> <span id="s684">And then I-I tried to shorten my talk and answer questions, because you go to schools, the kids are in different grades, and different mentality, you know.</span> <span id="s685">So I don’t want to -- I didn’t want to talk above or below.</span> <span id="s686">So I talk for a time, and then I said, “I want to hear some questions.”</span> <span id="s687">Then I can go out to what they want to hear, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Boleslaw Brodecki.</span> <span id="s691">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s692">You were telling me before about visiting -- ta-t-talking to the school kids, and -- and college kids, too, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Both.</span> <span id="s695">And you showed me the certificate you got from the Virginia Governor’s school.</span> <span id="s696">When you started -- when you started talking to kids, did -- what did -- did it do something for you?</span> <span id="s697">I know I’ve read letters from school kids to Holocaust survivors, and I think I have a sense of how powerful an experience it is for the kids to hear those firsthand, it’s different from reading it in a book.</span> <span id="s698">But what is it like for you to tell those stories, to go through those memories over and over, and i-it -- is there something -- do you like doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Well, see, not being a professional speaker, or politician who wants to get elected [indecipherable] so our motives are -- are different, you know?</span> <span id="s700">You don’t speak for popularity, or -- so first of all, what it does to you, it refreshes your memory.</span> <span id="s701">Because if you don’t talk about it, it kind of fades out.</span> <span id="s702">You’d be surprised how that comes out.</span> <span id="s703">At one time I went, and -- she, when we had something happen, a robbery, you know, and she was very much affected, and we went to psychiatrist, and sat in front of the psychiatrist, put you in the mood, all of a sudden you remember things you never thought you were gonna remember.</span> <span id="s704">I don’t know -- and by talking to the kids, and students, helps you -- your own picture of what happened.</span> <span id="s705">Yo-You do more analyzing, and remembering.</span> <span id="s706">Maybe if you wouldn’t talk about it 20 years, you just -- and -- and the reaction make you feel good that they understand what you talking about, like this time I talk to the governor’s school, the kids call me that I’m a hero.</span> <span id="s707">Then several girls asked me if I can adopt them.</span> <span id="s708">And a -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- in a way, it’s sad but it’s fun.</span> <span id="s709">One day I said to a guy, a Jewish fellow, we had a sh -- like a Yom HaShoah or something, and all the horrible stuff, and I asked a guy, “Did you enjoy the show?”</span> <span id="s710">He said, “How can you ask me if I enjoyed it, it’s not something to enjoy, you know.”</span> <span id="s711">But you enjoy the reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: You feel like you make friends, and -- and you doing for a good cause, because some people say it never happened, you know, and it -- a-and you get kind of, say heck, I -- it never happened, I have a number here, and they tell me it never happened, I’m a liar, you know.</span> <span id="s714">So you want to show you -- your side of the story, that this is not a lie, that it really happened.</span> <span id="s715">So this is one good part of it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s717">But for some people, too, remembering is not a pleasant thing, and they don’t want to do it, and they refuse to do it -- to go tell those stories, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Well, that -- that’s some people like that.</span> <span id="s719">Some people don’t want to see any movies, anything about it, because they say they just can’t take it.</span> <span id="s720">Her doctor, she ask him if he --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Mine heart doctor.</span> <span id="s722">My cardiologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: -- if he -- if he was in the Holocaust Museum, he says he just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s724">I -- I had to take head shots for the movies --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Head shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Yeah, publicity, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Now, wa -- yo-you got casting places, when they need you, they call you, but they got to have a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Like the director comes to Richmond, they going to make a movie, say I want him, and I want her, you know.</span> <span id="s731">So they had those pictures.</span> <span id="s732">So I went to the guy who take pictures, and -- and -- and we said something about Holocaust and the guy got crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Crying.</span> <span id="s735">Was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Because you told -- he -- you -- it came out that you were a survivor, and he cried?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yeah, he got crying.</span> <span id="s738">So my daughter said don’t pay attention to him.</span> <span id="s739">He says -- she was working for a big company, she got fired for some reason, so he says -- her -- her boss who fire her, he also was crying about Holocaust, but she -- she got fired anyways.</span> <span id="s740">So she said, don’t pay attention to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: I lost my train of thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Can I ask you a question, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s743">Q: No, I’m not.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No, what -- I shouldn’t be that inquisitive.</span> <span id="s745">What is your religion?</span> <span id="s746">Are you an atheist, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: No, I was -- you know, I’ve -- I’ve had an opportunity to interview a lot of American combat veterans from World War Two, and many of them had very ta -- gruesome, terrible experiences, and experienced all their lives after they came back, flashbacks, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Where suddenly they would be driving down a road, and all of a sudden they would remember something so vividly, they would have to stop driving, because it was so difficult for them, so real, those images were so real.</span> <span id="s750">Did that happen to you, too, that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I-I couldn’t recall it.</span> <span id="s752">Some I recall, but not that intensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: -- that there was some horrible stuff, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: I mean, you had a very, very difficult, horrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yeah, I wa -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And for a long period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yeah, I was like -- I was in like seven concentration camps.</span> <span id="s761">The reason that many, because when -- when the Russians started advancing, they keep moving us, you see.</span> <span id="s762">And a lot of time we were not even guarded, and -- but there was no place to go, there was January, was snow like this, and you go -- you had -- it was like in [indecipherable] everybody could -- now that you are in the -- and there was no place to run, you know.</span> <span id="s763">I was in the shlinterlovitch which was also on Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s764">One of the foremans was not a prisoner, she was a civilian.</span> <span id="s765">And he was trying to help me to escape.</span> <span id="s766">And I didn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s767">I didn’t go in for it, I didn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s768">And after the war I find out he become police chief in that area, because people were turning you in, you cou -- you didn’t know who to trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: At least you were alive momentarily, and next day they -- somebody turn you in, you get shot, so -- especially in the winter, it’s cold, and I mean you c -- you couldn’t survive, you know.</span> <span id="s771">But the flashback, that’s -- when we were talk, it comes back to a s -- when you talk to kids, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s773">Th-the question about trust, is something I want to ask you about, too.</span> <span id="s774">How did it -- how did you, over time, deal with the question of trust, trusting other people, and knowing that somebody wouldn’t turn on you somehow, or how -- how could you assume that people were good?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Well, some I have no choice, you know, some I -- that’s the only choice, you had to trust somebody.</span> <span id="s776">For example, when I was in one camp, working a vakhar, which is like a industrial place, and the railroad tracks on both ends of the -- whatever you call that.</span> <span id="s777">And there were guards, and they were calling a guy -- you know, we didn’t have anything, exe -- a little piece of cigarette, you know, where they throw it away, so the guards say, come on, get it.</span> <span id="s778">And he threw it on the other side of the track, where you’re not supposed to be, so the guy go there, get it, and he sa -- killed him, you know?</span> <span id="s779">So -- and I had one of them, when we were marching to work, he passed by me and gave me some dry bread, put it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s780">Then when he was on guard, he called me, he says -- well, I trusted him, he says, “After the war, I have a farm, you’re going to be my coucher.”</span> <span id="s781">You know?</span> <span id="s782">And then he, one day he says he’s in trouble, because if they find a guard helping the -- what they called at the time haftlinga, which is prisoners, they get punished, they might put them in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s783">So he says, “Somebody, I think, see me helping you.</span> <span id="s784">We have to do something, we have to do something.</span> <span id="s785">I’m in trouble.”</span> <span id="s786">So I said, “What we do?”</span> <span id="s787">He says, “You come up here, and when you come up, I’m going to start to call you bad names, and kick you, and call you,” -- So I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s788">So I went over there, he said, “You faftlifter, you the bingabanga woo woo woo.”</span> <span id="s789">Then when I went away I [indecipherable] so it worked out pretty good.</span> <span id="s790">But you didn’t know who to trust, you know, some na -- people hanging.</span> <span id="s791">People kill you for -- for -- for a bite of bread, and a -- especially when you in the camp, you see hungry people go mean.</span> <span id="s792">When we came to Mauthausen, they put 300 of us in a area maybe like those two rooms double, so they tell us to take the clothes off, put them together, and lay like -- like sardines against the wall.</span> <span id="s793">When they got another row, they had to put their legs between your legs, and another row, and another row.</span> <span id="s794">Now, it’s cold, and people got to urinate a lot.</span> <span id="s795">At night, you cannot get up, if you get up, you step on other people, you can get beaten.</span> <span id="s796">So if you really had to go, you’d jump, and you’d run on pe-people, and -- and you made up with a couple guys you -- you were laying with to show what place you left.</span> <span id="s797">And -- and -- and -- and it was a horrible thing because some people couldn’t reach it.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Oops.</span> <span id="s799">Hold that thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Some people couldn’t leave, so -- so they just -- so they just -- just urinate, so you get up in the morning it’s wet all over.</span> <span id="s801">And wa -- one night I was the -- see, we talking about after the war, we got back in the war this time.</span> <span id="s802">That what you say, we can jump back?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s804">It’s okay.</span> <span id="s805">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: I was [indecipherable] and I supposed to have typhus, and I have a constant noise in my ears.</span> <span id="s807">I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t keep balance.</span> <span id="s808">So a friend of mine, I gave him my portion of bread, so he was carrying me around so they don’t catch me, because if they say you’re disabled, bingo.</span> <span id="s809">So what happened here, when I came to the factory, I couldn’t keep balance, so the guy make me work, and I didn’t make it, so they send me back in the barracks.</span> <span id="s810">Now, during lunchtime or something, the guys were coming in, back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s811">So, there were bunkbeds.</span> <span id="s812">On every bunkbed, there was day shift and night shift was just one place to sleep ta -- every bunkbed was filled, three or four people.</span> <span id="s813">And, you know, you couldn’t get in, because they push you out.</span> <span id="s814">So finally I sat on the edge of one, and I had a belt, which was cut in half so fix my wooden shoes so I don’t lose them, you know?</span> <span id="s815">So I took the -- the belt I got in my pants, and put it around my throat, and I sit on the edge of the bunk, and tie it up, and I jump, to hang myself.</span> <span id="s816">And I lost conscious, you know?</span> <span id="s817">I open my eyes, I’m on the floor, and the guy who I was giving the portion of bread, which was [indecipherable] he says, “You’re going to miss your bread portion.”</span> <span id="s818">And I could not move, I’m all shaked up, so he said it three times, and he left, because he was afraid to lose his portion.</span> <span id="s819">So then I say -- I had a little metal box, and there was a half a razor, and a couple cigarette butts.</span> <span id="s820">So I said, “I’m going to do the Japanese stuff,” you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Kill yourself with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Somebody picked my pocket, and it was gone.</span> <span id="s823">So then I lay, I -- I don’t know how long, I finally got up, and -- and I was crawling around, trying to lay down somewhere, and the one bunk is -- only one person was there.</span> <span id="s824">So I figured he must be one of the kapos, you know, the fore -- foremans?</span> <span id="s825">So I can keep him -- one foot on the ground, and somehow I slip beside him, and I think I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s826">In the morning, somebody wake me, and the guy say, “You better get away from there.”</span> <span id="s827">I say, “Why?”</span> <span id="s828">“Somebody urinate, and there’s urine under the bed in there.</span> <span id="s829">Gestapo, when they come, they ba -- beat the heck out of you.”</span> <span id="s830">So I want to be nice, so the guy was laying beside it, I say -- try deliver the message, you understand -- the guy on the other side, “Leave that man alone, he been dead since last night.”</span> <span id="s831">That’s why he was sleeping alone.</span> <span id="s832">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: When you got out -- when you came here, though, and -- how did you learn to trust people again?</span> <span id="s834">Or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Well, that was [indecipherable] I didn’t tell anybody how keep my money anything, I didn’t know [indecipherable] trust.</span> <span id="s836">I didn’t do anything except somebody can tell me, and there was just regular, every day life.</span> <span id="s837">You know, there’s no -- no matter of trust.</span> <span id="s838">There was no question of trusting, because there were no dangerous [indecipherable] illegally trust somebody, and they get you.</span> <span id="s839">It’s just -- I don’t know how to --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: But I would think that even in the -- even in normal, every day life, you have circumstances where you could assume that somebody is trying to take advantage of you in one way or another.</span> <span id="s841">You know, it may not be a life or death kind of situation --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well yeah, well, if you -- if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: -- but it could be in a normal course of interaction, you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: -- you could have an attitude that everybody’s out to get you.</span> <span id="s846">That would be easy to assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Well, tha -- that’s -- no, I -- I don’t think I was in that way.</span> <span id="s848">Well, usually when you make a transaction with somebody, people mi -- we were trusting, we were given the wrong [indecipherable] the insurance man sell me insurance, and half of it weren’t true.</span> <span id="s849">The -- if you went to buy a car, they tell you lies, you know, this certain amount here of like salesmanship here, where people, they -- they say at [indecipherable] I got super salesman, and they got a super stupid people go in f-for the sales talk, I mean, you know?</span> <span id="s850">And a lot of time, people figured that you are -- this has nothing to do with it, but a lot of time people figured that you don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s851">To give you example, when there was a -- a -- a -- they were going -- like the president, there was between Nixon and Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: So me and my son took very much interest.</span> <span id="s854">We got a book from Kennedy, “Profiles of Courage,” and we read the paper, we even listen to [indecipherable] radio, and all that.</span> <span id="s855">Where I go to fix a TV, and there was a guy, he’s a president of this huge company.</span> <span id="s856">I think his name was West, or he live on West Avenue, he says, “Mr. Brodecki, when you finish working on TV, I want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s857">He was campaigning for Nixon.</span> <span id="s858">Okay, he not ask me if I know anything about it or not.</span> <span id="s859">So he says, “You sit down, I want to tell you so -- a little bit about Mr. Nixon.”</span> <span id="s860">So I played dumb, I said, “How did you know him, where did you meet him?</span> <span id="s861">Did you,” -- no, no, no.</span> <span id="s862">I said, “Did you go to school with him?”</span> <span id="s863">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s864">I say -- I didn’t tell him that I already knew more about it than he does.</span> <span id="s865">He was telling me -- he wanted to tell me all about Mr. Nixon, like I was -- I came out of the woods, so you got a lot of things like that here.</span> <span id="s866">Like you go look at the car, he says that’s the best car, and then you read the Consumer Reports, you know exactly who -- who -- what it is with that.</span> <span id="s867">A lot of people are just, you know, that way.</span> <span id="s868">A -- a woman ask me thi -- when I was working at Ward’s what’s the best television to buy.</span> <span id="s869">If I tell her, she buys something else.</span> <span id="s870">I say, “How come you did?”</span> <span id="s871">Oh, salesman told me that this is better.</span> <span id="s872">So you talk about trust, who is -- you trust, people -- you can not be knowledgeable on every field.</span> <span id="s873">So people will tell you stuff, and you believe it.</span> <span id="s874">But this is different kind of trust, during the war, where your life is in danger, you know, or your future.</span> <span id="s875">I mean there’s different degrees of trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: So, I don -- I know exactly what you’re asking, but I -- I don’t know how to answer it correctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Well, I don’t know what the right answer is, so I’m just throwing it out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: I don’t trust one area, but the other area, you’re too ignorant not to trust, do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I wou -- I wou -- what hit me when we came here is the -- the advertisement, when they were advertising cigarettes, every cigarette was the best, you know?</span> <span id="s882">Pall Mall was the special people’s smoke, and [indecipherable] is this, and that -- and we -- we didn’t -- we weren’t used to that kind of advertisement.</span> <span id="s883">It’s just like I was driving here one time a couple years ago, and -- and sees a lot of restaurants in Richmond.</span> <span id="s884">The Barkley Hotel dining room is above a mall.</span> <span id="s885">I went there, and I got lunch.</span> <span id="s886">That was the biggest bunch of garbage I ever had in my -- so who do you trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s888">Sometimes it’s hard for me to understand, though, how you could go through what you went through and still have a sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Well, I don’t know, but there was -- there was a lot of jokes during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: There was a Jewish woman, and she was cursing all day long, Hitler, then -- I hope you burn, I hope you drop dead, I hope this, I hope that, and continuously.</span> <span id="s892">So people say, “Why do you do that?”</span> <span id="s893">She says, “It’s always a moment when it comes true, and I don’t want to miss it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s895">I’ve her -- I’d like to ask you about when you came to the States, and you -- it was a Jewish organization that helped you get settled here.</span> <span id="s896">So I’m assuming that right away you had a chance to become part of a Jewish community here.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Y-Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s899">And I’m -- I’m wondering if you ever experienced a situation where American Jews didn’t understand what you’ve been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s902">A: I-I don’t know, you didn’t like it, but they didn’t -- first they didn’t be -- some of them didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s903">Other say well, what’s the big deal, a lot of people had trouble, Irish and Dutch, why I had to make a blow up about it.</span> <span id="s904">And well, you had to -- you had to understand that people rel -- regardless of religions, they grew up in this society.</span> <span id="s905">They even have Jews which are anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s906">I have a neighbor which is black, he hate niggers.</span> <span id="s907">I mean, he said they all crooked [indecipherable] so a -- a lot of people got their own opinions, they grew up in this environment, so when they -- why should they feel different than the next who is a Christian, unless they had some kind of education in that area?</span> <span id="s908">Those -- like we had a Yom HaShoah -- you know what that is?</span> <span id="s909">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s910">A Remembrance day.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: One of the Jewish fellas didn’t -- didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s912">I mean, acquaintances say, well where were you last night?</span> <span id="s913">Oh, I don’t believe in that stuff.</span> <span id="s914">And he was also a newcomer.</span> <span id="s915">He says people get killed here and there, why are the Jews making so much fuss about it, you know?</span> <span id="s916">So the people don’t understand that they grew up in different environments, it’s just that being Jewish is a religion, you might not even practice it.</span> <span id="s917">A -- a lot of people don’t come to any events, and so just being Jewish doesn’t mean that you know everything, or you got the same outlook like the other Jews, you know, there’s just a difference in people.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: You know, people -- was a amian lady -- you -- you know Armenia --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: -- was taken away from Russians.</span> <span id="s922">Between the Turks and the Russians, they did away with it.</span> <span id="s923">There’s a Armenian woman working in a thrift store here.</span> <span id="s924">You know, when they first come, they get the minor jobs, then they go -- and -- and we met a guy from Russia which is Jewish, he’s a Russian.</span> <span id="s925">So, it just a mentality.</span> <span id="s926">I was -- I stop now and then in thrift stores, some might pick up antique or something, so this Russians -- Russian walked in, so I said to the Armenian, which she -- I said is -- one of your friends is a Russian.</span> <span id="s927">She said, “He’s not a Russian, he’s a Jew.”</span> <span id="s928">So what no -- no matter what you do, you’re a Jew.</span> <span id="s929">You’re not American, you’re not a -- I had that happen, one day when I was in a automotive shop --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: -- and the guy said hey -- he’s also a Polack.</span> <span id="s932">So he said, “He’s not a Polack, he’s a Jew.”</span> <span id="s933">So wh-what you gonna do?</span> <span id="s934">There -- there was a joke with this, you hear that one?</span> <span id="s935">Where that drunk was in the -- and -- on the train, and he keeps saying that he hate Jews.</span> <span id="s936">So this Jewish fellow was sitting there, “And I hate drunks.”</span> <span id="s937">So finally the drunk got laughing, and he says, “Wh-Why are you laughing?”</span> <span id="s938">He said, “I’m laughing, I’ll be sober tomorrow, but you’ll still be a Jew.”</span> <span id="s939">So you -- you -- don’t make any difference, Hitler find out you great, great, great father has Jewish wife, so right away you -- you a Jew, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s940">So what are you gonna do about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: If you -- if you convert to Catholic, you know what they say?</span> <span id="s943">He’s a converted Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s945">I just -- I want to ask you if there’s -- if there’s anything you want to talk about, any subject that I didn’t bring up, that you think is important for you to mention?</span> <span id="s946">Some -- something about your experience, or your attitudes, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Well, I -- I really don’t know, you kind of exhaust the -- all the territory about the -- there’s not much I can say.</span> <span id="s948">There was a lot of incidents during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Like I told you about when I was trying to commit suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And there was other incidents.</span> <span id="s953">There was a couple things which I never understood, and this is a little spooky.</span> <span id="s954">I was dreaming a couple people in front of a bridge.</span> <span id="s955">Next day we were marching to Theresienstadt, and I see those two people, just like I had a dream exactly -- I don’t know what it means.</span> <span id="s956">A couple times I had a dream and the next day it kind of come -- come by me, just -- and I never understood how this come about, that you know ahead of time.</span> <span id="s957">So we’re telling here one time that a couple, all of sudden the guy got up at night, turned to his wife to come on.</span> <span id="s958">And they got in the car and went driving.</span> <span id="s959">Their kids got a accident somewhere miles away.</span> <span id="s960">Now this lady over there, we were resting on the bed upstairs, which we cannot see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s961">All of a sudden there’s a knock on the door, and she says, “Did you break your arm?”</span> <span id="s962">I said, “What in the hell are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s963">She ran down and opened the door, and my son walks in like that, he fell off the bicycle.</span> <span id="s964">And that’s a true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Yeah, she told me that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: She told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Let me ask you a broader question.</span> <span id="s970">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: I -- I know that your question didn’t have nothing to do with that answer, but I didn’t know how to get around to it, you just about exhausted the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Is it po-possible for you to -- after all these years it’s -- to come to grips with what happened to you, to understand it in any way that -- that you can explain to other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Ah, I un -- I understand your question, but what can I explain.</span> <span id="s974">I would talk about it all the time there should be tolerance, understanding, and [indecipherable] not everybody so perfect to be Mother Theresa, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Do you think that it could happen again, on that scale?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Do y-you remember what Santiana said, if you forget your past [indecipherable] will repeat itself.</span> <span id="s977">I -- I think that in the small scale, it’s happening every day, because if you look at the Africa, some European countries, Asia, there’s a holocaust against a lot of people.</span> <span id="s978">So it’s not on the scale it was in World War Two, but things are happening, and if -- if you don’t listen -- for example, we -- we tried to stop it like here they went to Iraq, and got Mr. Saddam Hussein Mr. Saddam Hussein would do like Hitler do, occupy lot of countries, he probably holocaust a lot of -- a lot of people.</span> <span id="s979">I don’t know, they -- they -- I cannot come to detail, but they -- they -- he pois -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s980">[blank] Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p>

id="s983">You were talking about Saddam Hussein.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yeah, well i-i-if -- if he wouldn’t be stopped, just like Blair said, the English prime minister, he say if we went on the wrong information about the weapons of mass destructions, and all, but there -- the future going to say that we did the right thing, because he was a villain.</span> <span id="s985">He was killing people, so we will be forgiven for that.</span> <span id="s986">But that would be a holocaust if he -- he start with Kuwait, and goes Adurabi -- Abudabi, all those little countries.</span> <span id="s987">He probably kill millions of people.</span> <span id="s988">And so the Holocaust didn -- didn’t end it.</span> <span id="s989">During the Holocaust -- it’s just -- you got small holocausts different places to different people.</span> <span id="s990">I don’t know, there’s some American history, Billy Jack, and all that stuff was going on over here.</span> <span id="s991">That wasn’t very

right.</span> <span id="s995">Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Like I see old American movies, and I see the sign in front of a -- a -- a restaurant that say, dogs and I-Irish are not allowed, you know?</span> <span id="s997">They didn’t discriminate against Chinese, who build the railroad from New York to California.</span> <span id="s998">I mean, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: They’re still in -- people, and it depends how many good people, how many bad people, the good people win, or the bad people win.</span> <span id="s1001">You know?</span> <span id="s1002">And if the bad people take over, you got another Holocaust, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Yeah, I do, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Even in your country -- it’s in Serbia over there, they were slaughtering people in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1006">It’s hard to s -- having -- being a survivor, what do you think that -- ho-how do you see the world as a result of that, and how does it -- how has it affected your life since the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Well, first of all, I’m glad I’m in United States.</span> <span id="s1008">Democracy, you know.</span> <span id="s1009">You can say things here where other countries you go to jail.</span> <span id="s1010">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1011">There’s freedom, and a lot of people take advantage of the freedom.</span> <span id="s1012">But in the -- y-y-you cannot take away the rights from people.</span> <span id="s1013">Where they got that here, anti-demafa -- Defamation League?</span> <span id="s1014">No one -- they might def -- defend Nazis and everything else because a free country.</span> <span id="s1015">But a -- I think things are getting better, and I think United States stopped the Nazis, and Saddam Hussein, and -- and -- and they’re in Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s1016">Whatever the -- the reason was, they made the world better.</span> <span id="s1017">Only thing I feel sorry for all those people get killed.</span> <span id="s1018">She tell you I go twice [indecipherable] to -- A2: Tell them it was your idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: -- to -- to the war memorial, and I put a wreath on it</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Which war memorial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: He-here -- here’s a war memorial, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: -- Richmond, World War Two, World War One, they got all the names all over, and I might be able to show you what I do, after the session.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: And you put a mem -- you put a wreath at the memorial for the -- it’s for -- for combat, for veterans?</span> <span id="s1025">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Because I feel bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1029">You feel bad about what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: I-I started off in Richmond -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: No, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s1032">Will you -- I wanted you to finish that thought.</span> <span id="s1033">You feel -- you do -- why do you do that?</span> <span id="s1034">Because you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Because a -- a -- wh-when we came here, and I didn’t know if United States would intervene in Europe, I might never see the -- time of the day, I might have been dead.</span> <span id="s1036">And all this, 50 - 60, or how many thousand American boys die, and I went to homes, fix the TV, and here’s a picture, on the top of TV of a G.I., and I say, “Who is that?”</span> <span id="s1037">“Well, my -- my son, he got killed in Europe.”</span> <span id="s1038">Or my father.</span> <span id="s1039">And I figured they’re looking at me like, you know, I’m still alive, and those -- I -- I just felt bad that those people volunteer [indecipherable] sacrifice their lives for the freedom here, which the average people on the street don’t understand that, that they owe somebody the liberties they get now.</span> <span id="s1040">Like today they dying in Baghdad every day.</span> <span id="s1041">So I just decided to take a part at remembrance.</span> <span id="s1042">And when we finish that, I [indecipherable] the wreath, I got it at home.</span> <span id="s1043">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1045">That’s great.</span> <span id="s1046">I want to ask you one more thing about your son’s involvement at the Holocaust museum, and what that means to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Well, that means a lot.</span> <span id="s1048">I mean, that he understand like h-he really got -- took interest in our family, then he went to Israel, and -- and he was a fundraiser that time, a-and he was in this house when they called him in, they couldn’t raise enough money for the museum.</span> <span id="s1049">He was awarded a United States -- so he went to work for the museum, and it was very difficult, but he says he wouldn’t quit, or trust anybody with the job.</span> <span id="s1050">And a -- and a woman who was dying, who want the museum to survive was Mr. Meyerhoff from Philadelphia, he put six million dollars for the museum.</span> <span id="s1051">And he did it for his wife, I think sh -- I don’t know if she was a newcomer, and he called Joe here, and Joe took the job.</span> <span id="s1052">And he finished the job, he was -- you’re going to see a Wallenberg there -- oh, on 14th Street, and in front, Joseph Michael Brodecki, National Campaign director.</span> <span id="s1053">But what happened after Clinton was elected, a lot of jobs were appointed by the government, see?</span> <span id="s1054">The people who started the museum, they were out, they appoint other people.</span> <span id="s1055">You know, which were democrats, I think.</span> <span id="s1056">But anyway, he finish his job, so he went to work for Apec, that’s where he got the picture with the Jewish president.</span> <span id="s1057">But he stay there for about a year, but he didn’t like, because he said it was affected by local politics, like democrats, or republicans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: And that was above helping Israel and oh -- so then finally he quit that, but he’s now with the st -- brokerage company in -- in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1061">A: I think he started off, it’s just a big, big, big company.</span> <span id="s1062">They never advertise.</span> <span id="s1063">So that’s the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: So there’s a Brodecki name right on the front of the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yeah, you gonna see the [indecipherable] I don’t think they took it off, because that’s the original people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: It’s Joseph Michael Brodecki, National Campaign Director.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: He was going all over the country, every time he called me, I says, “Where you at?”</span> <span id="s1070">“Well, I’m San Francisco.”</span> <span id="s1071">“Where you at?”</span> <span id="s1072">“I’m Los Angeles.”</span> <span id="s1073">I mean, he was gone 24 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1075">Tough job, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Well thank you, thanks a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A:
