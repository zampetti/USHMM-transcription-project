id="s92">Where is – where, let’s say, would you say is her roots?</span> <span id="s93">Where – what part of the country, and do you – did you visit this farm, did you know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Oh yes, yes, I know that farm –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: – it’s – it’s in southwestern Lithuania, which is called Šeduva, and between two small villages – well, more than villages, towns I would call, between Pilnuskai(ph) and Kazlų Rūda, and you know, a nice farm there.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How many acres, do you think, or hectares would it have been?</span> <span id="s98">A: S-S-Something about 30 hectares, maybe some – some – somewhat more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: And my father also comes from farming family, but strangely it – he lived in a town.</span> <span id="s101">They had land – well, he lived in a town, but they had land outside, and they farmed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: What was the towns name that he lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Užpaliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Užpaliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: That’s in – in a different part of Lithuania, it is north – northeastern part of Lithuania, called owsh -- Owshnatia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And what would be the lar – it – what larger city or town would Užpaliai be close to?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, Utena is –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Utena.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: – in that vicinity of center there, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s111">And, so both of your parents actually come from farming families?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: How did it – how was it that your father had a university education?</span> <span id="s114">Cause that wasn’t very common in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s116">Really, I don’t know why th – it was decided that he would have all that e-ed-education.</span> <span id="s117">I just know that, you know, some relatives of that – of my father’s family were living in Saint Petersburg and working in factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: So they decided that, well, this student could live with the relatives and go to school, instead of going to school somewhere in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s120">There were a few high schools in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s121">Instead of that he went to the same Saint Petersburg, and there was a gymnasium, so-called, high school, which was called Saint Catherine’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: It was a Catholic, which was unusual, supported by the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: By the Russian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: By the Russian government, because there were a lot of – Saint Petersburg was the capital –</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: – so there were a lot of diplomatic personnel who – Catholics, Italians, some Germans, you know, and spin – Spanish boys who went to that school.</span> <span id="s128">And well, of course, a lot of from the Russian empire also; Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So in some ways he got an international exposure –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: – from a country that didn’t have its – or from a place, it wasn’t a country at the time, a state at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: In a way that most of the people of his generation wouldn’t have had by going to such a high school gymnasium in Saint Petersburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Of course it was an advantage, and he was well th – he-he-he – he was aware of that, and you know, he had had that thi –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Did you feel that –</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: – [indecipherable] of that issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s138">Excuse me that I interrupted.</span> <span id="s139">Did you feel that kind of international horizon as you were growing up in your family, that your father had such a – such a world view?</span> <span id="s140">Or would you say there wouldn’t really be such a connection from when you – because this is all before you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s142">Yeah, I think, well, that generally he knew languages, and so read various – in various languages, in German, in Russian, in Polish.</span> <span id="s143">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So, he spoke all those languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: He spoke all those languages, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: In ge – in German he was sil – still studying, perfecting it, reading German just to keep, you know, to learn the language more ca – more fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: But the Russian and Polish, of course, he knew full of – fluently from his – from his days in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s151">So we – you could say he spoke four languages; Lithuanian, Russian, Polish and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Which my mother didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: She spoke Lithuanian only?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: She spoke Lithuanian, then she learned German, but well, she knew some Russian.</span> <span id="s159">She could converse, you know, but not very fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did – did this make a difference in your family as you were growing up, that your mother had not had the same opportunities, and so the same ability to – to grow intellectually as your father had had?</span> <span id="s161">Did they have – yeah, did that make a difference between them in how they understood things?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: No, not – not in this – no, that was no problem because my mother was quite an active woman, and she learned whatever she could, things, you know.</span> <span id="s163">And I don’t think that the people could say that she didn’t have that much formal education.</span> <span id="s164">She had – she read a lot and she learned from the people she – sh-she met.</span> <span id="s165">Her brothers were quite advanced also in the independent Lithuania, and helped our family.</span> <span id="s166">For instance –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: In what way – how were they advanced?</span> <span id="s168">What would you mean – mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Well, for instance, my – my uncle, my mother’s oldest brother was quite – was a secretary for the – for the lawyer in Vilnius</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: – which later became the president of Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: The lawyer’s name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Smetona.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Antanas Smetona.</span> <span id="s176">And so he had that relationship, he knew people and all that kind of thing and helped hold the family, really, by –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Through these connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: – through his connections, including my father’s family.</span> <span id="s179">For instance, he was in Tauragė, that’s why – my what – my father went to Tauragė because he was there working.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Your uncle –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: My uncle was a county – like county commissioner –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: – of Tauragė, and could help, you know, with the people, my – my family there, before I was born.</span> <span id="s184">And the other uncles also, the other – the other one was an educator, th-then he was a director of the high school, and the other was a lawyer, and then became a – an attorney, a state attorney.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Estate?</span> <span id="s186">That means like for –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A:

in that fam – family, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: So they came from a farming family, but they became professionals?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: I see, and fri – did your father have siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes, he had two – two – two – they were both farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: They were both

thing that as a new country, did Lithuania adopt the old Russian Imperial legal system, and that’s why it would have been useful?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes, yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span

Tauragė.</span> <span id="s268">There was no – none high school in Skodvilla(ph), so I went back to Tauragė and lived with some other people, and my parents thought that –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Would this – excuse me, this would have been middle school?</span> <span id="s270">At age 10 would you have been joining high school, or would have been later –</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Well, in the Lithuanian system, what they called a – was a grammar school for four years, and then a – there was what they call high school, which was called gymnasium for eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: And that was th – th-the – the education, and so I – I went with that so-called gymnasium to the first class in Tauragė, but my parents thought that th-that arrangement was very unsatisfactory.</span> <span id="s274">He requested that he would be transferred to a – the larger city where I could live with my family.</span> <span id="s275">And so he took again, he took, instead of being a judge he took again th-the previous position of prosecutor – assistant prosecutor I would call, in Panevėžys, which was a larger city, not much more sophisticated than Tauragė.</span> <span id="s276">Tauragė was sophisticated town.</span> <span id="s277">I di –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: What made it sophisticated?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: It was very near to the German city, Tilžė, and there was a lot of traffic between Tauragė and Tilžė, and the so-called Lithuania Minor, or Klaipėdos kraštas was also very near Tauragė, just a few kilometers away, and the relationship with that German influence, German cultural influenced area, you know, had an effect on Tauragė also.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did it – this re – leads me to a question I was also thinking about.</span> <span id="s281">As you were growing up, your very earliest years, did you sense that there were others in Tauragė who were not Lithuanian?</span> <span id="s282">Did you – you know, did you know of other nationalities, other groups of people, and – who made up the population of Tauragė?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Was quite mixed.</span> <span id="s284">Of course, there was a Jewish people.</span> <span id="s285">There were Lithuanian people who were Catholics, and there were Lithuanian people who were lu – Lutheran Protestants, about the same amount, half and half Lithuanians in – in that area.</span> <span id="s286">And that –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Were there Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No, they were not German – and there were Germans also in –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: – in Tauragė.</span> <span id="s291">So – and we were aware of that, but it-it wasn’t a cause of any hostility in – at all, you know, we –</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Were there Poles in Tauragė?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: So the population would have been made up of these – were there any Russians in Tauragė?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Maybe a family or two, but very few, if any.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So you would hav – i-if I were to describe Tauragė at the time when you were born and the first 10 years of your life, was a city that was made up of Lithuanians of both Catholic and Lutheran religion – religious affiliations –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: – of – of Jews, and of Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Ethnic Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Who predominated in the town?</span> <span id="s307">Which group do you think had the greatest group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Lithuanians, but were about – Ca-Catholics and Protestants were about the same, about even.</span> <span id="s309">When we went to our cla – [clears throat] in our gymnasium – in gymnasium in the first class, when the religions – religion was one of the subjects which you had to take, and when the religion subject came up, I mean, th-the class just fell in – in – in half.</span> <span id="s310">Half of that was Protestant, went to their class, and the others were Catholics and about – about even, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: You went to a public school, supported by the state?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Were there religious classes for people who were not Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Not in Tauragė, but in Panevėžys, yes, but they were not that – there were, you know, some, but they were not that regular.</span> <span id="s315">They had their – their religion ins – instruction of their religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Whoever else though would be – it could be Jewish, it could be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, Jewish.</span> <span id="s318">It – that was – there was no noticing – there was O-Orthodox –</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Orthodox Karayim.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Which was very s-s-strange, I mean a small national and religious group.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: They had their – their religious sa – lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: You said that Tauragė was sophisticated in – a great deal because there was a German influence –</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: – very close by.</span> <span id="s328">It would have been probably what was Prussia, no – you know that –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: – for more than most part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And that there were friendly relations.</span> <span id="s333">But if I – if I try to kind of follow the dates, you say you were born in 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: You lived there until you were 10 years old, so that would have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: – ‘33.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: 1933 is when the Nazis come to power in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And – and you were 10 years old, so maybe it’s unfair to ask, but I will ask anyway, did you – do you think something changed after the Nazis came to power in ’33, with German relations in the town, in Tauragė and in the region in general, was there any friction that developed, was there any – anything that changed in that?</span> <span id="s342">Did it – you think it had an influence at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: We had an influence but I am not aware of any increased friction.</span> <span id="s344">There was influence.</span> <span id="s345">The Jewish people were very much concerned, and the Lithuanian people, because the Germans became quite aggressive in – in Klaipėda area, which was –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What was Klaipėda?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: What is Klaipėda?</span> <span id="s349">What is Klaipėda?</span> <span id="s350">Gi – it’s a f –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Klaipėda is, oh, Klaipėda is the – is a – a haven city of – of Lithuania, a port city.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: It’s a port city.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: A port city of Lithuania and the third in the size on – in the country.</span> <span id="s354">The capital city Vilnius is first, Kaunas second, and Klaipėda is the third.</span> <span id="s355">And at that time in Klaipėda was, I think the majority of the population in Klaipėda city, a majority may be German about that time.</span> <span id="s356">In the countryside not so.</span> <span id="s357">In the countryside Lithuanians pre-predominated, but they were also very much influenced by the German culture through it – through centuries, really, they were under the German rule there.</span> <span id="s358">And the – during the – when the Nazis came to power, they became very aggressive in that area.</span> <span id="s359">They wanted to – it was part of the Germany before the first World War, and the Germany wanted to recover that territory, and they very – b-became very aggressive against the Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s360">So we were aware of that, that there was a hostile force right next to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Were they close to each other, Tauragė and Klaipėda?</span> <span id="s362">As – as –</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Klaipėda not so c-close, but the Klaipėda area, Klaipėda territory was quite near.</span> <span id="s364">I don’t know how many kilometers, maybe seven, eight kilometers from the Klaipėda area, which was au-autonomous area which had, you know, their own laws, German laws, and their th – bo-both languages were official, Lithuanian and German.</span> <span id="s365">And so we became that Lithuania is now Lithuanian – Lithuanian character and Lithuanian rule and Lithuania is under attack, under – under pressure when the – when – when Hitler took over in Germany, right there, because before that there was no such hostility.</span> <span id="s366">But in Tauragė the German population, as far as I know were quite loyal to the Lithuania and there were no fric – friction I am aware between Germans and Lithuanians in Tauragė itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And were there discuss – do you remember any kinds of discussions about this wider political context that you just talked about at home?</span> <span id="s368">Do you – I mean, I’m – I’m again trying to look through the eyes of a 10 year old boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: How much of this would have been in the atmosphere, how much would it have been talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Well, a lot, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: A lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: In the family and outside the family with the f-friends o-of – of my family, you know, the other families, which were –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you remember such discussions taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, yes, and well – well, so – one thing about – well, this is out of the time frame, but I was surprised when I came to Lithuania and I asked about some Germans now, after Lithuania became independent, I went to Tauragė.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And what year was this?</span> <span id="s377">Just to establish what we’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Okay, so 1990, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: In 1990 I went to Tauragė, my – I went with the local Lutheran bishop there.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: And his wife was from Tauragė, and she told me about all those people I knew, you know, and all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s383">And I was surprised that th – most – one of the richest people in Tauragė was German, and he was an authority of the German community in Tauragė.</span> <span id="s384">And I was surprised that he didn’t go to Germany when the Germans had the chance to go to Germany ah – when the Soviets took over the li – Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: After the end of the war you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, before this –</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Oh, I see, there’s ger – okay.</span> <span id="s388">Before –</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Before the war, wha – when the Soviets took over Lithuania –</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: The first ti –</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: – they had an agreement with Germany that the German na-nash – German, ethnic Germans could go to Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: – to leave Lithuania.</span> <span id="s394">And I was surprised to know that he, that German, didn’t go to – to – to – to – to Germany, because he was so hostile against Hitler, and the Nazis knew that, that for him to go to the – to Germany would be to go to – directly to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s395">So he just stayed there with his family, and of course was deported to Siberia.</span> <span id="s396">And – and I think that he died in Siberia, but his children, his – his daughter, he had three daughters, they came back to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Would have he been deported – we’re jumping ahead of ourselves a little bit, but do you think he would have been deported after the war, or during the first Soviet occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: During first Soviet occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And why?</span> <span id="s402">Because he was German?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: [indecipherable] if – well, the – the Soviets considered such people spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No matter, that – that was enough, that he was German, so he was a spy in their eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What about the Jewish population, was it a large Jewish population in Tauragė?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s410">Well, about a third of the p-population I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Maybe more, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s414">Did you know anybody who was Jewish?</span> <span id="s415">Did you have any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yes, yes, I had a friend for awhile, but they moved out later, so you know, and then I didn’t have any Jewish friends after he moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What was his name, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: I don’t remember now, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Okay, do you remember anything about him?</span> <span id="s420">How old – how old were you when he was your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Six, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Oh, so you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s425">Did your family have any interaction with – with Jews, either in a professional way, in a personal way?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Both, but infrequently.</span> <span id="s427">Since my father was working in his capacity as an assistant prosecutor, I would say the young students, after they graduated from the law school in Lithuania had to, if they wanted to work in the court system – but also, if they would like to become lawyers, they had to go through a – some practice in various capacities.</span> <span id="s428">So my father always had some young, just graduated young man or – or ladies, one of – of them was – was a lady, who just went through the practice several months – well, not a year maybe, maybe a year, I don’t know exactly what the term was.</span> <span id="s429">So some of them were Jewish, and I remember ra – you know, Mr. toris -- Terispolstis(ph), wh-who was practicing with my father, and also had, you know, just a relation.</span> <span id="s430">He visited us and I remember him very well, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: What was he like, do you remem – what do you remember of –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Oh, very friendly and funny young man.</span> <span id="s433">Well, I liked him very much, and well, I do – I didn’t want to go into small incidents like that, but there was, you know, I was about five years old, I think.</span> <span id="s434">I don’t remember it very well, but they tell me that I found my father’s pistol, and I took that – that pistol and I went through wh-where my father’s office was, and where Mr. Terispolstis(ph) was working.</span> <span id="s435">My father was not in the office, he was on some – I don’t know, some errand.</span> <span id="s436">And so I went to Mr. Terispolstis(ph) and said, look what I found, you know, and showed the pistol.</span> <span id="s437">And he said, oh, that’s nice.</span> <span id="s438">Just s-show it to me.</span> <span id="s439">And he just jumped, you know, on me, because he was afraid that the, you know, stupid kid –</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: It could be loaded, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: – that yeah, it could be loaded, and – and he took that pistol away.</span> <span id="s442">Well, I was kind of shocked, but then everybody was telling that story, and so it gav – kind of became a hero in the story, and I – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: You don’t know if it was loaded, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: You don’t know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Your p – let me ask something else, di – i – your parents – you were an only child.</span> <span id="s448">Do you consider yourself that you were close to your parents?</span> <span id="s449">Were you a close knit family, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes, yes, I was.</span> <span id="s451">In particular – well, no, when I was small with my mother, but when I was growing up, I became very close to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What – in what ways would you describe that closeness?</span> <span id="s453">Did he – did you discuss –</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, we discuss things of – various things, whatever.</span> <span id="s455">And he sometimes took some educational things, you know, told me about finance, about his work, about the problems they have, or – well, they had s – he had some arithmetical exercises, some arithmetical puzzles which he – that was educational, so – so he spent time with me, and we – we were very, very, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What would – how would you describe him as a person?</span> <span id="s457">What kind of personality did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Well, he was out – very outgoing, yeah, with a – with a lot – lot of humor.</span> <span id="s459">And very patriotic Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Those were his values?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Was he religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes, he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And may I ask what was the religion, was it Lutheran or was it Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: It was Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: It was Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: He was a Catholic, yes.</span> <span id="s468">My mother was also a Catholic, but he – she became religious when she became old, but – well, she was religious, but not – not to the extent my father was.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s470">And yourself, were you – did you go – were you s – did you go to any religious classes outside of what was offered in the school, or required in – in school system?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Not – not under – u-until the Soviet occupation, when the co – of course religious instruction was abolished, and there were outside and in the churches they had some educational lectures, discussions, something like that.</span> <span id="s472">Just then.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Before that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I’m jumping back a little bit.</span> <span id="s476">Do you know of a – anything of what happened to Mr. Telipolskis(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Do you have any other memories of the Jewish community in Tauragė, or anybody that you would have known from there, or who had interaction with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: N-Not – I know my father, you know, was interacting with some, and some – with some Jewish people, some – some lawyers and doctors, but they were not that close, they didn’t come to visit us, or – I – I d – I don’t know much about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Were there any discussions at home that you remember as a child and growing up, about who the Jews were?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: What – what was usually said?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Mostly it was in connection with the religious differences, and with the discussion about the – a Holy Bible, the Jewish Torah and the Catholic interpretations of that.</span> <span id="s486">You know, something like that.</span> <span id="s487">You see, I had a c – a cousin from my father’s s-side, my father’s oldest brother had a ch – a son, older than myself, who became a Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s488">So – and he visited our family quite often for awhile, he lived with us, but not for su – but – he was no – th-that time i-in – in th – high school, but later he became a c – a Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s489">And he visited us and there was a lot of religious discussion also going on with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And what kind of – I mean, the religious discussion can – can be very broad.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: It can be both subtle, and it can be very simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: And wa – were there – how would you characterize these discussions?</span> <span id="s495">Were they of real interpretation of what the Bible was and what the Torah was, or were they more sort of the kind of, you know, a more simple interpretations?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, I would s – I – I would sel – I would say b-both.</span> <span id="s497">It was – but when – when – when my cousin became a priest and I was a teenager, I think – a-and – and my father also joined those discussions, I think they were – they were quite, quite advanced in – and – and in – it was not a primitive thing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So what were the – what was the nature of them?</span> <span id="s499">What a – what are the kinds of comparisons that would be made?</span> <span id="s500">If you can remember, you know, in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, first recall s – discussion about – about God itself, whether – whether you know, believing or not believing, and then, you know, going – going f – well, tha-that was not – it had nothing with the Jewish, it was generally.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Whether there is a supreme being, you know, and cause of everything, of existence of the world.</span> <span id="s504">And as far as the Holy Bible is concerned, of course, the question about the Christ, about his importance and what – what – who was he real – really, Jesus from Nazareth.</span> <span id="s505">So those – those things were, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: How was that answered?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, of course, in a Catholic way, you know, that he was a per-person – a divine person.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And I guess what I’m trying to –</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Part of the divinity, something like – yeah, something in th – in that way.</span> <span id="s510">But it was discussed, it wasn’t discussed in which way, you know, what – what proves that, why we – do we believe it li-like this or something.</span> <span id="s511">It was not something given, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s513">And in what way was there – what was the Jewish element in this discussion, in these types of religious discussions?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, they are part of the Catholic – Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s515">My – my cousin told once, you know, or even several times that, you know, that there are some elements in Catholic liturgy which was saved from the old-time Jewish customs and – and – and which the Jews, the rabbinical Jews have lost.</span> <span id="s516">So even that the Catholics have something from the older Jewish religions, it was not ant – anti Jewish at all like its – itself, it was a discussion of the relationship of the Jewish religion and the Catholic religion – well, Christian religion, which really split off from – from the Judaism, and why did they split off, and – well, of course they then – the – the person of Jesus of Nazareth comes into that.</span> <span id="s517">That’s why you know, and what he – what was his message basically, and why did they had to split from the Jewish what – what the Jews had rejected and the Catholics accepted – I mean Christians accepted.</span> <span id="s518">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Well, you know, there have been religious discussions about Jewish influence on Christian religions that – that were very broadly accepted in – in many populations, Catholic populations of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: – Jews killed Christ.</span> <span id="s522">And this was trying – this was part of what I was trying to get at –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: – was that something that was part of such discussions and an interpretation in such way, it was, you know, a sense of did – not necessarily within your own family, but in the larger community, when Jews were discussed, was that something that would come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: I don’t know in the larger community because tha-that type of discussions were kind of inside of the family.</span> <span id="s526">Rarely, you know, sometimes we talk with other priests.</span> <span id="s527">It was not subject which people would just meet and start discussing like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Did – yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: And – but in my family in particular when – when my – my cousin became a priest, you know, those things came up regularly.</span> <span id="s530">And there was, yes – well, there is something in – in – in the gospels which calls about the je – y-you know, the Jewish people demanding that Jesus from Nazareth would be executed.</span> <span id="s531">You know, and there was something of that.</span> <span id="s532">But it – my cousin, my – my – my cousin also, he was a Catholic priest, had no hostility against the Jews as such.</span> <span id="s533">He was also interested and fascinating i-in relationship and in – in the common heritage with the Jews.</span> <span id="s534">So, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s538">I – I – I wanted to get a sense of the nature of these type – with th – the nature, the – the questions that were – that were raised, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: In my family, I – I would say there was not much religious or ethnical prejudice against neither the Jews, nor Germans, except the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Somehow in my family, the Poles, th-they just – they just couldn’t stand them.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And why not?</span> <span id="s543">Why do think that was the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Because of the – of the – of this whole relationship which re-resulted in the Polish army seizing the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: And my father was at that time in the Lithuanian army, and my mother was in Vilnius in – in the foreign industry of Lithuania, had to flee from the advancing Polish army, and you know, th-the – th-they took it personally, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Whey didn’t – they didn’t take any – any other, you know … any other relations, inter – inter-ethnical relations, they didn’t think – ta-take, you know, with any hostility at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: But with the Poles, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s552">Okay.</span> <span id="s553">We – we might come to that point, to w-wider explanation of this.</span> <span id="s554">Let’s get to Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: When you are in Panevėžys, and your father has taken the same position that he had –</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: In Tauragė.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: – in Tauragė –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: – so that the family could be together, and you would be able to go to school and be at home and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And you are how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: About 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: About 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And how long did you live in Panevėžys?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Oh, until I went to the university in Vilnius, so it’s – it was in 1941.</span> <span id="s568">Eight years, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: About eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So it’s from 1934 to 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: What kind of a place was Panevėžys?</span> <span id="s576">If we talk about – you know, I asked about Tauragė, what was its make-up, how would you describe Panevėžys?</span> <span id="s577">How different, or similar?</span> <span id="s578">Wh-What – what was this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: For – for me it was – it was different.</span> <span id="s580">And I came from Tauragė and I felt superior, because it seemed to me like it’s much less sophisticated city, much less sophitis – sophisticated school, and much less sophisticated friends I had in my scho – in my school, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: So I felt, you know – you know, a loss of Tauragė, you know?</span> <span id="s583">The interesting sophisticated city.</span> <span id="s584">Now, there were – there were some Germans in – in pen – in Panevėžys, but really few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: There were some Poles, there some Russians, which didn – we didn’t have in Tauragė.</span> <span id="s587">So ethnic – ethnic – you know, was completely different.</span> <span id="s588">There were a lot of Jews in – in – in Panevėžys, and there was a very small community, but influential, and a community of Karayims.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Tell us what are Karayims.</span> <span id="s590">Who are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Karayims are – it seems like they are of Turkish descent.</span> <span id="s592">Their language is similar to Turkish language.</span> <span id="s593">Racially they look like, you know, like Turks or Tartars, but religiously they are Jews.</span> <span id="s594">They are Jews, but they do not accept the talmu – Talmudic Judaism.</span> <span id="s595">They just accept Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: And refuse to co – you know, to accept any other authorities outside of Torah, any you know, rabbi’s interpretations, Talmudian [indecipherable], they just reject that.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: And the Jews consider them co – you know, ra – I think that Jews didn’t consider them really Jews at all.</span> <span id="s600">They dom – do not consider themselves rabbinical Jews.</span> <span id="s601">Th-There is a hoso – there was some hostility between Jews and Karayims.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: And yet they were in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s603">They somehow or other had –</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: – arrived there, come there.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well, they were brought here, ye – to Lithuania, all this – going through old – old history, but Lithuania’s ruler, Vytautas the Great –</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: – on his – when he was ruling Lithuania, Lithuania was really an empire because took a lot of territory up to the Black Sea, and he went to the Crimea, and in Crimea there was that Karayim community.</span> <span id="s609">And he brought several families, I think 40 or more families to Lithuania with the purpose that they would be his personal guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: You see, they’re outside.</span> <span id="s612">They’re complete outsiders.</span> <span id="s613">They just rely on the grand dukes of Lithuania and he i-is guarding them.</span> <span id="s614">He couldn’t trust Lithuanians because there were, you know, well, there were some of his friends, but there was friends of his cousin, who was his rival, and all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s615">The cris – Lithuania was becoming Christian, there were still old pagans, who didn’t like the ca – so he – he thought that he’d better rely on the people who nobody could even communicate with at the beginning.</span> <span id="s616">Well later they learned, of course, Lithuanian language, but – but still, they were – and they worship his memory even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Because they –</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: 500 – 600 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s621">And they were living in Trakai where Vytautas was mostly residing and they had, you know, the duty to – to protect the castle, go to the guard duty in castle.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: So there was thi – such a small but influential community in Panevėžys as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: How they came to Panevėžys, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Because they were di –</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Describe just a little bit about your high school years.</span> <span id="s629">What kind of a high school was it, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Really, really, my first impression was wrong, the high school was very good, you know, and compared with other Lithuanian high schools was wa – ca – was not the first, maybe – well, of course it wasn’t the first, the first was [indecipherable] the most ad-advanced.</span> <span id="s631">But – but it was a very good school, and had very good teachers, and – in most of the subjects.</span> <span id="s632">And the people were friendly, and so I enjoyed that – that, very much, you know.</span> <span id="s633">I was a poor student, because my father send me to grammar school one year earlier.</span> <span id="s634">Usually i-it started at seven, he sent me at six.</span> <span id="s635">And I was not a good student, neither in Tauragė, nor in Panevėžys, until the fi – my fifth class, fifth year class where I w-was left for a year, you know, to repeat the course in – in that school, because my mathematics we-were not good.</span> <span id="s636">Of course I was also sick, I missed classes, and so I was le – let to repeat the course in the – in the first ye – fifth year.</span> <span id="s637">And that helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s638">After that I became a good su – student.</span> <span id="s639">So my father overestimated me.</span> <span id="s640">I was just an average, exactly as – as – I am – I am not –</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: As you were supposed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s644">And do you remember what kind of atmosphere there was in these – 30’s, in this town, Panevėžys, about how many people did it have at that time?</span> <span id="s645">Was it – yes, it was a city I believe you told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yeah, about to – I would say, 30,000 maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Maybe more, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Or it will be more, would be more, m-maybe 40,000, close to 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So in – in those terms for such a small country it’s not inconsequential.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s656">What – what do you remember from those high school years, both personally, and what was going on in the wider society?</span> <span id="s657">What kind of discussions, what kind of events?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Well, it was rather quiet years until – until the situation in Lithuania became dangerous, and the first ultimatum, the Polish ultimatum came through, you know, and then the people are aware that the country is in danger.</span> <span id="s659">And then, of course, was a lot of discussion and concern, and taking positions and such like – like that.</span> <span id="s660">But general – the relationship between nationalities – well, I said taura – Tauragė there were no – no – no hostility.</span> <span id="s661">While in Panevėžys definitely there was, because there was a Polish gymnasium also.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: And there were Poles in – in – in – in Panevėžys, and that was already the host – ho-hostile element, because they were considered disloyal to Lithuanian state.</span> <span id="s664">Maybe they were not, but the Lithuanians looked at them thi – with – with suspicion that they might be disloyal.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Were there any – were there incidents that would have fed into this, or was this just the general accepted point of view?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No, there were no particular incidents, but there were na – th – our – the young people, the teenagers, Lithuanian, Polish, we didn’t fight or anything like that, but we ignored each other, mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Sometimes I had some discussion with them, but discussions –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Did you know anybody personally who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Oh, I met one of them, but no, no, no, I didn’t have any friends in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s672">The – and in – can you repeat just a little bit, if it would be – or – or explain just a little bit, what’s the essence, it was a – was it th-the takeover of Vilnius that was the reason why there was this friction, or was there something more to it, was it a broader, deeper, longer lasting –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Well, we – we – we had the suspicion that the Poles generally were against the Lithuanian state.</span> <span id="s674">That we – they wanted to recreate the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth.</span> <span id="s675">But in the modern times we were susp – sus – suspecting that they just wanted a – to annex Lithuania and – and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: And we felt that they denied, you know, the Lithuanians, in their mind that they were denying our right as – as a nation to keep our own state with our own capital, historical capital.</span> <span id="s678">And that – that was the hostility.</span> <span id="s679">Now, it was quite clear I never, you know, th – even thought about that, that between Lithuanians and Poles – b-between the young people, the teenagers who went to different gymnasium, that between those gymnasiums there were no – no relationship really.</span> <span id="s680">But I don’t know why there was no relationship with the Jewish j – schools which were in – in Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: There were no relations.</span> <span id="s683">We had some Jews who went to Lithuanian school, and wa – by class, you know, classmates.</span> <span id="s684">But – and we were fine, we were friends, we were o-okay.</span> <span id="s685">But the relationship between the Jewish gy-gymnasium and Poland – and Lithuanian gymnasium was just nonexistent.</span> <span id="s686">And I don’t know at – even now I couldn’t explain why it was so, because there was no such hostility at all, and Lithuanians considered Jews, you know, the Jews also supported Lithuanian claim to Vilnius usually, the great majority, I wouldn’t know about all but ye – th-the great majority was supporting that.</span> <span id="s687">And they [indecipherable] Lithuania recovered Vilnius, the Jewish community was – was quite friendly, and wh-while the Polish, of course, people were very hostile.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: So, let’s take – let’s start with the years that – le-let’s go up to these years where things start to get tense.</span> <span id="s689">And you’re saying the first one was when – had to do with the Polish Lithuanian relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Right, 19 eight –</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: – 1938, the – Poland demanded that Lithuania take up the diplomatic and – and economic rel-relations with Poland, which would –</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Which it hadn’t had until –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Which Lithuania didn’t have after – after Vilnius, you know, was like a completely – there were complete – complete l – l – no communication between Lithuania and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: And Vilnius had been occupied or taken over at what – what year?</span> <span id="s696">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Nineteen – so for 18 years there had been no diplomatic relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Right, right, and the Poles demanded and demanded, you know, with ultimatum.</span> <span id="s700">That means, if not, there would be war.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: And Lithuania accepted that.</span> <span id="s703">The Poles didn’t require that Lithuania renounce Vilnius as a – or – or renounce, you know, Lithuanian claim to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s704">It didn’t mention Vilnius at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: It mentioned the relationship.</span> <span id="s707">But still Lithuanians felt that it was demeaning, that it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Why do you think that they even – 1938 would have been motivated by it?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Well, we suspected that they always want to take over Lithuania eventually.</span> <span id="s710">That’s one thing.</span> <span id="s711">But at that time, Poland considers itself a great power in Europe and Germany just took over Austria and Poland wanted compensation as a great power, you know, so at least, you know, they – they took this step against Lithuania to showing that they are also – can act, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: So this was the – this was how it was perceived basically, in – in Panevėžys, in Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s716">And – and it is right.</span> <span id="s717">Now we know, you know, the backgrounds and so, and basically that was – what was [indecipherable] at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: I just drew a blank.</span> <span id="s719">I think maybe we should change tape here.</span> <span id="s720">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Algimantas Gureckas on October 14th, 2010.</span> <span id="s724">Mr. Gureckas, I wanted to continue our – our discussion about – about the rising tensions in – in your world, in Panevėžys, in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s725">And we were talking about the Polish Lithuanian relationship.</span> <span id="s726">As you’re speaking, I’m thinking, how much of this did a 15 year old boy know, because that’s how old you were in 1938; how much of this was discussed at home?</span> <span id="s727">How much do you – can you remember that you knew of it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Well, a lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s729">It affected everybody, affected my family, you know, and so also affected me.</span> <span id="s730">I also felt, you know, that Poles were – were trying, you know, somehow, you know, to show our superior – their – their superior powers, or their superior might against a smaller country, and didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s731">Didn’t like it at all.</span> <span id="s732">Although I was skeptical at that time about Vilnius, you know.</span> <span id="s733">I thought well, you know, we are no-not going to recover Vilnius ever.</span> <span id="s734">I didn’t tell anybody not – not that my father, nor – nor my mother, nor – nor my friends.</span> <span id="s735">But I thought wow, that’s – that’s an unrealistic, we might as well forget about it.</span> <span id="s736">But – but this was then a Polish ultimatum, the Polish demand, you know.</span> <span id="s737">It still hurt.</span> <span id="s738">Still hurt very much, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: I want to also kind of make a remark is, as I’m listening to you, you’re saying that these events, which are political –</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: – in nature, which are intra-governmental, nevertheless affected your family a great deal, and I take it to mean affected in a sense of not in a personal way that their lives changed from one day to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: But their feelings, their – their s – their senses and so on were affect – and that speaks to me of – of people who were engaged in a civic process.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Because there could have been people who live in a country, as there are today in the United States, and as there are all over the world –</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: – who – whose world consists of, I go to work in the morning, I do my job, I come home, I have no interest in – in politics, or in what goes around me.</span> <span id="s748">I can’t affect it anyway, and what happens in Washington, what happens in Moscow, is none of my affair, okay?</span> <span id="s749">And clearly that was not the dynamic going on in the cir – in the – in the circle of people that you grew up with.</span> <span id="s750">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s752">That’s true, I – I – I s – I – I am sure that there were such people, such people are disinterested in – in – in politics, interethnic relationships, and so I am sure there were so, but that was not in our – in – in our circle, in our family, in the friends m-my family had.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And why would you – how would you explain their engagement then?</span> <span id="s754">How would you explain their engagement to events that really are outside and beyond their personal lives?</span> <span id="s755">By that – still at that point, I mean at some point history doesn’t im-impact, but how would you explain this interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: In – in such a – well, as I mentioned before, you know, the – the family history, the people – the – my father’s experience i-in – in – in – in the War of Independence, and before that he was in Poland during the World War I, you know, an-and the relationship even during that tsarist times, even in their gymnasium, there was already hostility between the Lithuanians and Poles in their classes, he told me.</span> <span id="s757">So that –</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: I’m asking not so much about that particular relationship, but in – in a – I guess more direct way would say, why should your parents care what goes on between Kaunas and Warsaw, or Kaunas and Moscow, or Kaunas and Berlin?</span> <span id="s759">It’s ha – you know, what made your family engaged in caring about these political events, in general.</span> <span id="s760">Why would you – how would you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I – I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s762">But I know that even my grandfather from my mother’s side, even he was very committed to the Lithuanian national –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: – and ethnic ideal, right.</span> <span id="s765">He was working he – with them, he – he – he was helping during the 1905, 1905 there was a revolution in Russia, and in Lithuania it took a national character; Lithuanians against the Russian suppression.</span> <span id="s766">So, why – my father hid, you know, the – the revolutionaries – my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: My mother found out, I mean, that he hid the revolutionaries who were trying to get – when – when the revolution was suppressed, trying to get into Germany and later maybe to United States to escape from that pole – tsarist oppression.</span> <span id="s769">So, you know, it’s tradition going way back.</span> <span id="s770">And I don’t know how to explain.</span> <span id="s771">It was a small country, and the fe – people felt that, you know, these things really affect them.</span> <span id="s772">The country’s independence was precarious during that time, and of course, I mean, my father was working for the government, so i-if – if – if the country is occupied, I mean, he has no job.</span> <span id="s773">I think maybe that also had something to do.</span> <span id="s774">I – really, we didn’t pose those questions that way, so I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: That’s what it seems to me, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: The other question that comes to mind, and again this is in – in my mind an irony because I wouldn’t – I’m not as familiar with the history at the time, is why would Poland be someone you’d be – there would be more of such negative feelings about than the Soviet Union, which is right next door?</span> <span id="s778">What – well, so is Poland, but – but what kind of discussions were going on, what kind of sensibility was there about the Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s779">What role did that play in Panevėžys, you know, and what was going on?</span> <span id="s780">What did you know of what was going on in Soviet Russia, and the union itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: We knew some, we knew the – you know, my ma – my f – my father see the beginnings of the Russian revolution in Russia.</span> <span id="s782">I would say so.</span> <span id="s783">Again, the Polish thing.</span> <span id="s784">Soviet Union was supporting Lithuania in this Polish Lithuanian conflict.</span> <span id="s785">Or supporting Lithuania’s claim to Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: All along?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: All along.</span> <span id="s788">The only one of the great powers.</span> <span id="s789">The Germans also didn’t recognize the Polish annextion of Vilnius, but the Germans were not willing to, you know, to take stand, or support Lithuania or something like that.</span> <span id="s790">So they kept more or less outside of that – of that issue.</span> <span id="s791">The Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan supported Poland.</span> <span id="s792">So the only great power supporting – United States were behind the area, you know, they didn’t – it was time of isolation, they didn’t – tried not to take any stance in European affairs at all.</span> <span id="s793">So the only real power supporting Lithuania was Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s794">Now, my parents, being good Catholics and Lithuanians, they disapproved of the communist system as such.</span> <span id="s795">But there was little discussion of that, you know, all of the memories of revolution as my father said, I mean he thought that revolution was, of course, a cruel period of time.</span> <span id="s796">A lot of things happened, but he thought that, you know, after all this time, there was some – some normality in the country.</span> <span id="s797">Even he didn't wanted to believe that there was a constant terror or something like that.</span> <span id="s798">Although, you know, w-we read about the terror in – against so-called, you know, the – the short trials of the c – other communists against Stalin, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: You read that in the Lithuanian media?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yes, yes, that was – so di – that was looked – people didn’t believe really that all those people, you know, were traitors or something like that, and there was going a struggle for power.</span> <span id="s801">But as far as Lithuania is concerned, that was outside of our real concerns.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And did news of the famine in the Ukraine, was there anything like that that – that touched your –</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: N-Not – we didn’t know a thing about it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: In the 30s, as this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s809">So – so in other words, from what I get – a sense I get from you is the Soviet Russia, or Soviet Union was rather benign in it – in a – in a –</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: That – that was our – our impression, mo-most of pre – impression of my parents, of the people they – they befriended, they discussed those things, yes, that was – that did p – it was, you know, a – was supporting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: For our right cause, we imagined that the Lithuanian cause was –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: The right one.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: – a right cause, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: So, what happens after 1938?</span> <span id="s816">We’re finished with Poland.</span> <span id="s817">Poland requires this ultimatums – says this ultimatum, requires diplomatic relations.</span> <span id="s818">Everybody’s upset, but they acquiesce.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: What happens then?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Well, the next year the Germans demanded the Klaipėda area.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s823">And?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well, that was another shock.</span> <span id="s825">You know, the Lithuanian – c-clearly you couldn’t fight against Germany with any – with any s – you know, possibility of keeping glu – Klaipėda, so they took over Klaipėda, and that was the first occupation of Lithuanian territory, and that was first – the refugees we met.</span> <span id="s826">The Jewish people, and the Lithuanian people who were committed to Lithuanian cause became refugees.</span> <span id="s827">They didn’t want – and Panevėžys, they came even to Panevėžys, the people.</span> <span id="s828">And there were appeals, you know, that – you know, for living space, for other things, for jobs for those refugees.</span> <span id="s829">So my parents decided, you know, that we had a nice house, it was our own house.</span> <span id="s830">We have too much space, we can – we could rent, you know, the upstairs, you know, to somebody.</span> <span id="s831">And we rent it to a girl who came from Klaipėda as a refugee, and well, simply, we – he – she worked in – in – in Misetas(ph) co-company, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Misetas(ph) company.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: As a clerk, you know, as a clerk, you know, so th-that was a refugee, we came to our – to our house.</span> <span id="s834">And there were more those refugees, one of my father’s – th-the legal students who were taking practice with my father was also from Lithuania Minor, and he came, you know, to work there, so we met him directly, and of course the Jewish people took care of the Jewish refugees –</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: – you know, who came from Klaipėda.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Okay, so wa – so it was still sort of separate communities, it was not an integrated sense of these are all Lithuanian citizens, but it was more, each takes care of its own.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: It just happens naturally like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: And who was this girl who came from Klaipėda?</span> <span id="s844">Did you talk to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yeah, shu –</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Did she tell you about what had been going on there, and what she saw, and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Yeah, yeah, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: What did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: She – she was not from the – that area.</span> <span id="s850">She was from l – from Lithuania, she was Catholic, you know, Lithuanian – Lithuanians from Lithuania Minor are usually Lutherans.</span> <span id="s851">She ca – when a young girl she came to Klaipėda to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: And now she became a refugee, because she – she lived for years there, you know, and – and came back.</span> <span id="s854">So she told, you know, about the – the Nazis, how they acted there, you know, how they at-attacked Lithuanians and Lithuanian institutions.</span> <span id="s855">They became more and more, you know, aggressive as the time went on, until it was, you know, really a problem for the Lithuanian even to exist there.</span> <span id="s856">The Nazis were trying to, you know, to – to – to – to – to dominate that area at all, and of course, you know, they demanded Klaipėda for Germany, and Lithuania couldn’t resist, and you know, they – they just had to flee that – that country.</span> <span id="s857">Hitler himself came to Klaipėda, you know, and well, was a very sad moment for Lithuania, but we felt that’s – it was a superior – superior power, couldn’t do much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Were there any people that you knew of in Lithuania who were Lithuanians who supported Hitler?</span> <span id="s859">Who thought that the i – that the ideology of the Nazi party was one that had some positive attributes?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Ye-es, yes, but not in our circle, in our family circle.</span> <span id="s861">The closest I know was our Catholic priest, a teacher of religion in our school.</span> <span id="s862">He was impressed by the order and discipline of the Nazi movement, and during the lessons, you know, sometimes he made Germany – the Nazi Germany as an example of, you know, of a disciplined, purposeful society.</span> <span id="s863">But that was really ther – we heard about other people, you know, who – who were f-friendly to Germans, but there were very, very few of them, because Lithuania was under direct attack at that time, with Klaipėda.</span> <span id="s864">Everybody was very sad that Klaipėda was lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s866">What – and you were, by that point, 16 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: And how – is your life changing at all?</span> <span id="s869">I mean, your personal life, do things keep on going the way they should be, even in spite of these –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s871">It didn’t – my personal life didn’t in – didn’t change m – at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: What happened next, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Well, the next thing was that summer, 1939, from ow – ou-our school, there was an excursion to Vilnius, because the diplomatic relations were established, the communications were already established, you know, we could – we could go to Vilnius, you know, to visit the city.</span> <span id="s874">So my – my school decided to have an excursion.</span> <span id="s875">So, I to – my parents, you know, agreed that they had to pay some money, I don’t know, for that, but they agreed that I go on that excursion, and I went with a group of my classmates to – to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s876">And it made a great impression on me, the city.</span> <span id="s877">The great impression of the old Lithuanian history connected to the city, where there were signs all around.</span> <span id="s878">The Lithuanian coat of arms, you know, was on the city gate.</span> <span id="s879">Ancient.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: There was a – there was a – still a city gate in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: One.</span> <span id="s882">One.</span> <span id="s883">Yeah, one was – because Aušros Vartai, it wou – had – it had the chapel, had some religious meaning, so it – the gate was not demolished, all other gates were.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Aušros Vartai means in English, Gates of Dawn, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Gates of Dawn –</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: – but I think it was Lithuanian mistranslation aušros, it should be aus-austrayo(ph), I think where – meant –</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: – well, it’s – now it Aušros Vartai, so whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: So, but – but an-anywhere else, at the churches, at the bridges, we could see our – the coat of arms of our country.</span> <span id="s892">The old ones.</span> <span id="s893">Of course, the new offices had Polish signs, but nothing has – did – as far as history – well, there was some in combination, when the co-countries – was a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth while the countries were united in one commonwealth, there was a – also a no – Polish eagle, Lithuanian knight, and so on, you know, bi – from those times.</span> <span id="s894">But always, always the Lithuanian knight.</span> <span id="s895">And [indecipherable] thing, and so Lithuanian students met our excursion, and he was a leader of our excursion, so the city told about how Lithuanians lived under the Poles, you know, and we went to Lithuanian s-s – girls’ school, the girls – the – it was summer, so the girls went home, so the school was empty, so – but they accommodated us.</span> <span id="s896">So we were – we still in Vilnius were in midst of the Lithuanian community there, which was very small, and really oppressed, but they were proud because they felt that they were oppressed, and they were right that there was something wrong, you know, with the Polish government, that they – they were oppressing the Lithuanians anyways.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Did they have their own schools, though, Lithuanian language schools in Poland, or – or you don’t know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah, they – they had some, but there were – one of the – the other were, they closing those schools, and they had the one high school in Vilnius itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Just the only one.</span> <span id="s901">There were bef – many more before, but they were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: But in Vilnius there was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So in some ways this 1939 summer excursion is both an – something new, because you get to see the city for the first time in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: And it’s a summer vacation, and it’s positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: And it’s – it’s something that you see of – that you can relate to and identify with.</span> <span id="s909">And at the same time it’s the summer of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Which is not exactly a summer without tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Oh yeah, in Vilnius was – in Lithuania that was not that obvious, but in Vilnius, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: How did you feel it in Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Well, there were – there were all po – oh, there’s su-such like – first of all, there were military demonstrations of the Poles.</span> <span id="s915">There were parades.</span> <span id="s916">We were, you know, looking at one of the parades i-in Vilnius, of artillery regiment there, and we were comparing that because there was artillery regiment in Panevėžys also.</span> <span id="s917">So we were comparing how it is and we looked, you know, boy, our soldiers look much more, you know, much better, better clothes, better – and didn’t impress us as – at all.</span> <span id="s918">But there were also the signs all over the Vilnius that – in Polish – that we are not going to retreat from our seashore.</span> <span id="s919">And they were – they were ready to fight.</span> <span id="s920">They we – knew the war is coming, or at least suspected the war is coming, and they – they are not going like the Czechs or Lithuanians who gave up Klaipėda, or the Czechs who gave up the Sudetenland, they are going to fight.</span> <span id="s921">They are not going to give in to the Nazis – to the – Nazis they didn’t mention that, just to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Yeah, so – so it was obvious, the war is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: To you?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Which was not obvious in Panevėžys –</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: And Panevėžys is two hours away.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yes, but this was quite, you know, quite my place.</span> <span id="s928">And here, you know – and we met one Polish girl, who was just graduated from – from the high school and was visiting her relatives in Vilnius, and we talked with her, you know, and beca – she was very friendly, we talked in German with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: And she knew German, and she knew, you know, that the war is coming, but he – she didn’t think, you know, about all those horrible things.</span> <span id="s931">So – so what, you know?</span> <span id="s932">What – what are the Germans going to do to me, you know?</span> <span id="s933">Well, nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s934">It doesn’t matter, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Well, this is somewhat of what I was getting at earlier, is that, you know, some people say wa – some people will say, there’s all this high politics going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: How does it touch me, a simple person?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Well, for that girl, didn’t touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Sh – she didn’t care.</span> <span id="s941">I am sure, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: – it touched her terribly, eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: And pretty soon.</span> <span id="s946">Just a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s948">So this is where you started to feel that there’s something going on, in – when you went on this summer excursion to Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yes, it changed my opinion.</span> <span id="s950">As I said, I was skeptical about Lithuanian claim to Vilnius because it’s – it might be right, but it seemed too unrealistic to me.</span> <span id="s951">But after this excursion I changed my opinion completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: In what way?</span> <span id="s954">That this i – that’s what the Lithuanian capital is.</span> <span id="s955">I mean, the Poles took it over, but that’s – that’s what it – the capital is.</span> <span id="s956">That’s what the Lithuanian law says, that’s what’s Lithuanian constitution said.</span> <span id="s957">The capital city of Vilnius is Lithuania’s capital.</span> <span id="s958">So – and I thought that’s right.</span> <span id="s959">That’s what it is.</span> <span id="s960">Maybe – maybe we d-don’t recover the Vilnius, I don’t know, you know, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Also, before then –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: – but then, doesn’t change.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: – you had e – you had – before then, you hadn’t necessarily been convinced of this argument.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: But at that point, once you went there and you saw these signs, that these were – that there was so much that was of Lithuanian –</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: – history there, and Lithuanian presence there, that yes, it is – it is the rightful capital.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s970">You go back to Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: What happens after that?</span> <span id="s973">You know, there’s the summer, and then September first comes.</span> <span id="s974">September first is not that long after your summer –</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: – excursion.</span> <span id="s977">So, how did events play out?</span> <span id="s978">What happened back in Panevėžys, once you returned from the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yeah, first of all, as far as I am concerned, a lot of people, starting with my family, with my father and more my m-mother, were very much interested in my experience, in my –</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: – and even the people who – who were friendly with our family, the other families also were very much interested in that experience.</span> <span id="s982">Nobody saw Vilnius for 19 years, and now suddenly, you know, I saw that – that city, and everybody wanted – and even Lithuanian officers were interested, in my opinion how did the Polish army look to me?</span> <span id="s983">You know, and all that kind of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s984">I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: You were pretty much the hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: – a center of attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Th – that – I – I was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: That’s not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: No, no, well, I – I was just so – so proud, you know.</span> <span id="s991">Not so proud, but I tried to be, you know, controlled about it, but I felt very well about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: You know, that I had that experience.</span> <span id="s994">And then suddenly in [indecipherable] th-the – the vacation was ending, but the school didn’t start yet.</span> <span id="s995">School starts on September the first.</span> <span id="s996">But the week before I went to the gymnasium, I don’t know why, I met some of my friends and there, you know, I found out before – before the newspapers came out, or something like that, I found out about Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: And what was the militor – Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Well, it was that they committed themselves, both countries –</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Who were these countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Germany and Soviet Union committed themselves not to fight against each other, even in a c – in a cong – if the conflict with a third countries comes, that they wouldn’t be involved, they would keep neutrality in that conf-conflict.</span> <span id="s1001">So, since we knew that there were discussions between British and French and the Soviets, ho-how to stand up against German ag-aggression, suddenly this disappeared, you know, suddenly Soviets Union said no, we are not going to make a stand.</span> <span id="s1002">And the British and French, you know, just – just went home.</span> <span id="s1003">That was the whole power situation.</span> <span id="s1004">And the people thought that if there would be agreement between Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union, that there would be no war, because the superiority of this combination should have been clear even to Hitler.</span> <span id="s1005">So they thought, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: So are these discussions, you know, I – it still is hard for me to imagine that a 16 – by now 16 year old boy –</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: – is thinking like this at that time.</span> <span id="s1009">What I can imagine is that a 16 year old boy is listening to grown-ups talk like this at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: That’s right, but af-after – after visit to Vilnius I became political.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Before that, I – yeah, I heard th – I was interested in those things, but you know, not – not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: But ah – ah – at that point, you know, I became – I be – really interested in what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: So when you her – hear, a week from school – before school starts, that there is this Molotov-Ribbentrop pact –</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: – and you – you go to, where was it, your school area, even though it hadn’t begun, is this where you learned of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: From my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: From your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: From my friends, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Your friends.</span> <span id="s1022">And your friends are your same a – they – about the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah, the same age.</span> <span id="s1024">Well, they heard on the radio or something, but they, also their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Their parents.</span> <span id="s1027">I – we – we started discussing, I said no, so what, I mean, so what?</span> <span id="s1028">There is no wars on, does it matter much?</span> <span id="s1029">And my friend said, you know, well, my father said that, you know, this means war.</span> <span id="s1030">Because, you know, the Germans were ma – will be not d-deterred by the superior power of three great countries, Great Britain, France and Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1031">So that means the war is coming.</span> <span id="s1032">That was his father’s opinion [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: And you’re sharing it with your si – we – amongst yourselves –</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: – at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: That’s all – so we – we didn’t deduct ourselves really –</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: – but it came from our parent in the generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: From our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: All right, so this is a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: In this case my friend’s parent, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: So here we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: It’s a week before September first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: And then what happens?</span> <span id="s1050">A: And then the school started September first, and the war started, of course, and that was news, and everybody was listening to the radio, and everybody was following what’s going on, and quite soon it was clear, you know, o-of the German superiority, which we thought even before.</span> <span id="s1051">I didn’t see it, but other people saw the German army in Klaipėda.</span> <span id="s1052">We saw Polish army in – in Vilnius, and it was obvious, you know, that the Germans were much better prepared, and much stronger army than the Poles, and even before the war started, we thought that the Poles are going to lose the war.</span> <span id="s1053">And of course, we – we kids, you know, were, because of that hostility with the Poles, we thought that’s – that’s a nice time for Lithuania to recover Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1054">The Germans are attacking Poland and pole – Polish army definitely is losing, like in the first days it was quite obvious a German attack was, you know, the Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s1055">They – they went very, very strongly wi-with air – air attacks, armored formations.</span> <span id="s1056">So we thought well, you know, why Lithuanian army doesn’t go there and recover Vilnius, because Poles will be not able to resist any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Was there any sentiment of changing, I mean any voices amongst Lithuanians that said well, maybe we didn’t like the Poles very much for what they did, but my God, what’s happening in Poland, and it’s terrible?</span> <span id="s1058">Was that – was there any sympathy being expressed in the so – in those circles that you were in, of Poland’s getting it now, and it’s – it’s not easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Not in the those circles I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Not in my co – friends, classmates, no.</span> <span id="s1062">Not in my family.</span> <span id="s1063">But, our director of-of our school told us Germans are not going to win this war.</span> <span id="s1064">It is world war, and the Germans are going to lose, and we shouldn’t interfere in the war now.</span> <span id="s1065">He didn’t say that, you know, he – he simp – in sympathy with Poles or something.</span> <span id="s1066">Maybe he was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1067">But he was convinced that the Nazis are going to lose.</span> <span id="s1068">And it seems like not some kind of a military or – or – or economical analysis, but because the Nazi ideology, that generation knew Germans from the first occupation during the first World War.</span> <span id="s1069">And they were convinced that the Germans were always overdoing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Overreaching themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Overreaching.</span> <span id="s1072">In the first World War, and from the Nazi ideology they deducted that the Nazis are ric – ready to do the same thing, to overreach more, even more than the – during the first World War.</span> <span id="s1073">So they were – and our president, Antanas Smetona also was of that opinion.</span> <span id="s1074">Some of the officers of Lithuanian army, some o-of the diplomats said, I mean, it’s a chance to recover Vilnius, let’s go, and Germans were encouraging Lithuanians, encouraging, you know, that wil – Lithuania wil – would go and recover Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1075">And the British said, in that case, Great Britain will declare war against Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1076">But well, now this is the question, who will de – will win the war, and Smetona was convinced that Germans are going to lose, and he didn't – we didn’t know about that time, but we knew, you know, later, that Smetona was against that, and that’s why Lithuania didn’t – didn’t attack Poland at that time, because of Smetona and of thinking, which our director told to us [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Would you say, you know, would you say your family belonged to a particular kind of political wing in Lithuania, or was it fairly typical of, let’s say the mood in society?</span> <span id="s1078">From what I understand there was a Christian democrat, and a more nationalist, or national political forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Which one would your family would have – thought they would have identified with more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: My father was close to Christian democrats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: But he didn’t belong to the party.</span> <span id="s1084">And later he drifted closer to this national movement of Smetona, of the president, but he was also critical of Smetona quite a b – a bit, but – but he was like in between those two.</span> <span id="s1085">Now, from my mother’s side, everybody was Smetona’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So they were much more of a – of – from the national –</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes, from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: – starting from my grandfather, through all those brothers, you know, everybody, including my mother was from the national group of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Would you have called them nationalists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Translating would be, yes, but they were not any kind of Nazis, they were anti – anti Nazi, anti-German.</span> <span id="s1092">And there were, you know, some – s-some who – wh-who were pro-German, and pro-Nazi, like Waldemartas(ph) and so, but i-it – it – Smetona was hostile to that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: – that type of thinking, and – and those who followed Smetona was hostile against the Nazi thinking, not only as – as German, but generally against Nazi and fascist things.</span> <span id="s1095">Fascism of Italian type had more sympathies.</span> <span id="s1096">There were not too many, but Italians type was closer.</span> <span id="s1097">There was no racism in – in Italy, in – at least at the beginning, na – and – so, but in – in – in our circles, no, you know, there was no – no sympathy for the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: And yet – and yet, there was temptation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: – that – that this – this, let’s say encouragement, on behalf of the Nazis to then take Vilnius –</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: – was tempting.</span> <span id="s1103">It wasn’t – it wasn’t something that was dismissed as we just don’t do that, unless fa – is – until Smetona said so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1105">Smetona, well, is not – he is not the only one.</span> <span id="s1106">Also, as I said, our – director of our school also was of that opinion, and – and there was other people, older people who said, you know, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1107">Now, even if Lithuania would have attacked Vilnius, that doesn’t mean that it would be pro-Nazi because he is all – th-the Soviet Union supported Lithuania in the Polish-Lithuanian –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Conflict.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: – conflict, and here also, you know, Lithuanian – Germany would have became – become allies for that moment, but lith – from Lithuanian viewpoint it would be just like alliance between Finns and Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s1110">Not – they – Finns didn’t became Nazis at all, they were allies during the second World War with the Germans, but they still were a democratic country, and had nothing to do with the Nazi ideology at all.</span> <span id="s1111">So that was the idea.</span> <span id="s1112">Of course, it was unrealistic.</span> <span id="s1113">If – if would have happened, of course, Nazis would have taken everything that – but the hope was that, you know, well, so we are allies, just like we were allies with the Soviets, now we’re allies with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1114">But S-Smetona was against that, Smetona was a very strong leader, maybe a d – we could call it dictator, and without him, you know, nothing – nothing happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1116">So – so the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is – is –what you hear of is between non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: That’s what becomes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: That’s what we knew, and there was [indecipherable] so nobody kne-knew about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1121">So what happens later, in the early fall, as things progress, and – wha – how does life in Panevėžys change?</span> <span id="s1122">Or does it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yes, of it – it does.</span> <span id="s1124">First of all, the war, you know, the – some of the things, the commerce became affected.</span> <span id="s1125">There were some Lithuanian ships which were ru-run on the mines, and we – one of the sailors, a brother of our classmate came back, I mean his ship was sunk in the Baltic Sea because ran on the mine.</span> <span id="s1126">It’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: It hit a mine.</span> <span id="s1128">It hit a mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Well, hit a mine, well, there were non-contact mines also, you know at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: But that’s a technical thing, so anyway, I mean th-the ship was blown out of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Of the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: – of the water, right.</span> <span id="s1134">So, you know.</span> <span id="s1135">And then of course – and of course the ca – the concern whether Lithuania could become – still be ne – neutral when such a gr-great war is starting around.</span> <span id="s1136">And when the Soviets attacked Poland also, from the east, then everybody became concerned what’s – what’s now.</span> <span id="s1137">Because the Soviets are taking over all the eastern portion of Poland – well, really the Ukrainians, Byelorussians and Lithuanians living there, but doesn’t matter, you know, it’s – was still Poland.</span> <span id="s1138">They took Vilnius, the Soviets, and now, you know, everybody became – now we are involved.</span> <span id="s1139">Soviets recognize Vilnius as Lithuania’s capital, now they – are they going to turn it over to us, or will they find, you know, some kind of thing to – to get out of it, of the – the commitment.</span> <span id="s1140">And there was mobilization.</span> <span id="s1141">There was declared, you know, the Lithuanian army was mobilized to protect its neutrality, not for war.</span> <span id="s1142">But the Polish army, you know, went over the boundary to Lithuania and was disarmed, so they had – Lithuania army had to be there to disarm the Polish army coming over, and to intern them as the neutral country’s supposed to do in such case.</span> <span id="s1143">And a lot of Polish military came over, and refugees – generally refugees, not military refugees from Poland came to Lithuania, and they found quite – quite a bit of understanding and sympathy then, you know.</span> <span id="s1144">Poland was defeated and broken and then, you know, it seemed like, you know – not – not an enemy any more you had to fight, you know.</span> <span id="s1145">So the – there was sympathy for them and – and – and all the routine mobilization, we thought wi – the Lithuanian army being mobilized that they will go to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1146">And we – we were all, in our class I think everybody was, you know, why our army is not going there?</span> <span id="s1147">But as I said, the director explained to us, we didn't believe him, but that’s what it was, the older generation decided it would be foolish to get into that war.</span> <span id="s1148">And – but then we were very much tol – concerned, what will be next, you know, everybody was concerned.</span> <span id="s1149">There was organization, so-called Sauliai(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: What is it?</span> <span id="s1151">How would you translate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: It is close to national guard, p-partly like a reserves, part like national guard.</span> <span id="s1153">There was a military people a-after they served in the army, they were released into reserves, and they voluntarily joined that organization, which was a military organization, but not quite.</span> <span id="s1154">It differs, for instance, from the national guard in that was – that he – they had also cultural thing.</span> <span id="s1155">They had dances, they had lectures also, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: So it was somewhat civic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Somewhat civic, yeah.</span> <span id="s1158">But it was very popular, a lot of people in the – men, and also women belonged to that organization.</span> <span id="s1159">And it’s also part – was part of the – of the country’s military capa – ca – capacity, and so – and we were a-also our – the students of – in the high school, in the higher classes, now also belonged to that organization.</span> <span id="s1160">I belonged too, voluntarily, whoever wanted, there was no pressure at all to join, but I joined it.</span> <span id="s1161">And we were also called to duty then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Then the mobilization came and we were sent to – on the guard duty in – in the city as a – I’m writing in my memoirs, there will be no – our students were not quite military minded at all, you know, they might have m-made – made a – a – a play out of it, and it was a serious thing, so we – we were removed from the guard duty and sent to a place where there were no people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Well, what do you mean by made a play out of it, they – they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Well, they were starting, the girls were going to – to the school o-on – through the bridge – the bridge, they were supposed to guard the bridge.</span> <span id="s1166">They started on, you know, ch-checking their bags and all that kind of thing, and it was a flirt really.</span> <span id="s1167">And it was – and when – when the leaders found out, they were terrified.</span> <span id="s1168">They said, I mean, the p – the parents will complain, so we will go before court martial for this thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1169">So they took off of – of duty us completely and sent to guard gasoline tanks and – and outside place.</span> <span id="s1170">They want –</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Where there were no girls whose bags you could check.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No girls, no.</span> <span id="s1173">And no people at all, just a gr-great, friendly dog who came to visit us, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1175">So that is how, in the early fall, things seemed to be developing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: What happens next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Well, mobilization was called off, we came back to our classes.</span> <span id="s1179">Our cl – school was taking over for – for military ca – no, the girls’ school was taking over for the – the military.</span> <span id="s1180">The girls went to our school in the daytime, we went during the nighttime to our school, because it was different schools, girl and – and boys’ school.</span> <span id="s1181">And – but it was a short period of time, and of course there was news that, you know, Lithuania is recovering Vilnius, Soviets are letting have Vilnius for Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1182">Not all the territory which Lithuania claimed and the Soviets recognized before, you know, they – they just returned a quarter of the territory, but with the capital city.</span> <span id="s1183">And also was news that, you know, the military bases, Soviet military bases will be introduced in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1184">The Soviets will have military bases in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1185">So, everybody was really happy that Vilnius is returning to Lithuania, and everybody was concerned that the Soviet army is being introduced in Lithuania and having bases here.</span> <span id="s1186">It was not a big surprise really, because before that Estonia and Latvia already were forced.</span> <span id="s1187">They didn’t get anything, but they had to take in Soviet bases, Soviet guard [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Did you know that in Panevėžys at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yes, yes, that was in the news, in the newspapers, everybody.</span> <span id="s1190">So, Estonia first, Latvia second, Lithuania after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: I’d like to interrupt here and say, you know, when Germany at – [background conversation, tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Okay, this is a continuation of our interview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14th, 2010.</span> <span id="s1193">So, Mr. Gureckas, you were at the point where you were explaining the introduction of Soviet military bases in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia had them.</span> <span id="s1194">I wanted to go back for a minute to the first declaration of war, when Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany and then is also attacked by the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Do you know – was there a sense, did you – was there any discussion or did you have a feeling about – I’m doing all of this as a preface, what the Jewish community was thinking, how people in the Jewish community were reacting to these events, the local Jewish community in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s1197">Was there any – any knowledge – I mean, I don’t have a sense that you know, was much contact, but did you – do you remember anything about that?</span> <span id="s1198">A: Well, personally I didn't have, at that time, connections.</span> <span id="s1199">We had Jewish friends in our – in our class, but – and one was fairly close to me, but we somehow didn’t discuss much about this situation.</span> <span id="s1200">But it was from my parents’ contacts, we knew that, of course the Jews were concerned about the German attack, and the German strength, which they showed, you know, and the power.</span> <span id="s1201">And of course everybody knew how hostile the Nazis are against – against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1202">So, the concern was quite stunder – understandable.</span> <span id="s1203">But that’s – that’s about – about it.</span> <span id="s1204">I mean, there were concern, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1207">Of course they – they were not in favor that Lithuania would attack Poland, you know, but [indecipherable] they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: So – so it seemed – so I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1210">I could transfer my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: I had no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1214">So, when we’re talking about those military bases, you – you get the news in school.</span> <span id="s1215">Do you remember how you got the news that Vilnius is going to come back into Lithuanian control, do you remember where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Oh, everybody was at – at the radios at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: We [indecipherable] the Lithuanian delegation, government delegation was in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1219">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: So we knew that it will be decided one way or the other, and so everybody was just glued to the radio and listening when the end – when it was announced, you know, the news, and eventually it was, you know, that this – the treaty between Lithuania and Soviet Union is signed and Vilnius is really – really turned to Lithuania, and the military garrisons will be introduced in Lithuania, Soviet military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: What date was this, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: It was, yeah, it was 1939, October 10th was they signed the treaty and we knew about that October 11th, in the morning, from the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: From the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah, and then, of course, newspapers.</span> <span id="s1225">And the newspapers were a great disappointment because they showed new boundary between Lithuania and the Soviet Union, and as I said, I mean, just a quarter of the territory was being returned to Lithuania, three-quarters was just kept, Stalin for themself.</span> <span id="s1226">And the problem is that the Lithuanian areas were the farmers, and generally the population was Lithuanian in that area.</span> <span id="s1227">They fell to the – to th – to the Soviet side, you know.</span> <span id="s1228">Lithuania didn’t receive even those territories which were ethnically Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Are these – was this part of Belarus, where these –</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: It became part of Belarus then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: – [indecipherable] Belarus, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Par – became part of Belarus.</span> <span id="s1233">Later the boundary was adjusted when Lithuania was occupied, but the areas like Druskininkai, like Švenčionys, they were part of Belarus – Belarus at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: So you got bad – good news, bad news basically –</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: – October 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1238">So the – the enthusiasm was – was k-kind of muted at that point, and there was a meeting, you know, and i-it was muted, until really the Soviets – Soviets kept Vilnius for a couple of weeks yet, and they were r-really plundering the ke – the city during that time, and eventually the Lithuanian army took over Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1239">And s-somehow you know, at that point, when Lithuanian army marched into Vilnius, the country became split personality, the people said now we are going to celebrate, we are going to worry tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1240">Everybody knew that there is a lot of to – something to worry, but today we are celebrating, tomorrow we are – are g – are going to worry.</span> <span id="s1241">And that’s what we did, we celebrated and then we started to – to worry right away after that, after the celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: And – okay, so now Lithuania’s in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Did you – when was the first time you saw a Soviet soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Oh, that was an accident, the – well, again, after Lithuania – the Soviets had called the government delegation from Finland in – into Moscow and started discussions with the Finns, and they had also, you know, demands, which the Finns re – refused.</span> <span id="s1246">So, in – in a month’s time the Soviets attacked Finland and became Finnish Winter War.</span> <span id="s1247">And now everybody was for Finns in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1248">Soviet Union was supposed to be our ally, and well, ally, but we – we – we still were for the Finns, they were so – so heroically defending their country, you just couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s1249">Now, one of the Soviet planes was bombing Helsinki, ar – or some other Finnish cities, anyway, was one bomb – on the bombing raid.</span> <span id="s1250">The Finns were shooting back, and the p – the pa – the plane was damaged, couldn’t navigate very well, but turned south, went over Estonia, Latvia, came to Lithuania and near Panevėžys, crashed.</span> <span id="s1251">Well, really, crash landed, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Crash landed, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Crash landed.</span> <span id="s1254">The pilots came out and said, I mean, how far is Riga?</span> <span id="s1255">Well, they flew over Riga already, but they couldn’t tell any more.</span> <span id="s1256">So, the Soviets from their barra – from their military bases in Lithuania came, the Soviet soldiers to that place, dismantled the plane and brought it to the railroad station and took it.</span> <span id="s1257">And we saw then that plane, it went through our gymnasium, through the street in front of us.</span> <span id="s1258">Everybody was at the – at the window, and we saw the plane, all warped by bullets, which wa – wa – that – and we saw Soviet soldiers taking that plane away.</span> <span id="s1259">So that was the first time we saw the Soviet soldiers, taking away that damaged plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: So y – so you – the – so, in other words, the garrison had already been established, but you just hadn’t seen them yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No – yeah, th-they were – they were close, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: They were close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: – they were – they were not – not – not going to be – to the streets or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1264">There were – there were garrisons who were there, but they were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: They didn’t let their soldiers room around – roam around at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1268">And that plane is what you see, and it’s in – and it’s in bits and pieces, and it goes by your school window, and it’s of great curiosity to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1272">Also a bittersweet thing, because you know, w-we like to see the – the plane warped by the Finnish bullets, but then the so – Soviet soldiers in Lithuania was, you know, a bitter part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1274">How many – how many more minutes do we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q2: Well, we’ve only got two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Then let’s finish right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Let’s finish right here and we’ll continue more after lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q2: As we were talking about the Finnish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: As we were talking about the Finnish yes.</span> <span id="s1281">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14th, 2010.</span> <span id="s1285">Mr. Gureckas, where we left off, you were describing to us how you saw the downed Soviet plane which had fought – which was flying against – in the Finnish – the Winter War against Finland, how it landed near Panevėžys, and you saw the dismantled parts of it being taken by Soviet soldiers, and it aroused a great deal of curiosity amongst the – the kids in school, and you all went to the windows to take a look.</span> <span id="s1286">I wanted to ask a question about, let’s say, how kids felt then when these events were happening.</span> <span id="s1287">And bring it back to the very beginning of tensions.</span> <span id="s1288">Did you, as – as young students have an urge to do something, whether it was against the Germans, or against the Poles, or against the Soviets, to defend your country?</span> <span id="s1289">Were there any such student types of discussions or ideas going on, or even actions that were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Well, I could tell about one really ridiculous thing, because we were 15 years old when the – there was a tension about Klaipėda, a problem, the Germans were pressing Lithuania at that time, and it was clear that they will, sooner or later will demand that Lithuania return Klaipėda, together with the Klaipėda territory to Germany.</span> <span id="s1291">So my classmate, and my close friend, he told me that he heard a rumor that there is no organization, but secretly Lithuanian army is mobilizing, taking the volunteers, registering the volunteers, and he – he kind of suggested that we might be interested in that.</span> <span id="s1292">So I – I said yes.</span> <span id="s1293">My father was fighting for Lithuania, now it’s my turn, y-you know.</span> <span id="s1294">And we went together with him to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Did you tell your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s1297">That would be the end of the story.</span> <span id="s1298">No, we went together with him to the military office in Panevėžys, and just asks whether, you know, they – they need any voluntaries to fight for Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1299">Well, the sergeant there was kind of a – excited.</span> <span id="s1300">I mean, he was – he was dumbfounded really, you know.</span> <span id="s1301">And we couldn’t understand why – why he was you know, so kind of confused.</span> <span id="s1302">We just wanted to fight for Lithuania, that’s all, that seems so – and he, an elderly sergeant, you know, was a pr – now I can see, you know, why – why he was – the children want fight for Lithuania, well – but that was the end of the story.</span> <span id="s1303">They said no, thank you, you know.</span> <span id="s1304">If we need we will call on you, and we’ll call nev – everybody.</span> <span id="s1305">But now – now, we don’t need your service.</span> <span id="s1306">But good – good boys, you know, grow up.</span> <span id="s1307">You will be good soldiers someday.</span> <span id="s1308">Okay, so we went back to class, and somehow, apparently my friend told ma – our – our friend Rubinsteinas(ph), a Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s1309">He was one of our gang, Shalamas(ph) Rubinsteinas(ph), and he – apparently my friend told him about that story, and he was all upset that we didn’t take him with th – with – with us.</span> <span id="s1310">He also wanted to fight Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Wanted to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yeah, so that was the oh – the only really disagreement we had with him i-in our – in our friendship.</span> <span id="s1313">So – so that’s – that’s the story.</span> <span id="s1314">After that, of course, we were i-in that organ – organization, Šauliai, I would call like national guard.</span> <span id="s1315">And we took seriously our duties, you know, whenever we were called upon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: To check the girls’ bags.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Y-Yeah, well that’s – I didn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: I was supposed to be responsible for that guard, and I didn’t check on – on it.</span> <span id="s1320">But yeah, yeah, so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: That’s like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: But there was – was there any such talk – did it ever – first of all, did this story – this event ever reach your parents’ ears?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: We didn’t tell that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1328">And number two, did – did anything similar happen with – with Poles or with lith – with the Soviets, or anything else that was developing at the time?</span> <span id="s1329">Was there any other talk amongst the kids in school of any sort of resistance or activity, or anything like that about things – these histor – these [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: No, n-nothing against the Poles.</span> <span id="s1331">I mean, the thing went too f – too fast.</span> <span id="s1332">We didn’t – we didn’t even realize what the ultimatum was ac-accepted, you know.</span> <span id="s1333">And I was sick at that time at home, you know, so I – I don’t know how my friends reacted, and – at school.</span> <span id="s1334">But no, this thing became only when the Soviets occupied Lithuania, then – then we found tha-that we have to resist that somehow.</span> <span id="s1335">And that’s another part of my story, you know, when a – when the Soviets annex Lithuania, occupied and annexed Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1336">Yeah, I was looking for a place, you know, I could join some resistance group.</span> <span id="s1337">And the only group I knew was the Catholic organization, adate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: What was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Adaytis(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Adaytis(ph), and this organization was illegal under the independent Lithuania, Smetona’s regime, because they – it was legal in the universities, but not in the – in the high schools, because Smetona’s regime thought that it’s too early to get into political things.</span> <span id="s1342">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Excuse us, please, can we stop the tape, please?</span> <span id="s1344">[tape break] I want to come to that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: – but we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves chronologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: So let’s go back to October, when the bases appear, yo-you hear the news, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the bases appear, the plane is down, you see the – the parts going on.</span> <span id="s1349">How did life change after that?</span> <span id="s1350">How di – did it – did you feel it impact you in any way when those bases first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: No, the things quieted down.</span> <span id="s1352">While the Soviets were fighting against the Finns, they didn’t put any pressure on Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1353">The bases were there, you know, but there were no conflicts as far as we were conc – you know, aware.</span> <span id="s1354">And it seemed like, you know, we were a gr – very upset and apprehensive i-in the fall, about October, November.</span> <span id="s1355">But in the springtime of 1940, it looked like the things quieted down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Life hadn’t changed much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: The life, they didn’t change much.</span> <span id="s1358">Of course, war was going on, as I said, you know, and there were – there were less selection in the – in the – in the – in the m – on the market because of the blockades, you know.</span> <span id="s1359">But life was going pretty normal by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: So th – the government – what had happened to Mr. Smetona, President Smetona?</span> <span id="s1361">Did he stay around?</span> <span id="s1362">Was he still president?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yes, he was still president.</span> <span id="s1364">Government was fank – functioning as it always did.</span> <span id="s1365">It seemed like the things quieted down.</span> <span id="s1366">Of course, we were following war.</span> <span id="s1367">The Germans were landing in Scandinavia, in Denmark, and Norway, and then, you know, they attacked in the west, a-and – through Netherlands, Belgium and France, and the big battles of 1940 was going in the west.</span> <span id="s1368">So everybody was following what’s going on, because it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Was this through Lithuanian radio, or – or newspapers, or was this also internation – did you get any kind of international broadcasts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: At that time Lithuanian b – was sufficient.</span> <span id="s1371">We got from Lithuanian newspapers, Lithuanian radio the information.</span> <span id="s1372">Of course, other s – radio stations, German, Russian and others were available, but we didn’t – we didn’t feel like we have to use that at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1374">Okay.</span> <span id="s1375">And what would be the next – you were then what year of high school?</span> <span id="s1376">In June – in April of ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: It was a six – sixth year, I-I was yeah, finishing the sixth class, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1379">And what would be the next major event that you recall from that spring, or, you know, as the months went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Well, the occupation.</span> <span id="s1381">Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: What does the occupation mean in this ken – in this sense?</span> <span id="s1383">You have bases, but how does that change to occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Oh yeah, the bases were limited in certain places, and they were closed, they didn’t let their soldiers roam around, you know, they were all in – in the bases.</span> <span id="s1385">And suddenly, you know, the Soviet army – well, as a – as I told, I mean, I – my father came – we knew that our government delegation is in Moscow, there are some kind of problems there, but nobody thought it’s a great deal.</span> <span id="s1386">And then suddenly my father came from somewhere, called me, and said, you know that the Soviets are occupying the country, taking over the country.</span> <span id="s1387">And that’s what happened, and that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Do you remember that conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Where were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: At home.</span> <span id="s1392">At home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And how did he look when he told you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: It was already vacation started, you know, and then it was June, and vacation started, classes were over.</span> <span id="s1395">And my father were all upset, and excited, and I had my friend with me.</span> <span id="s1396">And he said, let – let the friend go.</span> <span id="s1397">So I said, oh, my – my father has something to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Who was this friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: – for me to do.</span> <span id="s1400">Well, it was a younger boy from the high school, and – but two classes lower, because he was younger.</span> <span id="s1401">He was just – just as a – his relationship was strange.</span> <span id="s1402">He was related to the Polish Marshall Pilsudski, who was – died – who died by – by that time he was dead.</span> <span id="s1403">But he was related through his – his mother side, you know.</span> <span id="s1404">And I don’t know whether he considered himself Pole or Lithuanian, but he was also very much interested in politics, in wa – in th-the war going on here.</span> <span id="s1405">We came, we discussed those things.</span> <span id="s1406">I was kind of try to be diplomatic, you know, I didn’t show my an – our hostility –</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Anti [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: – to the Polish, you know, and I tried to be diplomatic, and then my father came and said let – let him go, and then I said, my father has something to do, has a task.</span> <span id="s1409">And then my father said, you know, the Soviets are occupying Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1410">And that was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1411">Night, we slept during the night.</span> <span id="s1412">During the night the Soviet troops came from Vilnius, it took Vilnius first and went to Panevėžys, and started – well, then the tanks, th-the – the motorized troops, you know, were going – it – it was not a – a garrison, it was not a base.</span> <span id="s1413">It wa – they were all over the place.</span> <span id="s1414">And a – taking over, you know, and taking over the military establishments in Lithuania, taking hi – the barracks, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: How did it look in Panevėžys?</span> <span id="s1416">What were the – what did you see from that time, the next morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Well, the next morning we came up, they were already went through Panevėžys, they were in the ba – in the military barracks somewhere, and they went farther from Panevėžys over Ciulai.</span> <span id="s1418">We still saw some tanks, some military cars going, you know, on the road, but not ma – the mass, which was before, you know, during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: I didn’t see that – that massive movement, it was during the night, and somehow I didn’t hear it, and – although there should have been some – some noi – a lot of noise, but somehow I slept well.</span> <span id="s1421">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1422">And wi –</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Was your house in the middle of town, was it on the outskirts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: A-All – all over, in the outskirts, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: No, I’m talking your place, where you lived, where you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Oh, in the – in the middle of the town, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: We had our house quite near the center, right near my high school.</span> <span id="s1429">And – well, it’s difficult to say, but you know, there were also reports in the radio, in the press that the president has left Lithuania, he fled Lithuania, so he was condemned that he didn’t stay with his country during the critical time, and all that kind of thing, and this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Was this – was this still the Lithuanian press, or was this already –</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Still the Lithuanian press, it seemed like Lithuanian press, but apparently the control was already in – in the Soviet hands, or at least in the communist – Lithuanian communist party’s hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah, so – and – and then, you know, that same day, it was Sunday.</span> <span id="s1434">Saturday there was the ultimatum and they marched into Lithuania and in Panevėžys Sunday afternoon, I saw the first communist demonstration in Panevėžys in the main square.</span> <span id="s1435">The people didn’t – didn’t walk the streets.</span> <span id="s1436">It was Sunday and the city was kind of empty.</span> <span id="s1437">I went to s – into this – the city to take a look at what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1438">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1439">Were – were very few people going dur – during the streets, in the streets.</span> <span id="s1440">Not like a regular Sunday.</span> <span id="s1441">And then I went to the main square and there was a demonstration, not a big one, maybe 50 - 60 people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Young, old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Mostly young, I would say, mostly young people.</span> <span id="s1444">And they were – had the red flag there, and they were speaking in Lithuanian, you know, against the sovi – Smetona government, against the – the whole system, against the fascist government, as they called here – Smetona’s government.</span> <span id="s1445">And the others were listening to that, and j-just seemed like all of them – of the people were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: How did – how did you know?</span> <span id="s1447">I mean, how did it seem – why would – why would you make that assumption?</span> <span id="s1448">How did you – yeah, how could you tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Well, typically from – from the racial features, and from the accent the speakers used.</span> <span id="s1450">The listeners, of course, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1451">Well, I didn't check all, I was kind of aside, you know, I wasn’t in the demonstration itself.</span> <span id="s1452">So it’s difficult to say, you know, the composition, but it – the impression was like most of them or even all of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1453">Now, my fa – the Jew – the communist party was illegal in Lithuania before that.</span> <span id="s1454">Even when the – when the bases came in, it still was illegal.</span> <span id="s1455">My father was working in the court system, and some of the – of the clients, as he called, he had some communists also, who were accused just of the communist activities.</span> <span id="s1456">And so he was concerned that now, you know, that things changed, and those communists will became very influential.</span> <span id="s1457">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: What did he say – what did he tend to say about those communists that were his clients, earlier?</span> <span id="s1459">Did he have opinions about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Yeah, he had a negative opinion, because one of the – of the important communists which he was exim – examining his activities, was from a very rich Jewish family in Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1462">Do you remember their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: From very rich – pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Do you remember their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: No, I wouldn't, but I – I could find, because he was important later on, so maybe I could find out later, but I don’t remember exact now.</span> <span id="s1466">And so i-i – even that, you know, for him looked kind of ridiculous or – or – or unacceptable that from such a rich family, you know, he becomes communist, and is working against the Lithuanian government, really.</span> <span id="s1467">And I must say, later he was concerned that he will become imp – im – important person, which was right, he became very important person.</span> <span id="s1468">But became not in Panevėžys, but in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: I ent – the – the story is interesting.</span> <span id="s1471">He was afraid that there will be some revenge.</span> <span id="s1472">There was nothing from that.</span> <span id="s1473">He didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Who was – who was afraid there would be revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: My father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: My father was afraid that they – he will re – take revenge against him because he was conducting that investigation.</span> <span id="s1478">But there was none.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: He was – he was in Vilnius, he was doing his – communists were there, you know, and whatever, and there was none.</span> <span id="s1481">But there were some other people, you know, who take revenge, mostly criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Who also thought, I mean, they might be – so, th-they had the problem there, but this communist wasn’t – he just ignored.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: So when you s – okay, when you saw this demonstration, what – do you remember what your feelings were at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1486">I was afraid that the revolution is going on, from what I heard what happened in Russia, you know, with all the cruelties of the revolution might happen right – right here, right now, you know, in – in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s1487">They decided – they decided that they sh – you know, they should go and disperse the police, this – the fash – fascist police, as they said.</span> <span id="s1488">And they – they march with their red flag, they march toward police, I didn’t follow them, and I f – later find out that the Lithuanian military officer in Panevėžys telephoned the Soviet forces, whichever the commander was in Panevėžys, and asks whether, you know, that’s supposed what’s – what should happen, because they were trying to – to disperse the police, you know, and take the police headquarters in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s1489">And the Soviet commander said no, no demonstrations, nothing is allowed, and if you don’t – if you don’t protect the quiet in – in the city, we will have to take care of it and provide this – this – so th-there would be no d – no demonstrations, nothing.</span> <span id="s1490">So then, you know, h-he co – the c – the commandant, the Lithuanian officer called Šauliai, and we were also called, I – oh, we went to the Šauliai headquarters, we have given rifles, and we were supposed – there was – commandant’s hour, was supposed to enforce that, to patrol the streets, and see that nobody walks during the nighttime, which we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: And you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Which we did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1493">I did, and my friends did.</span> <span id="s1494">That was quite – nobody was demonstrating nothing, nobody was walking around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Did you, first of all, did you recognize anybody?</span> <span id="s1496">Within that demonstration was there anybody you personally knew or recognized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: And did you know of Lithuanian communists?</span> <span id="s1501">Not Jewish communists, but Lithuanian communists, who either would be there, or who had been in somehow or other known, or active?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: No, not – not real communists.</span> <span id="s1503">There were people, very leftists, you know, opinions, one – one – one – one doctor, he was a friend of the family.</span> <span id="s1504">He was – he was very leftist, but he wasn’t – he was very favorable about the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1505">He – he had very favorable opinion, but he wasn’t communist, he wasn’t working for the party or anything like that, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Did anything – do you know what happened to him when this – there was the fo – the Soviet occupation?</span> <span id="s1507">Did his [indecipherable] change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: He became director of the – of the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: And then I think he expanded that hospital very well.</span> <span id="s1511">He – he would – as – as a doctor he was really, you know, valued under the system.</span> <span id="s1512">But I – I su – suspect mo-more than a doctor than – than a co – I don’t think he was really a communist, even after – in particular after he saw, you know, the communism in – you know, in – in real life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: I want to go back again to that demonstration.</span> <span id="s1514">You said you were scared.</span> <span id="s1515">Did you have any view of – did you have any – any thoughts about the demonstrators?</span> <span id="s1516">You know, why they were demonstrating?</span> <span id="s1517">Were you surprised to see it?</span> <span id="s1518">Were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: I was surprised, but I understood that there – there are communists, so we – we knew my father said that there [indecipherable] are the young, some young Jewish people, the communists wi – is popular between some young Jewish peop – men and – and la – and girls.</span> <span id="s1520">So it wasn’t really much of surprise.</span> <span id="s1521">Still, it was a very small, I mean, there were thousands of Jews in – in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s1522">This – this group was small group, and apparently that’s – that’s the limit at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Okay, so you dispersed, and it went away, and it – it wasn’t something that stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yeah, I don’t know exactly, I didn’t follow them, and I went home, and then I got the call, that Šauliai are called for duty.</span> <span id="s1525">But what happened in between, except that thing the – our military, Lithuanian military officer telephoning the Soviets, that – I was told about that, but I don’t know exactly how it went, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Okay, so now it’s occupied, there is no more Lithuanian government, the president has left.</span> <span id="s1527">What else happened, what else changed?</span> <span id="s1528">A: Well, demonstrations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: More of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Oh yeah, well – but those were officials, you know.</span> <span id="s1531">The people had to go into demonstrations.</span> <span id="s1532">From their working places they were told that they better go, you know, and there was a threat, unconcealed threat that si – they will take care of all those who are against the people’s government, as they say.</span> <span id="s1533">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: How did you – I mean, from your story I get a sense that there was this – that there was a benign feeling for most of the independence years about the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: That when there was the Finno-Russian war, then you were on the side of the Finns because you know, they were the weaker, or the – it was their territory that was being attacked, and so it was more that you were on their side than the Soviet side.</span> <span id="s1537">But when did it stop being a benign feeling?</span> <span id="s1538">When did it start being a threatening feeling?</span> <span id="s1539">One where you’re – where you’re saying, these are our enemies?</span> <span id="s1540">When did that – when did that change [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Beginning was the first – the intr – i-introduction of the military bases, that – that was the first, and then the thing, you get – you get deeper.</span> <span id="s1542">But that – that was the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Okay, so that’s October, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: And then in June 1940 there’s a full occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1547">But even then, before that, go – with the World War going on, in particular w-with France collapsing, many people were thinking that Lithuania might not be able to survive as independent country.</span> <span id="s1548">And there was a discussion going on, which is better, that the Germans would take over or the – or the Russians?</span> <span id="s1549">Because Po-Poland wa-was gone, you know, was conquered by the – by both of them and partitioned.</span> <span id="s1550">And I would say – I was inclined that it ba – may be better under the Germans, my opinion.</span> <span id="s1551">Not very strong, but I was leaning that way.</span> <span id="s1552">But th – I would say the majority of Lithuanians we knew in – in the circle, were of the opinion that maybe the Russians occupation would be more benign, because the Russians are not that efficient, not that organized in our opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: And – and Lithuanian nation would have a better chance to survive longer – long time than under harsh and efficient German occupation.</span> <span id="s1555">So even at that point, people were leaning more toward the Russians than the Germans, more toward the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1556">Well, the Russians they were call – calling at that time, until the occupation itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: And why were you, you know, slightly more inclined toward – if – of – of the two evils, the German one would be the lesser?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: That’s difficult to say f-for me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1559">Maybe from the times of Tauragė, their culture were more familiar to me.</span> <span id="s1560">And you know, we had very good German teacher, even a g – a German, Lithuanian German in Panevėžys, and German culture, maybe made impression on me.</span> <span id="s1561">I – I – I like – I read – I – I knew German language fairly well.</span> <span id="s1562">I started reading German books.</span> <span id="s1563">Th – just that.</span> <span id="s1564">It wasn’t something very – very firm, you know, but I would say I was leaning that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1566">So it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: And the communist system somehow looked inefficient, distasteful.</span> <span id="s1568">Thi – thi – I – I didn’t realize the amount of – of violence in the nationa – national soc – socialistic German [indecipherable] I didn’t re-realize that much, than what I f – later found out.</span> <span id="s1569">And the Soviets were pretty obvious.</span> <span id="s1570">Once they came in, they were obvious.</span> <span id="s1571">They wer – they we – they were threatening.</span> <span id="s1572">They were not – not – propaganda was before they came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: The pro – there was, or there was not propaganda?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: There was a lot of propaganda but they didn’t care whether we believed or not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: – because the main thing was the threat behind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1578">So when they actually occupied –</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: – then that changed?</span> <span id="s1581">Then they cared that you believed it?</span> <span id="s1582">A: Oh, they cared all the time, but I – I don’t know, you know, e-even being friendly to them didn’t mean much, you know?</span> <span id="s1583">Some ca – somehow –</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Show me – explain to me how this threat made itself felt.</span> <span id="s1585">Even – you know, you have a – up to th – I have a picture of Soviets in the streets, Russian soldiers in the streets, this demonstration, an ideology that’s against the – the former independent government and so on.</span> <span id="s1586">But what makes this scary?</span> <span id="s1587">What makes this aggressive?</span> <span id="s1588">A: Well, they started arresting people pretty soon, you know, I don’t know, ma – maybe not the first week, but the second or third week, some of Lithuania’s ministers from the previous government were arrested and brou – and not arrested in Lithuania, but arrested and brought to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1589">And then, just in about a month time, you know, the – a lot of people get arrested, including my director of our high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: The one who said that Germany would lose the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1592">Yeah, he was arrested, I – a – a – a good man, you know, we knew, and a lot of other people who were considered, you know, like leading in this society, having influence in the society.</span> <span id="s1593">There were thousands arrested.</span> <span id="s1594">And the thing, you know, the – there was a prison in Panevėžys in the center of the city, built by the tsars, not far from the – our house.</span> <span id="s1595">Our house was in the neighborhood of – of that prison.</span> <span id="s1596">And right there, you know, the prison was – had bars in – in the windows.</span> <span id="s1597">Now the bars stayed, but once the Russians came in, you know, they put like some boxes over the windows, so th-they couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s1598">Maybe they could see from the – one – from the top, the – the sun, some – some light, but they couldn’t see anything outside.</span> <span id="s1599">You know, even tho-those small things, you know, this – that – the prison not good enough, they – they had to make it much – much worse, you know, to isolate people they couldn’t see outside.</span> <span id="s1600">Yeah, and pretty soon even the – from our – from our gymnasium, from our – not from our class, but you know, they were arrested, even – even the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Upperclassmen that means, older –</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Upperclassmen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Upperclassmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Upperclassmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Did you know any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Can you surmise what – you know, individuals, why they were arrested, why they would have been arrested?</span> <span id="s1610">A: Yeah, one of them was active in that Daiteninkai(ph), that Christian Catholic organization, before – apparently therefore, he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1611">Well, the resistance movement started already, so that might be the things they – and they were not very par-particular to get exactly their man, you know.</span> <span id="s1612">And if-if they wanted to get their man, you know, and they didn’t know who it is, so they took 10 of them, thinking that most likely one of them will be the – they are looking for.</span> <span id="s1613">And that’s it, that’s – that was – pretty soon we found that that mattered, you know.</span> <span id="s1614">The terror started pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1615">Not the first days, but pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1616">And of course, everything changed.</span> <span id="s1617">My father lost his job.</span> <span id="s1618">A lot of people were changed in – in governing positions, in – even in technical positions.</span> <span id="s1619">So – but no-not only that, but a lot of people were losing their jobs and – in the government, and in administration.</span> <span id="s1620">And everything that, you know, made very oppressive [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Did you hear of any – any murders?</span> <span id="s1622">Did you hear of any –</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: At that time not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1625">Did anybody come home from those prisons, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: So no – people were arrested, but they didn’t come back from being arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1630">And that happens all in June, July, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: July.</span> <span id="s1634">June was just a half a month ba – two weeks left.</span> <span id="s1635">June 15th they took a – marched into Lithuania, 16th, so July.</span> <span id="s1636">But fr – right from very beginning of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: So, what was the summer of 1940 like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Summer was easy because we went to the – on the vacation.</span> <span id="s1639">Well, I – first of all, after this incident in – in – in Panevėžys, when we had to enforce the commandant’s hour, it was vacation time, as far as the school is concerned.</span> <span id="s1640">So I went to my mother’s farm, which was where she was come from, and her sister was there, you know, running the farm with her husband.</span> <span id="s1641">And so I went there, and I went there because I thought – I mean, this – this territory might be taken over by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1642">There were rumors you know, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: And you preferred to still, you know – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Yeah, since I preferred to stay wi-with the Germans, you know, I-I thought maybe – now I found out th-that not – there was a division.</span> <span id="s1645">The Germans were taking – supposed to take over part of Lithuania there.</span> <span id="s1646">But nobody knew exactly, you know, where the – the dividing line would be.</span> <span id="s1647">But eventually they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1648">The Russians took over the – the entire country.</span> <span id="s1649">So, then they went back home and we went on our regular vacation with our – my uncle in the – in the eastern Lithuania in that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: The one with the nice farm with the lakes and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: With the lakes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: And wi-wi – and with – with the boat in the lake and all that.</span> <span id="s1654">And it was a really quiet place.</span> <span id="s1655">There was not much going.</span> <span id="s1656">We heard on the radio, we read in the newspapers all the changes going on in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: And this is by the – by this point Soviet press, Soviet Lithuanian press?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Y-Yes, it all – officially some of them that still had old names, but obviously they were run already by different people appointed by the new government.</span> <span id="s1659">So it was a quite – we were – you know, we were disturbed what – about what it was happening, but at that particular place, nothing much was happening.</span> <span id="s1660">And people were all concerned, everybody was tense.</span> <span id="s1661">There was supposed to be elections to the people’s parliament, where you know, there were exactly that many candidates as had to be elected deputies.</span> <span id="s1662">People boy – boycotted th-that, or even if they voted, they drew, you know, the cartoon characters instead of the bulletins inside.</span> <span id="s1663">But that was about it, there – there was not much, and the meantime they annexed Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1664">This – this parliament was called into the session and accepted the request [indecipherable] Lithuania would be included in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1665">And we were working with my father in the forest, and came out of the forest into the small town, and we saw that there were some red flags out, and we asked – I mean, what’s – what’s now?</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, what’s new?</span> <span id="s1667">And there was a – a smith working at the edge of the town, and we ask him, what – what’s now, I mean, why – why the red flags here?</span> <span id="s1668">Said, well, they annexed – they annexed Moscow to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1669">So that was that, because they annexed – announced the annexation.</span> <span id="s1670">So that was very upsetting, but in that village not much was happening, until, you know, my vacation was over, I came back to Panevėžys, and Panevėžys there were changes, there were cha –</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: What kind of changes did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Well, even the Soviet placards ne – red, you know, flags everywhere, you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1673">Pretty soon my father was fired from his job, had to look for – for s – for some other job, finally found in a bank, as a clerk in a bank.</span> <span id="s1674">Those – those things, let’s see, when – when did military took over?</span> <span id="s1675">Part of our – yeah, I think at that time, yeah, they – they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1676">We were supposed to have that much living space, we had much more in our own house, so they took the rest of it, and put the s – the Soviet officers into our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: So the German – the – the refugee from Klaipėda no longer was there in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: No, I don’t know, he – he a – she –</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: She was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: – she moved out somewhere, yeah.</span> <span id="s1681">And so they put – they put the Soviet officers there, and they – they changed.</span> <span id="s1682">For awhile one family was there, then another, and finally there was a Soviet Air Force officer, and his wife was a Soviet army medicine doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: So th – and they had the small, small girl, and they stayed for quite awhile in our – in our house.</span> <span id="s1685">And then another part of the house was taken over and one of the communist leaders, Lithuanian communist leaders were put in that part of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Did you know who this person was before he took over that part of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: We knew about him, but we didn’t know him personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1689">And how did that Soviet officer and his wife, or any of them behave?</span> <span id="s1690">Did you – did – were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: O-Oh th – oh, the officer himself, you know, th-the air force officer was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1692">Very reserved, very reserved, very quiet.</span> <span id="s1693">His wife was completely different, very talkative, very expressive, liked to discuss things with – with – here in with me with my poor Russian, which she corrected all the time.</span> <span id="s1694">And, was very friendly lady, very friendly lady yeah.</span> <span id="s1695">And th-the – and the girl, you know, the small girl, they – they – it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1696">He was in – in the d – on the duty, she was on the duty sometimes.</span> <span id="s1697">So they brought a g – a girl from Ukraine, a young girl maybe 15 - 16 – 16 - 17 years old maybe, Ukrainian girl, to take care of their small do – small – small daughter.</span> <span id="s1698">And that was strange for us, because that said, you know, y – y-you cannot live like this – this – I mean, you can’t live like this, you have – you will go to Siberia, you have to prepare for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: They said this?</span> <span id="s1700">Who said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: This girl, Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s1702">N-Not the officer’s wife, no, that – this girl which was brought to take care of their ch – their child, said, well – why – we – we didn’t – we did – we didn’t intend to go to Siberia or anywhere else, you know, why – why should we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Yeah, it was like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1705">Then she started talking about Ukrainian f-famine.</span> <span id="s1706">Now, my father said, well, that’s – that’s – nobo – nobody heard about that, you know, and sh-sh-she might be a little bit, you know, she’s – she’s – you know, living in fantasies, you know, so we – we just – we just discounted that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1708">You ignored what she was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Yeah, yeah, it – it’s – it was obvious nonsense, you know, so who c – who –</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1711">And that happened in the fall of 1940?</span> <span id="s1712">Sometime in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Yes, 1940, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1715">How did the very – did you know anything of what was going on in the Jewish community in Panevėžys, and what kind of discussions, how they were affected by the Soviet occupation, by this incorporation, what the sentiments there were?</span> <span id="s1716">Did you have any contact with your friend who had wanted to go help fight the Germans with you?</span> <span id="s1717">Did you – di – yeah, can you tell a little bit about what you did or did not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s1719">First of all, was completely obvious and natural that the Jewish community was glad that Lith-Lithuania was not occupied by the Germans, and if it had to go down, you know, it’s better that the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s1720">With that, many Lithuanians would have agreed.</span> <span id="s1721">But now, you know, the – the – we – we noticed pretty soon the hostility against independent Lithuania, against the previous, not only government, but the country itself.</span> <span id="s1722">Now, it’s very difficult to say how prev – prev – prevalent this – this attitude was.</span> <span id="s1723">There was definitely some, in particular in the younger generation there.</span> <span id="s1724">For us Lithuanians, was a gr-great surprise.</span> <span id="s1725">We never thought that our relations are bad, we never thought that the Jewish people are somehow disadvantaged in Lithuania or – or discriminated against.</span> <span id="s1726">Yet, the community was kind of separate, jewi – but we were – we were thinking and wer-were convinced that that was the choice of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1727">They wanted to have their own schools, they wanted to have, of course, their religions and synagogues and all that kind of thing, and their organizations.</span> <span id="s1728">And we didn't mind, but a lot of their life was separate from Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1729">There were some Jews which were integrated into Lithuanian society, but there were very few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: There were some – some doctors, s – in particular in – in professions.</span> <span id="s1732">And now, you see, I – since the Soviet terror became obvious quite soon, it is very difficult to say.</span> <span id="s1733">Those who were for the Soviet system became very loud.</span> <span id="s1734">And they wanted to make, you know, career, to make a do – to – to advance in this new s – new society.</span> <span id="s1735">So they were a – loud, they were active, they were running around.</span> <span id="s1736">They were tearing off the Lithuanian symbols, you know, from – from the houses or wherever they were – they were.</span> <span id="s1737">Those who were against them whether Lithuanian or Jewish or whatever, were kind of subdued.</span> <span id="s1738">Because the terror was there, there was no sense starting, you know, frankly, resisting that, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Openly resisting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Openly, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: So those who were against that were quiet and tried to be, you know, not – not obvious, you know, with – with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Not noticeably –</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: – their opinions there, so you know.</span> <span id="s1745">So it’s this – that’s why it’s very difficult to say how much of Jewish communi – community were collaborating with the Sov – Soviet occupation.</span> <span id="s1746">But it – it was obvious that they were, because knew – officers knew – knew people with responsibility there, a lot of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1747">Not all of them, some of them were Lithuanian communists, but there were not that many Lithuanian communists.</span> <span id="s1748">All Lithuanian communists got good and significant positions at that time, tasks to do, but there weren't that many of them.</span> <span id="s1749">And once they ran out of them, also the Jewish people came in and there were – there were more of them, l-lot – I – I don’t know percentage-wise – in numbers wouldn’t be more, but percentage-wise definitely there were more Jewish collaborators than Lithuanian collaborators with the Soviet government.</span> <span id="s1750">There were also Russians.</span> <span id="s1751">The Russians also was a split community because part of them were glad that, you know, the Russians were taking over the country.</span> <span id="s1752">Even the tsarist refugees from the tsarist gov – from the Soviet government, who fled to Lithuania said well, it’s – th-they might destroy us, you know, the Russians, who were against this – the Soviets, but it’s still nice that the Russia is expanding again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Did you have someone say that to you, or did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Not a ma – to – i-i-is – as somebody told to my father that, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: A – a Russian he knew, you know, friendly.</span> <span id="s1757">So – and so some of them collaborated, but some of them, of course, also tried to just disappear from the view, so not to attract any attention, so that they wouldn’t be, you know, repressed like [indecipherable] or the – of the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: So in this – in this situation, it sounds like there’s growing fear, growing terror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: And also a sense of being betrayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: But by whom?</span> <span id="s1763">And – and it – as far as you could tell at the time, ou – that feeling of betrayal, where was it deepest?</span> <span id="s1764">Where did it sen – seem to be deepest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: Against the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Against the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Against the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Although we were aware – we were aware that some of them really are against the s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: The Soviet system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: – Soviet system.</span> <span id="s1772">But how many – how influential were – it was difficult for us to say.</span> <span id="s1773">Now, my classmate, Rubeinsteinas(ph) – our high school or gymnasium was split in two.</span> <span id="s1774">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: By this time you’re 17 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: And he – he went to another gy-gymnasium, so my contact didn’t disappear, but wa-wasn’t that every day contact that we had when we had the same – were in the same class.</span> <span id="s1779">A-And instead we came wa-wa-wa – came the girls from the girls’ school, we were mixed up now, before they were separate.</span> <span id="s1780">And yeah, we got f – a j – a Jewish girl come in, there were many more – n-not many, but more, but I think – but I remember one of them, and the – it was obvious that this – this girl had nothing to do with the communist system or whatever, like that.</span> <span id="s1781">She was very quiet, very nice girl, very good student.</span> <span id="s1782">I really admired it – re – her.</span> <span id="s1783">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: U-Uditta(ph) Gormanita(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Uditta(ph) Gormanita(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: And her – her father was a – a rich merchant in smaller city, not in Panevėžys, but not far from Panevėžys, Ramigala, and her uncle was in London, also a rich man – a rich merchant there.</span> <span id="s1792">And I don’t know, well luckily – so we – Uditta(ph) was a wonderful girl, was a wonderful girl, we were dancing with her.</span> <span id="s1793">I don’t know, I didn’t fell in love with her, but I admired her, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: You liked her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1797">Do you know what happened to her?</span> <span id="s1798">What her fate was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: I don’t know, but I s – I suppose just like other Jews were all – were rounded up and killed.</span> <span id="s1800">I – although even my friends even now, when I talk with my c-class friends, cannot accept that fact, somehow say, well, maybe she s-somehow survived, but there is no chance.</span> <span id="s1801">There was no chance.</span> <span id="s1802">He was terrif – she was terrified when the war started, when the Germans attacked, and the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1803">She was – we – I – that’s the last time I met her, and a group of us met her, you know, she was terrified, she –</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s1805">Do you reme – if you remember it, tell me about that last time you met her and what – what was the circumstance at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Well, we were g – two or three of us, three of us, I think were – were running through Panevėžys, war already started, the Germans were bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: You mean the war in Lithuania started –</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Y-Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Y-Y-Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: [indecipherable] war in Lithuania, yeah, the ger – the Germans attacked Soviets, and we were looking for weapons, we wanted to fight Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: We – we wanted to – since Lithuania didn’t resist when it was occupied, we felt that we just have a – Lithuania has a duty to, you know, to fight, to show that it didn’t accept that occupation, that we really want to be free, and really w – we were looking for weapons, and didn’t know where – where to find them.</span> <span id="s1813">Previous arrangements were broken down, you know, and so we were going there, and the j – we just saw Uditta(ph) standing at the corner there, the ge – a German plane was turning circles around – around Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s1814">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: And she was at the corner of the center of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1817">Pretty high up, you know, the plane was there, the Russian officers were shooting from their pistols, and that – it was much too high to reach in the plane.</span> <span id="s1818">And Uditta(ph) was also looking at that plane with terrified eyes.</span> <span id="s1819">And we said, Uditta(ph), why are you afraid, I mean, you – you – you did nothing, you – you were definitely – we didn’t even conceive that the Germans would – what they did.</span> <span id="s1820">We couldn’t conceive, we thought, I mean, it’s a – it was a civilized nation, you know, a nation of the western civilization.</span> <span id="s1821">We – we didn’t conceive that they – something like that, that they would do, start killing the people all, you know, without any discrimination, nothing.</span> <span id="s1822">We thought, I mean – well, those who worked for the communists, those, you know, Jewish or not Jewish or Lithuanian or whatever, they are in trouble definitely, but Jew – Uditta(ph), you know, that wa – who – who could choose her, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Did she say anything when you said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1825">We – we tried to tell her, you know, that there is no reason to be afraid, but sh-she just listened and we saw that she – she just doesn’t believe us, and she was right.</span> <span id="s1826">She was right.</span> <span id="s1827">Yeah, I – I remember her, you know, I-I – I put – when – when they were building this Holocaust Museum, you know, I – I asked, you know, that her name would be inscribed in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1829">She made that kind of an impact on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1832">I go back and I keep wanting –</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: – you know, I have the same question that I keep asking, which is, and what happened then, and what happened then?</span> <span id="s1835">So, if we can go back a little bit to when it – you know, before you talk about this incident with Uditta(ph), your – the betrayal that I mentioned, that I brought up as a possibility before, as to who was betrayed a feeling of betrayal, did you ever feel that that last independent Lithuanian government also betrayed you by not resisting, by not fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yes, in a sense yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: In a sense, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1839">Although that was just symbolic, of course, Lithuania couldn’t de-defend itself, it was just too – too weak.</span> <span id="s1840">The bases were inside already.</span> <span id="s1841">But still, I think they should have fought.</span> <span id="s1842">They should have fought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Were those kinds of discussions also going on, and did that feeling of betrayal come once the terror started, or did it come once the bases started?</span> <span id="s1844">If you can make some – that kind of a distinction, I don’t know if it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: No, i-i- not the – not the bases.</span> <span id="s1846">The bases somehow was accepted as in-in-inevitable.</span> <span id="s1847">Estonia had that, Latvia had that, war was going on, you know, the situation was unclear, how the war will develop was not clear.</span> <span id="s1848">Somehow it looked too early to start and fight, you know, at that time.</span> <span id="s1849">It – it looked like it’s a right thing to play for time.</span> <span id="s1850">And that was playing for time, but maybe we’re – we’re wrong.</span> <span id="s1851">I mean, it would be much more effective fighting right – right there in 1939, but we were not Finns, we were not that organized like Finns, so Lithuania couldn’t bring defend also, but would be more – would be more known, you know, would have attracted more attention in – in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: It s – it sounds like what was going on in Moscow, and what people knew in – like your family in Panevėžys, as plugged in as you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: – to sources of information and contacts, that what really was developing was not known, that – that people were not informed.</span> <span id="s1855">That’s the impression I get from your telling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1857">Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: Of – of these negotiations, quasi-negotiations –</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: – that were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Of course not, yeah, we didn’t know at that time all the details.</span> <span id="s1862">Now we – we find you know, the documents, that memoirs, you know, we – we know – know much more.</span> <span id="s1863">So it – when I telling now the story, I have to watch myself to put myself in that time, not what I know now about those – the things –</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: That’s exactly –</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: – because I have read a lot of materials about those times, about negotiations, about decisions being taken at that time.</span> <span id="s1866">But at that time it looked like in 1939, was distasteful and – and dangerous, but correct decision to accept the bases, playing for time.</span> <span id="s1867">But not resisting in 1940, it seemed like the really was – was, as I say, betrayal.</span> <span id="s1868">It was – it wasn’t a decision which could be justified, really.</span> <span id="s1869">So when we were trying to fight the Soviets when the Germans attacked, it was desp – because Lithuania didn’t resist then, now we have to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Now we have to fight to show, you know, that we – we – we want to be free, we don’t want to be occupied by anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: You don’t want to be part of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: No, we don’t want to – to be part of the Soviet Union, or of – of anything.</span> <span id="s1874">No-Not of Poland, not for Germany.</span> <span id="s1875">We want to be independent country.</span> <span id="s1876">Our parents fo – our father fought for that, you know, and we want to have an independent country.</span> <span id="s1877">That’s – that was – that was the attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Let’s go back again to the fall of 1940, and then through the winter and the spring, people are arrested, the prison has it wo – its windows in the wa – in Panevėžys blocked off.</span> <span id="s1879">The former government flees –</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: – disappears, is arrested.</span> <span id="s1882">There are – there is a sense that the Jewish community, the noisier part of it is pro-Soviet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: No sense of – of how much anti-Soviet sense there is – sentiment there is.</span> <span id="s1885">And what happens then, after that?</span> <span id="s1886">I’d like to – the next half year, let’s say from January 1st, 1941 until when the Nazis invade the Soviet Union, and what – Lithuania is now a part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: What happens in that half year?</span> <span id="s1889">[technical direction] How many minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q2: About three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Okay, fine, so we’ll – End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14th, 2010.</span> <span id="s1894">Mr. Gureckas, I just asked you about what was the year – what was the next half year between January and June 1940, what events took place, what things developed, but I thought of another question I wanted to ask, preceding that.</span> <span id="s1895">And that is, of all these betrayals that we’re talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government, what was left of it, betrayal by the, you know, small group of let’s say refugees from tsarist Russia, who liked the idea of Russian domination, even if it was with their internal enemies before, betrayal by the Jewish community, or betrayal by Lithuanian – Gentile Lithuanians, ethnic Lithuanians, who were communists themselves.</span> <span id="s1896">Which betrayal do you think you felt in your heart most keenly?</span> <span id="s1897">Or maybe another betrayal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1899">I think the Jewish, because several things.</span> <span id="s1900">Russian community was so small that it was really insignificant.</span> <span id="s1901">Our government, pretty – find out that there was a split of opinion about that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military command.</span> <span id="s1902">So – also, you know, difficult.</span> <span id="s1903">Now, Jewish, proble – problem is that – because maybe we were – or were – were mistaken, but we had the impression that the Lithuanian Jewish relations are very good.</span> <span id="s1904">That there is no ispy – th-there was some Jewish communists, okay, you know – well, more than Lithuanian maybe, percentage-wise, but that was not really significant.</span> <span id="s1905">The Jewish community supported Lithuanians in the Vilnius question.</span> <span id="s1906">They supported Lithuania’s independence, they – Smetona had very good relations with the Jewish community’s leaders, you know?</span> <span id="s1907">So we didn’t see the reason why – we, as I said, maybe they felt being discriminated, because it was difficult for them, you know, to – to – you know, to become officers in the army, in the police, and something like that.</span> <span id="s1908">There was some ethnic discrimination in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1909">But those who really wanted could, you know, like Gensis(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian army, and very valued.</span> <span id="s1910">So there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: You’re referring to Jakub Gens who ended –</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: – ended up being the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Commandant –</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: – chief of police of Vilnius ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1917">He was a Lithuanian officer from the time of the Wars of Independence.</span> <span id="s1918">He became officer in the Lithuanian military school, and had a very distinguished career in Lithuanian army, in the war with Poland.</span> <span id="s1919">So, just one example, there were other officers, Jewish officers in Lithuanian army.</span> <span id="s1920">But benda – generally, Lithuania being a small country, just established, and in big tr – big conflict with Poland, and with Germany because of Klaipėda, were looking – they were discriminating not according to religion or race or anything like that, but about the perceived loyalty to the state.</span> <span id="s1921">The most discriminated people, of course, were Polish.</span> <span id="s1922">They just didn’t trust any Pole that he wouldn’t be just a spy, you know, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1923">So, for pr – a Pole got a government sensitive position was practically impossible.</span> <span id="s1924">Then, of course, Jews, because of some communists in there, you know, in the younger, and because of some cus – cosmopolo – cosmopolitic approach.</span> <span id="s1925">A sophisticated approach which Lithuania looked at them kind of s-such small, ridiculous state, you know.</span> <span id="s1926">They were yus – universal people, they – they were not – not that much ag-gainst Lithuania, but ri – but discounting Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1927">And that also for having some – somebody like that in military or police would seem l-like risky, you know, h-h-he doesn’t care about this country.</span> <span id="s1928">So then, Germans.</span> <span id="s1929">Lithuanian Germans ou-outside Klaipėda were mostly loyal, very loyal, just like I told about that, you know, which I re-reme – remember in Tauragė, Greigoris(ph), who – who refused even to – to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1930">And the same thing in Panevėžys, most of the Germans are loyal, but Germans still, you know, some.</span> <span id="s1931">And then later, you know, there were Tartars and Karayims, there were no discrimination whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1932">Their – their religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, Karayims had their own religion, Jewish based, you know.</span> <span id="s1933">The race, you can s-see Karayim, you know, you could see from – from the face, from the features.</span> <span id="s1934">Nim – Kara – Tartars not so much, was Karayims.</span> <span id="s1935">But that didn't matter at all.</span> <span id="s1936">Their people even in – in the army made the career, good career, you know.</span> <span id="s1937">There were generals, Tartars, there were colonels, Karayims, you know.</span> <span id="s1938">They were as good or better than Lithuanians, no – no problem.</span> <span id="s1939">So, the base of discrimination was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Well that – that sort of famous – I’m so sorry I interrupted –</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: – the [indecipherable] you – a sort of well known sentiment, legitimate or not, in most of the cases not legitimate, of a fifth column.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: That’s what you’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1946">And is – being, you know, aware that we are – the country was, you know, a small country, weak country in – in between dangerous other countries.</span> <span id="s1947">So that was one of the considerations, whether it – it was well taken or not, you know, that’s a different thing, but that was the basic feeling.</span> <span id="s1948">And now, basically, as I said, was the feeling that the Jewish community was a friendly community and there were not really big conflict.</span> <span id="s1949">There were some conflict in – commercial areas between Lithuania, but the government wasn’t involved in that at all.</span> <span id="s1950">Smetona’s government was against any anti-Semitism at all.</span> <span id="s1951">And – and the people also, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: And yet there was acceptable, as far as what I’ve read –</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: – there, at least from some other historical sources that there – the rise of anti-Semitism throughout Europe in 1930s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: – did not – did not bypass Lithuania, that as the decade wore on, within the society itself –</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: – there were such sentiments.</span> <span id="s1959">That’s what many historians –</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: – have claimed.</span> <span id="s1962">Do you think that there – those are – outside of any, you know, any events that we’re talking about now, would you say that that has validity to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Most likely so.</span> <span id="s1964">It’s difficult for me to say th – because we’re talking about the circle, my circle, my – my parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: – my dear friends, my friends, classmates, I didn’t feel that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: A-A-And all that circle, I din – didn’t feel that.</span> <span id="s1969">Yes, I knew there were some incidents, some i-in between Lithuanian farmers and – and – and Jewish merchants, but it – yeah, there were so, there was tension between Lithuanians coming into the commercial area, trying to establish their businesses.</span> <span id="s1970">There is a competition, sometimes this competition went out of bounds, you know, from both sides.</span> <span id="s1971">The Jews tried, you know, to establish some kind of mo-monopoly, and push out – that Lithuanian out.</span> <span id="s1972">Li-Lithuanian also, you know, appealing to some anti-se – anti-Semitic, you know, feelings.</span> <span id="s1973">So, apparently there was, but I couldn’t tell ma – much because it was way beyond my circle.</span> <span id="s1974">In my circle that – this – this wasn’t felt at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Yeah, there were some – for instance, there were some – some Jewish families changed their house language, their family language from Yiddish to Russian, and Lithuanians resented that, you know, he – he – they give up Yiddish, why then don’t – they don’t pick up Lithuanian?</span> <span id="s1977">And Yi-Yiddish didn’t – didn’t bother anybody, Hebrew didn’t bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know?</span> <span id="s1978">But – but – but I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1979">So there were those who did that, you know, and w-went to Lithuanian language.</span> <span id="s1980">Even in this museum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto her d – her diary in Lithuanian because she – she ju-just didn’t know ji – Yiddish that well.</span> <span id="s1981">So, there were – it was – it was a big community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no – or not, but in the people there was a sense of betrayal because they thought that the relations were good, and they didn’t see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way, or much of the community, in particular the younger generation.</span> <span id="s1982">The older generation, of course, didn’t partici – participate in – in that, but as I said, they just – they just were in – behind the picture, you know.</span> <span id="s1983">Nobody cared much about the – the rabbis or something like that, how – how they look at the things.</span> <span id="s1984">Now, I also write in my memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our – our family’s friend was Dr. Bridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his specialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also doctors.</span> <span id="s1985">And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of – the first Soviet occupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish community leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this reaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active – well, pro – pro-communist, younger, active people and talked with them, and asked them not – not to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds of times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people they are living between.</span> <span id="s1986">Tried to be neutral, you know, and th-th-they e – taking sides, they couldn’t have survived, because they would also, you know, provoke a lot of hostility.</span> <span id="s1987">And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone down.</span> <span id="s1988">And they said the younger – the young people just lef – la – just laughed at them.</span> <span id="s1989">The old people they don’t understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob-obsolete and – and didn't want even to listen to them.</span> <span id="s1990">So apparently even in the Jewish community, there was some perception that somebody is o-overdoing the things.</span> <span id="s1991">Now, was – as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you know, they we – they were – they were i-in – invisible, they tried to be-become invisible.</span> <span id="s1992">Now you asking about the period from – in early 1940s.</span> <span id="s1993">Really the breakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 1940, August, I think the third or fifth, about that time.</span> <span id="s1994">Right after the annexation, the thing changed.</span> <span id="s1995">Now the terror intensified consid – considerably, and the resistance started getting organized.</span> <span id="s1996">So now, la – a lot of people, even in – in – in – in – in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and Ar-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance.</span> <span id="s1997">But even the [indecipherable] resistance, the people who were prominent in the – in the society generally, most of them were arrested, th-thousands now.</span> <span id="s1998">Now it became a mass thing.</span> <span id="s1999">Now there was nationa – nationalization; the business establishments, commercial establishments, industrial things were nationalized.</span> <span id="s2000">I was my-myself, we – we s-students had to go there, write, you know, in the – whatever belongs to that merchant establishment, and to be nationalized with the owners.</span> <span id="s2001">Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian owner who owns some business or – or – or – or business establishment, they – they were just thrown out.</span> <span id="s2002">Now the Jewish, usually you know, still remain there as a specialist.</span> <span id="s2003">Just because usually there were some in the family, or in – in their circle who had influence with the new government.</span> <span id="s2004">So apparently they tried, you know, to help each other.</span> <span id="s2005">And pretty ba – became pretty obvious, you know, the things are nationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before.</span> <span id="s2006">Of course now, in government’s name, for – in government’s account, Lithuanians are just without a job, you know, just – just waiting around.</span> <span id="s2007">What’s the matter, you know, it’s always the – these – these things started accumulating.</span> <span id="s2008">The resentment against the Jewish reaction increased strongly.</span> <span id="s2009">As the terror increased, increased the – the – the – the reaction.</span> <span id="s2010">Also, because some of them, you know, even communist Jews went into the security e-e-establishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Were these people known by name, or was this just what was dis – this was understood, or discussed, I mean, what was the basis of this point of view, this – this – this belief that there were Jews in the security establishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Well, they were visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: They went, they arrested people, they interrogated people, they – yeah, th-th-they – after annexation, everything became visible.</span> <span id="s2015">Th-They – they didn't – the terror – concealed terror is not a terror.</span> <span id="s2016">I mean, they – and then the terror really started after the annexation.</span> <span id="s2017">It really – what we suspected, what we were afraid, now, you know, came to fruition.</span> <span id="s2018">Now you didn’t have to be afraid, you knew.</span> <span id="s2019">You knew.</span> <span id="s2020">That’s – that’s how it is.</span> <span id="s2021">That’s how it is, that’s how it will be.</span> <span id="s2022">And it – it – it gets stronger and stronger, more and more people arrested, until the big deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Well, tell us about the big deportations.</span> <span id="s2024">What happened then?</span> <span id="s2025">When did it happen, and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Well, it was in – in – in naja – I don’t remember exactly the date, but that’s 1941, June 14 maybe?</span> <span id="s2027">About that, 14 - 13.</span> <span id="s2028">Yeah, one night, you know, coming – well, in my o-op-opinion.</span> <span id="s2029">We were walking with my father through Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2030">There was – no, that was different, I’m sorry, that’s – that’s start of the war.</span> <span id="s2031">Suddenly, you know, of – we – we got up one morning and saw that, you know, our friends are being – being taking, arrested and being taking to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2032">I was working in the middle of the city, and I saw, you know, a – a – a truck going there, you know, an open truck, and I saw, you know, the family we knew, who was my father’s, really, superior for a time.</span> <span id="s2033">We saw that family, the old – the old lady there, and their girl and him, you know, in that truck, and soldiers with the s-set bayonets around them, being taking to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2034">And – and a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2035">Our teachers disappeared, you know.</span> <span id="s2036">Our teacher o-of the Russian language was a Lithuanian diplomat, he was arrested, there was no Russian class there.</span> <span id="s2037">He died from s-starvation in Siberia.</span> <span id="s2038">And so, you know, anybody could, there was no reason, there – pretty soon there was no reason – we couldn’t detect the reason who is safe.</span> <span id="s2039">Yeah, well, the members of the communist party, and the – of the communist activists, those who really contributed, who we-were working on the deportation, maybe they were safe, but nobody else.</span> <span id="s2040">There was no, you know, anybody could be arrested, anybody could be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Did you know at that point, when you saw the truck, the open truck, that this – this was a – a deportation that was a mass deportation, or did you see many trucks go to the train station?</span> <span id="s2042">Wa – can you kind of draw us a picture?</span> <span id="s2043">What was it that you saw, and what you understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Yeah, well, I didn’t see too many because most of them went during the nighttime, and I don’t know why this family was picked up – we-well, there were more people, not only this family in the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: But th-that was like after action actions, you know, something – people they might – might missed or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: But pretty soon we knew, I mean th-the railroad station was full of people, you know, the trains were full, and they were pushing those people, w-we – we knew, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Did you go to the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2051">I didn't.</span> <span id="s2052">I-I didn’t want to risk be – because I – we didn’t know, w-we didn’t know – now we know, you know, aba – apparently how that was done, but at that time there was no – no understanding what was going on and woo – who is in danger, who is not.</span> <span id="s2053">My mother opened – and tr-tried to – to – to – to think what – what we should take to go into Siberia, you know, now.</span> <span id="s2054">And – and that was open box, and she didn’t put anything in th – she just – just was paralyzed, you know, and that’s it, you know, we don’t – we don’t know.</span> <span id="s2055">We don’t know it – we were sho – we were shocked.</span> <span id="s2056">We were shocked, we didn’t expect anything like that.</span> <span id="s2057">They were saying, oh, your prostitutes are taking to – to Siberia, they will learn how to work.</span> <span id="s2058">Prostitutes, the – the kids, the families, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Does that Ukrainian au pair still living in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Yeah, but – but they were very rarely at home.</span> <span id="s2061">Th-The ka – this – the red army was on some kind of alert already, so they were mostly at their bases, wherever that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: And at that point, did you connect the dots and see what she was saying, or even then there was such confusion, that you had no idea that this could be Siberia, the Siberia she was telling you to prepare for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Yeah, yeah, we connected that.</span> <span id="s2064">We connected.</span> <span id="s2065">And we – particular the Russian literature, the Soviet literature we had – we had to read, you know, some of the Sholokhov’s novels, and there is about de-deportations.</span> <span id="s2066">And couldn’t understand, I mean, so-some – some silly thing, some unrealistic thing.</span> <span id="s2067">I mean, they come, they arrest the farmers there, you know, they bring them to Siberia, but what for, I mean, what did they do, and the whole family?</span> <span id="s2068">Why – why the whole family?</span> <span id="s2069">If the farmer did something wrong, you know, hm.</span> <span id="s2070">We di-didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2071">It – it looks kind of silly to me, I – but then I remembered, then I remembered that – that – that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2073">So – and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Ye – oh – we didn’t know what’s going on to – to the extent that oh, some of the people we know, you know, when the – they came for them to be deported, the – the father of the family, the man, ran away.</span> <span id="s2075">He saw, you know, somebody coming, he thought they’re coming to arrest him, because there were so many arrests, you know?</span> <span id="s2076">But n-not the families, there were people arrested, whoever was, you know, they wanted to arrest.</span> <span id="s2077">So they ran away and ha – hid, and their family was taken and dep – brought to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2078">Now, the man realizing that, came out, went to the railroad station, and whatever happens, he wanted to be with his family.</span> <span id="s2079">He didn’t realize that families were broken up, that the men were sent to concentration camps, and the families were sent to the – to the Siberian farms and something like that.</span> <span id="s2080">So you see, even at the moment, people were so – that confused, didn’t know, you know, the method what was going on.</span> <span id="s2081">So there was no sense for him because he was – he wasn’t let to go with his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: But he was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: He was ta – oh, of course, yeah, he was taken, yeah.</span> <span id="s2084">And very few survived there, i-in there, in particular the first deportation.</span> <span id="s2085">But, as I say, we realized that the Jews are also being deported, yes, and quite – quite many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: How did you realize this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Well, we saw, I mean, people just disappearing all – all around you.</span> <span id="s2088">Ma – my friend Rubinsteinas(ph), his family.</span> <span id="s2089">Our – our classmate Borokas(ph), his family, they are deported.</span> <span id="s2090">They were lucky.</span> <span id="s2091">They were lucky, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2092">At that time we were – thought it means how – how bad, how cruel, but they had 50 - 50 chance of survival in Siberia.</span> <span id="s2093">My friend Rubinstein(ph) survived, and Borokas(ph) survived.</span> <span id="s2094">They – they would – I don’t know whether Borokas(ph) was visiting Lithuania, you know, now, and Rubinstein(ph) I don’t – he married local girl, stayed there in Russia.</span> <span id="s2095">Whether he visited Lithuania, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2096">And [indecipherable] but at that time it looked – the horror, the same horror as for the others.</span> <span id="s2097">But many Jewish activists were acting in that deportation.</span> <span id="s2098">So, again, you know, it should have been more.</span> <span id="s2099">The – the people still didn’t – didn’t quite, you know – just because Jews are being deported, didn’t quite, you know, justify the whole Jewish community because of that, because the activists still were there, you know.</span> <span id="s2100">Not the only ones, but there were quite a few of them, quite many.</span> <span id="s2101">Clear majority of the civilians taking care of that, except the Russian soldiers, of course.</span> <span id="s2102">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: So you’re saying a clear majority of those who participated in deportations happened to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: I would say so, I would say so.</span> <span id="s2105">From what I hear, you know, they say the Jews, the Jews, the Jews deported, you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2106">I didn't take any samples or anything like that, but from what I heard, yeah, it seemed so.</span> <span id="s2107">Well, majority was Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: They were in each – in each group was one or two.</span> <span id="s2110">Well, two, at least two, sometimes more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: What happened then, after this, after these deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Well, they stopped for a – just few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: We – we have the feeling that it will resume, that – and – and that was right.</span> <span id="s2115">Later we find out th-that the – they just – they just – system, you know, the railroads, everything, they had to make a break, and then they would have resume.</span> <span id="s2116">So we had the feeling that they – it will resume, but was just a days, and the Germans attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: So the war started for Lithuania then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: The war started for Lithuania June a – a – deportations started in June 14th, I would say, so continued about three days more, maybe – no, it’s three – well, 14, 15, 16, maybe 17, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2119">And 19, 20, oh yeah, and 22, June 22, the Germans attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: And that’s when you last saw go – Uditta(ph) Gormanas(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: Yeah, few – few – a – a day after that, a day after that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: A day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: – I saw Uditta(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: So where were you when you heard news of the German attack?</span> <span id="s2125">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Oh, yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s2127">I was sleeping.</span> <span id="s2128">I was sleeping.</span> <span id="s2129">We – we graduated from our high school.</span> <span id="s2130">There was supposed to be – no matter deportations, there was supposed to be a picnic in – in – in – in Berchunai(ph), which is a resort near Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2131">We had to go that – that day, that Sunday.</span> <span id="s2132">And suddenly there was a thunder, a very strong thunder, and I thought, my goodness, th-there goes the picnic, you know, that is a thunderstorm.</span> <span id="s2133">And then there was an explosion.</span> <span id="s2134">I mean, I thought it’s thunder, but somehow the sound came through the – through the ground, not through the air.</span> <span id="s2135">Such a strong that our small house, you know, just – just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Shook?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: – swayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: I sh – no – stood up shock a-and went out outside to see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2140">There was no storm, there were no clouds.</span> <span id="s2141">The sky was clear, and pani – Pajuoste were – was the military base behind Panevėžys, there was a huge cloud going up of the explosion, apparently, huge cloud.</span> <span id="s2142">And there were a lot of planes ou – in the sky, but they were high up.</span> <span id="s2143">Now, what’s going on here, you know, something exploded in – in – in – in – in Pajuoste, definitely.</span> <span id="s2144">So – and then I saw, you know, it suddenly, I think five planes came through, pretty low.</span> <span id="s2145">Yellow s – this – the – the – the – yellow signs and the black crosses, black – oh – oh, I knew the German military sign – i-insignia.</span> <span id="s2146">Black crosses, that was German military – military planes, black planes, so that was clear.</span> <span id="s2147">Five, in formation going there, you know, on – over Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2148">So that – that was war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: And [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Then my mother came out, you know, and we started dancing, they are not going to defe – deport us to Siberia, see?</span> <span id="s2151">War was salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: For you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: For us, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s2154">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: When did you first see a German soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: There were a few days ca – went by, I came back from home, and we were – we were – also dur – during the nighttime we went outside, there was a – a small building, really without windows, so we thought rather a safe place, so we decided to o-over – stay overnight there.</span> <span id="s2157">And we heard, you know, we heard cars going on, motorcycles, commands, but very difficult to say, commands in any language sounds similar.</span> <span id="s2158">And suddenly a motorcycle went through our street very quickly.</span> <span id="s2159">Most likely it was already the German, but we stayed inside until morning, and in the morning somebody come running and said, Germans are in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Was this the day after you – the day after the war started, or a few days –</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: Oh no, no, no, Panevėžys were not that fast, yeah.</span> <span id="s2162">Vilnius, Kaunas [indecipherable], it’s surprising Vilnius was taken first, when – before Kaunas, and Lithuanians rewa – you know, took over Vilnius even before Germans attacked.</span> <span id="s2163">Then Kaunas the same thing.</span> <span id="s2164">But Panevėžys was between the German armored attacks.</span> <span id="s2165">It was not that important military center, so it came – I think it was 26th.</span> <span id="s2166">Warsaw the 22, the re – Lithuanian insurrection started 23, and Panevėžys was taken, I think, 26.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: So if the insurrection started in – in – o-on June 23rd, and you know, it was Lithuanian, how did it express itself in Panevėžys, what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Nothing much, the – because nobody had weapons, organization was broken down by deportations.</span> <span id="s2169">They was supposed to get weapons su – from somewhere, but the people who were supposed to get those weapons, some of them were deported, the other went into hiding.</span> <span id="s2170">One went to Kaunas, participated the – in the revolt there.</span> <span id="s2171">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Were you supposed to be part of this, was this a resistance group –</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: – that you were taking par – uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yes, but – but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s2176">We just didn’t have anything, no – no weapons, no – well, organization was – we reestablished organization, but so what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: So we – we just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: So was it a sind – was it a city without any rule, or any law, or any – any – how shall I say, any government at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: No, Soviets were there, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: The Soviets were still there?</span> <span id="s2182">Until the 26th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Until the 26th, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: So, it wasn’t an empty city of – of soldiers, it was – the minute one left [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Well, it is strange.</span> <span id="s2186">There were moments when there were none.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: The Russians were – retreated, you know, somewhere, you know, and there was none.</span> <span id="s2189">And then the Russians again, came again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: There was a moment when there was a rumor that Germans are in the city, and the NKVD took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: You mean the en – the Soviet Secret Police?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: Th-They took off and – and the rest of the Russians took off, and there was the city without an-any government.</span> <span id="s2196">And then they realized that it’s not true, so they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: There was terror, you know, they were – they were murdering – murdering people at the factory, sugar factory, tens – tens of people, and there were those doctors, surgeons, three surgeons and the nurse which were very cruelly murdered.</span> <span id="s2199">Well, the terror was – in – in – in Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Did you know it at the time, or is this something you learned later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: How did you learn about these murders?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Well, for – from – from the telling, you know, from –</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: People.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: – from – from the people, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: But that – that was factual information, as we found out.</span> <span id="s2208">It wasn’t a – a rumor.</span> <span id="s2209">Yeah, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Did you stay at home during these days that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: No, no, w-we decided t – we didn't find any we-weapons, we didn’t do anything useful, so my friend and myself decided to go to a neighboring vil-village behind the city, and – to see may the – maybe there the Šauliai have hidden some weapons, maybe so.</span> <span id="s2212">So we went there, didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s2213">Yeah, ba – the Soviet m-mili – Soviet mi-military came upon, you know, and were ch – starting shooting at us, so we ran away and hid.</span> <span id="s2214">And we sit – sit there for two or three days, and then I decided to come back to Panevėžys, and I came back and the city was kind of dead.</span> <span id="s2215">In – in the early afternoon there were nobody watching the streets except the military patrol – patrols.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: And this was Soviet still military?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Soviet, Soviet, yeah, so – so when I – when I saw them or heard them, I just made a – a turnaround through other streets, you know, and came home, finally without – without meeting any of them directly, face to face.</span> <span id="s2218">Meanwhile, the prison was evacuated and many of the people were being killed at the sugar factory.</span> <span id="s2219">But if –</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Why were they being killed at the sugar – sugar factory is just a place where – where candy was manufactured, or sugar was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: No, sugar, sugar, sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: – sugar was manufactured?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: Well, it was just apparently convenient place, I don’t know, they just dig the – the ditches and kill the people.</span> <span id="s2224">They were mostly from – from other towns brought to Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: So it was used as a quasi prison or a holding place and – and a – and then became an execution site?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: Yes, I – I would say so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: But th-then the prison became empty and some of the prisoner – pr – people who worked in the prison [indecipherable] my mother.</span> <span id="s2229">My father was digging di – digging anti – anti-aircraft, you know, well ditches, how do you call, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Trenches?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Trenches, yes.</span> <span id="s2232">So he was not home, I was not home, my mother was home.</span> <span id="s2233">So he – she – she thought that I might be arrested there, and they arrested.</span> <span id="s2234">The NKVD arrested a lot of young people in the streets, including my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: So my fr – wh-wh-when my mother knew that, you know, the – was told that the NKVD, the Soviet secret police left the prison, she told other people in the neighborhood that, let’s go there and – and let people out, you know, from the prison.</span> <span id="s2237">So one of the neighbors brought a ladder, came over, you know, opened the – the gate, and went to the prison.</span> <span id="s2238">Some of the prisoners were already breaking out from their cells, but it was very slow thing, so he showed where the keys are, and opened all the keys, and suddenly prison was empty.</span> <span id="s2239">All this young people came out into the neighboring houses, and meanwhile NKVD came back.</span> <span id="s2240">They – they had somebody guarding, and gave a signal that they are coming back, so everybody disappeared and they came back to the empty – empty prison.</span> <span id="s2241">Well, was too late to do anything, it was hours before the Germans appeared.</span> <span id="s2242">But still, you know, the – the – they – they knocked out a German – a – a Soviet tank somewhere you know, I don’t know, he was late, some [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2243">So that’s – that’s how – how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: Now, in many places, pogroms started even before the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Did that happen in Panevėžys as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: No, I – it’s a – my – what I know, what I have seen, is limited.</span> <span id="s2250">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: I realize that, you know, [indecipherable] from what I read, was completely different in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2252">The Germans came in right there and started anti-Jewish actions right there involving Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2253">In Vilnius also pretty soon like that.</span> <span id="s2254">But Panevėžys the Germans didn’t care about anything except their military tasks, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s2255">And nobody attacked Jews until – until the funeral of the doctors and the other people who were killed by the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Tell us about how they were killed, the doctors, and then what was this funeral, when was it, and why was this a catalyst?</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: Why the doctors were killed is – is – I – ou – nobody really understands.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: What were the circumstances of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: The doctors were operating on Soviet soldiers which were injured by the German bombing of Pajuoste.</span> <span id="s2260">They were brought to the hospital and the doctors, the surgeons were working on them, operating, and the nurse also, she – she works wi-with the doctors.</span> <span id="s2261">Now, somebody said that somebody broken into the hospital looking for weapons, because the soldiers brought to the hospital, they thought maybe they could get weapons there.</span> <span id="s2262">Which is nonsense, nobody brought them with the be – weapons.</span> <span id="s2263">I mean, they were injured – injured soldiers, so they were brought to the hospital, the weapons stayed wherever they were serving.</span> <span id="s2264">But I don’t know how much is rumor, how much is right, but in any case, there were some communist youth guards in the hospital and they telephoned the security that somebody is trying to break into the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: That is the secret police, the Soviet –</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: Secret police, yeah.</span> <span id="s2267">And then the secret police came, took the doctors, took the nurse and just – just killed them – not – not just shot, but really, you know, murder – murdered them to – to death, you know, by – by – by horrible, horrible torture.</span> <span id="s2268">How?</span> <span id="s2269">It’s – it’s nonsense, I mean, the doctors, I d – I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: And you found out about thi –</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: I-It would – you see, the people – the people are most dangerous, and most cruel when they are very afraid.</span> <span id="s2272">Russians were, at that time, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s2273">They were su-suddenly confronted with the German action, which was very powerful, and they were afraid, they – they – they realized that all the surroundings are hostile to them, the Lithuanian surroundings, so they were terrified.</span> <span id="s2274">And terrified people are dangerous people, because they are irrational then, and they just – so-so that – that’s – that’s my observation from that.</span> <span id="s2275">So I – that’s how I can explain that, because there is – does – doesn’t make any sense, there were n-no weapons in the – in the hospital and no possibility of the weapons [indecipherable] real, you know.</span> <span id="s2276">So so-somebo – somebody got scared, confused, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: And so – and they did away with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Oh, of course, yeah, then the funeral, bu-but not only the doctors, but also the people, about I don’t know, 20 - 30 people at the – at this sugar factory, various people who were arrested by securities earlier.</span> <span id="s2279">There, you know, in command, was that Lithuanian communist who was living in our house.</span> <span id="s2280">He was in command of that execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Ahh.</span> <span id="s2282">Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: And th-there – there was different, there they – they were executing because they thought, I mean, this is anti-Soviet people.</span> <span id="s2284">Ma – so then th – not – not in such a fear and as – as in the case of the doctors.</span> <span id="s2285">Now, nobody until now, I never heard that anybody would men – mention that any Jew was involved in that.</span> <span id="s2286">We don’t know Russian security personnel, maybe there were, maybe there were not, but nobody established that any Jew ba – that Lithuanian was is – in command, you know, at the sugar factory that wo –</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: So, another betrayal of a – of the worst kind, is a – it is a Lithuanian who is a communist –</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: – who is killing his own people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2293">Yeah, so – so there was no – no reason for any anti-Jewish action, but there was.</span> <span id="s2294">After the funeral, I went [indecipherable] they said they are beating Jews.</span> <span id="s2295">Well, I went to see wha – where, you know, and really we saw it, you know, the people were just standing and watching.</span> <span id="s2296">And three, maybe four, most likely three burly men were hitting, you know, at the small houses there – there were Jewish s-stores, you know, several Jewish stores at that place.</span> <span id="s2297">They were just breaking the windows, the doors, you know, beating it up.</span> <span id="s2298">And the people were just standing and watching what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2299">Nobody said, you know, anything to them, to those three peop-people there.</span> <span id="s2300">Obviously they were a – a – there were Jews there, you know, living in there.</span> <span id="s2301">And suddenly a man came out with a bl-bloody face, apparently a Jew.</span> <span id="s2302">And when the people saw the blood, you know, all this group of people who were standing yo – just stepped back, you know, maybe three steps back and dis-dispersed right there.</span> <span id="s2303">They were calling, you know, to join the people, but nobody joined them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: The three burly men were calling to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: – have people join them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Yeah, but we – nobody joined, but no-nobody even objected to anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Okay, so nobody condemned, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: No.</span> <span id="s2310">Well, I think it was implied, condemnation.</span> <span id="s2311">It was implied.</span> <span id="s2312">People – people, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: But they didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: They didn’t say – they say – didn’t say anything, yeah.</span> <span id="s2315">And they just dispersed, and – obviously they were sent from somewhere, you know.</span> <span id="s2316">Obviously some – some [indecipherable] tha-that was not s – anything spontaneous.</span> <span id="s2317">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Is that the first vi – anti-Jewish violence that you saw –</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: – in Panevėžys?</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: And do you think there was a connection between the funeral of these – you know, these people who were victims of the NKVD and that Lithuanian communist and whatever you know, units or rule that he had?</span> <span id="s2325">Do y – do you think it was just coincidence that it happened this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: No, not a coincidence, but a – somebody wanted to establish a relationship, which wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: Since nobody appro – nobody co – even – even from the [indecipherable] nobody accused that Jews were involved.</span> <span id="s2329">In other places there were such a – such accusations, I read, but not in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2330">Until now, nobody mentions that any Jew was involved in those actions, doctors or sugar fac – factory, no.</span> <span id="s2331">So apparently somebody want to make a connection, sent those three men there, you know, maybe paid them, and tried to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: And do you think a connection was made?</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: – in-insight them.</span> <span id="s2334">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2335">Not as – as far as me is concerned, but I don’t know about the other people.</span> <span id="s2336">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2337">I don’t think that even after that, nobody – nobody talked ab-about the Jews in connection with that – with those br –</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: Incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: – those incidents, yeah.</span> <span id="s2340">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: What happened – okay, so there’s a – there’s this period of four days between the Soviet retreat, come back, retreat, come back, and the German final establishment in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: And you – you – you first saw the planes and so on.</span> <span id="s2344">When it finally was established, that is, there was no return of any Soviet forces, is that when the funeral took place?</span> <span id="s2345">Was it at that point –</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: Oh no, several days after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: Several days after that, I don’t know how many – you know, two or – two – at least two, maybe three days after that, because the Germans had time to bring foreign journalists from Berlin by plane, they brought to Panevėžys to show the journalists what the Russians have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Ah, a propaganda move.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: So, a-and the journalists, even American journalists were there because America was not in war at that time yet with Germany.</span> <span id="s2353">American and Swiss, Swedish.</span> <span id="s2354">And I know about that story because there was one Lithuanian from Klaipėdos, Klaipėda area.</span> <span id="s2355">He was very much anti-German, his whole life anti-German, but he knew languages, and he – he was a refugee when the Germans took over Klaipėda, he lived in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2356">But he was kind of drafted, or asked as a translator for the journalists.</span> <span id="s2357">Journalists knew German, but not the real Lithuanian kn-knew German good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: And he knew.</span> <span id="s2360">So, the Germans brought them to those doctors and others and showed the places, and then later there was kind of like, I don’t know, like place for – for them to wait until the plane was ready to take them back.</span> <span id="s2361">And this Lithuanian translator whom I – who – was also our family friend, so he was telling us that one of the American journalists took him away and said, look, you know, this, all those killed people, that’s – that’s what the Germans did, didn’t they?</span> <span id="s2362">He said no, no, no, that – that was Soviets.</span> <span id="s2363">Oh, he says, that’s – that’s clear, that’s clear, thank you.</span> <span id="s2364">And then he wanted to – to – to talk with him and the American wouldn’t talk with him at all.</span> <span id="s2365">So the German propaganda didn’t take, I mean, the – the – that – at least this journalist was convinced that was a German –</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Action.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: – action.</span> <span id="s2368">And this, from – from Klaipėda, who all his life was fighting against the Germans, and e-even until – he always was, even after that inc – incident, but – but he was upset about the – th-the western prejudices.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: And he – th – it sounds like the western journalist, the American journalist, was looking upon him, the translator as being in the service of the Germans, because it served the German propaganda privasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2371">Well, apparently he was convinced that the Russians don’t do such things, nome – and the Germans do.</span> <span id="s2372">Which is true as – as far as the Germans are concerned, just the first – just the first part not – not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2374">So let’s go forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: And the funeral happens, you see the – this beating up of – of Jews and their houses by these three men.</span> <span id="s2377">And then what happens within Panevėžys?</span> <span id="s2378">How do things develop further?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: Well, horribly, because there were a lot of killing.</span> <span id="s2380">Revenge killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: People, you know, ju-just under suspicion that somebody was in the communist youth organization or something, were taken out and shot, without any i-inquiry, without any court, without any pro-procedure, just like that, you know, and a lot of innocent people were just killed, like this – in Panevėžys and in surrounding villages, like that.</span> <span id="s2383">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2384">Some of them were Jewish, I don’t know how many of those, but definitely just some – some Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s2385">Some Lithuanians, some Russians, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: Do y – was this done – was this done without German involvement?</span> <span id="s2387">Was this sort of like a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: I would say without.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: Without.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Ja – that was just Lithuanian project.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Not – not a project, there was a staff, you know, just when the Germans marched – marched in, I saw the Germans right there, you know, at my gymnasium, and the girls were, you know, greeting them with flowers and – and milk and water and [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] and one of our classmates who ran away to Germany was – I didn’t see him, but he went by, you know, he was drafted by Germans as translator, going through Lithuania.</span> <span id="s2393">So we – Lithuanian flags everywhere.</span> <span id="s2394">The only German flag under their military establishment, and even that flag was a war flag, not the regular German flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: So, according to that, that’s kind of correct, I mean, that’s the army.</span> <span id="s2397">They don’t claim that – that city or that part.</span> <span id="s2398">So – and there was a staff, Lithuanian staff is – they said, I went there, you know, and so – volunteered for in – ins – in service there.</span> <span id="s2399">They gave me a – a rifle, the automatic Russian – automatic rifle, ammunition, and a – a – how do you call it, armband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2401">What color is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: It – it identify – pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: What color was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: It was red.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: It was red?</span> <span id="s2406">A: What was surprising, but there were signs, you know, ah-ah-ah-ah – was ga – was a red – up in the red material or something.</span> <span id="s2407">In Panevėžys it was red, but it was – it had insignias, it – different insignia.</span> <span id="s2408">And that’s it, we went into th – into the service there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: Apparently some from our service were killing people, apparently.</span> <span id="s2411">I don’t know, after that, whe-when they were killing, apparently they felt like big heroes, you know.</span> <span id="s2412">Like –</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Killing anti-com – killing communists, killing Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: Yeah, killing communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Killing communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: Communists.</span> <span id="s2417">J-Jews weren’t – at that point wer – I don’t think – I am not sure, but I don’t think they were killed just because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s2418">They suspected they are communists, that’s – something like that.</span> <span id="s2419">Anyway, not the families –</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: And were these people who – who were, you know, when you volunteered, and others, were they all about your age, about 18 - 19 at the time, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: They were sa – yes, well, the lower, ba – ba – could be – could be higher than that, too.</span> <span id="s2422">In their 20s something, up to 26 - 27 maybe.</span> <span id="s2423">Something like that.</span> <span id="s2424">So, pretty soon, you know, the people in – in Panevėžys were very concerned about that, that innocent people are being killed, so they had contacted the leadership of that staff, and you know, said – and then, you know, the – the staff – staff was responsible, they get weapons.</span> <span id="s2425">Th-Th-They have those armbands.</span> <span id="s2426">So after that they stopped this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: What did they a – what had been your duties?</span> <span id="s2428">You weren’t involved in that, but what had they asked you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">A: Well, my first duty, or first thing, we – they – they send me to Pajuoste together with others in – in – in a truck, to pick up the ammunition.</span> <span id="s2430">There was a lot of ammunition, loose ammunition in Pajuoste.</span> <span id="s2431">So, we went there and took the – those heavy boxes of ammunition in the truck, and brought to the staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: And is that when you had last seen Uditta(ph) Gormanas(ph), at that point, or at –</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: No, no, that before, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: That was already before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Th-That was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: And – okay, then – then we se – wait, we went back, second time.</span> <span id="s2438">Second time when we back, Germans – German soldiers were there, they just looked.</span> <span id="s2439">Wh-What are you doing, you know, here?</span> <span id="s2440">We s – we said we have, you know, the instructions from our staff to take ammunition.</span> <span id="s2441">Out.</span> <span id="s2442">Out of here, no ammunition, nothing.</span> <span id="s2443">Well, out, okay.</span> <span id="s2444">So we went back to staff, said to them, and Germans didn’t let us pick up any more.</span> <span id="s2445">Okay.</span> <span id="s2446">So then tol – they told me to take a group of my friends and go and see the – there is a report that some communists, or maybe even Russian soldiers, straggling soldiers are in a big building, Meistas(ph) factory, or a – a b – a building, that they might be hiding there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: Check that.</span> <span id="s2449">Okay, I go with my f – my – my men in there, you know, to check that, and well, the building is high, hm.</span> <span id="s2450">There are very few windows, only very high up.</span> <span id="s2451">Well, we started approaching the building, everybody just coming together, I said no, I mean, if they was going to shoot, you know, they got us all, so just spread, just spread.</span> <span id="s2452">And we approaching the building and then the German comes in, the German sergeant and asks, who is in charge of this thing?</span> <span id="s2453">They – so – so me, you know?</span> <span id="s2454">He co – approached me and said, hey, what’s going on, what – what war are you fighting here?</span> <span id="s2455">Well, what war?</span> <span id="s2456">Well, I patiently explained to him that I have instructions, something [indecipherable] report there about something like that.</span> <span id="s2457">Out.</span> <span id="s2458">I – I am taking over this duty, I will take care of that.</span> <span id="s2459">So, we wanted to stay and take a look, you know, how –</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: How he takes care of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: – how he takes care of it.</span> <span id="s2462">No, he didn’t let us, you know.</span> <span id="s2463">He just chased us away.</span> <span id="s2464">Well, going to staff, reporting another, you know, no – no success there.</span> <span id="s2465">Okay, so another reports.</span> <span id="s2466">Some communists may be in some other building.</span> <span id="s2467">Okay, we go to another building.</span> <span id="s2468">Well, it’s a small, small house, small wooden – not a shack really, a house, but it’s a small one – one – one store building.</span> <span id="s2469">Well, the report is that the communists are th – a-are there, you know, or – or the activists there.</span> <span id="s2470">Looking, no nothing – nothing happening in there.</span> <span id="s2471">So he said well, somebody, a volunteer is going inside to see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2472">No volunteers.</span> <span id="s2473">No volunteers, well, what do we do?</span> <span id="s2474">You – you can’t wait until the night, so I’m suppose – then I’m going there.</span> <span id="s2475">Okay, go inside, kick in the door, you know, the door not locked, opens.</span> <span id="s2476">I thought maybe somebody will throw grenade or – or – or shoot, but there was nobody inside, empty.</span> <span id="s2477">But there was something, the [indecipherable] was not quite, some – somebody – there was food, there were things, somebody left it in very big haste.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: Hurried manner, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: Yeah, definitely there was something, but at that time there were nothing, empty.</span> <span id="s2480">Okay, I’ll come back, report that, nothing there.</span> <span id="s2481">So they send me, alone now, report that a – a Jewish communist killed himself, shot himself.</span> <span id="s2482">Go there and see what’s – what – about that report.</span> <span id="s2483">Okay, I go there, in the center of the city, and go, a famil – an old people, fam – family living there, a very nice, old man and old woman living in a small apartment, very nice, very tidy.</span> <span id="s2484">Very scared people.</span> <span id="s2485">I asked about that, yes, there is somebody died, you know, in – in – in the – in a shed outside.</span> <span id="s2486">Outs – so I went into the shed, yes, there is a man, you know, who apparently killed himself, because his pistol was right there, you know, and a lot of money, Russian, Soviet money.</span> <span id="s2487">And a s – a small piece of paper, you know, with scribbled writing, but not Lithuanian, apparently Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2488">So I looked at, he – he was dead, definitely.</span> <span id="s2489">I took the pistol, and the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: Was he shot in the head?</span> <span id="s2491">Did he shoot himself –</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: In the head.</span> <span id="s2493">Yeah, he shot himself in the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Was this the first time you saw a corpse?</span> <span id="s2495">Because up until here, we haven’t talked about you – you’ve talked about things you heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: But not necessarily what you yourself saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: No, I – the only corpses I have seen before, and a f – few of them were during the funerals, during the wake.</span> <span id="s2499">But also very few of them.</span> <span id="s2500">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: So this one is the first sort of war – result of – casualty of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Casualty of – of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: – these events.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2507">But at that time, you know, there was so many dangers we went through, that it didn’t affect me very much.</span> <span id="s2508">I took it as a fact, was just the man killed himself.</span> <span id="s2509">I – I have a task here now, to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: What did he look like?</span> <span id="s2511">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s2512">A: Y-Young man, not gray, dark hair.</span> <span id="s2513">I would say in – in his 30s, maybe.</span> <span id="s2514">Okay, so I take his weapon, his – his pistol, his – his – my – the money, and the – the s – the note and went back to the old Jewish couple, and asked them to translate for me this – this note.</span> <span id="s2515">They did, I scribbled out the translation, and he said that, you know, I am – he is – he always was a communist, believed in communism and now he’s dying for the communist [indecipherable] and something like long live Stalin, or something like that.</span> <span id="s2516">Okay, I wrote it down, and thanked the – the people, and said, you know, report to your community to f – to get the funeral of him, bury him.</span> <span id="s2517">The people were so co – you know, they were also so scared, you know, saying [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: Yeah, what will happen with us, what will happen with us?</span> <span id="s2520">I said, well nothing, old people, you know, what could happen to them?</span> <span id="s2521">But – nothing, you know, don’t – don’t worry, you know.</span> <span id="s2522">Oh – and the Germans are marching, you know, through the windows you can see artillery going, you know, all – all the German – German thing.</span> <span id="s2523">Well, what the – I – I really believed – I really believed that they are in no danger whatsoever, just like Uditta(ph).</span> <span id="s2524">Was – I believed it was in no danger, I believed that these old people are in no danger whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2525">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: Do you think there was a connection between – [technical direction] Okay.</span> <span id="s2527">It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Algimantas Gureckas, on October 14th, 2010.</span> <span id="s2531">So, Mr. Gureckas, you were with this old – this old couple who were very frightened, old Jewish couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">Q: And you had just found the corpse of a young man in their shed.</span> <span id="s2534">Do you think there was a connection between this young man and them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2536">I think h-he might have been th-their son, or – or a close relative, but I – I didn’t enquire that, and I thought, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: – I – I – I – I ch – I shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s2539">I mean, we were – we just – just – maybe not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: So that was your fourth – that was your fourth –</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: Task.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: – task.</span> <span id="s2543">And you returned to your headquarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: My headquarters, gave the pistol, the am-ammunition, gave the money, gave the note and the translation, and that was a day’s work done.</span> <span id="s2545">So went back home with my friends, and my father met us with the – a toast for a free and independent Lithuania, which we thought it’s being established now, because all the city was just in Lithuanian national colors, and the flags, except for one building where the German commandant was – took over the place.</span> <span id="s2546">So – so tha – at that pla – what we thought is going – going to happen, there will be, well maybe not quite independent, but something like Hungary, or – or Slovakia, something like that, you know, that we will – will be independent country together with – with Germany, you know, allied willingly or not.</span> <span id="s2547">And then the other day, I went to the police, I don’t know why, do-don’t remember exactly, went to the police, and – but I remember the view, which was very shocking to me.</span> <span id="s2548">There was an old man, apparently a Jew, an old man, you know, and he was standing like in the corner, and on his forehead was written in, I would say maybe it looked like wet ashes, you know, make something like that and then smear on that, and it was called žydas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: In Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: In Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: So that means Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: And he was inside the police station?</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: And he was inside the police station, was standing in the corner, the people were going around their business there, you know, nobody was paying any attention to him as far as I could see.</span> <span id="s2555">I don’t know, I – I just left that police and j-just stays in my memory, you know, bec-because it was such a shocking, shocking view for me, for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Q: Was he – do – was he – you say he was an old man, do you remember what he looked like?</span> <span id="s2557">Was he small, was he large?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: No, he was small, he was bald, yeah.</span> <span id="s2559">That – that – that was very shocking to me, that’s why I remember it.</span> <span id="s2560">Well, I went back home, then didn’t have any di – nothing when I went to staff, they had nothing for me for awhile.</span> <span id="s2561">We met some Germans, we drank with them.</span> <span id="s2562">My school German became conversational, but my – when we are – get drunk, you don’t have inhibitions, so it’s mech – much earlier – easier to learn.</span> <span id="s2563">The Germans were very friendly, the soldiers.</span> <span id="s2564">They were – they were soldiers, that’s all they c-cared, you know, they wer – they were fighting their – the war, and no politics, nothing her-here.</span> <span id="s2565">They were friendly people.</span> <span id="s2566">Now, another day I went, and they had another task to me.</span> <span id="s2567">And the Russians – the railroad was a regular western European railroad in Lithuania, the width.</span> <span id="s2568">The Russian railroads had different width.</span> <span id="s2569">So when the Russians took over, they made a more wide, you know, on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Mm-hm, a wider [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: – the Russian – a Russian standard.</span> <span id="s2572">Now, the Germans wanted us to bring it back to the west European, German, or previous Lithuanian standard.</span> <span id="s2573">So I had to – to – to go to the prison.</span> <span id="s2574">There was prisoners of war, Russians, Soviets, you know, Ukrainians, whatever.</span> <span id="s2575">I had to take 120 - 150 of them and bring to the railroad, and let them work on the railroad bringing the – the – the rail width to the regular side.</span> <span id="s2576">And, to watch what – with my friends also, to watch them, you know, working there.</span> <span id="s2577">So that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: So you guarded them, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: We guarded them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: And they were – they were working there.</span> <span id="s2582">It was easy – well, of course, not very easy, easy because th-there were, you know, before, that width, so it was just re-return to the old place.</span> <span id="s2583">And it was narrower, so it’s no problem, n-no – no – no need to extend anything or something.</span> <span id="s2584">But, you know, the rails are heavy, you have to – to lift them and bring it, and so – so it was w-work, you know [indecipherable] many of them.</span> <span id="s2585">Now, I was the control.</span> <span id="s2586">The Ukrainians were very happy people there.</span> <span id="s2587">They were, you know, full of fun, you know, they – they had all kinds of funny stories, and I s-started, you know, to talk with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: In Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: In Russian, yeah.</span> <span id="s2590">They said, you know, all – they were all happy.</span> <span id="s2591">They knew the war was over, will be over in months, they go back to free Ukraine, everything will be just fine.</span> <span id="s2592">And I saw that I lost, I mean, you know, a war discipline, they – they are not working, they are just entertaining me.</span> <span id="s2593">So, I had problem, you know, until I [indecipherable] on them to work.</span> <span id="s2594">The Russians were very up – not very, but they are upset, sad, you know.</span> <span id="s2595">They were working, but obviously they – they – they were not happy, not like Ukrainians, it’s – it’s a very big difference between.</span> <span id="s2596">There were other nationalities.</span> <span id="s2597">There was one of them, they knew no Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: But it was a Soviet soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: It was a Soviet soldier, he was from Kaukas(ph) or somewhere, th-the Russians told me, he is from Kaukas(ph), so he doesn’t know any Russian.</span> <span id="s2600">Yeah, so I don’t know who he was, but di – you showed to him, he-he did, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s2601">They never – I wa – I never asked them, but they never complained, th-they – I never asked how they are fed or something like that, but apparently there were no problem, because nobody complained to me that they didn't have hot food or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: How did they look?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: They look alright to me.</span> <span id="s2604">There is just a few days –</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: – they became p-prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2607">They were under Lithuanians, not under the German rule.</span> <span id="s2608">The Germans some – somehow, you know, they are supposed to be under the Germans, you know, but they were under the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2609">So they working several days, we were working at that’s – that’s rail – rail somehow is re-established the – the discipline with – with a difficulty with my Ukrainian friends.</span> <span id="s2610">And finally, it was going fr – really fast, you know, the – the work was done, some distance from Panevėžys, and that was done, you know, my task was finished, I – back to the staff, gave back the rifle, the ammunition, the armband, was done.</span> <span id="s2611">Went home.</span> <span id="s2612">My participation in the second World War was complete, without the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: At that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Yeah, without point.</span> <span id="s2615">Let me tell you, at that point – without – without – without any shot being fired from my gun, I – I didn't – didn’t have any – no need, no opportunity.</span> <span id="s2616">I wasn’t in any fi-fighting in the action, nothing.</span> <span id="s2617">So I came back home and just was waiting until the Lithuanian army will be reestablished, we will be mobilized and we’ll be sent to fight the – the Soviets together with the Germans, just like Finns, like Hungarians, Italians, Bulgarians are doing.</span> <span id="s2618">So that was the big illusion, you know, and no – no Germans didn’t – didn’t want any – any of our services, and – of Lithuania’s service.</span> <span id="s2619">Now, as far as the Jews are concerned, until that, you know, nothing happened except for those p-previ – early executions.</span> <span id="s2620">The early executions, of some of the com – my communist friends, you know, that – who were in the communist youth organization, fled together with the Soviet army when the Germans approached Panevėžys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: So you had communi – you had friends who had been part of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Yeah, they were from my class, well, what can you do?</span> <span id="s2623">So, yeah, th-the two of them were killed, you know, there in action, you know, against the German.</span> <span id="s2624">They tried to attack a German tank, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s2625">But the others retreated together with the – some communists with the si – this communist who lived in our house and who was participating in executions at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: Sugar shack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: – sugar factory.</span> <span id="s2628">And th-those come – those communist youth people, they – they got rifles, they were – had weapons, and they were f-fleeing together with the red army, retreating.</span> <span id="s2629">The Germans, well, you need map really.</span> <span id="s2630">The Germans went one way from K-Kaunas to Dofilis(ph) in Latvia, Pskov in Russia, directly towards Saint Peterburg; Leningrad, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">Q: Mm-hm, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">A: But one f – another was big – big move from Pilzzeit(ph) to Tauragė, Šiauliai, [indecipherable] Riga, and farther away into Estonia.</span> <span id="s2633">And Panevėžys is in between.</span> <span id="s2634">So they were fleeing toward north, not toward the east.</span> <span id="s2635">Of course, toward the east the Germans were already advancing there.</span> <span id="s2636">They fled to – reached Latvia, Jēkabpils, which is on the Daugava river.</span> <span id="s2637">And so that on the other side of Daugava are – the German tanks are going.</span> <span id="s2638">Apparently – the communists apparently, for instance, this communist who lived in our house, de – he survived.</span> <span id="s2639">He – he e – he escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: He escaped, because he later was parachuted into Lithuania, caught by the Germans and – and hanged by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2642">And so he – he escaped, but then of course was thrown back as a paratrooper.</span> <span id="s2643">But my f – but the young friends from the communist youth thought it’s – it’s hopeless.</span> <span id="s2644">They said that they threw their rifles into the Daugava river, and walked back to Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2645">Well, it took couple of weeks, I guess, until they arrived back.</span> <span id="s2646">Nobody was interested, nobody bothered them, nobody enquired about them, nothing.</span> <span id="s2647">If they wouldn’t have fled, they would have shot.</span> <span id="s2648">They would have killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: They would have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: The first – first day, yeah.</span> <span id="s2651">Such people like them, they were killed first day, no questions asked.</span> <span id="s2652">What a difference two weeks made.</span> <span id="s2653">Nobody was interested, nobody even asked them where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Or who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Or who they were, yeah.</span> <span id="s2656">They lived just normal life.</span> <span id="s2657">One of them’s living in Klaipėda now, raising his family, that’s – he was Russian, yeah, ethnic Russian.</span> <span id="s2658">Yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: So, you – you fired not a single shot from your rifle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: Not a single shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: But you said that some who did join this national guard, the Šauliai, you had heard that they had been implicated in murders –</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: – and in massacres.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: What is it that you heard, and did you know of these people personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: Well, there’s the problem.</span> <span id="s2667">I think when they were killing the people, they thought they doing some kind of a heraic – heroic work.</span> <span id="s2668">But they very quickly found out that everybody looks very, you know, agains – ev-everybody’s we – very much against that, and they condemned such a t – such a action.</span> <span id="s2669">So they didn’t brag about that any more, and so I just heard the rumors, yeah, from my class, about one, yes, but it’s a rumor, he never talked about anything like that, so I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2670">I can’t accuse him, because this is terrible accusation, and well, he is killed.</span> <span id="s2671">H-He is killed by the – by the s – by the Soviets, but – on second occupation, he – they found his remains in ter – what does – near Vilnius there, the burial place.</span> <span id="s2672">But – but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2673">Just a rumor about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: But when we’re talking about massacres, are we talking about massacres of Jews, or are we talking about revenge shooting of communists, some of whom might be Jewish, some of whom would not be?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: I imagine that it’s – it’s killing of the communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2678">Jews and not Jews.</span> <span id="s2679">Definitely not Jews, because we know, I mean, who are killed.</span> <span id="s2680">As far as Jews are concerned, we didn’t have that many people so we identify, you know, how many and where.</span> <span id="s2681">I sa – would suspect that the Jews had the worst chance to survive in the – than the Lithuanian communists.</span> <span id="s2682">Well, Lithua – be – if they decided to kill, I mean, there was no chance any more.</span> <span id="s2683">You know, they decide, this is a communist, let’s shoot him.</span> <span id="s2684">And they shot – shot him.</span> <span id="s2685">But I think they had stupid errors, you know, of killing people who were not communists, could happen for the Jews much easier, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: Of the suspicion?</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: Sus-Suspicion and not knowing the community that well.</span> <span id="s2688">In Lithuanian case pretty much well – was known who was, you know, wa – involved that much.</span> <span id="s2689">So I suspect that maybe more Jews.</span> <span id="s2690">But anyway, they were not killed, there were not mass executions like later.</span> <span id="s2691">There were not executions of children, women.</span> <span id="s2692">Well, women, unless they themselves were implicated, but – but not like, you know, the whole families or something like that.</span> <span id="s2693">Just – just thought he’s a communist, a Jew a communist, we’ll kill him, kill him.</span> <span id="s2694">That’s my impression.</span> <span id="s2695">I – I wasn’t close to those things, I saw – well, it’s difficult to say, but it was definitely not – not a mass ex – extermination of the Jews –</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: – at that point, yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: At what point did that start?</span> <span id="s2699">Let’s go – let’s go to this point [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Oh yeah, well, that’s another story.</span> <span id="s2701">Since – you know, it became a pr – as far as I was concerned, became a quiet time, you know, no – no – no service in the – in the mi – of military or police or anything like that, I through with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: You’re finished with high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: You’re finished with high school.</span> <span id="s2704">So my friend from my – from my s – class, asked me to come to the village to be a guest in his sister’s – sister’s ba – wedding.</span> <span id="s2705">And so we went, I went with – to my – near – near Biržai, his – his village, and there was a very si – big wedding, you know, a lot of Biržai beer, which is very good, very, you know, homemade.</span> <span id="s2706">Fine, so we celebrated there.</span> <span id="s2707">Now, after that, he decided to show me the Biržai and the – and the area around, area where he was born and grown and he wanted to show me.</span> <span id="s2708">Well we went to Biržai, went, met the girls there, was nice.</span> <span id="s2709">And the last day before I-I came home, we were walking through his village.</span> <span id="s2710">There were no buildings around, there were fields and roads, and there came a man on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2711">And this man came to a – both of us and said, do you know?</span> <span id="s2712">Biržai Jews are – have been killed.</span> <span id="s2713">We were shocked, I mean, wha-what – what do you mean?</span> <span id="s2714">He didn’t say hello or anything like that, that was the first words he said, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: A total stranger, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: Total stranger.</span> <span id="s2717">Do you know the Biržai Jews were killed?</span> <span id="s2718">No.</span> <span id="s2719">We were – we were shocked.</span> <span id="s2720">And he started telling, he – he just had to tell that the German commandant, the German military said – the Jews were in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s2721">He said that they found, the Germans found that the Jews had hidden weapons, and because of that, you know, he t – took all the Jews, and brought to someplace, you know, outside the city, and they just killed all the Jews.</span> <span id="s2722">All, he said.</span> <span id="s2723">Children, babies.</span> <span id="s2724">The German officer was walking around and shooting babies in the mothers’ hands.</span> <span id="s2725">Whether he participated or not, I don’t know, but he was shocked.</span> <span id="s2726">At least he was apparently guarding, or so.</span> <span id="s2727">He was – he – eyewitness.</span> <span id="s2728">No question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: What would have made you think that he might have participated in it, or in – been involved in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2733">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: But he was an eyewitness, at any rate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: He – well, yeah, he was telling with details everything what was going on.</span> <span id="s2736">He was telling about the doctor who was not brought to the – he was so m – valued that they didn’t bring him to the – the ghetto, he still stayed at his home and his office.</span> <span id="s2737">And the Germans came to pick him up and bring with the other Jews, and he said no, he is not going anywhere.</span> <span id="s2738">And the – well, the German officer pulled out the pistol and just shot him right there in his office.</span> <span id="s2739">And thi-this is – they said, I mean, they just put him in – in the truck and brought to the execution place and threw in with the others.</span> <span id="s2740">And he – he described the execution in great detail.</span> <span id="s2741">He said, the ra – re – Germans were killing, Lithuanians were killing also there, the – those Jews, you know, and he – he told him particularly he – the ch – the killing of the babies for him you – was – was – was the thing, I mean, he just couldn’t – he said, after that, I mean, he – he just resigned from – from the service, and he doesn’t want even to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: Was he a policeman?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: Well, like auxiliary policeman at that time, not a regular in uniform or anything like that, no.</span> <span id="s2744">Tho-Those are – were not involved in – in – in usually in – in Jews’ execution.</span> <span id="s2745">But that was – we were shocked also, hearing that.</span> <span id="s2746">And we thought that’s – it’s a unique thing, as I read in Napoleon’s biography right before going there, you know.</span> <span id="s2747">Th – having time I just picked up a book and read Napoleon’s biography.</span> <span id="s2748">And there is an incident where Napoleon killed the prisoners of war in – in Akah(ph), in – in – today Israel, at that time Turkish Palestine.</span> <span id="s2749">And even, I thought, I mean, even – even Napoleon, whe – really a reasonable military leader, he did things, and I thought well, Biržai will be also in history like Jaffa, you know, some cruelty which happens during the war, you know, without any reason, something – well, what do you mean, I mean Jews were hiding weapons.</span> <span id="s2750">Maybe they were hiding weapons, but somebody prepared even the ditches for the – for the – for th – for them to be killed, you know, before that.</span> <span id="s2751">So s – must be just – just a pretense.</span> <span id="s2752">So, we – we thought that something what’s ha – what’s happened in Biržai, the – we – I went back to Panevėžys, you know, and then I found out no, this thing is going all around.</span> <span id="s2753">And then we found out not only in Lithuania but in Latvia also.</span> <span id="s2754">Hm.</span> <span id="s2755">Now – then we [indecipherable] we saw, in our gymnasium, in ou-our high school came a German detachment, not the regular military, I don’t know, the uniforms were somewhat different, they have digging equipment a lot, and there was – they will kill Panevėžys Jews also, the rumor was there.</span> <span id="s2756">And of course we believed because we knew what happened in Biržai.</span> <span id="s2757">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2758">By the way, I bir – didn’t mention how the ge – ghetto was established, fairly early, but not the first day, not e – not even the first week.</span> <span id="s2759">The Germans had all kinds of announcements, and telling what to do, return the weapons, this, that, you know, all kinds of things, and u-underneath it was – my friends said, you know, if – if it’s not written [indecipherable], we’ll – we’ll executed – them – it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: We’ll be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: – yeah, we’ll shot.</span> <span id="s2762">Not – not worth even reading, but if it says we’ll shot, at least I read it.</span> <span id="s2763">But there was another announcement with – not in German format, establishing a ghetto in Panevėžys, and requiring to wear this yellow star.</span> <span id="s2764">Not to walk on the sidewalks, all this thing.</span> <span id="s2765">I cannot remember, I’m sorry I can’t remember who signed that, whether it was a Lithuanian mayor, or was a German officer, I cannot remember who – who is – un-under whose authority was written – although I know that in some cases Germans printed, a mayor who didn’t sign.</span> <span id="s2766">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q: It doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">A: But doesn’t matter, but I don’t know in Panevėžys, under whose authority it was announced.</span> <span id="s2769">And the ghetto was established.</span> <span id="s2770">At the beginning, the idea of ghetto didn’t seem such terrible, because we thought about medieval ghettos.</span> <span id="s2771">Jews living separately, but well, we imagined, you know, we knew that there were ghettos in Poland already.</span> <span id="s2772">We – we imagined that there – I mean, the Jews are – had in there, their establishments, professionals, you can go there, buy things with th – from the Jews.</span> <span id="s2773">You can go to the doctor, Jewish doctor, you can go to the lawyer.</span> <span id="s2774">And then [indecipherable] they live just separately.</span> <span id="s2775">So, not that bad.</span> <span id="s2776">But when the ghetto was established, it wasn’t the medieval ghetto, it was – everybody was crowded in, in the small place, tak – they didn’t work in their professions, they had to work outside, you know, s-simple some – digging or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">Q: Did you see people being moved into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: No, I didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s2779">I saw people that were working on – on the street with the yellow –</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: – with the yellow star.</span> <span id="s2782">And that also was – made a negative impression on the co – the Lithuanian people in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2783">Tha-That’s – that’s too cruel, that’s too cruel.</span> <span id="s2784">Maybe the Jews did wrong things, maybe they deserved some kind of punishment, but this – this was too much.</span> <span id="s2785">And there was a organization, I know, because my mother knows her – he – she wasn’t pa-part of the organization, but her good friend, this doctor I talked, Dr. Bridges, who talked with the Jewish doctors about, you know, the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation, his wife, and other, mostly from Catholic organizations, made a – a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2786">First of all, there was not enough food for them.</span> <span id="s2787">There was some food, but not enough.</span> <span id="s2788">So thif – that’s first thing what they get for, you know, to – to bring food to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2789">Ghetto was guarded by Li-Lithuanian au-auxiliaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">Q: So the same sort of auxiliaries as this man who was on a bicycle from Biržai?</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2792">Exactly the same.</span> <span id="s2793">But th-they – they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s2794">They – th-they – they cou – you could bring bread and soda, th-they didn’t want, you know, to – to bri – they were supposed not to let to [indecipherable] they just didn’t care.</span> <span id="s2795">And they said, well, we – we – we buy them, you know, some vodka, you know for this service, but – they didn’t ask for that, but it’s – so – but th-there were quite many Jews, and I don’t know, I – I – I just doubt very much that everybody got enough food f – by this smuggling, but – but some, you know, apparently held, because it was a rather – a rather ma – many la – women were involved in that, so I suppose there was – it was – it was senseless.</span> <span id="s2796">I mean, wa – it was something which was a-ab – effective to some – some degree.</span> <span id="s2797">And then, you know, came that – that day of execution.</span> <span id="s2798">And the rumor went around that tomorrow the Jews will be killed.</span> <span id="s2799">First of all, I heard about that from thos – these auxiliaries.</span> <span id="s2800">Some of th-those auxiliaries came to my friends and said, we are not going to kill anybody.</span> <span id="s2801">We are not killers, we are not going to kill anybody.</span> <span id="s2802">If they force me for such – into some executions, we are going to – to flee from the service.</span> <span id="s2803">And they asked my friends, you know, whether we could arrange for them to hide until they could go out of the city toward their villages, and hide there, but right now where – when they ha – when they escape from this.</span> <span id="s2804">So apparently – by the way, h-here the Bishop of Panevėžys comes in.</span> <span id="s2805">He also heard those rumors and in one Sunday – I wasn’t in – in the ch – in the church, it’s – I regret at the time, not a direct witness, but the whole city was talking about that, that the bishop s – talked about thou sho – shall not kill, and he really condemned those who’d kill innocent people, and excommunicated them in advance.</span> <span id="s2806">Those who kill innocent people, or you have killed innocent people he excommunicated and – and condemned them, not by name, because some of them that just didn’t do that yet.</span> <span id="s2807">But, as a – as a category of people, of – of killers.</span> <span id="s2808">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">Q: And he was talking about the massacre of the Jews, the ongoing massacre of the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">A: Yes, and other innocent people, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: – but he was talking about the Jews.</span> <span id="s2813">No – nobody had any doubt, including the Germans, because the Germans reacted.</span> <span id="s2814">They arrested the bishop, put in – in – in the house arrest, and said that he is removed from his – from his duties, and he has to leave Panevėžys altogether.</span> <span id="s2815">Okay, so he left Panevėžys altogether.</span> <span id="s2816">He had the villa in Berciunai, a few kilometers from Panevėžys, and – a small resort, and he went to his vil – to this villa.</span> <span id="s2817">But he didn't resign from a bishop’s duties, he – from the villa he just did his old work as a bishop.</span> <span id="s2818">And Lithuanian administration covered it up, you know.</span> <span id="s2819">So he – he was there, you know, and I know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: Casimiras Paltarokas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">A: Casimiras Paltarokas.</span> <span id="s2824">And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: So did these – did these auxiliaries who came and asked to be hidden until they could return to their villages, did that succeed?</span> <span id="s2826">Were they able to run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: No.</span> <span id="s2828">I asked after this – this thing, you know, my friends wer – did they?</span> <span id="s2829">No, they said, they didn’t need to.</span> <span id="s2830">There was no – no need.</span> <span id="s2831">There were enough, those who went willingly, and those who refused were left alone, but all of them resigned from the service then, because we have – they didn’t want to be associated even with this – the killers, the people.</span> <span id="s2832">So th – at least in Panevėžys there was no – no – well, pressure maybe, but not – not really something, you know, forcing to participate in – in – in executions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Q: So, in other words, those Lithuanians who did participate –</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">A: Did willingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: – did it willingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: Apparently yeah, that’s – that’s the conclusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: And when di – do you remember what month the executions started, when the Panevėžys Jews were liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">A: I di – I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s2839">I have on my – on my memoirs –</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: Was it – or was it in the summer, was it in the early fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: Oh summer, summer.</span> <span id="s2842">Late summer, I would say.</span> <span id="s2843">Maybe late August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2845">So two or three –</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: Yeah, late August, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: So we’re saying June, two or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: No, maybe September already.</span> <span id="s2849">Well, but not – not – not later than that.</span> <span id="s2850">Late –</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Q: So two or three months after the Germans have invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">A: Less, because half a month June, and July – yeah, two, two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">Q: Two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: About two months, yes.</span> <span id="s2855">Apparently ki – i-in other places of Lithuania what I read, you know, there were executions of various kinds much earlier.</span> <span id="s2856">But Panevėžys was a quiet place, and – until the Germans took over, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Q: Did you see – after those rumors, wasn’t it true that actually the next day that happened, or the few days afterwards it happened – I mean, in other words, were the rumors fulfilled?</span> <span id="s2858">A: Which way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">Q: I mean, there – sometimes one can hear that there are rumors and it doesn’t happen that week, it happens the week after.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: No, no, it happened that, because it – there were – they brought – they were telling a story, they brought Russian prisoners of war to dig the ditches for that.</span> <span id="s2861">And when they gave the dimensions of the ditches, the Russians threw – threw off their – their shovels and they refused.</span> <span id="s2862">Because they were Soviet, people they knew, that’s – that’s for their – for execution.</span> <span id="s2863">And they assumed for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: And the Germans finally tell them that that’s for Jews, not for you.</span> <span id="s2866">They didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2867">They didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2868">They had to take their equipment, whatever, dig the ditches themselves, or hired sa – I don’t know, but the Russians wouldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: They were Soviet people, they know what it means to dig a ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Yeah, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: They – yeah, well it’s – it’s na – it’s – it’s – it’s terrible, it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s2873">The day when the executions started was somehow very strange, you know.</span> <span id="s2874">Nobody was talking, people just didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s2875">People – people stopped talking, you know, it was kind of – myself, I went, you know, to s – visit my friend, who lived near the – the street where the road was leading toward Pajuoste where the executions were taking place.</span> <span id="s2876">And the trucks full of – of Jews, I suppose, full of people were just going that direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2879">And to his – with my class friend, we just looked, and didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2880">Didn’t say anything because what – what can you say?</span> <span id="s2881">What can you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: So it’s like the whole city knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Q: The whole city knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">A: Oh yeah, the whole city knew, definitely.</span> <span id="s2886">And the reaction was horrified, horrified.</span> <span id="s2887">I don’t know what – whether all of them, of course, maybe o-ob – obviously, there should have been people who approved.</span> <span id="s2888">Af-After all, there were people who participated.</span> <span id="s2889">But generally, you know, when you go to the city and see the people, you – you can see that everybody’s kind of like paralyzed from horror, what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2890">You ga – the – the – any revenge, anything about the Jews was forgotten by that time, long ago.</span> <span id="s2891">When the Jews were brought into the ghetto, you know, the Lithuanians, th-that – that was the end.</span> <span id="s2892">The Lithuanians didn’t – didn’t approve of that; a ghetto as it was established there, didn’t approve of that, and so – but yeah, that’s – that is a terrible, a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s2893">Yeah, we – we went then, after the execution, oh several, several weeks after the execution, and we went to a farm where one of our friends had the girlfriend i-in that farm.</span> <span id="s2894">The farm was nearest farm to the execution place.</span> <span id="s2895">And we wanted to find out.</span> <span id="s2896">We – we knew, I mean, it – it was a horrible thing happened of a gur – tremendous significance.</span> <span id="s2897">Wanted to find out wa-wa – wh-what – what it was.</span> <span id="s2898">And they said well, the girl couldn’t tell us anything because when the executioner cames, the fa – th-the – the parents, they say, hid her.</span> <span id="s2899">Told her to go upstairs, you know, and the – and to hide, and because those – the killers were going around the co – the house drinking water, vodka, everything.</span> <span id="s2900">But we didn’t really, in such a detail as this from Biržai told, there was nothing – nothing – nothing.</span> <span id="s2901">The same thing, the same Germans and Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2902">German officer also killing, you know, babies.</span> <span id="s2903">Apparently still there’s some resistance of the executioners to kill babies, so the officer had to take them up on himself.</span> <span id="s2904">I’m just – I suppose, that – that’s my deduction.</span> <span id="s2905">The story was told that, you know, one Lithuanian officer was married to a j – Jewish girl, and when the Jews were brought to the ghetto, he went together with her.</span> <span id="s2906">Lived together with her, and when they brought to the execution, he went together with her.</span> <span id="s2907">And he was told, you know, to go out – go away, you know.</span> <span id="s2908">He refused, he went with his wife and was killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">Q: So you got as close as to the farm next to the execution site?</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">A: Right, yeah, wa – the group of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">Q: The group of us.</span> <span id="s2912">But you didn’t go to the execution site?</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">A: Nah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: No.</span> <span id="s2916">Then they said, you know, at the end of the ex-execution it looked like they became insane.</span> <span id="s2917">They were drinking vodka, complaining that th-they – they cannot get drunk, you know, no matter how much vodka they drink.</span> <span id="s2918">And at the end, you know, it was starting g-getting at dusk, you know.</span> <span id="s2919">And some of them started going – the – the Jews had to disrobe, they will start going through their – within they had hidden some – some valuables there, some gold or whatever, some started going through those – their – their – their clothes.</span> <span id="s2920">And one of them, of the executioners, one of them said that you’re not supposed to that, you know, that’s – that’s supposed to leave, you know, for the – for the – for the – the Germans, you know, to take care of it.</span> <span id="s2921">So what they did, they just shot him and threw him together with the Jews in the – in the – in the – in th – in the ditch.</span> <span id="s2922">Now, this is true – true story, because about year, or – or couple of years ago, my friend came to me and said, you know – wanted to check with me his translation of a request of a mother of those – that who was killed there.</span> <span id="s2923">He was asked – she was – wanted to translate into German, was asking the German authority to let dig up the grave, find the remains of her son and remove it and bring it to – to its – a regular cemetery.</span> <span id="s2924">So, I saw that – that letter, which my friend has translated, we looked at the translation.</span> <span id="s2925">So I – I doubt very much a German would have approved that, I don’t know what happened with that story, but apparently that story is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">Q: So that means the one who was there, who was saying you can’t go through the clothes –</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: – this was his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">Q: How many Jews were there in Panevėžys?</span> <span id="s2933">Do you know, approximately?</span> <span id="s2934">Are we talking 10,000, are we talking –</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: No, about s-s 7,000 - 8,000, something less than 10,000 I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: And in Biržai, did you have an idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">A: Less.</span> <span id="s2938">Considerably less, but I know, because the city is much smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">Q: Smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">A: But I – I – I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: After this, did you hear of other such massacres throughout the countryside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s2944">What did you hear after the Panevėžys massacre?</span> <span id="s2945">How did – how did the next several days play out?</span> <span id="s2946">When did people start talking again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: Pretty soon, I suppose, but they were still ob-obsessed by that, and were – really came back to that theme.</span> <span id="s2948">I was working at that time.</span> <span id="s2949">I took a wa – a – a jo – a job in the municipality of Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2950">We see Germans introduce the food – food cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: We were supposed to get that much food, you know, for – and the – this – everybody had to get those cards.</span> <span id="s2953">Now, it’s tremendous operation, you know, every people have to get those cards in Panevėžys.</span> <span id="s2954">Tremendous lines and – and lots of time.</span> <span id="s2955">So they hired people, I was one of them, and many of my friends, to bring those to the people.</span> <span id="s2956">We got those food cards, we had lists of people who live and how many, and we were bringing those cards to the people themselves, so they wouldn’t waste time getting those cards.</span> <span id="s2957">So it was very interesting because I knew pa – pa – got to know Panevėžys as never before.</span> <span id="s2958">You know, all kinds of people from all professions, all – all social levels, you know, all nationalities, except the Jews.</span> <span id="s2959">Except the Jews.</span> <span id="s2960">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2961">And so I brought those cards.</span> <span id="s2962">Most of the people, you know, just signed for it, a-and I go to the next house and so on.</span> <span id="s2963">But some of the people were talkative.</span> <span id="s2964">And – and some – and all – not always, but many of the people were bringing up this – the execution of the Jews, and all negative.</span> <span id="s2965">I suppose that those who were for it, wouldn’t start the discussion at all.</span> <span id="s2966">I just met one who – who was that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">Q: In the bringing of these cards around you mean, or in general you just met one person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: He – he – he – he – let me see, did I bring a – a cards?</span> <span id="s2969">Exactly thinking, I think I was bringing the cards, but he was outside, or he was visiting that fa-family, and I didn’t give him the cards, just the regular – the residents.</span> <span id="s2970">And I don’t know, he was officer in Lithuanian army or – or what, I don’t remember his – his profession, but he said that his – he was one of those, when the deportations started who – who ran away to hide because he thought th-they are coming for him.</span> <span id="s2971">And his family was deported.</span> <span id="s2972">He – hi-his wife and two daughters.</span> <span id="s2973">And he was convinced that the Jews were in that group, and he said he is going to – to participate in killing of the Jews.</span> <span id="s2974">But I doubt very much, because he was telling when the Jews in Panevėžys were already killed, so he had to go to Vilnius or Kaunas, you know, where the executioners were still working.</span> <span id="s2975">I doubt very much whether he did that, but I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">Q: But his sentiment was there.</span> <span id="s2977">In other words, he had that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: – he had that sentiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2981">But that was the only one, and I sup-suppose there were more than that, but I – but I – I – I would imagine that they wouldn’t start that type of conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">Q: And yet, with the people that – who you did have start such conversations, they were still in some shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2984">And th-that’s why they brought up the subject, they just – just couldn’t – couldn’t hold, they just wanted to – to – to speak about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">Q: So all this happened in the first several months after the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">Q: And after the German occupation, and we have another three years, or another two and a half years of – of German occupation, Nazi occupation of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s2988">Anything in those next couple of years occur that was also related to the Holocaust, to the Jewish community, that you came across in your life at that time, or was it pretty much over by the fall of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: In Panevėžys was over, because no Jews were left, unless somebody hid some of the Jews, which happened, as we found out later.</span> <span id="s2990">At that time nobody w-was bragging about it.</span> <span id="s2991">So – but I went to Vilnius, to study in Vilnius and there were ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">Q: Oh yeah, there was a ghetto there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">A: Ghetto there, really two of them at the beginning.</span> <span id="s2994">And yeah, but it was so isolated, and was at – the wall, they were really under the wall there, s-so they were so isolated that we didn’t know what’s going on in there.</span> <span id="s2995">We knew that it – we saw some of the Jews being driven to some kind of work.</span> <span id="s2996">We knew they were, some of them, working in the factories, one factory came up in flames because it seems [indecipherable] there sabotage, because they were working for the German army, for the – getting the cur – th-the furs, you know, for the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: Yeah, so Kailis factory.</span> <span id="s2999">So, but we d – we knew that executions were going on in Paneriai.</span> <span id="s3000">From time to time they were taking out there and – and being killed.</span> <span id="s3001">We knew that some of the Jews escaped.</span> <span id="s3002">Escaped – not only those which were hidden, but escaped into the forests in vil – in Vilnius area and in Kaunas area, I don’t know in other ci-cities.</span> <span id="s3003">And there joined the Soviet guerillas, Soviet partisans, which the movement, at that time, you know, th-the – the Soviet planes were parachuting some of leaders and weapons.</span> <span id="s3004">And th-there was that movement of the Soviet partisans, es-escaped prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war escaped.</span> <span id="s3005">Some of the Lithuanian communists wer – survived, and the Jews who escaped from the ghettos.</span> <span id="s3006">Now, at that time there was Lithuanian resistance movement against the Germans, there was underground press going out, letters, and even at that time I noticed one thing.</span> <span id="s3007">That our press, underground press was reporting what the ger – Germans were doing with the Jews.</span> <span id="s3008">If they killed, you know, thousand or s – or – or – or – or so Jews in Kaunas, there was a – a – a – a notice, a report.</span> <span id="s3009">There were reports about Jewish guerillas, the Soviet guerillas, but there was no judgment.</span> <span id="s3010">And even speaking with the people, they didn’t, most of the pe – they didn’t speak about those things, but if there was – they spoke about the Jewish guerillas, I – I didn’t meet anybody who would condemn them.</span> <span id="s3011">At that time it was clear that they were fighting, that was the only chance to fight for their life.</span> <span id="s3012">So, ba – what – what – nobody see how – how you can condemn them.</span> <span id="s3013">They were on the other side, they were enemies.</span> <span id="s3014">Our Lithuanian s-security forces, auxiliaries were fighting against go – Soviet guerillas, also against the Jewish Soviet guerillas, but not because they’re Jew, because they were fighting against the Soviets.</span> <span id="s3015">Well, that was, the war was going on, Lithuanians were fighting Polish guerillas also.</span> <span id="s3016">But there were no – there was not – not that, as a div – during the first occupation, where there was that resentment.</span> <span id="s3017">There was no resentment.</span> <span id="s3018">They were on the other side, they were like – like enemy, which you do not condemn, you know, he – I fight for one cause, he is fighting for another.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">Q: What were you studying in Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">A: Law.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">Q: Law.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">Q: And did the name Jakub Gens mean anything to you then, did you know of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">Q: Did you know of the Lithuanian security chiefs at the time in Vilnius, Lileikis, Gimzauskas, did those names mean anything to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">A: No, but my – one of my friends, who studied together with us in my class, he was working in Lithuanian security under the Germans, and – and a-as an officer.</span> <span id="s3029">He was studying and working in the city already.</span> <span id="s3030">But his job was in particular, against the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s3031">He was well – and he was killed by the Polish underground when he was trying to arrest somebody or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">A: So I knew him very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3035">And did he have anything to say about the workings there, or was he pretty quiet about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">A: He was kind of quiet, yeah, generally he was a quiet man.</span> <span id="s3037">But no-nothing – but as far as I know he had nothing to do with the Jews, but I can’t be sure.</span> <span id="s3038">I can’t be sure, but really against the Poles, and still continued that hostility.</span> <span id="s3039">Doesn’t matter, you know, because the German occupation, but Lithuanians were still fighting the Jew – the Jew – the Polish, and the Polish Lithuanian, fighting Lithuanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">Q: Yeah, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">A: E-E-Even at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">Q: If there – is there anything else that you would like to add to events that touched – that again, you heard of, or were inv – or were involved in, in a sense of – of being in a certain place when something happens, about the Jews during the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">A: About the Jews during the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3045">Since you were in Panevėžys and you were in Vilnius –</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">Q: – is there any other memory, any other event or instance in those two and a half, three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">A: No, not really, except that, you know, in Vilnius I-I was a student, and between the students and – and some wa – in the higher class, were definitely condemn – with old – the opinion was condemning those who had participated in executions, and even at that time were participating, because more or less, killing of the Jews in Paneriai – Austai(ph) Paneriai took place all the time, sometimes less, sometimes more and the killers were working all the time.</span> <span id="s3049">Of course, killers were killing not only the Jews, they were killing also the Poles, and well, Lithuanians, Germans killed themselves.</span> <span id="s3050">But th-they killed them also.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: Yeah, the Lahavichos(ph) – it was territorial defense organization, which General Lahavichos(ph) organized with the agreement with Germans, but later, you know, fell out.</span> <span id="s3053">Germans arrested him and disarmed that defense force and killed, you know, hundreds of – of his soldiers.</span> <span id="s3054">And then the, you know, Lithuanians from the east Prussia, not from Klaipėdos, but even farther, Tilžė and all that, they f – they were, you know, fled from Nazis to Lithuania in Vilnius, they arrested and executed them in Austai(ph) Paneriai also.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">Q: And the reason was because of activities, or because of –</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">A: Oh, activities, they were pu-publishing in Lithuanian newspaper, Lithuanian books.</span> <span id="s3057">Well, of course, that was all over, because they had to flee from the Nazis and they came to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3058">And – but the tils – Tilžės – Tilžės – Tilszin(ph) Gestapo still had, you know, get in – in th – in their – in – in their plans, and as far – as soon as Germans occupied Lithuania into Vilnius and they came from Tilžė, they just took them out and executed the whole two families there.</span> <span id="s3059">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">Q: How – I s – I have a sense that we’re gon – coming close to the end of our story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: How did things end with you in Lithuania?</span> <span id="s3063">What happened with your family?</span> <span id="s3064">What happened in 1944 as the war was turning?</span> <span id="s3065">Bring us up to date as how you came to live in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: Well, I – I don’t know whether I should go through – through small detail, but after university was closed – the Germans closed the university.</span> <span id="s3067">Well, first of all, the Germans, after Stalingrad, which was in –</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: – 1943, which was another turning point, I was very much aware, and most of the people were aware that this a turning point.</span> <span id="s3070">After Stalingrad we thought maybe, you know, there might be somebody if – if the Germans throw the Hitler away, or something may – some – but most likely Germans have lost the war.</span> <span id="s3071">So, Germans also realized that they are in bad shape now.</span> <span id="s3072">So they decided oh, Lithuanians wanted to fight against the Soviets, okay, so let’s call Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians, they established Waffen SS legions for those countries and drafted the young men into those Waffen SS legion.</span> <span id="s3073">Estonian [indecipherable] legion, and Latvian, two divisions.</span> <span id="s3074">Estonian, one division, Latvian, two divisions.</span> <span id="s3075">And Lithuanian, Lithuanians just boycotted.</span> <span id="s3076">Nobody really, excepts few invalids reported to the induction center.</span> <span id="s3077">Well, they became so angry, they closed the universities, because they realized that the students were behind it, and they arrested the – you know, s – I don’t know, about 50, maybe less people very known in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3078">P-Priests, professors, even their administrators who worked on that dam, high administrators and brought them to the concentration camp in Stutthof, near Danzig.</span> <span id="s3079">And all the other oppressions, you know, your – even – even – even farmers and so al-al-also.</span> <span id="s3080">So, once that started – well, I d – I don’t want to go into lo – long details, but I – I wa – I became sick with a pneumonia and was in the hospital and I was discharged for pneumonia.</span> <span id="s3081">And the Germans took a list of discharged people and drafted us.</span> <span id="s3082">And I saw that’s – it’s really a sad situation.</span> <span id="s3083">So I thought that the only thing I have, if I don’t want, you know, that my family will suffer [indecipherable] for that, I – I would rather collec – select, you know, where do I am going under the Germans.</span> <span id="s3084">And I selected so-called Reichsarbeitsdienst.</span> <span id="s3085">A Reichs labor service, which all the Germans had to – to go through before going into the military service, but also the girls had to go through that.</span> <span id="s3086">So I w – I volunteered for that, not wanting to go anywhere else.</span> <span id="s3087">My resistance leader approved of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: He himself was part German, and apparently thought that that’s – that’s advantageous to – to – to – to be on that side [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: So you were an anti-German resistance –</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">Q: – as an anti-Nazi resistance [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">A: Right, right, yes.</span> <span id="s3094">So my leader acce – a-approved of that, and I went into the arbeitsdienst.</span> <span id="s3095">I served for, not the full term.</span> <span id="s3096">I don’t know why, they let us go earlier.</span> <span id="s3097">And we came to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3098">We knew that, you know, the German –</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">Q: Were you – excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt.</span> <span id="s3100">You weren’t in Lithuania at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: No, we went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">A: We – we work in Peenemünde, we were in several places, but I [indecipherable] in Peenemünde where the German rockets were being built, you know [indecipherable] and – and the other.</span> <span id="s3104">And Mr. Brown was there, you know, I – we saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s3106">You saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">A: Y-Yeah, well, just fleeing, you know, he was walking through there.</span> <span id="s3108">So, was – was – German were very correct about that.</span> <span id="s3109">Apparently they wanted to create some friendly people for them, you know.</span> <span id="s3110">Was – was no-not bad at all.</span> <span id="s3111">And the Germans wo – took – but we were working together with the Germans, mixed together with the Germans, and they were young boys, but friendly.</span> <span id="s3112">So, was not a bad experience.</span> <span id="s3113">Wa – one – bu-but then we were released from that service earlier, before our term was over, because there was supposed to be Lithuanian army, you know, armed forces be – being established, and the general said that he needs some experienced soldiers who could be un – you know, non-commissioned off – officers, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: Which general, what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: Lahavichos(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">Q: Lahavichos(ph) okay, him, okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">A: Yeah, and – an-and so I – I went back, you know, was discharged and s – joined Lahavichos(ph) army.</span> <span id="s3118">But that was a short thing, you know, couple months until Germans, you know, came in conflict with Lahavichos(ph) for many aspects.</span> <span id="s3119">They di – didn’t hold with their agreements.</span> <span id="s3120">Lahavichos(ph) was a very strong, a very s-stubborn and proud man.</span> <span id="s3121">We loved him, all the soldiers loved him, he was a real leader.</span> <span id="s3122">So the Germans arrested him, his staff, as I said, and disbanded this – this unit and executed some of them.</span> <span id="s3123">We were let go earlier, so I lived in my aunt’s house in – in the village.</span> <span id="s3124">And then the Russians approached Lithuania, pretty soon they took Vilnius, was a-approaching Kaunas and I decided, you know, that I – I’m not going to wait for them.</span> <span id="s3125">Some who mo – my friends ask me to, you know, join them as guerrilla fighters against the Soviets.</span> <span id="s3126">I didn’t believe in that, I thought maybe two, three months, not more, you know.</span> <span id="s3127">I didn’t believe that the west will fight for Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3128">I decided I go west, and try, you know, to – to meet it, the western English, or Americans in Germany, because this was obvious Germany lost the war, that was clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">Q: Did your parents go with you?</span> <span id="s3130">A: No.</span> <span id="s3131">My mother wanted to go with me, well there was confusion, a lot of confusion.</span> <span id="s3132">And my pa – father wanted, you know, he was too late.</span> <span id="s3133">Panevėžys was taking without any – any ba-battle.</span> <span id="s3134">Germans just demolished electrical plant and retreated without any ac – without any resistance.</span> <span id="s3135">So my father stayed in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3136">My mother eventually went to Germany also, but separately form – from myself.</span> <span id="s3137">I went to Germany, also, we met at the end of war.</span> <span id="s3138">I met my mother in Munich, and well, I must tell y – if I tell the full story, so I went to the east Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">Q: We were sent to work together with the farmers, to – to help the farmers.</span> <span id="s3141">Apparently, also, before the evacuation, it was clear that the Russians will go in – inside.</span> <span id="s3142">So we were working at the farm, and then suddenly was told everybody has to go to dig ditches against the tanks, to make obstacles to the Soviet tanks coming in.</span> <span id="s3143">And a lot of Lithuanians, Poles, everything, you know, were brought together, and who were just digging those anti-tank ditches.</span> <span id="s3144">Which didn’t help any, apparently, later.</span> <span id="s3145">We were in – in the – in the rather famous – we later fa – became famous in the – or infamous really.</span> <span id="s3146">A village nomar -- Nemmersdorf –</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: Well, yeah, what – Soviets e-e-executed a lot of Germans.</span> <span id="s3149">All of them, really, who were left there, so – who were digging those – those anti-tank ditches.</span> <span id="s3150">Now, one afternoon, you know, after – after lunch, we were – a break, you know, were eating our lunch and suddenly we noticed that SS troopers have surrounded us all around.</span> <span id="s3151">And they took out their automatic weapons and one of them came forward.</span> <span id="s3152">And in very good Lithuanian language, very good, with no accent, nothing, said that we Lithuanians are all communists, we should be shot right away.</span> <span id="s3153">We didn’t fight to defend our own country, and we deserve to die row – right here and now.</span> <span id="s3154">But, the fuehrer is so great in – in his – you know, that he decided to let us – to – I mean, to w-wer – to fight f – for the Germany in this way, you know, of our – our shame, that we didn’t defend our country, that we are basically communists at heart, who let us, you know, wer – you know – well, anyway, to – to – to – to – to – to parole us from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">Q: Expiate – expiate your sin –</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: – in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: Expiate my sin.</span> <span id="s3159">So, and this – so.</span> <span id="s3160">we will be drafted now in the German army as auxiliaries in the Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s3161">And wh-who doesn’t, you know, doesn’t appreciate fuehrer’s great move, you know, well, we will know about that, how to handle it.</span> <span id="s3162">Okay, so – so we became German soldiers.</span> <span id="s3163">Soldiers, no, auxiliaries.</span> <span id="s3164">No rank, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s3165">They [indecipherable] gave us uniforms, but without any rank indications, any insignia, and we were aus – auxiliaries.</span> <span id="s3166">We were supposed to do work, we were digging trenches against the sw – Swedes in Stralsund in Germany.</span> <span id="s3167">Stralsund because the Germans at that time thought that Sweden’s will – going to join the allies and attack them in the north.</span> <span id="s3168">So we were digging those trenches after that, you know, the Swedes didn’t attack, so they brought us as other tasks.</span> <span id="s3169">But they were manual tasks, and electrical work, you know, something like that.</span> <span id="s3170">I don’t know whether to tell the story, I – I – I – because – are we running out of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: Yeah, we’ve only got about a minute left on this tape, actually.</span> <span id="s3172">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">A: Yeah, well – well, anyways, well after the war, I met my – my mother.</span> <span id="s3174">I didn’t go into the prisoner of war, I just deserted from the Germans.</span> <span id="s3175">I didn’t feel that I owe them anything.</span> <span id="s3176">And we lived in Germany, I studied in the University of Tübingen, studied law again.</span> <span id="s3177">And then, you know, my uncle, my mother’s brother brought us to the United States, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: And your profession after the war, can you tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">A: After the war, I had various jobs, the bo – the first – the first job I had was a manual job, polishing – buffing the metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">A: Brushing – buffing the lipstick casings.</span> <span id="s3182">So th-that was work.</span> <span id="s3183">It was di-dirty work.</span> <span id="s3184">Then I worked in textile, and after I st-studied here and completed my studies in University of Connecticut, I – and then in New York University Business School, then I worked for the government.</span> <span id="s3185">I worked in the postal service as an economist, making analyses of new equipment, of new buildings, economic analyses in that field, and worked until I retired.</span> <span id="s3186">And after that, a short time, I worked in Lithuanian mission at the United Nations, when Lithuania became independent.</span> <span id="s3187">They didn’t have any diplomats, and Mr. Simutas(ph), who was appointed ambassador at the United Nations, asked me to join his staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: I’d like to thank you for participating today.</span> <span id="s3189">And this concludes the United States Holocaust
