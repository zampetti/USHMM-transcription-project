Feder.</span> <span id="s29">I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s30">And I had two sisters and a brother, and a mother and dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Interviewer: The year of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Theodore: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Interviewer: The year of your birth?</span> <span id="s34">The year of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Theodore: Must I?</span> <span id="s36">February 21, 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Interviewer: Why don't you tell me a little bit about your family and personal background; reconstruct it?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Theodore: Let me start in the place called Stolbtsy [Stowbtsy], S‑t-o-l-b-t-s-y, formerly White Russia, now Belarus, where a family was growing up.</span> <span id="s39">The family had a hotel, which was used as a way station for Jews going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s40">This was a tense century.</span> <span id="s41">My two sisters, not my mother, she was a very strong-willed person, were influenced by a man called Zalman Shazar, who later was president of Israel.</span> <span id="s42">With the pogroms in that area, they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there the family had a delicatessen, a grocery.</span> <span id="s43">The two daughters went to grammar school and high school.</span> <span id="s44">And in college, one of my sisters, Sara, Sara Feder, became friendly with a woman by the name of Golda Meyerson -- I have a picture to prove it -- who later became Golda Meir.</span> <span id="s45">And there are pictures somewhere in my archives about Golda taking me to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s46">Now, it isn't that I was influenced by Golda at that age, but I was in a grouping where, as a youngster, I was sort of pulled in.</span> <span id="s47">And that was in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s48">There was a Polish Zionist group, headed, of course, by Golda and my sister.</span> <span id="s49">And so I can't say that in my mother's milk I was given Zionism, but I certainly grew up with it and I had a great love for my sister Sara.</span> <span id="s50">I followed her around like a little dog.</span> <span id="s51">And slowly, all of this began to come to a point.</span> <span id="s52">Now Golda, after World War I, decided to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s53">She told her husband, "I'm going.</span> <span id="s54">Do you want to come?</span> <span id="s55">Do.</span> <span id="s56">If not, stay here."</span> <span id="s57">He went.</span> <span id="s58">When it came to my sister, she said the same thing to her husband, and then stopped.</span> <span id="s59">And so my sister didn’t go to Palestine, but was one of the founders of the Pioneer Women Organization in the United States, where for close to 25 years she was one of the leaders.</span> <span id="s60">Throughout all this period and also during the war, when I was in Fort Knox, anyone who really wanted to know knew what was happening in Europe.</span> <span id="s61">The Jewish Telegraphic Agency had all kinds of information, speakers coming to the Louisville YMHA because I was at Fort Knox, which was near Louisville, and as a warrant officer adjutant I also read documents that had information, not too much, about the struggles that were going on in Europe, mainly from a military point of view.</span> <span id="s62">All of this decided me that what I really wanted to do for my life was to go overseas, when it was over, and see if I could be helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Interviewer: What year are you talking about when you got -- started getting information about the Jewish situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Theodore: This was after the war started, 1941.</span> <span id="s65">I was at Fort Knox from 1941, and I ended my stay there on a day that a document came through from General Marshall, and I even have a copy of it, in which the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration [UNRRA] was asking for staff to be allowed to leave the army and come overseas and work for the United Nations.</span> <span id="s66">I immediately put in.</span> <span id="s67">Maybe one of the reasons that I was able to get in was that I had had a small association with the United Nations at Fort Knox when one day we were asked to pick 30 drivers about the same age, same height, and I did it.</span> <span id="s68">And there were commendations from the commanding general about how well we did it.</span> <span id="s69">And when I put in my application to the UNRRA, I put that in as well.</span> <span id="s70">And I think that may have tipped it, when I came overseas with the UNRRA, and that was a saga too, because it was on a ship with 400 people that had left the army to go into Europe with the UNRRA, and we left on the day that the atom bomb was dropped.</span> <span id="s71">So everybody on that ship was unhappy because they would have been discharged if they stayed, but they went along.</span> <span id="s72">We landed in England, and something happened there that was important, as far as my knowledge of what was happening in Europe.</span> <span id="s73">At the headquarters of the UN, the UNRRA in Washington, they were very adamant that we, as members of the Armed Forces, and the UN, should not get involved in the black market.</span> <span id="s74">Don't take hard currency, take traveler's checks.</span> <span id="s75">You can't get into the black market.</span> <span id="s76">I thought it strange that that was something that was being talked about.</span> <span id="s77">When in London, I needed some pounds.</span> <span id="s78">The only place I could go to was the US Army Finance Office.</span> <span id="s79">When I got there, I saw a long line of 300 or 400 men, officers, G.I’s.</span> <span id="s80">I got in line.</span> <span id="s81">We -- I was dressed in an officer's uniform, with a tab on my shoulder saying UNRRA.</span> <span id="s82">None of them had ever seen anything like that, so I was a curiosity.</span> <span id="s83">And after I answered their questions, I asked them questions.</span> <span id="s84">I said, "What are you doing waiting in line?"</span> <span id="s85">At which point, a fellow put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a stack of, I don't know how many tens of thousands of French francs.</span> <span id="s86">He says, "I'm going to change these French francs into dollars, and I will have made $25,000."</span> <span id="s87">I was startled.</span> <span id="s88">And sure enough, all these men were bringing money in.</span> <span id="s89">Whatever they sold, I didn't ask, whether it was Army stuff or whatever, cigarettes in the PX.</span> <span id="s90">But when I got to the front of the line, I threw my $100 in traveler's checks, the fellow there says, "What do you want to come to me for?</span> <span id="s91">You're going to get legal right.</span> <span id="s92">You go around the corner and you'll get 30 percent more."</span> <span id="s93">Now, I tell the story because this element was very important in war-torn Europe.</span> <span id="s94">When I finally got to Germany and I was in the headquarters of the United Nations Rehabilitation Relief Administration, and I was involved in documentation and statistics and so on, I felt very uneasy.</span> <span id="s95">I felt very uneasy because I saw many things that were happening that were certainly not something I wanted to be associated with.</span> <span id="s96">Namely, the UNRRA took on as refugees, ex-Wehrmacht, even some of the soldiers who had been SS, and it was a very curious mix.</span> <span id="s97">And in addition, they were repatriating.</span> <span id="s98">The Russians came in and took their Russians.</span> <span id="s99">The Poles came in and took their Poles.</span> <span id="s100">The only group not touched was the Jews.</span> <span id="s101">And that was of great interest to me.</span> <span id="s102">And I -- on the side, I kept statistics separately to see just what it was.</span> <span id="s103">And I was always talking to Herb Katzki, whom you have been talking with.</span> <span id="s104">And incidentally, I got my job -- Herb doesn't agree -- but there were two of them, Harry Beal and Herb Katzki -- I had a hot water heater in my building in Elsen [village in the city of Paderborn], Germany where the headquarters of the UNRRA was, and they didn't.</span> <span id="s105">So they took baths in my place and that's how I got in the JDC.</span> <span id="s106">Within six months I decided I wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s107">And I came to the JDC, and they said, yes, they'll take you.</span> <span id="s108">We need people in Munich [München].</span> <span id="s109">And I left and came on staff with the JDC in Munich [München].</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Interviewer: Let’s backtrack a bit, now that you talked about the JDC.</span> <span id="s111">Did you, with the UNRRA, did you have a specific role or responsibility, and was that based on training you had had before, education that you had had before?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Theodore: What was important for the UNRRA at that time was to have a cadre of people who knew the Army, because the UNRRA was under the aegis of the Army, and you had to talk militarize, old buddy sort of thing, and that's why I was in the U.S. zone.</span> <span id="s113">Also, the fact that I had a major in psychology and public administration gave me a background, certainly not my Jewish background, for the work that they did and the fact that they put me in the headquarters of the entire UNRRA, who at that point had close to seven million refugees.</span> <span id="s114">However, there were only about 40,000 to 60,000 Jews, only 40,000 to 60,000 Jews in West Germany, Italy, and Austria, very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Interviewer: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Theodore: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Interviewer: What was the nature of your work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Theodore: Actually, it was called reports and statistics for the CEO, which meant that we had to keep our pulse on the vast movement of people in Europe at that time.</span> <span id="s119">Who were all these people that were moving?</span> <span id="s120">Trains were coming daily into West Germany from Romania, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, dumping the "Volksdeutsch".</span> <span id="s121">Those were citizens who had a German background and who certainly during the war didn't give much help to the government that was supposedly theirs, and they were all thrown out.</span> <span id="s122">And, of course, as it turned out, that was a very plus for West Germany because the people they were sending were highly skilled farmers, people that later helped Germany in their rise to power economically.</span> <span id="s123">But we were in constant consultation with many areas apprehending people.</span> <span id="s124">The truth of the matter is the data that we got was way off, way off, because there were more people getting on these trains than were on the books, so to speak.</span> <span id="s125">And I recall now, my interest in JDC and the fact that there were involved in all of this, Jewish Army chaplains, G.I’s.</span> <span id="s126">As a matter of fact, when I came to Germany, I was housed in a town near Frankfurt called Hochst [Hochst am Main], which you've heard of Bayer's Aspirin.</span> <span id="s127">Well, it was a tremendous complex for manufacturing, at that time, of medication for venereal disease.</span> <span id="s128">And when -- there was one evening, a G.I. came up to me and he says, "I know you're Jewish."</span> <span id="s129">I said, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s130">He said, "Would you help us?"</span> <span id="s131">I said, "What is it I'm supposed to do?"</span> <span id="s132">He said, "Well, we're trying to help Jews.</span> <span id="s133">We're trying to help Jewish refugees come in from the East."</span> <span id="s134">So I said, "Well, how are they coming?"</span> <span id="s135">And he told a story of all this great movement of people, hundreds of thousands, that there was an underground, moving people out of Eastern Europe, staffed by what was called the Brikha, which were Palestinian Jews, it was a brigade stationed in Italy.</span> <span id="s136">And what Palestine did -- what the Jewish agency did was to draw out of the ranks from the brigade and establish this organization and bring from Palestine others to replace them in the brigade, so that the British Army didn't know that there had been a movement.</span> <span id="s137">So there were dozens and dozens of these Palestinian Jews, all picked for what it was they had to do.</span> <span id="s138">And with all the trains coming in, there would be additional box cars added at the end with Jews in it, Jews who wanted to flee Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s139">And it was especially in rows after the Kielce pogrom, dozens of Jews in Poland were shot, the exodus started.</span> <span id="s140">And so this young man said, "Look, we're going to have to pick up some people who are coming in and they're at a rail center outside of Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s141">We're going to have a truck and we're going to go get them."</span> <span id="s142">I said, "I can go along."</span> <span id="s143">And that evening we got in the truck; there were three trucks.</span> <span id="s144">And we drove to this area, and we stopped in front of a bunker.</span> <span id="s145">It looked like a bunker.</span> <span id="s146">He says… actually the top was all bombed because it was a railroad station.</span> <span id="s147">He says, "In this bunker we're going to find Jews.</span> <span id="s148">On the other hand, there are going to be many non-Jews there."</span> <span id="s149">I said, "Well, how do I tell the difference?"</span> <span id="s150">"Oh," he says, "you say two words.</span> <span id="s151">You say 'Joint' and you say 'Amkhah' which is Hebrew for friend."</span> <span id="s152">And we walked down about twenty stairs into this bunker and it was a tremendous area filled with people.</span> <span id="s153">It was dimly lit and you could hardly tell, children were crying.</span> <span id="s154">You could hardly move through the people, and both of us started from both sides and saying "Amkhah, Joint."</span> <span id="s155">And it was as if the words were magnets and the people were made out of steel.</span> <span id="s156">Slowly they got up, didn't ask a question, and followed us out.</span> <span id="s157">I was so overwhelmed by those two words and the experience; I wanted more than ever to get into JDC.</span> <span id="s158">And eventually, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Interviewer: That's quite a story.</span> <span id="s160">You started to talk about this mass movement of people across Europe, and you mentioned, at least some of them were.</span> <span id="s161">Can you expand on that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Theodore: When our people were freed from the camp, their first impulse was return home.</span> <span id="s163">And it wasn't difficult because trains were moving.</span> <span id="s164">They got a ride, just like my wife, and she was in a group who were walking towards Dresden, and when the war was over she also decided to go home.</span> <span id="s165">So you had tens of thousands of Jews moving back home.</span> <span id="s166">But when they got there, there wasn't much.</span> <span id="s167">The homes were bombed.</span> <span id="s168">None of their friends were back.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Interviewer: You're talking about the movement of people across Europe in 1945.</span> <span id="s170">And I'm trying to get a sense of who those people were.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Theodore: First of all, you must remember that the Germans had taken hundreds of thousands of people as slave laborers.</span> <span id="s172">They weren't Jews.</span> <span id="s173">They were just criminal -- no, I shouldn't say.</span> <span id="s174">There were a few criminals.</span> <span id="s175">They just took anybody.</span> <span id="s176">Or they took certain skills, and picked them up and put them to work, Hungarian farmers, Romanian tailors.</span> <span id="s177">They had the best system of being able to move people about for their purposes.</span> <span id="s178">And they moved them.</span> <span id="s179">And they used them.</span> <span id="s180">Schindler's, after all, those people in there.</span> <span id="s181">So you had those that were moving westward to their homes, and, from among those in Germany, they were going eastward back to their countries.</span> <span id="s182">But let me get to our people.</span> <span id="s183">Because of this, because there was no control, because the police and the military couldn't care less if another train -- Jews were able to come out easily into Western Germany.</span> <span id="s184">Why Western Germany?</span> <span id="s185">Because there were the camps.</span> <span id="s186">There were a lot of camps that had been set up and, indeed, were beginning to close down because of the movement, the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Interviewer: You're talking about a displaced person's camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Theodore: Yeah.</span> <span id="s189">We had, even in the early days of my UNRRA experience, people responsible didn't understand what was happening.</span> <span id="s190">They didn't understand that there was a movement taking place that they had no control over, because -- and, also, because of the friendly officers of the UNRRA who wanted to be helpful, especially because the commanding general was Eisenhower, and he had seen how unhappy President Truman was when we complained about the bad accommodations that Jews had in Germany as compared to what the Germans had.</span> <span id="s191">And there was a group headed by a fellow of the name of Harrison who came and said it's true.</span> <span id="s192">The gentiles were living much better than the Jews who had come out of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s193">So we were able to bring all these people in them.</span> <span id="s194">I'm talking about the Brikha.</span> <span id="s195">So that the 30,000, slowly, in the period of 1946, and 1947, and 1948, rose to about a quarter of a million.</span> <span id="s196">Now, the general opinion is that those that we were serving had all been in camps, had come without anything, and were sick.</span> <span id="s197">They needed nourishment, it was true.</span> <span id="s198">Those who had been in camp needed that.</span> <span id="s199">But what this movement was bringing was altogether different.</span> <span id="s200">You were getting Jews who had lived in the underground.</span> <span id="s201">They called it uboat [?]</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">There were Jews who were in the partisan, hundreds of Jews.</span> <span id="s204">There were Jews who were fleeing from Poland and Bucharest and Hungary.</span> <span id="s205">And then the last group and the most important group were Jews from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s206">Jews who deserted the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s207">Jews who had an opportunity of leaving and they took it.</span> <span id="s208">And so, therefore, the group we were working with were not those who couldn't take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s209">On the contrary, those who came brought strength to the -- those who had been in camp.</span> <span id="s210">For example, we decided very soon -- it could very well have been that they decided it for us -- to set up a self-government.</span> <span id="s211">Many of the Jewish army chaplains were very much involved in that.</span> <span id="s212">Now, the chaplains were into Germany earlier than we were.</span> <span id="s213">We didn't come in until the middle of June.</span> <span id="s214">They were there before the war ended.</span> <span id="s215">And some of them were very aggressive and saw immediately the need for self-government and a self-government was set up.</span> <span id="s216">The chairman at that time was a man by the name of Blumowitz who later became the Surgeon General of the Israeli Army.</span> <span id="s217">We're talking about people with capacity.</span> <span id="s218">There was a man by the name of Retter who later became an aide to Golda Meir.</span> <span id="s219">A Mr. Piegoch [?]</span> <span id="s220">became a number two person in the Mapai party.</span> <span id="s221">So we were dealing with people who were responsible, who were able to act, who did what we couldn't do.</span> <span id="s222">We could come into a camp and we had our people in camps.</span> <span id="s223">But when it came to running the camp, they were running it.</span> <span id="s224">They -- we must forget about it being a camp.</span> <span id="s225">We thought of it as a village.</span> <span id="s226">There was a mayor.</span> <span id="s227">There was a police force.</span> <span id="s228">There was a fire force.</span> <span id="s229">There were kitchens.</span> <span id="s230">There was garbage collection.</span> <span id="s231">They were all Jews.</span> <span id="s232">So what we were dealing with, really, were people who were responsible.</span> <span id="s233">And as we brought in our supplies in those early days, the division was made directly to the camp.</span> <span id="s234">They made the distribution.</span> <span id="s235">They were our armed knights.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Interviewer: Question, just for the record, who are we talking about now when you say we?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Theodore: Talking about Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Interviewer: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Theodore: That Joint.</span> <span id="s240">And so there is another element.</span> <span id="s241">For example, I noticed in the document the Museum put out recently about the history after the war.</span> <span id="s242">I noticed that it said that on June -- or in June, the JDC was admitted in order to set up a welfare program.</span> <span id="s243">That was true, but it didn't go far enough, because the history of the DP camps has never really been told.</span> <span id="s244">How to come to grips with a group who have been through the Holocaust, lost their families, were living in, the best I could say, in substandard housing in the camps, even though some of them were villages, how could they come out of that trauma?</span> <span id="s245">What -- how could they get up every day, having lost their families, living in these wretched conditions?</span> <span id="s246">Okay.</span> <span id="s247">They were given food, clothing, and so on.</span> <span id="s248">It was mind boggling that they did so well.</span> <span id="s249">For example, we brought in three psychiatrists and sent them to the largest camp, which was in Pocking, where there were 14,000 Jews in one camp.</span> <span id="s250">And we brought them over for a purpose.</span> <span id="s251">We weren't sure what did we need for Palestine.</span> <span id="s252">What did they need in order to care for the possibility of large-scale mental breakdowns?</span> <span id="s253">Because after all, there was a lot -- we knew were going to Palestine, then Israel.</span> <span id="s254">What would they need?</span> <span id="s255">What would we need?</span> <span id="s256">We -- and I'll get to our program in a moment -- and after a month there, they came up with the following.</span> <span id="s257">They examined about 400 people.</span> <span id="s258">And they came to the following conclusion, that the percentage of people who would break down or who would need hospitalization would be no different than in a normal society.</span> <span id="s259">That was it.</span> <span id="s260">And that was true.</span> <span id="s261">We had a few, a few dozen out of a quarter of a million having to be hospitalized, but the majority wouldn't.</span> <span id="s262">Whether it was because of the strength of anyone who had survived, but it was also a point that we came to the conclusion that something was happening.</span> <span id="s263">It wasn't that we were talking to all the people or it wasn't that the central committee, which was our group, and incidentally, the army gave them a liaison officer.</span> <span id="s264">They had a full colonel as a liaison officer from Frankfurt who didn't speak a word, other than English, and so we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s265">What was the name?</span> <span id="s266">Colonel Sivers, from the South.</span> <span id="s267">And suddenly -- it was sudden -- one day we said, you know, there's something changing completely.</span> <span id="s268">The social workers began to talk to us about the paring-offs that were taking place in camp, looking for new life.</span> <span id="s269">The result was something that we will never forget.</span> <span id="s270">At one point -- well, first of all, we brought in wedding rings, sent a jeep down to Milan.</span> <span id="s271">They bought wedding rings.</span> <span id="s272">Everybody got a free wedding ring.</span> <span id="s273">Number two and most important was that we said, look, we better get as many diapers as we can because we're going to be full and need it.</span> <span id="s274">And I recall in early 1948, we had a -- someone made some statistics.</span> <span id="s275">They said that every woman between the ages of eighteen and thirty was either pregnant or had had a child in the previous six months.</span> <span id="s276">This rebirth, this -- the rose growing in a garbage can, people who looked so unfit were changing.</span> <span id="s277">And so there was a miracle.</span> <span id="s278">There were the children.</span> <span id="s279">And with children, you had to change a lot of programs.</span> <span id="s280">We had doctors, and never mind the question of diapers, special foods, and the whole gamut.</span> <span id="s281">And the camps changed completely, because with the children, what else did they need?</span> <span id="s282">The people in the camps to have a village.</span> <span id="s283">Papers, there were at least a dozen Jewish papers that were published.</span> <span id="s284">And also, the -- there was no Yiddish type, so they were phonetically English words.</span> <span id="s285">In the book I gave you, you'll see.</span> <span id="s286">Kindergartens, new thing.</span> <span id="s287">They opened up kindergartens.</span> <span id="s288">We were involved in a very famous Jewish actor by the name of Yabakoff [?]</span> <span id="s289">.</span> <span id="s290">I noticed it in the paper the other day.</span> <span id="s291">The comedian, we brought him in.</span> <span id="s292">We brought in Yiddish -- there was one place that had a lot of Yiddish movies.</span> <span id="s293">We brought that in.</span> <span id="s294">We brought in all kinds of athletic stuff for the people.</span> <span id="s295">Most important, one I can't forget, that it was difficult for the Army to understand the Jews.</span> <span id="s296">After all, in dealing with the military government, dealing with the Germans who were clean, precise, and work on time, who would say, "Yah," every time the question was asked.</span> <span id="s297">Our people never said yah.</span> <span id="s298">They were independent.</span> <span id="s299">And it was hard for the Army to understand, they had to be responsible, but they couldn't.</span> <span id="s300">And so there were all kinds of rumors that the Jews were lazy.</span> <span id="s301">They didn't want to work.</span> <span id="s302">That they were just eating -- doing nothing, forgetting -- forgetting that not one of our people wanted to stay there.</span> <span id="s303">This was the bloody earth of Germany.</span> <span id="s304">And they were there by sufferings.</span> <span id="s305">And the minute they had an opportunity of getting out, illegally or legally, they went.</span> <span id="s306">But the commanding general said, look, these people are doing nothing.</span> <span id="s307">So we set up a work.</span> <span id="s308">It was called produktiveassersia [?]</span> <span id="s309">.</span> <span id="s310">A word for us.</span> <span id="s311">We brought in material.</span> <span id="s312">We had so many tailors.</span> <span id="s313">The ORT expanded.</span> <span id="s314">I must say that with the tailors, we had a funny experience with one group because we had some very bright people; after all there were Jews from Łódź, an area where clothes were made.</span> <span id="s315">And so we found that you figure out on a piece of material you can make so many suits, different sizes.</span> <span id="s316">And we found, much to our dismay, that this one place was making only small sizes and keeping the rest of it, making big sizes and selling it for the committee to be used in the religious activities.</span> <span id="s317">But we thought that was fine.</span> <span id="s318">So we put people to work.</span> <span id="s319">And all during this time there was the underground going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s320">We were involved.</span> <span id="s321">We were involved.</span> <span id="s322">The number of gallons of gasoline that somehow or other went out of certain trucks to other trucks, made it available for them to move down to Italy and to France.</span> <span id="s323">And there was, the UNRRA knew about it.</span> <span id="s324">The British wanted to stop it, but it continued.</span> <span id="s325">It was the only thing that kept the spirits of the people, knowing that they could leave.</span> <span id="s326">And it was our responsibility to carry on this vast program, not just welfare, but from the cradle to death.</span> <span id="s327">And the committee ran everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Interviewer: The central committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Theodore: The central committee, which incidentally was established based on the political schlüssel , political key, as there was in Palestine.</span> <span id="s330">And you had the Agudath.</span> <span id="s331">You had the Mapai.</span> <span id="s332">You had the Mapam.</span> <span id="s333">You had the political methodology, which permeated all the way into Eastern Europe, because those that went were out of certain political parties, and they found that they could organize groups coming out by having this additional tie.</span> <span id="s334">Well, we certainly tried to do what we could in order to help them.</span> <span id="s335">Besides the food, we were also a good tie to the military.</span> <span id="s336">For example, when the state of Israel was founded, then there was normal immigration to Israel, except for one thing.</span> <span id="s337">The British Army insisted that there should be no one of military age sent.</span> <span id="s338">Cruel.</span> <span id="s339">Terrible.</span> <span id="s340">I don't want to –</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Interviewer: In 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Theodore: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s343">The British had their hand in everything.</span> <span id="s344">After all, the heads of the UNRRA and the IRO were all British generals, and who were they talking to?</span> <span id="s345">They were talking to their home office who, of course, didn't want immigration to Palestine and even to Israel.</span> <span id="s346">And there was one time, I don't want to mention who was involved, but I talked to some of the people, others did as well, that how cruel it was to separate families at this stage and this period after the war.</span> <span id="s347">And the result was very interesting.</span> <span id="s348">The person who said he was going to examine the train, said, I will only examine the left side of the train.</span> <span id="s349">I want all the women and children there.</span> <span id="s350">What you put on the right side -- I don't care.</span> <span id="s351">I'm not going to look at it.</span> <span id="s352">Because I have to certify that I have seen this train and only women and children have gone.</span> <span id="s353">And so there you were.</span> <span id="s354">The person examined the left side.</span> <span id="s355">And on the right side, of course, were the husbands and the wives -- the husbands and the kids of military age.</span> <span id="s356">And it went.</span> <span id="s357">And then finally when IRO closed out, they decided that everyone could go.</span> <span id="s358">The -- let me talk about the ship Exodus.</span> <span id="s359">You remember, the ship that was sent back to France, came to France, and the people didn't want to get off.</span> <span id="s360">They were on a hunger strike.</span> <span id="s361">It really wasn't, because at night, Herb would know, boats were sent to put food on, and the people ate.</span> <span id="s362">The ship was sent back to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s363">And all the people were offloaded and sent to a camp called Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s364">Within one month, every person who had been on the Exodus was on his way back to Palestine in the underground.</span> <span id="s365">British, no British, the valor of the people who were handling this was tremendous.</span> <span id="s366">But let me try to give you a picture of what it was like, what it was like sitting in the office in Munich [München], a ------ of three, across the street was the central committee and they had a very fine villa which the Army had given them.</span> <span id="s367">And next there was a long street nearby called Mohlstrasse.</span> <span id="s368">The area was a very fine area of homes which had been taken over by the Army and so on.</span> <span id="s369">There wasn't a day that there wasn't an incident, either with German police, our people were in black market.</span> <span id="s370">We couldn't blame them.</span> <span id="s371">After all, they had been victimized.</span> <span id="s372">If they had a possibility of making a few dollars, let them make it.</span> <span id="s373">We, also, were in the black market.</span> <span id="s374">It cost two cigarettes for a box seat in the Wagner Opera House around the corner.</span> <span id="s375">The director was a man by the name of Solti, the present Sir (Georg) Solti.</span> <span id="s376">So this -- this is how things worked.</span> <span id="s377">The committees had their purpose.</span> <span id="s378">It didn't always parallel ours.</span> <span id="s379">For example, they were so strong, they felt that the tremendous warehouse we had with millions of pounds of food and clothing and cigarettes ought to be under their control.</span> <span id="s380">You know, if you're a political group, you don't stand still.</span> <span id="s381">You try to go forward by seeing what you can gain, like politicians anyplace.</span> <span id="s382">And the former director, a fellow by name of Leo Schwartz, who is an author, he was willing to turn it over to them.</span> <span id="s383">And we thought that would be unpalatable, then we would have no control.</span> <span id="s384">And so the contract was signed by them, and then sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s385">I took one look and I put it in a safe, locked it up, and I called Herb, and I said, "Herb, we can't sign that, because that would be giving over to the committee things that our board certainly wouldn't want."</span> <span id="s386">And sure enough, that's what happened.</span> <span id="s387">We never gave it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Interviewer: I need to ask you a few questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Theodore: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Interviewer: To clarify this for people who don't know exactly what your role is and there are certain terms, like the central committee that you sort of explained, but I think that we need to be a little more specific sort of for those who might watch this.</span> <span id="s391">When you went to work for the Joint -- the American Joint Distribution Committee, what was your role and what was your function?</span> <span id="s392">You keep, also, referring to Herb, so I need to -- some of us need to understand this.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Theodore: Yeah.</span> <span id="s394">I was brought on as the deputy director for our program in the USO in Germany, which means I was the number two man in this program.</span> <span id="s395">I had specific tasks.</span> <span id="s396">From an administrative point of view, with personnel, with administration, I had a responsibility for liaison with the UNRRA and the leader of the IRO, and for liaison with part of the military.</span> <span id="s397">I also visited the camps to observe and to report where we might find things easier to do, and to determine that our food and clothing was properly distributed.</span> <span id="s398">We had a problem at the outset because it wasn't -- we came in, in 1945, but by the time our supply lines -- yes, we sent trucks up to Sweden and brought back food, but that was a fly in the bucket.</span> <span id="s399">You needed large -- in order to take care of a group of a quarter of a million, you needed a large warehouse.</span> <span id="s400">You needed a lot of trucks.</span> <span id="s401">You needed a lot of staff.</span> <span id="s402">You needed security.</span> <span id="s403">We had -- the Army gave us two dozen rifles and told us to train our own group for guarding our supplies.</span> <span id="s404">Also, not only security, but there was a great deal of thievery -- couldn't blame them.</span> <span id="s405">After all, if you put one carton of cigarettes and try to hide it, you were ahead $50.</span> <span id="s406">So this was a constant problem we had of security.</span> <span id="s407">Also, in setting up the program we had a lot of new people coming in, and I was responsible for placement and for all of the factors that go in to have a running organization.</span> <span id="s408">It was -- Leo Schwartz, he's written a number of books, was busy.</span> <span id="s409">The director is busy.</span> <span id="s410">As director, you had to be constantly perdue [?]</span> <span id="s411">with the committee and with the Army and with the UNRRA, and he took over that role.</span> <span id="s412">We were constantly thinking of new programs to be helpful to our people within the needs that were demonstrated.</span> <span id="s413">We also were doing our best to save money.</span> <span id="s414">We did.</span> <span id="s415">The archives will show that one of the most important foods that we had was cigarettes.</span> <span id="s416">We were able -- not we, but there were some over at the central committee, they could tell you the number of calories a pack of cigarettes would buy.</span> <span id="s417">The Army in its infinite wisdom allowed the G.I’s APO privileges.</span> <span id="s418">They didn't tell them they couldn't bring in cigarettes.</span> <span id="s419">So millions of cigarettes were coming in through the Army.</span> <span id="s420">The Army knew about it.</span> <span id="s421">And finally, eventually, only in 1948 did all this end, so that was three years, when they had what was called a currency reform.</span> <span id="s422">They took the Reichsmarks, which were about 500 to a dollar, and converted it to Deutsche Marks.</span> <span id="s423">At that point, Germany opened up.</span> <span id="s424">Instead of keeping hidden what had been manufactured and not sell it for the cheap Marks, they were willing to sell it for the Deutsche Marks.</span> <span id="s425">And it was true; the Deutsche Mark did get strong.</span> <span id="s426">It was as if from one day there were no flowers, and the next day there were peonies all over Germany.</span> <span id="s427">And we had to be very sensitive to all of this in what we were distributing during that period.</span> <span id="s428">And we were able to -- I'm sort of walking through one area that I was involved with.</span> <span id="s429">We convinced the Army that we ought to have a distribution of cigarettes to the workers, because their salaries were small, and they certainly were smoking.</span> <span id="s430">We always talked about smoking.</span> <span id="s431">And I'm sorry I didn't take a copy of it, but the Army put out a directive in which we were mentioned about the distribution of cigarettes to working mothers, to workers.</span> <span id="s432">And what developed was that instead of spending the budget, we didn't.</span> <span id="s433">And the money that was saved, and it was into the millions of dollars, were used to help buy the ships that took people to Palestine and Israel.</span> <span id="s434">And so we were a very integral part of that whole picture.</span> <span id="s435">I must also say a personal thing.</span> <span id="s436">When I told my sister that I was -- my sister, Sara, who was the head of the Pioneer Women, that I was going to go to work for the Joint, her immediate reaction was, "Ted, how could you go to work for a non-Zionist organization?"</span> <span id="s437">I said, "Sara, they've changed."</span> <span id="s438">She says, "If you tell me so, that's fine."</span> <span id="s439">And we did change.</span> <span id="s440">We were more involved in these areas.</span> <span id="s441">As a matter of fact, in 1948 we opened up an organization in Israel that took over the responsibility from the government of Israel of all the handicapped, the elderly, and sick children that were immigrating to Israel.</span> <span id="s442">Just think of it.</span> <span id="s443">We hade a caseload.</span> <span id="s444">We've built hospitals.</span> <span id="s445">If we hadn't, people wouldn't have moved out of Germany.</span> <span id="s446">So it was important for us to establish these institutions and run them, run them.</span> <span id="s447">We took it off the back of Israel.</span> <span id="s448">Eventually, in 1955, they took it over.</span> <span id="s449">And so, getting back to what I was doing.</span> <span id="s450">I rambled a little bit there.</span> <span id="s451">We were always on the alert for two things, protecting our people from the Army.</span> <span id="s452">It sounds strange, but, you know, if you have a military government and you have military police, and you're responsible for security in an area, and you have these lovely Germans who don't fight, who don't make any trouble for you, who say yes, and who go about their business, and you have these hundreds of thousands of DPs who want no part of the Army, who don't think that they should have to be disciplined by the Army, but the Army said if there's black market, we're responsible.</span> <span id="s453">And there are always a lot of people who felt, well, if something goes wrong, it's probably the DPs down the road.</span> <span id="s454">It wasn't true.</span> <span id="s455">And to our people who were there in such an important role, to explain exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s456">And I think we were successful to that end.</span> <span id="s457">But if it hadn't been for President Truman with his directives, we would have had a much more difficult time.</span> <span id="s458">And this was constantly one of the things that concerned us all the time, because people coming into the camps, they were coming in illegally, and the Army doesn't like illegal things.</span> <span id="s459">They don't like that -- the border between Czechoslovakia and Bavaria is porous, as far as the Jews were concerned.</span> <span id="s460">So this was always a problem.</span> <span id="s461">And incidentally, because of the realization that it was a problem, the headquarters of the Army in Frankfurt, under urging by many agencies in the States, had an advisor in Jewish affairs, the commanding general.</span> <span id="s462">Some very important people were there, Judge Leventhal of Philadelphia, Rabbi Bernstein, and they were a buffer between the Army at the top level where there was probably more interest and more willingness to be reasonable than down at the lower level of the GI who has a fraulein who keeps talking about how the Jews are getting so much more than we poor Germans and he's in the military government, and he has no love for the displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Interviewer: Explain to me something about this hierarchy that the U.S. Army was basically in charge of the zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Theodore: Yes.</span> <span id="s465">There were four zones.</span> <span id="s466">There was a French, British, Russian, and American.</span> <span id="s467">There were no DPs in the Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Interviewer: Then how did the UNRRA, the Joint, all of these other organizations fit into the structure in terms of the possibility in working with the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Theodore: The Army -- well, not really the Army, the United States authorized the UNRRA to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s470">That's why they sent out that original document to look for staff, because they knew that the Army could never, could never be responsible for taking care of civilians, especially this difficult group.</span> <span id="s471">And they needed help.</span> <span id="s472">And they wanted the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s473">And they were very pleased when the UNRRA went ahead and built their agency quickly and took over because the Army was not able to.</span> <span id="s474">The Army, from a medical point of view, was magnificent.</span> <span id="s475">You know, everybody -- they would make sure that typhoid and so on and so forth, everybody was powdered.</span> <span id="s476">They could set up medical things.</span> <span id="s477">But when it came to looking after the people, caring for them, the needs that were demonstrated, they knew they couldn't.</span> <span id="s478">And, therefore, the UNRRA came in.</span> <span id="s479">The UNRRA was given a mandate.</span> <span id="s480">There had never been an UNRRA before.</span> <span id="s481">The Army had never had to work with a civilian organization.</span> <span id="s482">And a lot of them didn't like it, which was probably one of the reasons that the picture I showed you with the six generals, all of the UNRRA, that's the brass that was there in order to intercede.</span> <span id="s483">And so the UNRRA was given responsibility of looking after the camps, maintaining the camps, getting the food -- couldn't swim.</span> <span id="s484">You think of trying to feed Army, the ten and one ration to children and to women.</span> <span id="s485">It was too much, really.</span> <span id="s486">But that's what they had at the very outset and that's one of the reasons we brought in as much food as we did.</span> <span id="s487">Then the military was also responsible for security.</span> <span id="s488">Now, security, anything.</span> <span id="s489">They raided camps and were very much upset that the people were smarter than they.</span> <span id="s490">They didn't know one DP from another.</span> <span id="s491">The Army, for example, rations, that's a good Army way.</span> <span id="s492">There's a camp, let's say Wolfitzhausen [Wolfratshausen?]</span> <span id="s493">had 2,000, men, women, children.</span> <span id="s494">They need rations for a whole month.</span> <span id="s495">They need so many gallons of this and so many tons of this.</span> <span id="s496">And that was it.</span> <span id="s497">But when it came to the utilization of the food, the Army didn't have any kind of know-how.</span> <span id="s498">They couldn't send in their own side.</span> <span id="s499">So this was UNRRA's responsibility and UNRRA had to know everything.</span> <span id="s500">[End of Tape One]</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Tape Two Interviewer: We were talking about the structure in post-war Europe and you were explaining about the U.S. Military and the U.S. Zone and the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s502">Then, now that we've established that the UNRRA needed to carry out a lot of what the military could not, how does the Joint fit into the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Theodore: Well – Interviewer: We should say the American Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Theodore: American Jewish Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s505">Let me talk a little bit about voluntary agencies and the dilemma they have in carrying on programs in disaster areas.</span> <span id="s506">It's always a mess.</span> <span id="s507">When you have a disaster, no matter how well trained the people are, somehow or another there are so many different groupings, the government, the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s508">It's a caritas.</span> <span id="s509">Coordination is so essential.</span> <span id="s510">In Germany there was the army, sacrosanct.</span> <span id="s511">They had a responsibility because they were carrying out -- they were running the Germans, the military government.</span> <span id="s512">Their responsibility was to get them on their feet.</span> <span id="s513">They called in the UNRRA because they realized very quickly back in early 1945 that something had to be done and they couldn't do it, or they didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s514">That wasn't their job.</span> <span id="s515">That wasn't why you became a general, to look after some people.</span> <span id="s516">And so the UNRRA came in and was given responsibility for running the camps with the backing of the army who brought in medical supplies, who brought in food and so on, and they set up a system of distribution, and then, of course, hung around the camps.</span> <span id="s517">Every camp had a committee.</span> <span id="s518">Ours were Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s519">We fostered the central committee.</span> <span id="s520">We were allowed to come in – Interviewer: Now using the term "we" again, and I know you were with the UNRRA and you were with the Joint, so we need to be clear here.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Theodore: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s522">I don't want to say we with the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s523">I'll say we with the Joint.</span> <span id="s524">The voluntary -- the JDC is a voluntary agency.</span> <span id="s525">We were working in many areas in Europe before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s526">We were into Italy.</span> <span id="s527">We were into France and Belgium, Holland.</span> <span id="s528">However, there was some concern for whatever reason for bringing the JDC and other voluntary agencies into Germany.</span> <span id="s529">The UNRRA had to ask permission from the military and it wasn't until June that we came in, for whatever their reason.</span> <span id="s530">They had many reasons, communication.</span> <span id="s531">They were afraid, still, that there may have been an underground.</span> <span id="s532">We were told when we were riding in the jeep, never ride with your front glass down, keep it up, because the Germans had put wires across and so on.</span> <span id="s533">So there was the danger aspect, overexagerated, but military has to, you know, security is security.</span> <span id="s534">And finally the UNRRA had to put into motion a portion of their organization to look after us.</span> <span id="s535">Not that we were so terrible, but we needed housing.</span> <span id="s536">We needed uniforms.</span> <span id="s537">We wanted to be part of the PX and, of course, that's where the army, rankled with civilians, was going to the PX.</span> <span id="s538">What I'm saying is that at the outset all voluntary agencies had a difficult time getting in.</span> <span id="s539">Once we came in, we were there as agents, as part of the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s540">There was a department.</span> <span id="s541">We reported.</span> <span id="s542">We got everything through them.</span> <span id="s543">They looked after all of gasoline, for example, permission to bring in trucks and so on.</span> <span id="s544">So, this is where we stood.</span> <span id="s545">They knew our people.</span> <span id="s546">They worked with us in our planning.</span> <span id="s547">They were protective of us because they weren't having an easy time.</span> <span id="s548">And the fact I keep coming back to the generals.</span> <span id="s549">The generals did a lot of scotch drinking with the generals on the other side to help smooth the way for us to come in and work.</span> <span id="s550">Once we were in there, they left us alone.</span> <span id="s551">We got our PX card.</span> <span id="s552">We got gasoline for our trucks.</span> <span id="s553">We bought jeeps and trucks from the army for -- they were giving it away, after all.</span> <span id="s554">And so this was how we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Interviewer: What did you -- what is the work that you -- that the Joint did, how was it differentiated from what the UNRRA did?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Theodore: UNRRA had basic responsibility for feeding, for clothing, medical, but there was low standard.</span> <span id="s557">The average caloric menu was about 1,200 calories a day.</span> <span id="s558">That is not much.</span> <span id="s559">And they were bad calories, as I told you.</span> <span id="s560">They were giving us the ten and one ration that the army put out, which are numbered ten cans of Hungarian goulash or whatever, the cigarettes, in these boxes.</span> <span id="s561">And so the level of food was very low.</span> <span id="s562">And, therefore, we made provisions for bringing food in.</span> <span id="s563">They probably used their cigarettes for purchasing, which is all right.</span> <span id="s564">The army didn't mind that, because whenever our people were doing were peanuts compared to what the army was doing.</span> <span id="s565">So, you know, they didn't make too much noise about it.</span> <span id="s566">But we went closer to the people.</span> <span id="s567">We went closer to the people.</span> <span id="s568">Our representatives in the big camps sat in with the central committee every day in the problems of running a camp and how we could help them, what were those things that they didn't have that we had or could get.</span> <span id="s569">So we enhanced the diet.</span> <span id="s570">We had a large number of TB's.</span> <span id="s571">We were the first to bring penicillin into Vienna and into Germany.</span> <span id="s572">We were supplementing because the UNRRA was unable -- they didn't speak the language, let's put it bluntly as that -- where our people would speak to us.</span> <span id="s573">We could get to know more about what was happening than any UNRRA person.</span> <span id="s574">And so we were sort of the cushion between the people and what they were supposed to get from the UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Interviewer: What other ways were you able to supplement, other than giving them food?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Theodore: Well, food, medicine, clothing, a great deal of clothing, cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Interviewer: Did you get involved in education or vocational training or –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Theodore: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Interviewer: -- with this activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Theodore: We even printed a Talmud.</span> <span id="s581">Yes.</span> <span id="s582">Yes.</span> <span id="s583">We had Rabbi on our staff, two rabbis, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s584">We had an educator on our staff.</span> <span id="s585">We brought teachers from Palestine to the schools.</span> <span id="s586">Now the question is where in 1947 were you with children that needed education?</span> <span id="s587">Well, that was a miracle.</span> <span id="s588">These were children who came from the East, who had lived underground with their families, or were Russian and came in.</span> <span id="s589">So we -- as a matter of fact, I think we had twenty teachers brought from Israel.</span> <span id="s590">One thing they had to have, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s591">If they didn't have the Yiddish, they weren't good teachers.</span> <span id="s592">Every part of their daily living we, in one way or another, touched.</span> <span id="s593">And, of course, when we set up our immigration in 1948, we helped tens of thousands of people to immigrate.</span> <span id="s594">They used to have a term; the Joint is "unser Vater."</span> <span id="s595">The Joint is our rescuer.</span> <span id="s596">But that didn't mean that they looked at us and we were living fairly comfortably.</span> <span id="s597">We weren’t paid big salaries.</span> <span id="s598">I remember my salary was $7,000 a year.</span> <span id="s599">It was a good salary at that time.</span> <span id="s600">But they weren't jealous because they knew that when they needed help, we were there.</span> <span id="s601">We would protect them from the military government.</span> <span id="s602">We had lawyers on our staff.</span> <span id="s603">We brought in surgeons for the TB hospital for operations.</span> <span id="s604">We filled the camps that the UNRRA couldn't do.</span> <span id="s605">On the other hand, we were always aware of the fact that a number of workers, that everything was functioning, and that the people deserved better pay, or cigarettes, and we kept their spirits high.</span> <span id="s606">We were there.</span> <span id="s607">And that they knew that the Joint could deliver.</span> <span id="s608">Many of them knew Joint before the war, where we had operated in Eastern Europe for so many years, immediately after World War I.</span> <span id="s609">So it wasn't like we were new.</span> <span id="s610">We were Jews, Jews.</span> <span id="s611">And they -- and I think we were pretty good Jews, because we understood what it was that was moving them and what it was that they wanted and what they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s612">And we, in our own way, helped.</span> <span id="s613">We were a direct line of the committee who were functioning.</span> <span id="s614">If the Joint had had to run our program with our own staff, we couldn't have.</span> <span id="s615">Where would you get the thousands of workers in these camps who were paid, who were functioning, who were delivering services?</span> <span id="s616">If we had set that up, first of all, we wouldn't have had enough money.</span> <span id="s617">And many other voluntary agencies were never able to figure out how we were able to work so well, because they came as strangers to whomever they were helping.</span> <span id="s618">But when it came to our people, the word Joint was something symbolic with their people being rescued and helping towards their future of moving out of there.</span> <span id="s619">And when we told them about immigration, they saw our involvement with the underground to Israel, I don't want to say they behaved themself, but they understood what was happening.</span> <span id="s620">Not that they weren't critical of us, but never mind.</span> <span id="s621">That's a love-hate affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Interviewer: How large was your operation in Europe, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Theodore: Well, on that, I'm going to give you exact figures because I knew you were going to ask it.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Interviewer: Well, there were a lot of camps.</span> <span id="s625">I wonder how many of them you were able to become involved with.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Theodore: Personnel, in January of 1946, we had 44 employees.</span> <span id="s627">In January of 1947, we had 294.</span> <span id="s628">And in January of 1948, we had 560 employees.</span> <span id="s629">But that does not include all the workers in the camp.</span> <span id="s630">These were people who were responsible to us, who were our channel to the people.</span> <span id="s631">We had -- let's see, in 1946 we had 38 employees who were from the United States.</span> <span id="s632">In 1947, we had 86.</span> <span id="s633">And in 1948, we had 110.</span> <span id="s634">That was our staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Interviewer: Where were the rest of them from?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Theodore: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Interviewer: Where the -- you mean the rest of them were the people from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Theodore: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Interviewer: I can't imagine you going in with 44 employees in 1945.</span> <span id="s640">That's not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Theodore: Well, that -- we had decided soon on that recruiting in the United States was very difficult.</span> <span id="s642">And we made a plea to many people about servicemen who wanted to work overseas.</span> <span id="s643">And we got quite a few that way, like myself.</span> <span id="s644">And any -- you know, in the beginning there were only about 30,000 or 40,000.</span> <span id="s645">Our supplies hadn't started coming in.</span> <span id="s646">The best that we could do is work with the committee who were there.</span> <span id="s647">We found -- we didn't found the committee, we found them.</span> <span id="s648">And they were there.</span> <span id="s649">And they were important.</span> <span id="s650">Without them, we couldn't have carried on our program, couldn't have.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Interviewer: Were you able to work with most of the camps, or just the larger ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Theodore: Every camp.</span> <span id="s653">Every camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Interviewer: Every Jewish DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Theodore: Yeah.</span> <span id="s656">Wherever -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Interviewer: And there were many.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Theodore: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Interviewer: Just for the record, when you talk about the central committee, you've referred to it in many terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Theodore: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Interviewer: There were also committees at each camp; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Theodore: Yeah.</span> <span id="s663">Let me talk about how they functioned.</span> <span id="s664">As I say, we found them there.</span> <span id="s665">They had been helped to organize by a number of Jewish-American Army Chaplains.</span> <span id="s666">And they accepted their role.</span> <span id="s667">They were serious.</span> <span id="s668">As a matter of fact, in 1946 Ben-Gurion visited, and he was their guest.</span> <span id="s669">And it's interesting that someone was willing to put forward to Mr. Ben-Gurion that the city of Stuttgart, if he felt that he wanted all the Jews to inhabit that one city, they thought they could work it through with the military government and the army and the Germans.</span> <span id="s670">He got so excited and so mad.</span> <span id="s671">How dare you bring up such a thing?</span> <span id="s672">No Jew will remain here that should be in Palestine.</span> <span id="s673">But this is the committee.</span> <span id="s674">They were thinking how can we?</span> <span id="s675">After all, there were buildings, there were factories.</span> <span id="s676">This would be a good place and so on.</span> <span id="s677">The committee saw their role as a part of us, and as a part of us.</span> <span id="s678">We met every day.</span> <span id="s679">We -- I shouldn't have said that.</span> <span id="s680">We met -- generally the committee liked to meet at night, because during the day they were busy.</span> <span id="s681">And they also knew that when it got to be about 12:00 or 1:00, we got tired.</span> <span id="s682">And it was at that point that they would bring up some of the requests that they felt they couldn't pass early in the day.</span> <span id="s683">But by the time we got tired, we'd say okay, another thing, another thing.</span> <span id="s684">There was a mutual respect on their part, realizing, even though most of us had never been in the Holocaust or the Shoah, yet they understood how we were working, how we needed to function in order to be able to have our committee in the United States accept what we were doing.</span> <span id="s685">And when they began leaving, things began getting more difficult.</span> <span id="s686">We had to take more responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Interviewer: Were they responsible to committees within each camp?</span> <span id="s688">Were there also committees within each camp, self-government?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Theodore: They weren't responsible.</span> <span id="s690">The committees in the camp were responsible to them.</span> <span id="s691">That was the channel.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Interviewer: But each camp had a self-governing committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Theodore: That's right.</span> <span id="s694">All of them tied into the central committee.</span> <span id="s695">They didn't always agree.</span> <span id="s696">There were arguments and so on, but it was a normal kind of reaction that they had to each other.</span> <span id="s697">But when things got tough and when people began being moved around, the committee was very important.</span> <span id="s698">Because at one point, the army or German government said we would like to consolidate the camps, because after all, there was a lot of all these people coming from the east that were living pretty badly and they wanted to have these.</span> <span id="s699">And that was also a point where Jews were moving out.</span> <span id="s700">By 1948 and 1949, American immigration had set up -- or it began, based on what was called the Truman Directive, that anybody who had been in camp would have a priority in immigrating to the United States.</span> <span id="s701">So, that was the atmosphere at that point.</span> <span id="s702">The committee, of course, would like -- would have liked them all to go to Israel, but not all the people wanted that.</span> <span id="s703">They had -- many had relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s704">They had friends who were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s705">But when it came to committees that visited the camps, they were all united.</span> <span id="s706">They all wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Interviewer: So was the primary goal of the central committee to work with you and other aid organizations to get what they needed for the displaced people?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Theodore: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Interviewer: I'm just trying to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Theodore: Yes.</span> <span id="s711">We felt that -- not that we didn't have our own experts about what it is that we needed sent to them -- but we relied on their data and on their forthrightness as to what were the priorities.</span> <span id="s712">We listened to them.</span> <span id="s713">And when we made a distribution, we worked with them.</span> <span id="s714">So it was well financed by us.</span> <span id="s715">We felt it was important.</span> <span id="s716">We gave them status.</span> <span id="s717">After all, they had status with a colonel from the U.S. Army who came over every day, couldn't talk to them, although few spoke English.</span> <span id="s718">He would come over and schmooze with us as to what was going on.</span> <span id="s719">And when there was something really desperate, we did call the colonel.</span> <span id="s720">There were incidents once where some fellow decided that the black market on Mohlstrasse ought to be done away with.</span> <span id="s721">And instead of coming with the military police, they came with German police, armed, armed.</span> <span id="s722">It came to us about five minutes after it began.</span> <span id="s723">One person had already been shot.</span> <span id="s724">And instead of the military government pulling these police out, someone says clear the street.</span> <span id="s725">It was two very long blocks.</span> <span id="s726">And they were right around the corner from our office.</span> <span id="s727">And meanwhile, a crowd of probably 500 had gathered at the other end of Mohlstrasse, at which point my colleague, Dr. Kahane, who died the other day, and I ran out.</span> <span id="s728">And not knowing what to do, though we certainly didn't want to go to where the police were, and when we realized that the group was slowly walking up the streets, 500.</span> <span id="s729">Nothing in their hands, no stones, no sticks.</span> <span id="s730">And the people looked at me.</span> <span id="s731">I looked at them, and said, "Let's go."</span> <span id="s732">So down we ran to the group and we walked with them.</span> <span id="s733">By that time somebody with a little more sense had decided that they weren't going to start a third world war, and withdrew the German police.</span> <span id="s734">And it never happened again.</span> <span id="s735">And that didn't make us exactly heroes, because we were stupid, but it happened just that way.</span> <span id="s736">And so the army knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s737">All the black market we knew, we weren't involved.</span> <span id="s738">It wasn't our responsibility, and the central committee status was raised by the fact that they had brought about this reaction to the use of Germans, because this was 1947, late 1947, early 1948.</span> <span id="s739">And it made headlines in the United States.</span> <span id="s740">The military government was told in no uncertain terms that they had done wrong.</span> <span id="s741">So this was the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Interviewer: When you started working with the Joint in 1946, what was the situation in the camp?</span> <span id="s743">Were they pretty well organized at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Theodore: Yes.</span> <span id="s745">They certainly were organized.</span> <span id="s746">We had not yet come to our full capacity of bringing in supplies.</span> <span id="s747">Now, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s748">You can only land in France or in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s749">And for the army, for some reason, only landed in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s750">So we had to set up warehouses, and there's pictures in this thing, because what we had we couldn't make a full distribution to everybody.</span> <span id="s751">So we had to make decisions as to who got what when, and that wasn't very easy.</span> <span id="s752">It was very cruel.</span> <span id="s753">But it was the best that we could do, except that we did have cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Interviewer: How did you make those decisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Theodore: With the committee.</span> <span id="s756">With the committee.</span> <span id="s757">We tried to assess, because not every camp was the same as far as the UNRRA supplies they were getting.</span> <span id="s758">And so we knew that there was some not -- just better supply officers in one camp than in the other.</span> <span id="s759">And we knew just what was happening, and we made the decision on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Interviewer: Where did you get your supplies from?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Theodore: We bought cigarettes in Switzerland, some food, but it was all -- there wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s762">So we had to bring it in from the United States.</span> <span id="s763">So that time in 1947, we really started to get our supplies, and by 1948 there was a constant movement of supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Interviewer: And was this mostly privately funded?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Theodore: All, all.</span> <span id="s766">Anything we brought in was funded by the JDC through the United Jewish Appeal.</span> <span id="s767">As a matter of fact, yes, we got some money from South Africa, but this was all JDC money.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Interviewer: Did you have specialists on your staff who knew how to procure supplies and do all of this kind of stuff?</span> <span id="s769">I mean, it's a big job.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Theodore: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s771">Well, that's where the local people were so good, because they -- as I mentioned before, the Germans weren't sitting by idly.</span> <span id="s772">The Germans were producing, but they didn't want to sell.</span> <span id="s773">As I say, the Reichsmark had no value.</span> <span id="s774">You would light -- kids lit cigarettes with 100 Marks, and so on.</span> <span id="s775">We had some very fine people on our staff and who knew where some of the stuff was and negotiations would take place, and we would get it if it was -- and they also knew that we were willing to pay in dollars in the States or wherever.</span> <span id="s776">And in every area there were eggs and butter and chickens.</span> <span id="s777">And so each camp had its own channel of where to buy things.</span> <span id="s778">There was one story of the first United Jewish Appeal mission to Germany, and it came in February of 1947.</span> <span id="s779">It was the first airliner to fly into Munich [München].</span> <span id="s780">There were no steps so they came down a ladder.</span> <span id="s781">There were 40 men and women, all dressed as if they were going on a hike into the mountains, you know.</span> <span id="s782">Winterclothes and so on, and they came to see the programs.</span> <span id="s783">And the leadership looked aside and said, look, we know what we're doing, but the people ought to see what the UNRRA is giving.</span> <span id="s784">So, we again used a camp called Feldafing, and we talked to the directors and said, we want the people to see the menu for that day as published by the UNRRA, and we want them to eat dinner and breakfast based on the UN nutritional menu, and don't deviate one iota.</span> <span id="s785">Give it to them.</span> <span id="s786">Now, we knew that generally for dinner they would get two or three slices of bread.</span> <span id="s787">They might get small butter.</span> <span id="s788">They might have one slice of cold cut.</span> <span id="s789">And they would have tea.</span> <span id="s790">That was dinner.</span> <span id="s791">For breakfast it was black bread and butter and a little jam.</span> <span id="s792">That was it.</span> <span id="s793">And he also said, we want to live like some of them live.</span> <span id="s794">Well, show us where they're living and set up a place and ten of us will stay overnight.</span> <span id="s795">Fine.</span> <span id="s796">And it's true that there was barracks [for] living there.</span> <span id="s797">So we took one second floor barracks, which was a military barrack, and the bathrooms were a dozen sinks and so on.</span> <span id="s798">And we set up their beds with mattress filled with straw, which the people -- but we did give them a lot of blankets.</span> <span id="s799">And, of course, the windows we covered over and so on.</span> <span id="s800">They understood.</span> <span id="s801">The morning that they were to go out there, I sent the fellow who wrote the document.</span> <span id="s802">I said, "Go out there and see if everything is set."</span> <span id="s803">They don't want what we're giving them.</span> <span id="s804">They don't want any trace of it.</span> <span id="s805">Just what the UNRRA is giving them today.</span> <span id="s806">Half-hour later he said, "Mr. Feder, I'm here, but a terrible thing has happened, also a nice thing."</span> <span id="s807">The committee felt that if they were going to greet and entertain the people who were helping them, they ought to give them a nice meal.</span> <span id="s808">What's there?</span> <span id="s809">He says, "Well, I tell you, it's a nice meal.</span> <span id="s810">There's chicken and there's even a piece of pork."</span> <span id="s811">I said, "Get it out.</span> <span id="s812">Bring it over to the hospital and put it in their kitchen."</span> <span id="s813">"But they're going to argue with me."</span> <span id="s814">I said, "Don't argue.</span> <span id="s815">Tell them we won't give them their next month's ration if they don't."</span> <span id="s816">I said, "Let these people see what the UNRRA's giving them."</span> <span id="s817">Well, it was the most successful mission in the history of the UJA, because what they saw was honest.</span> <span id="s818">They saw what the people had been living.</span> <span id="s819">And then they also saw a difference between what they had and what the people were eating, based on what we had done for them.</span> <span id="s820">As they came to the camp, people were sitting outside.</span> <span id="s821">The bus pulled up and these ten people walked out.</span> <span id="s822">Our people had never seen people dressed that way.</span> <span id="s823">They thought they looked like bums.</span> <span id="s824">And when they were introduced, these are the people from the United States, they looked at them, and they kissed them, and they said we would never have recognized you.</span> <span id="s825">There's also a story about Yahudi Menuhin and Leonard Bernstein.</span> <span id="s826">Yahuda Menuhin, very little guy, made a terrible mistake; although, in his way of thinking, he was right.</span> <span id="s827">He came to Germany too early.</span> <span id="s828">He came in early 1947 and gave a concert in Germany.</span> <span id="s829">Our people were roused.</span> <span id="s830">They were angry; and the Jews should come and play for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s831">He asked -- let's see, there's a military government, if he could visit a Jewish DP camp.</span> <span id="s832">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s833">And they called and our people were there, and as they came up, they were booing him.</span> <span id="s834">They were shaking their fists at him.</span> <span id="s835">No one did anything to him.</span> <span id="s836">No one touched him, but he had a great fear.</span> <span id="s837">He saw it.</span> <span id="s838">When he came to Frankfurt, he told the story to the then advisor on Jewish affairs, Judge Leventhal of Philadelphia, told a story, and says, "Why are they like this?"</span> <span id="s839">He said, "Look, I'm not going to answer you.</span> <span id="s840">I'm going to show you something."</span> <span id="s841">He took him over to the Federal Depository, and took him in the basement in a --- where it was locked.</span> <span id="s842">He says, "Come look."</span> <span id="s843">And what was there were gold fillings that were Jewish.</span> <span id="s844">He did say a word except, "Mr. Yahudi Menuhin, that's why they did what they did."</span> <span id="s845">Leonard Bernstein was another thing.</span> <span id="s846">One day, it must have been in 1948, the phone rings and a man says, "My name is Leonard Bernstein.</span> <span id="s847">Is this the Jewish Joint?"</span> <span id="s848">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s849">He said, "I need help."</span> <span id="s850">"What is it?"</span> <span id="s851">"Well, I'm here to conduct the Munich Philharmonic and there's a strike and the orchestra can't come to rehearsals.</span> <span id="s852">Is there any way you could help us?"</span> <span id="s853">So, Sam Haber, the director, said, "Sure.</span> <span id="s854">How many people are there?</span> <span id="s855">Let us speak to persons arranging."</span> <span id="s856">So it wound up that we sent ten trucks to ten different places, brought the musicians in, and they rehearsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Interviewer: When he wanted to conduct the Munich –</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Theodore: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Interviewer: -- Philharmonic.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Theodore: He couldn't get the orchestra, because there was a strike.</span> <span id="s861">So we made available trucks to pick them up at various points and bring them to rehearsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Interviewer: These were German musicians?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Theodore: German musicians.</span> <span id="s864">We decided, you know, by now he -- I can even remember one of the pieces was a Ravel piano concerto for left hand, and he conducted it.</span> <span id="s865">Conducted it.</span> <span id="s866">And after it was over, I said, "You know, we've been very helpful to you.</span> <span id="s867">We want you to be helpful to us."</span> <span id="s868">He said, "What can I do?"</span> <span id="s869">We said, "We have a small DP orchestra in Wolford's house, and would you conduct them?"</span> <span id="s870">"How many?"</span> <span id="s871">"Eleven."</span> <span id="s872">He said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s873">We brought him out.</span> <span id="s874">He was in his tux.</span> <span id="s875">The hall was full, and thousands of people gathered outside, the great Leonard Bernstein.</span> <span id="s876">I think it was “Poet and Peasant" that he conducted.</span> <span id="s877">And I was sitting inside watching him, and his hands got so wet from the tears, that he barely stood up he was so emotional.</span> <span id="s878">And “Poet and Peasant" never sounded like “Poet and Peasant" ever was played.</span> <span id="s879">And it was over, and they applauded.</span> <span id="s880">He came back.</span> <span id="s881">He pulled himself together.</span> <span id="s882">And we said, "You know, a lot of people didn't hear you.</span> <span id="s883">Would you do it again?"</span> <span id="s884">He said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s885">And everybody moved out.</span> <span id="s886">Some more moved in.</span> <span id="s887">And there he was, still crying.</span> <span id="s888">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s889">So, when it was over the people gathered around and kissing this man, hugging him.</span> <span id="s890">He didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s891">And he stayed there for another hour, walking about, talking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s892">And that night we took him to dinner at the officer's club, which was in the Haus Der Kunst, which was a large museum Hitler had built for the new German art.</span> <span id="s893">And the army always takes the present.</span> <span id="s894">So, there we were, and it was rather obvious, an American Army mess with an orchestra of ten people, a meal cost 25 cents.</span> <span id="s895">The director recognized him and came over and said, "Am I being too forward?</span> <span id="s896">Could you play us a piece?"</span> <span id="s897">"Oh," he said, "sure."</span> <span id="s898">He said, "Any Jews here?"</span> <span id="s899">[laughs] The director didn't know.</span> <span id="s900">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s901">It was 10:00 PM.</span> <span id="s902">At 2:15 in the morning he finished.</span> <span id="s903">He was getting out of himself all the built-up frustration that that day had brought him.</span> <span id="s904">I'm not talking about how good a Jew he was, but he certainly wasn't involved in Jewish affairs, and yet that was Leonard Bernstein.</span> <span id="s905">That was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Interviewer: I need to ask you some more questions, which may be a little bit more mundane, but I think they're important for information purposes.</span> <span id="s907">You mentioned the prevalence of the black market in postwar Europe.</span> <span id="s908">Were you at the Joint able to make that work for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Theodore: Whatever we did was something that the army allowed us to do.</span> <span id="s910">We would have never set up the program of distribution based on working and so on with a minimum to every family, if the army and the UNRRA had not allowed us to do it.</span> <span id="s911">They knew we were doing it.</span> <span id="s912">So, in effect, it wasn't black market.</span> <span id="s913">I mean, we just didn't take a boxcar and say, here.</span> <span id="s914">A boxcar would have been a quarter-of-a-million dollars profit.</span> <span id="s915">We had a case like that by someone, too.</span> <span id="s916">No, we didn't condone or allow or be part of it.</span> <span id="s917">What they wanted to do was their business.</span> <span id="s918">We weren't there to police them for the Germans or the military government.</span> <span id="s919">If the military government wanted to arrest them, fine.</span> <span id="s920">But that was a gimmick, not of our making.</span> <span id="s921">The goal of all the people were to leave.</span> <span id="s922">The number who were left behind finally in 1955, 1957, were small.</span> <span id="s923">They had problems that they couldn't immigrate.</span> <span id="s924">Maybe they had a little business or whatever, and that was our goal.</span> <span id="s925">The military government knew that if they were arresting people, putting it on the record, they could never immigrate.</span> <span id="s926">And black market didn't seem like a major crime in the world about us.</span> <span id="s927">So, they were very lenient on it.</span> <span id="s928">Occasionally, they would have some, but nobody was kept from immigration because he did a little black marketing.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Interviewer: I'm just looking at perhaps, if you were -- needed more supplies or different supplies, there had to be ways to get those, other than waiting for them to come from the United States.</span> <span id="s930">I don't know if you were able to -- you, as the system, for your own purposes and your own goals.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Theodore: Well, we didn't deliberately, but certainly it took place.</span> <span id="s932">If a camp that got their supplies decided that they would enhance the menu by fresh fruit and it cost them a carton of cigarettes, they used it.</span> <span id="s933">We didn't stop them.</span> <span id="s934">But they were doing it.</span> <span id="s935">And that's how the system sort of worked.</span> <span id="s936">But, look, the military were wonderful.</span> <span id="s937">At one time in Frankfurt, in the main center of the city, the army set up a great big store, with two entrances.</span> <span id="s938">One entrance was for the GI’s and officers who could come in and be given points for chocolate, cigarettes, soap, whatever.</span> <span id="s939">They got points.</span> <span id="s940">The other door -- now this is the American Army -- the other door was for the Germans who could come through with whatever it is they wanted to sell, Meissen [porcelain], china, cameras.</span> <span id="s941">They brought it in.</span> <span id="s942">They got their points.</span> <span id="s943">The Germans took their points for their cutlery or whatever, walked over to the other side and used those points to get what the GIs had brought in, the chocolate and so on.</span> <span id="s944">The GI took his little points and went around the other side and bought his Meissen.</span> <span id="s945">That was army sponsored.</span> <span id="s946">So the army knew, but didn't know how to control that issue.</span> <span id="s947">But it wasn't considered such a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Interviewer: Now when you talked about your involvement with the Brikha and that you were able to help them get soap, or able to help, I guess, get some money to them to do what they needed to do, was that official policy or unofficial policy?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Theodore: It had to be official.</span> <span id="s950">We didn't do it on our own.</span> <span id="s951">Our people, as a matter of fact, our director at that time -- I showed you the picture -- was Doctor Joseph Schwartz.</span> <span id="s952">He was a great man.</span> <span id="s953">And the policy he had agreed with by our lay leadership in New York certainly was from that end.</span> <span id="s954">We worked very closely together.</span> <span id="s955">I wouldn't have been able to get tens of thousands of gallons of gas if I hadn't been told go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s956">I didn't steal it.</span> <span id="s957">We just weren't using all our trucks, and they gave us so much per truck.</span> <span id="s958">The Army, deep down on a high level, understood, understood what our motives were.</span> <span id="s959">They knew exactly what we were doing.</span> <span id="s960">They knew every aspect of it.</span> <span id="s961">And they were sympathetic to it, because like that, they could have stopped us.</span> <span id="s962">And so we didn't set it up.</span> <span id="s963">We didn't always condone it, but it was there.</span> <span id="s964">And in the final analysis, it was of great help to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Interviewer: Was it important to be resourceful in maybe not breaking the rules, but bending the rules to accomplish what you needed to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Theodore: It's a very nice statement.</span> <span id="s967">I agree one hundred percent.</span> <span id="s968">I have a story.</span> <span id="s969">One day I received a call from the colonel.</span> <span id="s970">And he said, "I have a question to ask, and I'd like your opinion."</span> <span id="s971">This was around Passover.</span> <span id="s972">But, you know, the Orthodox on Passover must cleanse the house of the -- not of the khometz because you can't have it around.</span> <span id="s973">And at some point if you have a store, your rabbi agrees with you to sell it temporarily to a gentile.</span> <span id="s974">And so he said, "We raided the camp and we found three floors of ration food.</span> <span id="s975">And the committee states the following: That according to Jewish law, no Jew must have khometz in his home during Passover and, therefore, they brought all of their khometz to this warehouse and checked it in, in order to come within the ruling.</span> <span id="s976">My question to you is, is it true that for Passover, an Orthodox Jew must rid his home of khometz?"</span> <span id="s977">And I said, "Absolutely.</span> <span id="s978">I do it, too."</span> <span id="s979">Dead silence.</span> <span id="s980">"Thank you very much."</span> <span id="s981">Now, just think of what I did.</span> <span id="s982">I didn't say anything but give him a direct answer to a question he asked me because he wanted no part of it, either.</span> <span id="s983">I could have said it seems impossible that a thousand people would give their food into one warehouse.</span> <span id="s984">And obviously this is a warehouse for -- I knew it was a warehouse for the camp where they had food in it.</span> <span id="s985">But I didn't say anything but what he asked me.</span> <span id="s986">So that's when you talk about being resourceful.</span> <span id="s987">Then there's a funnier one even.</span> <span id="s988">It had to do with a cow in a warehouse.</span> <span id="s989">And the military had been told that somebody brought a cow into the camp.</span> <span id="s990">And so they were, after all this is rationed food.</span> <span id="s991">They came in and were looking for it.</span> <span id="s992">And they came to the warehouse.</span> <span id="s993">They went through the first floor.</span> <span id="s994">Not there.</span> <span id="s995">The cow was on an elevator.</span> <span id="s996">It was on the third floor.</span> <span id="s997">So when they went to the second floor, the cow went to the first floor.</span> <span id="s998">And when they came down, the cow was brought up to the third floor.</span> <span id="s999">And that's how they had cheated the military government of a cow, mobile cow.</span> <span id="s1000">So resourcefulness was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Interviewer: I assume it also was with the illegal immigration to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Theodore: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1003">That was an experience which had so many edges to it.</span> <span id="s1004">From Austria, the quickest way, and there was any number of children institutioned, they had to walk through the mountain about a mile, and they did it, children, women, men.</span> <span id="s1005">And on the other side, there was a truck that took them.</span> <span id="s1006">But most of the movement was handled through border checkpoints, through friendly border checkpoints.</span> <span id="s1007">Also, the Brikha coming eastward -- or westward went through Russian checkpoints.</span> <span id="s1008">And they weren't stopped.</span> <span id="s1009">But somebody had been there before and had made a distribution of vodka.</span> <span id="s1010">You can just imagine the kind of planning you had to do and the resourcefulness of the people who were involved to know that a train carrying a few thousand people coming through.</span> <span id="s1011">And they made check -- spot checks.</span> <span id="s1012">When ours came in, they didn't.</span> <span id="s1013">So there are all kinds of stories of the resourcefulness of the Palestinians, now Israelis.</span> <span id="s1014">And it was -- the head of it was a man by the name of Chaim Hoffman, his Hebrew name was Yakhiel [?]</span> <span id="s1015">.</span> <span id="s1016">He died.</span> <span id="s1017">And I remember a month before he died, I had met him in Israel.</span> <span id="s1018">And he said, "You know, Ted, no one knows what happened there more than I. No one knows what you guys did."</span> <span id="s1019">Because one of the jokes about the Brikha is that everybody was in it.</span> <span id="s1020">And it's true.</span> <span id="s1021">A lot of people were in it.</span> <span id="s1022">But basically they were able to function with the funds that they received from us.</span> <span id="s1023">You know – Interviewer: I'm going to stop you here, because we're out of tape.</span> <span id="s1024">[End of Tape Two]</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Tape Three Interviewer: You were talking about the Brikha and the spirit in everyone –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Theodore: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Interviewer: -- that had been involved.</span> <span id="s1028">Now, were you, as representative or deputy director of the Joint Distribution, directly involved with these efforts?</span> <span id="s1029">How did you – Theodore: Well, not really, because what we tried to do is to not -- and they felt the same way -- become too involved with the people who were functioning out in the field.</span> <span id="s1030">So our office was in direct contact with the top person, who was this man Chaim Hoffman.</span> <span id="s1031">And whatever it was that he needed or wanted, he would come to us; we to him.</span> <span id="s1032">I don't want to say it was like an army, because the people were functioning on their own out in the field.</span> <span id="s1033">And they all came to this point.</span> <span id="s1034">It was about a half-block away from us, he, who held all the wires in his hand.</span> <span id="s1035">And we moved directly with him, for good reasons.</span> <span id="s1036">We were American.</span> <span id="s1037">We shouldn't be involved in this.</span> <span id="s1038">After all, we were in there for an altogether different reason, to bring help to the people in the camps.</span> <span id="s1039">We weren't there to send people underground to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1040">So we always -- our name never appeared on anything.</span> <span id="s1041">But their needs were covered directly between our office and his office, whether it was money, whether it was gasoline, whether it was trucks.</span> <span id="s1042">Although technically, he was in officially, because the Jewish Agency -- remember I told you about bringing teachers in -- they came in under the aegis of the Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s1043">So the IRO, at that time, had him as part of a voluntary agency, with the Jewish Agency, for Palestine wives [lives?]</span> <span id="s1044">.</span> <span id="s1045">And so he was there legally, and functioned from there with all the communication that was available.</span> <span id="s1046">But, you know, we knew where they were.</span> <span id="s1047">We knew what camps they were in.</span> <span id="s1048">We made an effort to be a little more generous to them.</span> <span id="s1049">And they were generous to us.</span> <span id="s1050">They liked to try to pull wool over our eyes, as any committee has a right to.</span> <span id="s1051">If they don't, I would throw them out.</span> <span id="s1052">If they don't want to argue with us and if they don't want to bring up plans that we might buy, gee, what kind of committee are they?</span> <span id="s1053">But there was one that we wouldn't take.</span> <span id="s1054">We had a children's home right down on border near Birches Gaden.</span> <span id="s1055">And one day there was a request that came up from children.</span> <span id="s1056">The request was to build a ritual bath.</span> <span id="s1057">I took that into Mr. Haber.</span> <span id="s1058">I said, "Sam," -- he was as religious as I am -- "do you think that children need a ritual bath?"</span> <span id="s1059">So we said, well, you know, they're asking about that, about $4,000 for it.</span> <span id="s1060">So we went over to Chief Rabbi and said, "We had a request for mikveh at this home.</span> <span id="s1061">Do you see any reason why, or are there people living nearby who need a ritual bath?"</span> <span id="s1062">And he looked up at me, and he smiled.</span> <span id="s1063">He said, "I can't tell you that there isn't a woman down there who may need a ritual bath.</span> <span id="s1064">But I want to tell you, if there is one, I'll do everything I can to bring them up to the next camp where there is a ritual bath."</span> <span id="s1065">So it was not all fun and games, because sometimes there was danger in moving these convoys through, because at one point there were some scattered shots going through the French Zone of Austria.</span> <span id="s1066">That was cleared up.</span> <span id="s1067">But the majority, there was never any real danger with all the movement of these tens of thousands of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Interviewer: Did you have good working relationships with other organizations, other aid organizations that were involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Theodore: Yes.</span> <span id="s1070">Well, with ORT and HIAS and the Jewish Agency, there were no problems.</span> <span id="s1071">We cooperated.</span> <span id="s1072">We saw eye to eye.</span> <span id="s1073">We had the same goals.</span> <span id="s1074">There was never any competition.</span> <span id="s1075">And no one else was doing what we were doing.</span> <span id="s1076">However, we had a very fine contact with the non-Jewish agencies, and there were many.</span> <span id="s1077">The Catholic Relief Services, the World Council of Churches, the Quakers, International Social Service.</span> <span id="s1078">There must have been fifteen or twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Interviewer: They were in the Jewish DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Theodore: No.</span> <span id="s1081">They were in Germany.</span> <span id="s1082">They were working in Germany.</span> <span id="s1083">They were working in other camps.</span> <span id="s1084">And we knew each other, after all.</span> <span id="s1085">And one day, and I don't know whose idea it was -- I know it was the guy from the World Council of Churches -- he called up one day and he said, "Ted, we are going up to Frankfurt to talk to the military about an issue dealing with something with the camps."</span> <span id="s1086">And he said, "I'd like to take a lot of us along."</span> <span id="s1087">I said, "I'd be happy to."</span> <span id="s1088">He says, "I'm even going to put on my big cross, which I usually don't."</span> <span id="s1089">And we went up and we saw Lucius Clay, General Lucius Clay.</span> <span id="s1090">And they presented their problem.</span> <span id="s1091">And he was sympathetic.</span> <span id="s1092">And the issue was settled.</span> <span id="s1093">And as we went back on the train, we were talking.</span> <span id="s1094">And suddenly he said, "Why don't we have a voluntary agency set up, an agency of all three agencies, and meet once a month?</span> <span id="s1095">They have similar problems.</span> <span id="s1096">And, if we want to go together, do it."</span> <span id="s1097">And thus was born a council of voluntary agencies that had a lot of clout.</span> <span id="s1098">You know, it's easier if you go in with a lot of agencies with different religions, rather than going alone.</span> <span id="s1099">And so we set it up and we were very careful to keep it on the right level, that we would all see eye to eye.</span> <span id="s1100">And I remember when I moved to Austria, we set up a volunteer agency there.</span> <span id="s1101">Whereas in the United States, the kind of kindredship and cooperation between these agencies mostly was nil.</span> <span id="s1102">But over there, suddenly, the importance of religion didn't come into it.</span> <span id="s1103">We were fighting a cause.</span> <span id="s1104">And as volunteer agencies, we said it.</span> <span id="s1105">We set it to a commanding general or to an ambassador, that we are a voluntary agency.</span> <span id="s1106">We obey the laws, but we're carrying out the policy that those who have contributed to us want us to do.</span> <span id="s1107">We will not be in conflict with the government or the military.</span> <span id="s1108">But if we have a policy to carry out within the rules, we'll do it, whether they like it or not.</span> <span id="s1109">And so, you know, they didn't mind that because they were also a little concerned about how things were going in these camps.</span> <span id="s1110">The military government liked the fact that there was peace in the Jewish camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Interviewer: You were talking earlier about almost a resurrection of these people in the camp, and how their lives began again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Theodore: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Interviewer: Can you talk a little bit more about how that came about and how long it took?</span> <span id="s1114">There's a whole sort of besides the physical rebirth, almost, of a lot of these people weren't well.</span> <span id="s1115">Had there been a spiritual rebirth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Theodore: Sure.</span> <span id="s1117">Well, let me start with right after the war.</span> <span id="s1118">Everybody, I told you, there was so much movement, so everybody was moving, looking for their relatives.</span> <span id="s1119">We, on our part, in all our offices painted the walls white for people to put their names up.</span> <span id="s1120">And so we had steady streams of people coming, looking.</span> <span id="s1121">What I'm trying to get at is that there was something in them that they had to look, that they might find, and there were few who did find.</span> <span id="s1122">And when they did, you would know it because it ended always in screaming and shouting.</span> <span id="s1123">That was a period, a period of unrest.</span> <span id="s1124">They didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1125">They -- the organization wasn't ready for them.</span> <span id="s1126">They accepted to be put into facilities by the UNRRA, the underground was go to Landsberg, wherever, you'll get in.</span> <span id="s1127">And that was a period of bewilderment for most people.</span> <span id="s1128">Where am I going?</span> <span id="s1129">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1130">Despite the fact that he was living on the bloody soil of Germany, he was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1131">He had a chavura.</span> <span id="s1132">He had friends.</span> <span id="s1133">He had fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s1134">He had JDC trying to help him, and he was helped.</span> <span id="s1135">He was able to eat.</span> <span id="s1136">He was clothed.</span> <span id="s1137">He was even given a job.</span> <span id="s1138">But it was all temporary.</span> <span id="s1139">They didn't want to continue.</span> <span id="s1140">They didn't want to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s1141">I hate to tell this story because it's a little off beat, but I must say it.</span> <span id="s1142">There was a commanding general in Heidelberg, who had been approached by an UNRRA social worker, talking about the trauma of the DP’s, all DP’s in camps.</span> <span id="s1143">And what could the Army do from a recreational point of view?</span> <span id="s1144">Bring a band in once a week to give a concert, and this was an old general.</span> <span id="s1145">And he says, "Tell me.</span> <span id="s1146">You got men in those camps?"</span> <span id="s1147">"Yes."</span> <span id="s1148">"You got women in those camps?"</span> <span id="s1149">"Yes."</span> <span id="s1150">He says, "So what do you want?</span> <span id="s1151">What more do they want?"</span> <span id="s1152">And he continued, which I'm not going to say.</span> <span id="s1153">Which is -- was his opinion that somewhere, somehow, the normal reaction of people being thrown together might end in something positive.</span> <span id="s1154">That's one opinion.</span> <span id="s1155">And he was absolutely right.</span> <span id="s1156">He was a dirty no-good so-and-so, but he was right, because the camps -- whatever we did.</span> <span id="s1157">We brought in movies.</span> <span id="s1158">We brought in players.</span> <span id="s1159">We organized every part of their life, education.</span> <span id="s1160">And also there were people with children that had come from Russia; that had come from various areas.</span> <span id="s1161">And we were to set up schools and so on.</span> <span id="s1162">And the chemistry began to take place.</span> <span id="s1163">There was no matchmaker.</span> <span id="s1164">And as I say, it suddenly -- we were blind to it, fortunately not too late -- when the committees began to talk about the fact that there were pairings off.</span> <span id="s1165">And the Rabbi was telling us about the number of marriages.</span> <span id="s1166">And he said, "There's no rings."</span> <span id="s1167">And that's when we sent somebody to Milan to buy gold-plated brass rings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Interviewer: At what time did this renewal begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Theodore: 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Interviewer: 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Theodore: 1947, because by 1948 we had these thousands of babies all over the place.</span> <span id="s1172">And you'd come into a camp -- where they got baby carriages, I don't know, because we never bought -- but somehow they got baby carriages.</span> <span id="s1173">And they'd come in the camp and you'd see a dozen women pushing.</span> <span id="s1174">And finally we said we better find out just what is this all about.</span> <span id="s1175">And we didn't get very far.</span> <span id="s1176">The committees were noncommittal.</span> <span id="s1177">And said, look, they haven't anything to do.</span> <span id="s1178">They see so much about them that's beautiful because that part of Germany was absolutely magnificent.</span> <span id="s1179">I hated it.</span> <span id="s1180">I went over the border to Switzerland, the same thing on that side.</span> <span id="s1181">It looked good.</span> <span id="s1182">None of our social workers -- it was after babies were born that they had problems.</span> <span id="s1183">Our social workers never reported about what was permeating in the group, or who were getting married.</span> <span id="s1184">We never were able to figure out those who had been in camp and those that hadn't been in camp.</span> <span id="s1185">But my own feeling was that a great number who had been in camp also married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Interviewer: I'm wondering; a lot of the young girls who had been in the camp feel they lost their adolescence in teenage years, all of a sudden they were in the DP camps, and I assume also having babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Theodore: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Interviewer: I wonder if this was a difficulty that your social workers and psychologists had to help them, and I don't think these people were necessarily prepared for adulthood in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Theodore: No, now if we think about it, it could very well have been a defiance.</span> <span id="s1190">The German down the street two years would kill me.</span> <span id="s1191">I'm having a baby.</span> <span id="s1192">I'm coming back.</span> <span id="s1193">It's funny, I never thought of analyzing it or why.</span> <span id="s1194">See, I've met people who were born in camp, and I asked them what -- what did your family tell you about their life?</span> <span id="s1195">They say very little, very little.</span> <span id="s1196">They don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1197">As a matter of fact, you know, there's a whole organization of children of survivors who have problems -- not problems, but if they wouldn't have had a problem on this issue, they might have had another problem, a normal family problem, that might be.</span> <span id="s1198">Of course, my wife is victim, and my daughter and her thesis at NYU wrote, as a child of a survivor, in which she disagrees with the premise of so many of them who had written about the problem of dealing with parents who had been in camps.</span> <span id="s1199">We also had Merita's [Merica’s?]</span> <span id="s1200">mother living with us, and they were freer to talk about what experiences they had, which was quite unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Interviewer: Tell me how you met your wife.</span> <span id="s1202">You're mentioning your – Theodore: Well, we have only the Joint to thank.</span> <span id="s1203">In 1948 and 1949, the JDC in its infinite wisdom found in Hungary a group of Jewish medical students, about a hundred and some odd, all of whom had a year to finish, to get their degree.</span> <span id="s1204">The policy of the JDC had always been immigrate, get out of here, don't go to school, don't hang around Germany, Austria, Italy.</span> <span id="s1205">It's no good.</span> <span id="s1206">But for some reason, this was such an unusual group, they decided to give them assistance while they finished their year for their medical degree.</span> <span id="s1207">In the case of my wife and a friend of hers, they learned that the Munich University Medical School would give them more credit for their -- for what they had had in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1208">And so my boss, Mr. Haber, was persuaded to take these two girls to Munich [München] where they would finish their medical school in Munich Medical College.</span> <span id="s1209">And I -- there was only two, so I was made the social worker.</span> <span id="s1210">And I remember exactly what we gave my wife.</span> <span id="s1211">We gave her a carton of cigarettes, ten boxes of skinless sardines, a kilo of cheddar cheese from Missouri, and a hundred francs.</span> <span id="s1212">That was it.</span> <span id="s1213">And so something unfortunate happened; that her mother who had tried to come through the minefield had been arrested and was in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Interviewer: Through what minefield?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Theodore: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Interviewer: When you say through the minefield… Theodore: Oh, I'm sorry, between Hungary and Austria.</span> <span id="s1217">This was my wife came through that minefield.</span> <span id="s1218">And she was in jail, and she had no news.</span> <span id="s1219">She didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1220">She came to me.</span> <span id="s1221">And I, through a number of people in the Joint and the Israeli Embassy, was able to get to her mother, and to help her in food, reading materials, and so on.</span> <span id="s1222">So we became friendly.</span> <span id="s1223">And before her mother came out, we were married in Munich [München], Army chaplain.</span> <span id="s1224">She always says that the best thing the Joint did was give her a husband.</span> <span id="s1225">And I, vice-versa.</span> <span id="s1226">We have three children, a son in England with two boys, two daughters here in New York.</span> <span id="s1227">Both have two children, and that's -- oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1228">I made sure she finished medical school and got her degree.</span> <span id="s1229">And she is doing research at New York hospital in White Plains in geriatrics.</span> <span id="s1230">She also worked in Switzerland in a geriatric hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Interviewer: The -- share the aftermath for the DP.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Theodore: Okay.</span> <span id="s1233">During this entire period, starting at the end of 1947, 1948, there was the legal movement to Israel.</span> <span id="s1234">The United States came through with a new immigration act specifically to help displaced persons from Germany, Austria, and Italy.</span> <span id="s1235">If you were a DP, you could get a visa very easily.</span> <span id="s1236">So -- and also people were moving to other countries like Canada, Australia, and in this period, we were also involved in immigration, the movement was taking place.</span> <span id="s1237">Camps were closing out.</span> <span id="s1238">We come into the early 1950s, where I think there may have been three or four camps.</span> <span id="s1239">And then you come into the 1955s, and during that period, 1952-1955, the Germans, the Germans wanted to be as helpful as possible.</span> <span id="s1240">I must also mention it was the period where there were negotiations between the Jewish organizations and the government of Germany on restitution.</span> <span id="s1241">So there was a lot of involvement of Jewish causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Interviewer: Were you involved with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Theodore: We are part of it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Interviewer: Did Ben-Gurion call you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Theodore: No.</span> <span id="s1246">Moe Levitt, our director in New York, was the secretary of it.</span> <span id="s1247">Wherever the group came and I was, I was involved.</span> <span id="s1248">Like we were on our wedding -- first, in 1952, and they got to Sweden when I was called to come back because restitution was starting up in Austria.</span> <span id="s1249">And so the government was interested, really interested, because they had been there so long, by making facilities they could get them out.</span> <span id="s1250">And the government was very cooperative.</span> <span id="s1251">And they had -- there was a lot of building all over Germany.</span> <span id="s1252">So the few, by that time there was 500 or 600.</span> <span id="s1253">So we began to move up.</span> <span id="s1254">They were given apartments.</span> <span id="s1255">They were given pensions.</span> <span id="s1256">And by the end of 1950, they were all out.</span> <span id="s1257">So that's how it ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Interviewer: What -- how important was the DP experience in Europe and your efforts to help them in terms of establishing foundation in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Theodore: Well, curious that the JDC's first program in its history was in 1914, when, let's see, there was Ambassador Morgenthau, father of Roosevelt's Morganthau, who had cabled that because of a conflict that was taking place, or skirmish, or war, that Turks were making it very difficult for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1260">And the first $50,000 that we raised went to Jerusalem, and we've been there ever since.</span> <span id="s1261">A program that was set up eventually, Malben, was set up -- I came to that program in 1963.</span> <span id="s1262">I helped close it down.</span> <span id="s1263">But the JDC was responsible for setting up and staffing and financing the programs for all of the elderly, indigent, and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Interviewer: So the camp experience in helping people rebuild their lives and the development of community again, how did that play into your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Theodore: Well, I think that the experience in the camps of these people was a good fundamental grounding in what eventually they found in Israel, because the importance of the political parties, the importance of free elections, the importance of a central being, state of Israel, never been the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1266">That -- the experience, whatever it was, it had its effect on the people.</span> <span id="s1267">And the fact that many of them, the minute they came there, went right into the Army.</span> <span id="s1268">It was coming from living in limbo, which it was, living in an area that they wanted no part of, where they couldn't put their roots down, and coming to Israel was a blooming for their lifetime.</span> <span id="s1269">As far as my experience is concerned, I certainly learned a great deal about mess and housing and kosher food.</span> <span id="s1270">And the first thing that hit me when I was sent to Vienna, was right after the Hungarian Revolution, about 25,000 Jews came across the border and came directly to our office, waited in line.</span> <span id="s1271">There were a few women who had dead children they were carrying, and within a very short time that problem was well handled by us with the know-how that we had had.</span> <span id="s1272">And, of course, there was also another thing there that changed history.</span> <span id="s1273">I haven't mentioned that immigration was not an easy thing.</span> <span id="s1274">Medical, you couldn't have TB or other debilitating diseases.</span> <span id="s1275">You had to take a security examination by CIC.</span> <span id="s1276">Did you ever watch a Communist Parade?</span> <span id="s1277">Why?</span> <span id="s1278">And it was not easy.</span> <span id="s1279">It was easy to go to Israel, but to go to the United States was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1280">And something happened in that they didn't change at all.</span> <span id="s1281">In 1957, a guy by the name of Nixon was sent by Eisenhower to look at it.</span> <span id="s1282">And he saw atomic scientists, and he saw highly professional people who any government would take quickly.</span> <span id="s1283">Look at what you save in having well-trained professional people.</span> <span id="s1284">And so Nixon suggested and found a loophole in the immigration law where people, without going through the security -- although they had a slight medical -- could be given a temporary entry visa immediately.</span> <span id="s1285">And then the security check will come later.</span> <span id="s1286">People would go to the American Embassy and in a week were in the United States.</span> <span id="s1287">Waiting for visa under the old rules took months or years.</span> <span id="s1288">This was an exclusion.</span> <span id="s1289">Other countries in Europe were also quick on the draw, would bring in buses down to the border and take everybody that came from Switzerland or Holland.</span> <span id="s1290">And Nixon broke the immigration standards and allowed immigrants to come in easier.</span> <span id="s1291">That was at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Interviewer: That was very late, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Theodore: No, no.</span> <span id="s1294">That wasn't in 1957.</span> <span id="s1295">So he has one plus somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Interviewer: I understand that you -- when you were with the JDC and you had had contact with Oskar Schindler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Theodore: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1298">Well, you must understand at that point in the late 1940s there were many Germans who said they helped Jews.</span> <span id="s1299">There may have been.</span> <span id="s1300">And there were a few.</span> <span id="s1301">But there were a few students in the White Rose uprising in Munich [München] who were standing up and helping.</span> <span id="s1302">And so we just didn't live with them.</span> <span id="s1303">We just had as little contact as possible.</span> <span id="s1304">And one day at our office in Munich [München] in Sebra Strasse 3 [?]</span> <span id="s1305">, the receptionist came in to our director, Mr. Haber, and said there is a German who wants to see you.</span> <span id="s1306">Tell him to see Feder.</span> <span id="s1307">This German walks in the door, tall, rather good looking, and was wearing the usual Bavarian lederhosen.</span> <span id="s1308">He had pants, hat, feather, a vest with little flowers on it.</span> <span id="s1309">And when I get up, put out my hand, Feder and Joint, Schindler.</span> <span id="s1310">And I said, "What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s1311">As I uttered the word "you" the door to my office opens, one of my colleagues comes in, a displaced person, takes one look at Mr. Schindler, screams, drops to his knees, kisses his pants, and begins to cry.</span> <span id="s1312">And he was incoherent.</span> <span id="s1313">Now, I want to tell you, I had never seen anything like that before, never saw it since, and I knew something was up.</span> <span id="s1314">After he began -- stopped gasping, I said, "What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s1315">He said, "This is Mr. Schindler.</span> <span id="s1316">He saved my life and 140 other people."</span> <span id="s1317">He smiled.</span> <span id="s1318">He says, "Well, what he said is true.</span> <span id="s1319">And I come to you because I need some help."</span> <span id="s1320">I was still speechless.</span> <span id="s1321">I went in to Mr. Haber, and I said, "Sam, here's one German you're going to see."</span> <span id="s1322">And I quickly told him what happened.</span> <span id="s1323">He said, "For God's sake, bring him in."</span> <span id="s1324">And he sat down.</span> <span id="s1325">And it appears we had received information about him, that our committee in New York was discussing what they wanted to do for him.</span> <span id="s1326">So we knew we were speaking with a man that was going to be helped.</span> <span id="s1327">What could we do for him?</span> <span id="s1328">And, well, he needed help right away, because it wasn't that he was starving, but he was in pretty bad shape.</span> <span id="s1329">Well, we sent him -- he came from upper Bavaria, Regensburg, I think -- no.</span> <span id="s1330">We sent him home with a good care package, and told him to be in touch with us because something was going to be coming in on him.</span> <span id="s1331">And it did.</span> <span id="s1332">And it was very simple.</span> <span id="s1333">It says the JDC has made a grant of $15,000 to Mr. Schindler.</span> <span id="s1334">Now, $15,000 in those days and today, would be tenfold.</span> <span id="s1335">And he wants $5,000 in Germany, and he wants his $10,000 when he goes to Argentina where he and his wife, who was an agronomist, are going to set up -- not a mink farm, but a nutria farm, going into business.</span> <span id="s1336">And he said, "I'd like to get the $5,000 to pay off my debts and maybe buy tools.</span> <span id="s1337">And I'd like to come in periodically."</span> <span id="s1338">Because I was ready to give it to him at that time, he said, "No, don't give it to me."</span> <span id="s1339">Well, I didn't want to argue with him.</span> <span id="s1340">Had I given it to him, he would have been so much ahead because the value of the Deutsch Mark then was pretty low, at about twenty, and when there are twenty Deutsch Marks to a dollar, and when he finished up about six months later, it was down to ten.</span> <span id="s1341">Okay.</span> <span id="s1342">So, he kept in touch and came in, discussed nothing ever personal about his wife, his son, his plans.</span> <span id="s1343">He was always planning.</span> <span id="s1344">And finally he got all the money.</span> <span id="s1345">And after about four months, decided to go.</span> <span id="s1346">Then he said he's taking his wife and he has a family he'd like to take with him.</span> <span id="s1347">It was a couple and two women.</span> <span id="s1348">Okay.</span> <span id="s1349">I went to the general, and there weren't that many ships going to South America.</span> <span id="s1350">And he finally got down there, got his money, started a factory.</span> <span id="s1351">Nothing went right, nothing.</span> <span id="s1352">Anything he touched.</span> <span id="s1353">Two years later Mr. Levitt was there.</span> <span id="s1354">He came and asked if he could get another $5,000, and if he did he could get this and that.</span> <span id="s1355">Mr. Levitt said yes.</span> <span id="s1356">One of the oddest cases we've ever had.</span> <span id="s1357">Anyways, by that time the restitution was taking place in Germany.</span> <span id="s1358">He made a choice.</span> <span id="s1359">He said, "Look, I was also hurt by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1360">They took my factory eventually away.</span> <span id="s1361">I had invested a great deal in it."</span> <span id="s1362">And so we didn't -- hadn't an answer for him.</span> <span id="s1363">We gave it to the restitution people.</span> <span id="s1364">And they were fascinated by it.</span> <span id="s1365">You know, one case of a righteous German, and they -- I later said you guys -- this went on a caprice -- you wanted to see all of his documents, which he drew the buildings and one thing and another.</span> <span id="s1366">And the result of all this was, all kinds of important Germans, but more important all kinds of Germans, that didn't like him.</span> <span id="s1367">He got next to nothing.</span> <span id="s1368">And he asked if he could come back to Germany to fight his case.</span> <span id="s1369">And we said we'd pay for his ticket.</span> <span id="s1370">When he got there, he said, "I have a possibility of really getting into something in building.</span> <span id="s1371">I can get a concrete manufacturing machine," or some bloody thing.</span> <span id="s1372">And at that point we gave him some more money, that, too -- And his lawyer helped him.</span> <span id="s1373">That, too, went down.</span> <span id="s1374">The only joy he had, and he went on a number of times, was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1375">There, those whom he had helped treated him royally with hotel, food, liquor.</span> <span id="s1376">He was with them.</span> <span id="s1377">And they adored him, after all.</span> <span id="s1378">But there wasn't anything for him to do.</span> <span id="s1379">He came back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1380">And then he got into real heavy bouts of drinking.</span> <span id="s1381">And that's the end of the story.</span> <span id="s1382">When he was buried, he asked to be sent back -- not back, sent to Israel for burial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Interviewer: In your dealings with him, what kind of man was he?</span> <span id="s1384">What kind of personality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Theodore: He liked to talk.</span> <span id="s1386">He liked to talk.</span> <span id="s1387">And he had so many ideas in the business field.</span> <span id="s1388">It was fascinating to listen to him.</span> <span id="s1389">In some ways, I didn't want to say it, I had a feeling he was a first-rate conman.</span> <span id="s1390">And perhaps that's what was necessary to save those Jews.</span> <span id="s1391">Or maybe the Lord put him on the earth for one reason, to save 160 Jews, and then the Lord left him alone.</span> <span id="s1392">That, incidentally, isn't my idea, but it was told to me by the fellow who played -- not told to me.</span> <span id="s1393">There was an interview with him, who played in Schindler in the picture, the -- what's his name -- Scandinavian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Interviewer: Liam Neeson.</span> <span id="s1395">[?]</span> <span id="s1396">Theodore: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1397">And anyways, that was his story.</span> <span id="s1398">And I felt comfortable talking to him, but I just couldn't see him, because when you think of what he did in pulling the German Nazis by their nose and keeping those people, no one -- no one could ever understand what was the chemistry that drove him, or was able to keep him alive with all these murders that he was dealing with.</span> <span id="s1399">It beggars description.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Interviewer: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1401">Your experience with the DP camps in Europe, did this have an impact on you after that period that remained with you?</span> <span id="s1402">Did it change you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Theodore: The experience with JDC changed me.</span> <span id="s1404">When the DP period was over, and I was sent to Vienna, at that point it wasn't certain that the JDC as such was going to either continue or expand, and the possibility of disbanding.</span> <span id="s1405">And so I tried making contact with other organizations, working in the social service relief field.</span> <span id="s1406">And then, of course, fate had it that there were plenty of emergencies that JDC had.</span> <span id="s1407">And I was able to build a family, and wherever we went, the family was with me.</span> <span id="s1408">Working in Tehran, my background was very important, because we were dealing with a poor group of Jews living in the ghettos, without running water, without toilets.</span> <span id="s1409">And we had to set up a program for them.</span> <span id="s1410">My experience in Germany was positive, very important.</span> <span id="s1411">I could look at the 34 kitchens in the schools and determine whether they were functioning or not functioning.</span> <span id="s1412">We brought in staff to establish a substantial medical program; experience there.</span> <span id="s1413">Dealing with the people, which was the most interesting, because they were the most stubborn people in the world, still are, taking after their brethern, doing my best to organize the committee in Tehran, all of my finesse in Germany was called into play.</span> <span id="s1414">I didn't win all of them.</span> <span id="s1415">But it was very satisfying to be able to do as much as the JDC did in a community where eight years before there be a line on Friday in front of the hospital of a dozen or more mothers with born dead [stillborn] children who had to be buried.</span> <span id="s1416">That ended.</span> <span id="s1417">We cleaned up cemeteries where Jews who were Jews used to live.</span> <span id="s1418">So the experience was very positive and then eventually I was transferred to Israel where all our programs were going, and it was exhilarating.</span> <span id="s1419">And then finally back to Geneva, where the headquarters.</span> <span id="s1420">I was a deputy to Charlie Jordan for all of Europe and North Africa and Israel.</span> <span id="s1421">And 25 or so years ago, he was murdered in Prague.</span> <span id="s1422">And by whom, we don't know.</span> <span id="s1423">They were trying to get documentation.</span> <span id="s1424">They knew what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1425">They claimed that he had drowned himself.</span> <span id="s1426">He was there with his wife and nephew.</span> <span id="s1427">Charlie Jordan, drown himself?</span> <span id="s1428">It was more of being drowned in a bathtub, which is one of the favorites of certain groups, and then thrown into the river.</span> <span id="s1429">And when we asked to be present at the autopsy, they said sure.</span> <span id="s1430">The autopsy was done at 7:00, and the chief doctor of the Zurich community and our doctor arrived at 11:00.</span> <span id="s1431">They did not see the autopsy.</span> <span id="s1432">We did ask for some of the internal pieces and brought them back, but never could -- he was obviously murdered.</span> <span id="s1433">There was a book written by an escaped security officer, Czechoslovak, in London, who said that the Czech police had watched through night of glasses, how he was carried out of a home and thrown into a river.</span> <span id="s1434">But it has a peculiar ending.</span> <span id="s1435">This doctor whom we brought in, the chief pathologist, this was August, was found frozen to death in a park in Zurich.</span> <span id="s1436">Now, that's enough to push memories.</span> <span id="s1437">Never found out.</span> <span id="s1438">They insisted it was suicide.</span> <span id="s1439">He was drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Interviewer: What do you think the greatest success of the Joint was, in your stay at the camp, not in all your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Theodore: I'd hate to pull one out.</span> <span id="s1442">But I would say that our work in Israel, as probably the jewel in the crown, because we in our way have done so much.</span> <span id="s1443">We built the school of social working.</span> <span id="s1444">We established all of the buildings, and we had built half-a-dozen buildings in this program of Malben, were all turned over in working order and was part of the wholed medical programs of the state of Israel, all of these hospitals.</span> <span id="s1445">Yeah, I think – Interviewer: I'm trying -- what do you think your greatest achievement was in the DP camps in Europe prior to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Theodore: That we were there.</span> <span id="s1447">Even if we hadn't done as much as we did, the fact that we were there, that we represented something that they hadn't had for years, that we showed them that Jews in the world hadn't forgotten them, wanted to help them, and that their lives in the future would be more or less what it was before the war.</span> <span id="s1448">And, you know, how often in that period, walking into a camp, not that, you know, people were running up and kissing their hands, on the contrary.</span> <span id="s1449">I use humor with our people.</span> <span id="s1450">And I represented something so solid.</span> <span id="s1451">And I was a big guy, too.</span> <span id="s1452">And that we listened to them.</span> <span id="s1453">We didn't tell them.</span> <span id="s1454">We listened to them, and were part of them.</span> <span id="s1455">And I suppose that giving courage to so many people might have been the greatest thing the JDC did.</span> <span id="s1456">There's, in that respect, there was the leader of the Jewish camp in the British zone of Germany, it was Bergen-Belsen, and the leader was a fellow by the name of Rosenzaft, was his name.</span> <span id="s1457">And they spoke a little English.</span> <span id="s1458">How he learned English, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1459">And so they brought him in 1945 -- after all, here is a man that came through and he was present -- DPs and everybody's interested in him.</span> <span id="s1460">And they brought him.</span> <span id="s1461">And Stephen Wise had him speak to a large group.</span> <span id="s1462">So in the midst of the group he said some unkind words about the Joint.</span> <span id="s1463">When he was over, Rabbi Weis jumped up -- I think it was Wese -- and says, "This is terrible.</span> <span id="s1464">We're going to have to get the Joint out of there.</span> <span id="s1465">We're going to have to get another organization."</span> <span id="s1466">Rosenzaft is listening, jumps up, "Why do you want to do that?"</span> <span id="s1467">So he said, "But you just told us about how inept (they are) with the the problems."</span> <span id="s1468">And he says, "Rabbi, you didn't understand me.</span> <span id="s1469">I was talking as if they were part of the family, and you have a right to be critical of your family.</span> <span id="s1470">But if you do one thing against the Joint, you're going to have trouble with me."</span> <span id="s1471">Now, what did that mean?</span> <span id="s1472">That's it.</span> <span id="s1473">He knew that we were there.</span> <span id="s1474">He liked arguing with us.</span> <span id="s1475">I remember once meeting in an airport, and he always smoked cigars.</span> <span id="s1476">And he had this cigar, and he says, "I sent one cigar to your boss, Mr. Haber.</span> <span id="s1477">If he would have been a good guy, I would have sent him a whole box."</span> <span id="s1478">So, there it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Interviewer: We have a few minutes left on this tape, and then I'll put in a new tape for the pictures.</span> <span id="s1480">Is there anything else you want to say here that sort of concludes this part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Theodore: Well, I think that the epic period of the displaced persons in Europe has never been adequately reported, and put on paper.</span> <span id="s1482">It was a glorious page in history.</span> <span id="s1483">If there had been no Israel, which focused the eyes of the Jewish world, what took place in Germany would have been known by everybody.</span> <span id="s1484">And it was; it was a real valiant page of history of Jewish life.</span> <span id="s1485">No one expected that it would end as well as it did.</span> <span id="s1486">Maybe that's another thing.</span> <span id="s1487">We worried with them.</span> <span id="s1488">We cried with them.</span> <span id="s1489">We wanted desperately to get them out, and they felt that.</span> <span id="s1490">They had never had anything like that before.</span> <span id="s1491">And sometimes we were stuffy, but at all times we were there to help.</span> <span id="s1492">And they realized that.</span> <span id="s1493">And unlike most people who are getting help, they're ashamed, and they weren't.</span> <span id="s1494">They said, yes, we have a right to it.</span> <span id="s1495">We were set upon and we're very grateful.</span> <span id="s1496">So -- and I met many people since who had been in the camp, and many who hadn't, whose life was touched by the Joint.</span> <span id="s1497">And it's amazing how they remember, how Elie Wiesel remembers the blanket that the Joint -- I mean, that is true.</span> <span id="s1498">Another woman, the other evening I spoke to a group of women who had been helped by the JDC.</span> <span id="s1499">And four of them got up and said, "If it hadn't been for the Joint, I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s1500">I wouldn't have gotten my medical degree."</span> <span id="s1501">So I said, you know, "It's been a long time ago."</span> <span id="s1502">She says, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1503">I didn't really know where to go to say thank you."</span> <span id="s1504">Interviewer: That must be very rewarding to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Theodore: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Interviewer: It must be very rewarding for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Theodore: Yes.</span> <span id="s1508">Or we have a tremendous program today in Russia, and some of our people get overwhelmed by being told by elderly people that their first meal after World War I was through from the JDC.</span> <span id="s1509">Or someone had been a farmer in the Ukraine who fled.</span> <span id="s1510">The farm had been paid for by Agro-Joint.</span> <span id="s1511">Everybody remembers us.</span> <span id="s1512">Fine.</span> <span id="s1513">Although we must have made plenty of mistakes.</span> <span id="s1514">[End of Tape Three]</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Tape Four Theodore: This is a picture that appeared in the Milwaukee Jewish Chronicle in 1916.</span> <span id="s1516">It is a group of young Pole Zionists and there are two women in it that are my folk.</span> <span id="s1517">The woman on the left end is my sister, Sara Feder, who later was part and parcel of establishing the Zionist Labor Women's Organization, The Pioneer Women.</span> <span id="s1518">There were just two women and seven or eight men.</span> <span id="s1519">And the last person on the picture is a lady by the name of Golda Mabovitch.</span> <span id="s1520">Actually, that's Golda Meir.</span> <span id="s1521">And she was the mentor of my sister and friend of the family, and occasionally took me to kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Interviewer: You can tape it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Theodore: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Interviewer: You can put a -- attach -- I mean, just year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Theodore: Okay.</span> <span id="s1526">This is the "War Room" in quotation marks of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Germany.</span> <span id="s1527">And it's an enlarged map of Germany, showing the hundreds and hundreds of camps where DP’s and refugees were living.</span> <span id="s1528">At that time, there must have been about seven million refugees and DP’s, who were eventually repatriated or immigrated out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1529">The tall fellow is a fellow by the name of Feder, and Mr. Eisner to the right.</span> <span id="s1530">And the lady is British, and her name is Miss Rogel [Rugul?]</span> <span id="s1531">.</span> <span id="s1532">And every morning this map was visited by various members of staff to bring it up to date and the fact that there was such movement taking place.</span> <span id="s1533">This is a picture of Golda Meir and Sara Feder taken at Columbia, Missouri.</span> <span id="s1534">Golda was on vacation from Palestine and came to visit her dear friend, Sara Feder, who was a doctor of psychology at the University of Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Interviewer: The year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Theodore: This is 1933.</span> <span id="s1537">This picture is unique in the sense that it contains at least six or seven British generals who were the head of the United Nations operations in Germany and Austria and Italy.</span> <span id="s1538">The British that took over leadership role for many reasons, maybe to give them jobs or because they were fearful of the possible trend of Jews going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1539">The person at the head of the table is General Frederick P. Morgan, who was one of the `planners of the invasion and was at the final ceremony for surrender.</span> <span id="s1540">He turned out to be somewhat of a problem, because in a news interview that he gave a few months later, he claimed that the Jews were fleeing Poland, coming with gold and platinum and money and rich.</span> <span id="s1541">He was thrown out after a couple of weeks by our own Fiorella LaGuardia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Interviewer: Why are there so many generals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Theodore: Yeah, they were generals.</span> <span id="s1544">This is a very unique picture, taken in Munich [München] in 1947.</span> <span id="s1545">And it contains the leadership of the JDC in Europe and in Germany.</span> <span id="s1546">From left to right is Herb Katzki, who is still with the JDC.</span> <span id="s1547">Next to Herb is Doctor Joseph Schwartz, from Baltimore, Rabbi Schwartz, a great person.</span> <span id="s1548">Edda Doych was in charge of our social service program.</span> <span id="s1549">And Leo Schwartz, on the end, was our director.</span> <span id="s1550">He had been there for a year.</span> <span id="s1551">When he left, he wrote three books.</span> <span id="s1552">And I'm next to Mr. Schwartz, Leo.</span> <span id="s1553">[Transition to next picture] Theodore: There I am, and my favorite truck, a Bedford.</span> <span id="s1554">He has a left-hand drive -- no right-hand drive.</span> <span id="s1555">And this was taken in Normandy.</span> <span id="s1556">And I'm sorry I couldn't show you who's in the open truck, because it would be of interest to the fact that one of the women was from Norway and later became minister of social welfare.</span> <span id="s1557">Any of us who could drive, were told to drive, because they had to get all these trucks out of Normandy into Germany.</span> <span id="s1558">It was a great ride.</span> <span id="s1559">I was thinner then, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Interviewer: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Theodore: 1945.</span> <span id="s1562">[Transition to next picture] Theodore: This picture was taken in 1946.</span> <span id="s1563">The person on the right -- it was in a displaced person's camp.</span> <span id="s1564">I'm not sure if it was Feldafing or Wolfitzhausen [Wolfratshausen?]</span> <span id="s1565">.</span> <span id="s1566">The man on the right with the glasses, I think was Frank London or Louder, who was a columnist with the New York Post.</span> <span id="s1567">He was visiting the camp.</span> <span id="s1568">And we walked -- there were more kids in this one, but he was taking because he had the longest payot (Ph.) of any of the other children.</span> <span id="s1569">And his teacher, the man on the left with the payot, was asking him to recite from the Talmud, and he was doing it.</span> <span id="s1570">Now, the question is: How fast did the payot grow?</span> <span id="s1571">Because here it was 1946, weren't even born.</span> <span id="s1572">I must admit at that time, I didn't ask him.</span> <span id="s1573">But we assumed that he was in hiding in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1574">And that camp also had over 250 children going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Interviewer: It's amazing that he was able to be in hiding and yet maintain – Theodore: Sure.</span> <span id="s1576">This is a visit by General Frederick P. Morgan.</span> <span id="s1577">He's in the center there with a white belt.</span> <span id="s1578">And he's in one of the feeding assemblies.</span> <span id="s1579">And you can see how everybody is feeling very happy, primarily because the man he is talking to spoke English.</span> <span id="s1580">He had come down because of "we," the JDC, had protested about the bad housing in this camp.</span> <span id="s1581">And he was the gentleman who later was ousted from his post as director general because of his comments about Jews coming out of Eastern Europe with gold and diamonds, platinum and money.</span> <span id="s1582">This is a memo to the leadership of the JDC, Mr. Beckelman in Paris, and Mr. Haber in Munich [München], signed by Oskar Schindler, that he had received from the JDC $5,000 for needs in Germany.</span> <span id="s1583">But in addition, there was a sum of $10,000 that the JDC would give him when he went to South America to establish a project there.</span> <span id="s1584">[Transition to next picture] Theodore: This was the receipt that Mr. Schindler signed each time he picked up money.</span> <span id="s1585">You notice, the name on the top is the name of the director of the Joint, Mr. Beckalman.</span> <span id="s1586">And then all of the signatures on the right are his.</span> <span id="s1587">We tried to give him the money all at one time, but he said, "No, I want to take it out in seven installments."</span> <span id="s1588">And these are his receipts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Interviewer: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
