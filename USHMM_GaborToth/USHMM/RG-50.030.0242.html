Would you tell me your name please and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: Frida Wallenstein, and I was born in Czecho...in what was at the time Czechoslovakia, in a small town called Selo-Solotvina (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Question: Tell me a little bit about your life as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: My family moved from Czechoslovakia to Belgium when I was about two and a half years old.</span> <span id="s15">I had a sister who was also born in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s16">My parents were working people and my little sister was born in the Liege (ph), Belgium, where we lived until I came to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Question: And can you describe your life as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: We had wonderful parents who cared for their children, protected us, did everything to educate us, and until the war ca...until the war came, we we had a very close-knit family.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Question: Was this a very Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Answer: Yes.</span> <span id="s21">My...my uh (cough) both my parents came from orthodox, very orthodox background.</span> <span id="s22">My father didn't want...did not want to keep it but my mother was...kept...liked to keep the orthodox but we lived in a city...Liege did not have a large Jewish uh community.</span> <span id="s23">We had a synagogue.</span> <span id="s24">We had a haider (ph).</span> <span id="s25">I went to haider and I learned to uh to to read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s26">I uh also had private tutors to teach me to read and write Yiddish.</span> <span id="s27">I used to read and write fluently in Yiddish, but the the...there was one kosher butcher and because of the life style in Belgium, the kosher laws as I grew up were not kept and especially, of course, during the war and during the years hiding.</span> <span id="s28">So I had forgotten about the kosher uh laws until I came to the States to live with my aunt, but my parents both came from an orthodox family.</span> <span id="s29">We went to services during the high holy days and I was not bar mitzvah because the orthodox Jews did not, but we assimilated more...we were Jewish but could not keep the strict kosher laws because Liege did not have enough of a Jewish population to ke...to be able to keep up like with the kosher meats and things like that.</span> <span id="s30">And the Belgium cook with butter the same as the French but my mother could never do it.</span> <span id="s31">She did stay with no cooking with butter...meat with butter...she could never mix it.</span> <span id="s32">We did, but we didn't, and for instance we have a lot of shrimp, a lot of seafood and that was never brought into our home, never, never.</span> <span id="s33">We did keep kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Question: In the terms of the social environment at the time, what was life like for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Answer: Did not feel Jewish.</span> <span id="s36">Did not feel any different.</span> <span id="s37">I remember going to school during Passover with matzos because we did not eat bread, but I did not feel different from any of the other uh children who...because Belgium is Catholic, what Catholic there were.</span> <span id="s38">There was only one girl I remember going to school with as a Jewish girl and my sisters who followed after me, but there was nothing ever brought up or mentioned or named as Jewish we were known.</span> <span id="s39">There were a lot of Polish people in Belgium, and they could never associate us as being Czech...uh Czechoslovakian.</span> <span id="s40">They referred to my mother as the Polish tailor, and my mother didn't...never at no time was anything or any reference made to the fact that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s41">Never.</span> <span id="s42">was never made made to feel different.</span> <span id="s43">I'm...or I did not feel different or separate because I was Jewish...no.</span> <span id="s44">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Question: Did you have non-Jewish friends and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Answer: All my friends, all my school friends except this one girl, and I was not friendly...uh she did not become a close friend of mine until I went into high school.</span> <span id="s47">In grade school all my school friends were Catholic.</span> <span id="s48">There was no two ways about it, because there were not enough Jewish families to have somebody of your age be in the same class.</span> <span id="s49">And we kept...uh when St. Nicholas Day came, we went along with the children.</span> <span id="s50">When the Easter egg hunt came along, we went along.</span> <span id="s51">We went Easter egg hunting.</span> <span id="s52">All my friends were Catholic.</span> <span id="s53">I lived across the street from the church and every time you went by, you went like this, and I went the same because all my friends were.</span> <span id="s54">My mother never stopped me.</span> <span id="s55">I knew I was Jewish but you follow along with the children, but I knew I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Question: Can you remember what happened when the war came?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Answer: Yes I do.</span> <span id="s58">Germans came in and for two years we stayed at home.</span> <span id="s59">We continued living under war conditions...rations.</span> <span id="s60">Uh we went to school and uh we lived uh under occu...you know, occupation, the same as everyone else and in two years, exactly two years later, then we were uh as Jews...then we started, the Germans started with the Jews in in at least Liege.</span> <span id="s61">I don't know what other part of Belgium did.</span> <span id="s62">The first thing was, no rad...the Jews were not allowed to have radios.</span> <span id="s63">We were not allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s64">We had to register as Jews and that meant that we took identification cards to uh the Foreign Ministry and they stamped a big red stamp on it, on the inside that said Juda (ph), and we had to wear the uh ____ David on the chest.</span> <span id="s65">As a matter of fact uh I remember distinctly the students from the colleges some things and I don't know if mocking is the right term, used to wear them, the Star of David, and they made bonfires in mockery of the Jewish star, and uh I don't know...it was a matter of days or a week, they...there were some young people who had to go to a certain area and report as Jews and they had to go with clothing, with their with their ration stamps and clothing and food and they were young teenagers, two of my very close friends uh that I was going to high school with.</span> <span id="s66">The one I had gone to grade school also had to go.</span> <span id="s67">I was fifteen.</span> <span id="s68">They were about fourteen.</span> <span id="s69">They were just a little bit younger than I am, and the families let them go because no one knew, no one had any idea what the reason was, why, what for.</span> <span id="s70">We knew in Belgium about the uh Jews escaping from Germany.</span> <span id="s71">A lot of them ended up in Bel...in uh Belgium, but no one knew what what was happening, so they went, and I don't know if it was a week later, ten days later or a few days later, they called men of certain ages and my father was called to go to, supposedly to Dunkirk (ph) to build up fortifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Question: ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Answer: And my father was called and I can see him...it was a Saturday and we lived upstairs of a cafe in an apartment.</span> <span id="s74">My father came up the stairway.</span> <span id="s75">We had just finished cleaning.</span> <span id="s76">The door was open.</span> <span id="s77">He had his hair shaven, and my mother said where are you going?</span> <span id="s78">He says I'm going to report because if I do they promise not to touch the families.</span> <span id="s79">And my mother said, I don't trust them.</span> <span id="s80">And it was a matter of...I think all the Jews, and I'm talking Liege...now realized something was wrong, that we were being deported and everybody went panicking.</span> <span id="s81">Everybody went into going to hiding and...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Question: Let's go back just a moment.</span> <span id="s83">When...this is now two years after the start of the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Answer: After the start of the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Question: Go back to the very start?</span> <span id="s86">How did you feel when things began to change?</span> <span id="s87">What happened in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Answer: I I I don't...</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Question: Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Answer: You mean when we went into...when they started with...?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Question: No.</span> <span id="s92">When the war just began...what was it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Answer: What was it like?</span> <span id="s94">We had...my parents were were wonderful.</span> <span id="s95">I mean everybody did the black market like to have food and things, and my parents did everything.</span> <span id="s96">We did not feel...oh, I remember my mother was afraid for me because she remembered the Kosacks (ph), you know, raping, and I was going on...let's see...I was going on fourteen and she was afraid for me, but the the Germans...someone asked me just not long ago if the Germans did anything like to rape a woman.</span> <span id="s97">Germans, and I'm talking Liege...probably the whole Belgium, I'm not sure...were not allowed to approach a civilian on the streets.</span> <span id="s98">They had houses, prostitution homes, reserved for soldiers.</span> <span id="s99">They never never touched anyone on the streets, and I think, if I remember, this was done for propaganda purposes to show how good the Germans were, that they were not our enemies, but they never never touched a woman.</span> <span id="s100">Belgium had food.</span> <span id="s101">Anything we had...coffee, we used to roast coffee after four years of war, and we had to close the windows because the coffee smelled when you roasted it.</span> <span id="s102">We had rice...everything found its way on black market.</span> <span id="s103">My father, before we went into hiding, used to get on his bicycle and go and get, you know, the carp is not the same as the American carp.</span> <span id="s104">It's clean.</span> <span id="s105">And he would sell that on the market because that was not rationed.</span> <span id="s106">They would...he would go to the farmers and sometimes like bring eggs because that was highly rationed.</span> <span id="s107">Now the farmers had quotas to turn in depending on the size of their farms, whether it was butter or eggs, so what they used to do is they used to be quote, robbed.</span> <span id="s108">Somebody came during the night or early in the morning and they were robbed, and all of that found its way on the black market, so as far as where we were in Belgium, we had food.</span> <span id="s109">We never went hungry.</span> <span id="s110">Never.</span> <span id="s111">Clothing...it's not the way of life here.</span> <span id="s112">You know, you bought a dress and you wore it until you outgrew it and then it went down to your younger sister and it was passed down.</span> <span id="s113">My my mother had been a man's tailor, so whatever pieces of fabric were left around, we managed to scrounge, and we wore the same things over and over, but we had clothes and for money you could buy and it's hard to explain.</span> <span id="s114">My parents were honest people but anyone who understands war situation knows that if you want to survive in an occupied country, you do black markets.</span> <span id="s115">In other words, there were ration stamps.</span> <span id="s116">I was...never had money floating in my hands as much as...that's before we went into hiding...this is the first two years of war.</span> <span id="s117">The ration stamps were like like postage stamps and they used to make false ones.</span> <span id="s118">They used to duplicate them, like making fake money and it used to find its way on the black market, and that's what my father did and I don't know where he got his...he did not produce them.</span> <span id="s119">I don't who produced them, but we...my father used to buy them, get them and sell them and make money that way, and then wherever you could get either farm produce or I don't remember meat but I remember distinctly fish and eggs, whatever, and especially the stamps so I was old enough that if a customer came and wanted stamps, you see, and you could tell they were fake.</span> <span id="s120">But remember that the civilian...I mean Germans did not occupy everything and besides...they called them Alexis (ph) patrol Germans...they were all...everybody had to because you had a pad of butter a month as a ration.</span> <span id="s121">I learned to drink coffee without sugar for that reason, because my mother saved it to make jellies and things and to this day I don't drink coffee with sugar for for that reason, but anything you wanted except bananas.</span> <span id="s122">Fresh fruit, because Belgium had Belgium Congo and you could find on black market.</span> <span id="s123">So we ate and there was uh, you know, I I remember the first German.</span> <span id="s124">We were petrified of them, you know, but the Germans were not all over.</span> <span id="s125">The country was run by Belgium civilians, so you didn't even see them that much.</span> <span id="s126">It's just that we had a uh a concern (ph) very close by with...a block, a block and a half of where I lived, so you did see more of the soldiers than maybe if you lived in an area where the concern (ph) was not close by, but otherwise it was all run and all occupied by by civilians, by by the Belgiums, so the first two years uh there was noth...I did not...if I think back, besides seeing the first Germans and clinging to my mother, uh you know, you saw them coming with their rifles and as much as we could still comprehend uh once we got going I did not feel...there was no persecution.</span> <span id="s127">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s128">We continued to go to school, so there was nothing to make us feel...I think my parents sort of protected us to to to what really could be.</span> <span id="s129">I don't know, but the brunt of it was on my parents because they had gone through World War I with the, you know, the Kosacks and they remembered but we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Question: ____the start of the war, those first few years, being Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Answer: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s132">It had...there was no difference.</span> <span id="s133">We were, we were the same as the Catholics because it's predominantly Catholic.</span> <span id="s134">I just remember maybe there were Protestants in school, but even Catholic religion was taught in the public schools.</span> <span id="s135">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s136">No idea that it would...that there would be...I did not comprehend at the time, but I know that when the Germans invaded Poland and my mother, who I'm sure was very smart, wanted to come to the to the United States, and we had one aunt, her sister, the only one, in Cleveland, so I ended up in Cleveland, but it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s137">I won't go into it because...but uh and we knew of the, for instance, the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s138">I did not comprehend it.</span> <span id="s139">You have to remember that I was much younger and children were not, didn't have television like here today so we did not comprehend the full meaning of it.</span> <span id="s140">We knew the German Jews were persecuted because German Jews came into Belgium in running away from Germany and we had German Jews there.</span> <span id="s141">I personally as a young girl did not come in contact with other young girls.</span> <span id="s142">Whether adults came or they mainly maybe went to Antwerp or Brussels...Liege is not a cosmopolitan city where uh, you know, uh uh people from other countries came.</span> <span id="s143">You know, uh in the capital city, your port...but I did not have any contacts that I remember with anyone who came out of Germany or...I think there may...probably most of them were German, not even Austrian...I think Ger...I know Germans came in but I did not have any contact with them.</span> <span id="s144">I did not know of any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Question: When and how did things begin to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Answer: When we had to report as Jews.</span> <span id="s147">There was no school, no...we went...no school, no radios.</span> <span id="s148">We had to register as Jews and then they started deporting only the young people and I don't know if they were boys.</span> <span id="s149">For some reason or other I..</span> <span id="s150">.</span> <span id="s151">these two friends of mine (coughing) ...excuse me...(coughing)...had to go and then when they called my father, that's when he went in to turn to this Catholic family who was very staunch.</span> <span id="s152">They had a son who was Trappist monk as a matter of fact, and he was in the country, knew of the house, rented the house for us for six months, and we moved there.</span> <span id="s153">There were three rooms upstairs, two rooms downstairs.</span> <span id="s154">We had outdoor facilities.</span> <span id="s155">My father grew a garden, a big vegetable garden.</span> <span id="s156">He helped the farmers and we used to go down to the farmer to get fresh milk.</span> <span id="s157">I can still taste the milk.</span> <span id="s158">I couldn't drink it today.</span> <span id="s159">It was just drained from the uh the cheesecloth that they used to strain it.</span> <span id="s160">We burned wood and then this uh couple came to hide with us.</span> <span id="s161">I don't know if it was a month or two after we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s162">She had worked for my parents uh as a uh as a tail...in tailoring.</span> <span id="s163">He was a friend of the family who also, who had come from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s164">He had joined us because we were from Czechoslovakia and they got married, and I don't know how they found out, but they knew where we were and they joined us so we had my parents, and I was the oldest of three...my two sisters...and then we had a cousin who was eight years old at the time whose mother had died many years before when he was a young child whose father left him when the Germans started with the Jews.</span> <span id="s165">He had remarried and the stepmother brought him to us, so we had four in our family, and then Rochelle (ph) and her husband and the baby who was not quite a year old.</span> <span id="s166">They shared a room.</span> <span id="s167">My parents had a room and I don't remember where my little cousin slept, but the three of us slept in one room and we had to go to the stream to get water and to heat the water.</span> <span id="s168">We had to use outdoor facilities and we had woods behind the house and farmland in front of us.</span> <span id="s169">During the weed-cutting season we used to go behind the farmers when they cut the weeds and we called it in French _____...you follow the the farmers and you pick the weeds that is left behind.</span> <span id="s170">We put them in big burlap sacks, went down to the flour mills and then we used to...my mother used to prepare the bread and then take them to the farmers and bake them in the outdoor oven.</span> <span id="s171">If you ever tasted...yes...bread baked in wooden ovens and uh we used to get...we had identification.</span> <span id="s172">Our names were changed from...my maiden name was Adler and Frida is a German name...it's a foreign name, and my name was changed to Fernand Albert (ph)...in English it's pronounced Albert, and my middle sister, my little sister kept the same name but my little cousin was Zeigmund which is typically a German name.</span> <span id="s173">His father was from Czechoslovakia, so we changed it to Simone (ph), which is Simon in English, and I remember we told him if you ever want to see your father, your name is Simone Adler and you're not to tell anyone.</span> <span id="s174">Of course, his father made it.</span> <span id="s175">He didn't.</span> <span id="s176">And it took no time at all for the Catholics around the villages to know we were Jewish but no one, no one ever...I mean I remember one time the farmers came because the Germans were looking for I don't know what and we went into the woods and because the farmers warned us.</span> <span id="s177">My sister and I used to go into the city everyday to get our ration stamps on our real names and one time the citizens who were handing out the ration stamps...the Germans were looking for something or other, and they put us in the back of the old school until the Germans disappeared and then I don't know exactly how...before the Germans uh came to arrest the family and I think...I can't...don't know how my parents found out.</span> <span id="s178">It may be the same person who made out the false ID papers for us...found a place for me to go into the city and I became a maid.</span> <span id="s179">It was a woman.</span> <span id="s180">She was from Alsace-Lorraine (ph).</span> <span id="s181">She was a widow to a coal mining engineer and she had a son who was at that time forty years old who was a gynecologist and babies were delivered at home in those days and he received patients in his home two afternoons a week and it was a wealthy home which means they had a live-in maid and someone who came three times a week.</span> <span id="s182">I went in.</span> <span id="s183">They knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s184">I went in and the two...the day woman left, so I did the work of two women.</span> <span id="s185">I scrubbed white marble halls.</span> <span id="s186">I scrubbed Persian rugs.</span> <span id="s187">I scrubbed...I mean the wood...I don't know what the wood is called in English...it was...and the woman used to go, you know, this is coal furnaces, and she used to go like this to make sure there was no dust.</span> <span id="s188">I had...she did the cooking and then when he used to come in, they used to have a cocktail because this is typical French way of living and relaxing.</span> <span id="s189">When he went to deliver a baby, you know, they went hours before and when dinner...when they were ready for dinner they rang a bell, and I served and then I went into the kitchen and I ate my dinner and then if uh...you know the French eat everything on a different dish, and I did the dishes, not in a dishwasher, but we had...they were wealthy enough to have water that was heated not in the same manner as here but the water was...you didn't have to heat it on the stove.</span> <span id="s190">Also he received patients.</span> <span id="s191">I had to sterilize his instruments and I maintained a house, a three-floor house, and you have to appreciate how to clean Persian rugs.</span> <span id="s192">I mean not carpeting, her...we're back into Persian rugs.</span> <span id="s193">Parquet, uh parquet, the real parquet that I had to scrub with my feet and the big pads and I stayed there until my sister, my middle sister...my my sister Bertha was also placed in a doctor's home in the country for that purpose also and she was not feeling well and the doctor told her to go home to rest and that's when on a Sunday morning on May 5...I used to go home every other weekend on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s194">Traveled by bicycle.</span> <span id="s195">I used to go home uh over night.</span> <span id="s196">She...the lady of the house, the lady of the house allowed me to go home, but usually maids used to go home, get weekends off but she took advantage of my situation.</span> <span id="s197">I went home every other weekend, and I got a phone call that was messaged (ph), saying to me not to go home, and I got...I understood that the Germans had been at the house.</span> <span id="s198">Now to re-track...my father was ill and I..</span> <span id="s199">.</span> <span id="s200">all I remember his eye was broken outside and like he had an ear infection, an eye infection.</span> <span id="s201">The country doctor treated him, sent him to the hospital and of course the hospital was in the city in Liege.</span> <span id="s202">He came to the hospital on Friday.</span> <span id="s203">My sister was supposed to come in and bring him shaving cream and soap for bathing...you did not get these things...they were black market, the good ones...and my sister never came in and I got word that...I understood the fam...the Germans came and the family and the other couple were picked up.</span> <span id="s204">Doctor Bastat (ph) told...where I was in hiding...managed to get my father released from the hospital, went to the hospital and my father and I got on a bus to go to the village to see what had happened and I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s205">My father went on one end of the bus, me on the other end and he says if one of us gets picked up, we don't know the other one.</span> <span id="s206">I can see my father.</span> <span id="s207">If I would have been picked up, my father ignoring me.</span> <span id="s208">Then we saw the farmers and they told us that what they did is they went to...you know, this is this is a little village with little passage, little road, not even a road, leading to the house, and they brought the family from the house to the main road and they questioned my my mother and my mother said that these were not their children...her children, and they were there for her...their health, wh...which was common practice, because we came from coal-mining countries and a lot of children from the schools were sent to the country, but they didn't take it and they asked where my father was and my little sister said in the hospital, and I understand the German slapped her for lying.</span> <span id="s209">This came from the farmers who were there when the Gestapo picked up my...the family and you know, all the people at five o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s210">Also, in between while in hiding, my two sisters and my cousin were placed in an orphanage which, of course, was Catholic but it was not working out for whatever reason it was...I don't know...I didn't get involved in these things, so they were in an orphanage for a while and then came home and the reason I went into become a maid and they tried with my little sister is for what exactly what happened is so you wouldn't be together if anything happened, and there was...I remember a man who worked in cutting the woods behind us who wanted to take my little cousin.</span> <span id="s211">My mother was afraid to let him go.</span> <span id="s212">She was afraid something would happen to him and nothing to us, so he was taken with my parents.</span> <span id="s213">My par...uh they were arrested May 5 at five o'clock in the morning by the Gestapo and we had (cough)...we have a citadel (ph) and it's like in the suburb of Liege that was unoccupied but the Germans occupied it and they gathered the Jews from Liege there and they stayed there until May, May 12th and then they were sent on to Maline (ph) which is a city between Brussels and Antwerp where they gathered the Jews from Belgium.</span> <span id="s214">While they were in the citadel with some packages, with whatever food and clothing or whatever was needed into the citadel and Rochelle (ph) who's the only one who survived told me that a German gave her milk through the bars every single day.</span> <span id="s215">There were some Germans who were helping people escape, get out of the citadel because the citadel also hol...held Belgium civilians who did underground for uh underground sabotage and my father tried to pay, because it was done for money, to have my mother and the children taken out of there but the Germans who were doing it were caught and were killed by the Germans, so that...yes...this is, this is for real.</span> <span id="s216">They were Germans.</span> <span id="s217">You have to realize not all Germans were Gestapos.</span> <span id="s218">Not all Germans were Nazis.</span> <span id="s219">There were Germans who helped.</span> <span id="s220">Whether they did it for money or because they cared I don't know, but I know my father had found out that it could be done and...but the Ger...these German soldiers who were helping, whether they were uh people who did sabotage or Jews, were killed, were shot, you know, by their own people.</span> <span id="s221">Said couldn't be done.</span> <span id="s222">We thought they would...this was, you have to realize, this is May of 1944.</span> <span id="s223">D-Day was June 6th.</span> <span id="s224">The Allied troops were bombing supposedly the railroads but they did not damage the railroads enough to stop the trains from going out, so they thought they would not be deported.</span> <span id="s225">Not only that, someone, some Catholic people found out when they were going out of Liege but they did not dare tell my father because my father went out of his mind, and my father tried everything which way he could to do something or to join them and then went on to Maline and I stayed with Monsieur Madame LeBare (ph) who they were going in between with correspondence.</span> <span id="s226">My aunt and uncle had lived there and then went to France when Jews went into hiding.</span> <span id="s227">Jewelry which was not jewelry with diamonds.</span> <span id="s228">There were gold so you could sell it to buy food, were brought out of the citadel to their homes and handed to us and I went to stay with them for just a few days but could not stay because he too, Monsieur LeBare was also in hiding and I went on to Brussels to be closer to Maline to be able to send care packages and I stayed with a Jewish man who had intermarried a non-Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s229">In Belgium when there was an inter-marriage, they did not touch the Jews and I spent the last few months of the war in Brussels, when I say in hiding...I walked the streets.</span> <span id="s230">I went to the library and read books.</span> <span id="s231">As a matter of fact I had surgery.</span> <span id="s232">I had my appendix out and I went into a Catholic hospital and I remember the Allied troops were bombing at the time, getting ready for D-Day, and I went in.</span> <span id="s233">I remember wearing a blue nightgown and being on the elevator and Madame Freedman said to me, she said you have to be careful, you know, when you go under...these these were ether, you know...they put the mask on you.</span> <span id="s234">She says some people when they go under anesthetic, they talk and I went and I had my appendix out and the bombs were flying all over and I remember waking up and I can see the Virgin Mary on the ceiling and I kept saying in French, there's something I can't talk about.</span> <span id="s235">There's something I can't talk about.</span> <span id="s236">And I happened to be in a room with people who did not speak French.</span> <span id="s237">You know Belgium is bilingual.</span> <span id="s238">They spoke Flemish.</span> <span id="s239">They spoke...they didn't speak French, and I stayed there...you know, those were the days they kept you in the hospital for two weeks, and that's when D-Day had happened and the Allied troops came into Brussels in September and my father managed to get himself in jail, in a in a prison, Belgium prison, because...I don't know how he managed it but he said he used to go to help the the underground to fight.</span> <span id="s240">He used to go to the farmers and quote, rob them, to feed the underground people.</span> <span id="s241">Somehow or other...I don't know what he did...he got himself in jail, got himself a lawyer, and I went to the lawyer.</span> <span id="s242">I said you have my father released, I'll kill you.</span> <span id="s243">My father was in jail...I don't think he ever forgave me for it...the last three months of the war and I left Brussels and I decided to go home for to be home with my father for my 18th birthday, and my birthday's September 14.</span> <span id="s244">Got on a train, got as far as _____ which is halfway between Brussels and Liege and didn't realize because Brussels they just walked in...the British and the Canadians came in, and didn't realize they were still fighting on the outskirts of Liege, because it's the closest place to Germany.</span> <span id="s245">We had it when the Germans came in in reverse, and I stayed with Monsieur, Madame LeBare and got my father out of jail somehow.</span> <span id="s246">He was an alien.</span> <span id="s247">They were going to send him to Czechoslovakia, but everything was proven and I went to live with my father.</span> <span id="s248">We managed...we were bombed.</span> <span id="s249">We had the buzz bombs.</span> <span id="s250">A place to live was hard to get, so I went back with my father and people started coming out of the camps and coming home and we were hoping and some man and I don't remember his name...a Jew...came came out of the camp.</span> <span id="s251">My father was going to palm readers, to fortune tellers, everything, and this man told my father, don't keep hoping.</span> <span id="s252">I took the bodies out myself from the crematories.</span> <span id="s253">You have to realize that they went out when Hitler had the final...came up with the final solution and they went into Auschwitz on May 21 according to Rochelle.</span> <span id="s254">They left uh Belgium 19.</span> <span id="s255">Arrived on the 21 and they separated women and children and Rochelle's husband went on a march.</span> <span id="s256">Didn't make it.</span> <span id="s257">That's what she told me, and when they went in, somebody told her to hand the baby to my mother, and afterwards they told her she would never see the child.</span> <span id="s258">My mother was lost because my cousin was ten.</span> <span id="s259">My little sister was...let's see...I was going on eighteen, so my littler sister...six...eighteen...fourteen...I was told that my middle sister was given the option of either going to the women's camp or staying with my mother, and she choose to stay with mother.</span> <span id="s260">You have to realize they didn't know about the gas chambers, and they went in immediately.</span> <span id="s261">They did...were not choosed for experiments, and this was the final solution and they went in immediately.</span> <span id="s262">I didn't have the heart to ask Rochelle did they go in right away or the next day or anything, but that was the final solution and this man told him, he says don't...you know, that's what some of the people did is keep the bodies, so uh and then we made contact with my aunt in Cleveland and my father thought I would be better off coming to the States.</span> <span id="s263">And I left my father and came to Cleveland, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Question: And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Answer: I think so.</span> <span id="s266">But we had...the Catholics...you have to realize the the people who would have been caught for making the false ID's were risking their lives if they had been caught, you know, doing it.</span> <span id="s267">Uh if you care to know, the reason the family was picked up is we had what they called the ____ and they were the people...I don't know if you can really call them pro-Germans.</span> <span id="s268">Probably most people worked for the Germans, and we had sabotage very very strong in Liege because of the ammunition...first of all because they hated the Germans...ammunition, rifles and I remember distinctly when an American plane was shot down and fell between two stacks of hay across from the house where we were in hiding, and we walked over.</span> <span id="s269">No bodies were found because probably the underground picked up...I don't know if it was one fli...pilot and the co-pilot.</span> <span id="s270">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s271">Nobody found anything and these people were helped.</span> <span id="s272">You also had a Briti...you know, you had the Belgian underground and I don't know if there was some infiltration coming from England or what and when my understanding was that if the ____ turned in like an underground or...they got paid for this.</span> <span id="s273">This was...that's my understanding.</span> <span id="s274">They did it for money.</span> <span id="s275">My...the family and the other couple were arrested on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s276">There were things...there were people arrested...I mean the Germans were doing a lot of...nobody knew who was doing what.</span> <span id="s277">On Thursday there were twin brothers...they were farmers across the way from where we were in hiding, who had been called to go to German, you see, and they didn't go.</span> <span id="s278">This was...and we're talking Catholics.</span> <span id="s279">They were picked up and I don't know if they also worked for the underground maybe to what extent...I don't know.</span> <span id="s280">They were picked up on Thursday, and whoever was doing it slipped...I don't know how but they found out who did it and the person who was doing it was killed, you know, was shot down for what he was doing, but with all the things that went on, my...our family was picked up.</span> <span id="s281">The two brothers, the twin brothers were picked up and then that one person...whether it was one...I know it was one.</span> <span id="s282">Whether he worked in conjunctions with others I couldn't tell you because I was not at home...was was shot down because of what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Question: Did you see this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Answer: No.</span> <span id="s285">No, no.</span> <span id="s286">I did not see it happen.</span> <span id="s287">You have to realize I was in Liege and I was running for my life too, especially at that time because the fam...you know, my parents were deported and I..</span> <span id="s288">.</span> <span id="s289">for some reason the Gestapo did not believe my little sister.</span> <span id="s290">They did not go to the hospital so far as I know.</span> <span id="s291">My par...my father left the hospital right away that same Sunday and uh Madame _____, her son the doctor thought it would be better if I left, so because they were in trouble if they would have caught them with a Jew.</span> <span id="s292">Of course they could have denied knowing that I was Jewish because I was there as a as a maid.</span> <span id="s293">That was...you know, but it still...they could have been picked up and put in the citadel for torture and to make them talk, and I was prepared to go to Maline, uh to Brussels to be able to forward packages to the family, but they were only there for seven days and then deported, so...but this all came back from from the farmers, you know, who lived in the country.</span> <span id="s294">I mean this is all true.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Question: When you were in Liege, what were you aware of in terms of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Answer: When I was in Liege...just held my breathe if the Germans...I remember the uh Madame ____ sent me to the dry cleaner.</span> <span id="s297">We had a river which is the main river which separated Liege from going towards France or from Germany.</span> <span id="s298">The bridge, the bridges were dynamited even before the German invaded.</span> <span id="s299">They had ju...they had dynamited one of the bridges and when it was acts of sabotage, the Germans posted themselves on each side, and I remember picking up some dry cleaning and something had happened and they stopped me and they were...and I never never...I studied German also and I spoke Yiddish fluently...never opened my mouth when a German...I didn't want to let anything go.</span> <span id="s300">We were aware...we knew we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s301">It...it...it's hard to explain because I remember my mother used to say if we can only live to to tell about it, to talk about it.</span> <span id="s302">Even though I was going...I was just about sixteen when we went into hiding, you know, we're not the children of today.</span> <span id="s303">We didn't have television.</span> <span id="s304">We we were not world...wise like the children are today.</span> <span id="s305">My parents were fantastic parents in trying to protect us, took the brunt of it.</span> <span id="s306">We were aware.</span> <span id="s307">We told my little cousin if you ever want to see your father, you must not...your name is Simone Albert and nothing else, but I was a blond.</span> <span id="s308">The...I think the the help of of the farmers, the help of the people...we went on living.</span> <span id="s309">We ate.</span> <span id="s310">My health was fantastic.</span> <span id="s311">We did go, for instance, in between...someone told us about a priest in another village in the ____ which is the...he was hiding a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s312">As a matter of fact this young woman, this Rochelle who is in Israel now...her sister and her mother were there in that village that he was willing to help and I remember my mother and my two sisters...maybe my little cousin went...no, I think my mother and my sister...we got on the train and we went uh towards Mameur (ph) it was called and we went and we stayed at the priest's house and he was going to decide whether to let my sister or me or both of us stay and after we got off the train...(laughter)......alright and we, and he...it was interesting because he was helping Jews but on the other hand, he worked both ends at one time, and I want to say this very openly.</span> <span id="s313">I am not prejudiced.</span> <span id="s314">Catholics helped us to save, risked their lives to save our lives, but there's always a bad one, and this priest worked both ends.</span> <span id="s315">As a matter of fact, I think the underground took care of him eventually, if I remember correctly and we didn't stay.</span> <span id="s316">We went back, so we were aware but until you saw, until you saw the Germans...you know, it's like every day living.</span> <span id="s317">We learned to live with no water.</span> <span id="s318">We...my father made us play cards every night.</span> <span id="s319">We burned a kerosene lamp and that was...I remember we used to gripe but we played cards.</span> <span id="s320">There was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s321">We played cards.</span> <span id="s322">But we went to the farmers.</span> <span id="s323">We went to the movies.</span> <span id="s324">We we walked...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Question: Is this in Liege?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Answer: No, when we were in hiding in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Question: I've gotten confused now with the sequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Answer: Well, even when we were hiding, even when I was in Liege, when I was in Brussels, I walked the street.</span> <span id="s329">I walked the streets openly.</span> <span id="s330">If I would have been stopped for any reason...first of all I was a girl.</span> <span id="s331">I was...I was not in areas where sabotage went on or Germans went, so I walked...I walked the street like any other civilian, and in Brussels we didn't have...with Liege you had the river to cross, you see.</span> <span id="s332">In Liege you had to be careful because if any act of sabotage went on, because there was a lot there, the Germans posted themselves on each side of the bridge and you had to keep your fingers crossed you didn't look suspicious that they'd put you...picked you up, put you in the citadel for questioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Question: Were you ever accosted by Nazis at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Answer: No.</span> <span id="s335">What I remember before we went into hiding, you know, we had to have black drapes, no lights, and that was before we went into hiding, and I can see, I can hear the boots coming up the stairway, and the Gestapo came because they thought they saw light.</span> <span id="s336">The drapes were actually opaque black.</span> <span id="s337">You could not see a white drape with light because that meant signaling, you know, whatever, and to this day when I when I see boots...I mean I can see the German, but that was before we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s338">The only instance I remember even though that was not allowed is...I'm talking German soldier...I don't know...there were two, three walking together and we were walking with my mother.</span> <span id="s339">It was my sister and they stopped my mother for just a few minutes about something that was a no-no, and they let her go, but otherwise, other than the ordinary sabotage went on or anything that they stopped everybody, especially on either side of the river.</span> <span id="s340">No, I was never stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Question: Did they search people, search your bicycle or search...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Answer: Yes.</span> <span id="s343">See they looked to see on the dry cleaning, yes.</span> <span id="s344">Physically I was never searched.</span> <span id="s345">What, what they did is if they suspected someone, they picked them up, took them to the citadel and I'm talking not necessarily Jews.</span> <span id="s346">I'm talking citizens.</span> <span id="s347">Took them, let's say the the the underground went and picked up ammunition.</span> <span id="s348">An hour later the real German ones _____, so they posted themselves and they search especially by the river and they would arrest...they would ta...and it was mainly men.</span> <span id="s349">They would take them to the citadel.</span> <span id="s350">At first what they did is they...you had turned in...you had to realize that the identification card are almost like passport.</span> <span id="s351">They are very very official, picture and everything.</span> <span id="s352">They would they would keep the identi...the ID's and say come back and get them, but the people never went back to get them, so they got wise, you see, and they would hold whoever they had and I heard, I remember hearing of people being tortured to the extent I remember one instance of uh very clearly that somebody committed suicide.</span> <span id="s353">I remember it being said.</span> <span id="s354">I never saw anyone, I had no contact with anyone who was released from the citadel, but I remember it being said if they talk, don't blame them because they were being tortured.</span> <span id="s355">So what was happening, for instance, if a man who...remember the women didn't work in those days.</span> <span id="s356">Women stayed at home.</span> <span id="s357">If men went out to work and they were due home at five o'clock and word I mean spread like wildfire.</span> <span id="s358">You knew when there was sabotage right after it happened.</span> <span id="s359">You knew what was going on at all times.</span> <span id="s360">If a man, if there was...something had happened and your husband or your father didn't come home at five o'clock, starting from five o'clock until he got home fifteen minutes late, you trembled.</span> <span id="s361">You waited and you hoped they hadn't been picked up.</span> <span id="s362">But that was not to the Jews.</span> <span id="s363">That was to every Belgian citizen because of the very high rate of sabotage that was going in Liege.</span> <span id="s364">Now you have to realize that the French Belgiums hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s365">We're not talking about the Flemish.</span> <span id="s366">We were orthodox, but it was not the orthodox that are known in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s367">I mean, you know, my father did not wear a yarmulke (ph).</span> <span id="s368">I understand my mother was married with a shidle (ph), but of course did not live that way.</span> <span id="s369">The synagogue was orthodox.</span> <span id="s370">We didn't have a rabbi.</span> <span id="s371">He went to Russia for a visit and was caught during the war.</span> <span id="s372">The Belgian Jews except maybe for Antwerp...we're talking Liege...people my generation and older, were immigrants.</span> <span id="s373">They came mainly from Poland to work the coal mining countries and then went into businesses, tailors, furriers, merchants, and they worked their way out.</span> <span id="s374">Belgium is a modern country, uh very open, and you could get yourself financially quite comfortable, even as a Jew.</span> <span id="s375">As an alien you had to register.</span> <span id="s376">It was...all aliens.</span> <span id="s377">There were Italians and then after the Sp..</span> <span id="s378">.</span> <span id="s379">during the Spanish Revolution we picked up not many Spanish because they went mainly to France, so you had aliens but not Jews.</span> <span id="s380">Now I am talking the French part of Belgium.</span> <span id="s381">I am not versed of what went on in Antwerp, but the Flemish Belgium may be a little, may have been a little more pro-German than the French Belgium.</span> <span id="s382">The Belgium, the ____ hate the Germans, remembered World War I.</span> <span id="s383">They did not...the the the...when I say uneducated, we all went to school until like age 12.</span> <span id="s384">Everybody went to school.</span> <span id="s385">Were not cosmopolitan.</span> <span id="s386">They didn't know of a Jew.</span> <span id="s387">I never was pointed out, made to feel different.</span> <span id="s388">I I remember going to school with matzos.</span> <span id="s389">When we went into hiding, when we had to go, we had a neighbor and I don't even remember the name.</span> <span id="s390">She said where are we going, so my mother told him we have to leave.</span> <span id="s391">We have...because we're Jews and they looked at us.</span> <span id="s392">They didn't even know what a Jew...they couldn't believe we were Jewish, you see, because even though we kept Judaism at home...my mother lit candles...the neighbor next door, the Catholic, was not aware of it all or we didn't speak about it in school.</span> <span id="s393">There was not the exchange that children have today.</span> <span id="s394">This is why St. Nicholas day, Easter egg hunt, uh the the children have communion.</span> <span id="s395">My sister who was much more outgoing than I was, went to parties for communion.</span> <span id="s396">We had rosaries at home, holy pictures.</span> <span id="s397">We did not carry them, but that's what we carried during while we were in hiding because even the very non-staunch Catholics who did not follow all the rules, carved bread before (ph),.</span> <span id="s398">They _____.</span> <span id="s399">They had rosaries in the house.</span> <span id="s400">That's what we carried to be part of the Catholic, but as a Jew until we had to go into hiding and even while we were in hiding, if I can relive it...we had fear but we did not have fear of the Belgium citizen you see, like a whole...Question: Your friends did not turn on you like they did in other cases.</span> <span id="s401">They remained very helpful, and when you were in hiding, were they helpful to you?Answer: My Monsieur Madame LeBare...I went to stay there.</span> <span id="s402">I mean this was a couple who were maybe at that time maybe in their fifties, late forties...you know, when you are young they look a lot older...Monsieur Madame LeBare I went to.</span> <span id="s403">Uh where I was in hiding they took me in because they were anti-German but they...I..</span> <span id="s404">.</span> <span id="s405">I don't think they would have risked their life to the extent that this man in the country did to get us papers, to get the false identification card.</span> <span id="s406">It took one rotten apple to kill the whole thing.</span> <span id="s407">You have to realize that the villages, everyone knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s408">Everyone knew we were hiding.</span> <span id="s409">There was no way...nobody abandoned us when when my mother and my sisters were arrested and brought to the main road, and the farmers also...this came back from a farmer that I have no reason to doubt them, that they tried to help in saving the children.</span> <span id="s410">The the ordinary farmer, the ordinary citizen...no one turned on us.</span> <span id="s411">I mean Madame ____ or the doctor did not turn against me.</span> <span id="s412">What they did is they didn't want to risk my staying there.</span> <span id="s413">There was no need for it.</span> <span id="s414">It was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s415">I could not stay with Monsieur Madame LeBare because he also was hiding because he was supposed to have gone to Germany, you see, to work the factories.</span> <span id="s416">You have to realize Hitler was loosing at the Russian fronts and and all the Germans...the the German citizens were in the army.</span> <span id="s417">They needed civilians so he also was hiding in his own home.</span> <span id="s418">They couldn't pick up everybody, so they were afraid...they didn't turn on me.</span> <span id="s419">I stayed there but for their safety, for my safety, we couldn't stay together.</span> <span id="s420">We went back...my father and I got on a bus.</span> <span id="s421">We went back to the farm.</span> <span id="s422">They spoke to us.</span> <span id="s423">They could have turned us in.</span> <span id="s424">You see, we went to get information...what happened, what...but nobody turned us in.</span> <span id="s425">I..</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">we left, we left the farm.</span> <span id="s428">Nobody turned us in, but it took what they called _____ who worked for the Germans whether I feel, whether they were ignorant or there are always people who go on the winning side to protect themselves or whether they did for money I don't know, so it took one person to do it, but as a whole, no...no one.</span> <span id="s429">I went back to the farm.</span> <span id="s430">I went to Monsieur Madame LeBare, and no one said you must be...you know, it was worked out so that I was safe, and I was able to get on a train and go to Brussels.</span> <span id="s431">Nobody threw me out.</span> <span id="s432">We were on a bus.</span> <span id="s433">Farmers...we got the story.</span> <span id="s434">They could have called, they could have called the Germans.</span> <span id="s435">They could have called the Gestapos.</span> <span id="s436">They could have the ___ Germans and had my father and I arrested.</span> <span id="s437">We survived through the end of the war.</span> <span id="s438">If it wouldn't have been for the Belgium citizens, for the Catholics, we could have never made it.</span> <span id="s439">Not only they helped, but they did risk their lives.</span> <span id="s440">I mean if they would have been caught, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Question: We have to pause there.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">END OF TAPE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Answer: We knew we were...when I walked the streets when I went on errands, even when I went home on weekends as a maid, when I was working as a maid, during...I don't remember...it took me a half an hour, forty-five minutes on my bicycle...I had no fear during that period.</span> <span id="s444">Uh I also had an incident that happened.</span> <span id="s445">We live in...it's hilly.</span> <span id="s446">The trucks did not run on gasoline...it was butane, whatever they run...and it was common practice to hook up to the truck in the back and go up the hill.</span> <span id="s447">My skirt caught on to the truck and I fell and I broke my collar bone.</span> <span id="s448">I can prove it.</span> <span id="s449">And I remember there was a man sitting in the open truck in the back and they picked me up and put my bicycle on and I said don't let me die three days before my birthday.</span> <span id="s450">It was September 11.</span> <span id="s451">That's how I remember the date.</span> <span id="s452">The fear was not a constant fear, you know, on the everyday living.</span> <span id="s453">Sure we knew like before I went in to be a maid and the family sat together and we talked and we had to play cards with my father...we griped, I mean like any ordinary teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Question: And your father was present...</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Answer: We were all together...the the family except for the brief period where my two sisters and my cousin went into an orphanage which...I don't remember how long they stayed, whether they stayed a month, two months, and then the nuns said my sister...my sister was too old to really be considered uh an orphan.</span> <span id="s456">Uh the the food was not as...it sounds it sounds crazy...the food was not as good as at home.</span> <span id="s457">Remember, we ate fresh vegetables, fresh foods, cream.</span> <span id="s458">My my...I I was much heav....I was heavier than I have ever been and we lived as a family.</span> <span id="s459">We burned wood.</span> <span id="s460">I mean...we we we...on most everyday thing, no.</span> <span id="s461">A man came to cut the woods behind.</span> <span id="s462">They befriended us.</span> <span id="s463">They offered to take my cousin...</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Question: I'm still just a little bit confused.</span> <span id="s465">You were living as a family with a family, and yet you're working as a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Answer: No.</span> <span id="s467">The the whole...up until about...I don't know how long I was a maid...three months, four months...the whole family was together until this person came and told my parents about my going in to become a maid so as to be separated from the family.</span> <span id="s468">We were in hiding when I had to fill out papers and I had to go back to to the village, to _____...in hiding for twenty-two months.</span> <span id="s469">I was a maid for only several months, so the first part of the hiding, two families were together, completely together.</span> <span id="s470">For a short period, my sisters and my cousin...but that was much later until you you get your bearings, until...and I don't remember at which point of hiding they went to the orphanage.</span> <span id="s471">I was too old.</span> <span id="s472">There was no two ways...we lived two families together in a little...I'm telling you, a small house in three rooms upstairs.</span> <span id="s473">We can't even call them bedrooms...we turned them into bedrooms and two rooms downstairs, so we were two families together and my father went to help the farmers.</span> <span id="s474">Uh we rode our bicycles.</span> <span id="s475">We we didn't work.</span> <span id="s476">Uh we didn't know...you know, you had to take it on a day-to-day basis because we didn't know how long we were going to be in hiding.</span> <span id="s477">We left the house with no fear.</span> <span id="s478">We rode our bicycles to the next village with no fear.</span> <span id="s479">We went to to the farmers to pick up eggs or whatever we needed with no fear.</span> <span id="s480">My sister and I went in to Liege for our ration stamps.</span> <span id="s481">How did I feel?</span> <span id="s482">I think on the way down there was not that fear because we didn't have to fear every every citizen, you know, we passed, or or truck or every farmer.</span> <span id="s483">When we went to to the station where they handed out the ration uh stamps, to give you the instance when the Germans were looking for I don't know what and the people who were distributing them according to ___..._______________card with the Juda stamped on it, so they protected us.</span> <span id="s484">I am sure we didn't realize, at least we, me as a teenager, realized the full extent of what was happening.</span> <span id="s485">I was aware...I didn't understand Kristallnacht, for instance, until many years later and you see pictures.</span> <span id="s486">I knew it was there.</span> <span id="s487">I remember when the Germans invaded Poland before...you know, we were going tracing back.</span> <span id="s488">My...we had balconies.</span> <span id="s489">You know, this is European style.</span> <span id="s490">There were balconies, and I remember...it was a beautiful sunshiny day.</span> <span id="s491">My mother was crying, and I couldn't understand, but my mother remembered World War I, you see.</span> <span id="s492">I remember we left Liege because everybody yelled they're dynamiting the bridges, they're dyna...and we lived in the part of Liege we could only go to Germany, so we went to friends on the other side of the city.</span> <span id="s493">My father and the other man took off to see what if they could ____ the troops, even though we were aliens, and we went, my mother, Madame Bilkowitz (ph)...they didn't have children...my two sisters and we went...I've seen movies of it, and what happened is in Belgium is the civilians were caught with the soldiers and the planes came and were shooting low and killing civilians, and we were marching with a few belongings, and people were turning around.</span> <span id="s494">They said don't keep going.</span> <span id="s495">They're shooting at the troops so the civilians are getting killed, so we stopped and we went and I remember we stayed...we slept on the floor with everybody packed in in what was built for soldiers to to stay.</span> <span id="s496">I remember trying to make tea with cold water because there was no cold water and we decided to turn around because the people who were trying to go to Fra...to France were coming back and saying the Germans are...with the machine guns, you know, were giving the planes low and shooting, and I saw the first Germans as we were going back.</span> <span id="s497">We didn't know where my father and Monsieur Berkowitz were, and I saw the first German.</span> <span id="s498">We were not home yet and I could see them on a motorcycle with side car and with the guns and we held on to my mother and Madame Berkowitz.</span> <span id="s499">We went back to Liege and my father and Mr. Berkowitz came back.</span> <span id="s500">There's nothing to...and we went back home.</span> <span id="s501">And during the first two years, everything we had to eat was black market.</span> <span id="s502">I never went hungry.</span> <span id="s503">When it came to going to hiding, sure we were afraid but we didn't know about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s504">We did not...we knew about the ____ but I as a teenager, I think my parents entwined to shield us.</span> <span id="s505">Today we tell our children.</span> <span id="s506">And we tell them the world is not all roses, but children were not brought up that way, so they shielded us so...I I I remember knowing...when you went went into Poland, I remember my mother crying when war was declared and they ta...you know, they they came in.</span> <span id="s507">We went into hiding.</span> <span id="s508">I remember my parents talking.</span> <span id="s509">I can see my father walking up the stairway, afraid when I hea...when I hear boots.</span> <span id="s510">When I see them to this day I shutter because I can see the Germans marching with the boots and not necessarily Gestapos.</span> <span id="s511">I can hear, I can remember when the the this Gestapo stopped because they thought they saw a light coming out of our windows.</span> <span id="s512">But we were not afraid of the everyday soldier you see, who...and we, where we lived we prob...we might have had more than let's say Brussels, because we were at the German border, and there was what we call ______ where they train soldiers, you see, and they occupied it.</span> <span id="s513">The Americans occupied it in reverse when they liberated us.</span> <span id="s514">The hiding...yes, we knew but maybe some of it over forty years kind of...but I remember we went into the woods to sleep because the Ger...the the farmers came and said, you know, the Germans are searching for I don't know what, but going into the city, coming back...until the Germans stopped us at the bridge and I mean I trembled, but I don't think I comprehended even what was happening in the citadel when people came out and said they're torturing, because as a fifteen year old girl, you know, you don't...unless unless you live through an experience, you cannot feel what someone else has, but I remember...I was in Brussels...when I went to Brussels when my mother was taken from the citadel in Liege to Maline, and I was getting ready to send a package, and Madame Freedman said to me, Frida...I don't know how she found out...she says you can't send a package.</span> <span id="s515">They've been deported.</span> <span id="s516">And why I cried and why...I felt hurt.</span> <span id="s517">You know, I'm trying to remember, but I must have known that it was something terrible, and I remember she made me go to the movie and I was...so I came...their son who was younger, and I did not want to go, and she says you have to go because she felt it was better for me but I remember crying.</span> <span id="s518">I remember feeling terrible that they were deported, you see.</span> <span id="s519">But whether I understood...we didn't know about the the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s520">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s521">But whether...I don't think I was scared.</span> <span id="s522">I was so...I remember crying.</span> <span id="s523">I remember not wanting to go to the movie, you see.</span> <span id="s524">I know when I went into the hospital for appendicitis, I I was afraid to divulge my real name, you see, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Question: Because it was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Answer: Yes.</span> <span id="s527">First of all I would have divulged I was in hiding, you see.</span> <span id="s528">I had another name.</span> <span id="s529">I must have been afraid enough, but not when I walked the streets because everybody...you know, the ordinary civilian walked the street, and only...and in Brussels I did not quite have the fear because Br...Liege was much more dangerous sabotage-wise, you see.</span> <span id="s530">There was a lot more going on in Liege.</span> <span id="s531">My father while in hiding...we knew about the underground, you see.</span> <span id="s532">Once I went to Brussels I was detached from that, and I don't think I feared for my life during the last three months of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Question: Let's just pick up and trace again...I know we've been through it before, but just a little bit more slowly...you're in hiding.</span> <span id="s534">You're living with the two families.</span> <span id="s535">And what happens next?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Answer: What happened next?</span> <span id="s537">We grew the vegetable.</span> <span id="s538">We we we went to fetch water.</span> <span id="s539">We cooked everything the hard way.</span> <span id="s540">You know, you have to remember we did laundry on the scrub board.</span> <span id="s541">Not only we didn't have water, we had to go get the water.</span> <span id="s542">We had...the the when they used to cut the trees, they used to leave pieces of wood so we gathered wood to burn in the stove.</span> <span id="s543">We did not burn coal.</span> <span id="s544">Our days were busy from morning till night.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Question: What was your next phase, after the two families?</span> <span id="s546">You didn't stay as the two families?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Answer: No.</span> <span id="s548">I went into Liege to become a maid.</span> <span id="s549">My sister very shortly after went to the next or the same village to a doctor in the village to become a maid, but she was ill.</span> <span id="s550">She did not feel well, and the doctor told her to go home to to recuperate, so I was in Liege as a maid.</span> <span id="s551">Went home every other weekend on my bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Question: So your family remained a unit...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Answer: The family remained as...the two families remained as a unit.</span> <span id="s554">This is why when the Gestapo came...except except my father.</span> <span id="s555">My father went, came to Liege and went in...we had one big hospital.</span> <span id="s556">He went to the hospital on Friday.</span> <span id="s557">But this is what families tried to do is not to stay together.</span> <span id="s558">This is why my sisters went into an orphanage...</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Question: A Catholic home...?</span> <span id="s560">Answer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s561">Well, they're all Catholic.</span> <span id="s562">We...I assume everybody knows...went to a Catholic orphanage to try to separate...you were not in a cluster when this happened, which is exactly what happened you see.</span> <span id="s563">Uh a lot of families...that's what they tried to do...save the children, to separate the children from the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Question: Do you remember the day that it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Answer: When they were arrested?</span> <span id="s566">May 5, 1944, five o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s567">The Gestapo came to pick up the family, and remember this...on March...March 5, excuse me.</span> <span id="s568">March 5 at five o'clock in the morning, and you have to remember the weather...wee hours in the morning and it's dark, and they took them from the house to the main road to question them and my mother tried to save the children by telling them that they were not her children.</span> <span id="s569">But the Germans did not take it, and the farmers tried.</span> <span id="s570">I don't know to what extent, and the Germans did not take it and I guess no one asked for me.</span> <span id="s571">Whoever reported us didn't realize that I was missing but they did ask where my father was and my little sister said my father was in the hospital and the German slapped her for lying.</span> <span id="s572">In this case the farmers who did not specifically do something physical for us like making the papers or something, but they knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s573">We had food.</span> <span id="s574">We had eggs.</span> <span id="s575">We had milk.</span> <span id="s576">We had everything we wanted.</span> <span id="s577">My father worked for it, but uh nobody paid for us you see.</span> <span id="s578">I mean there was no exchanges, you know, wherever...I don't know where we got the meat.</span> <span id="s579">I remember a ham, a smoked ham, and my mother never touched it.</span> <span id="s580">I mean my mother could not get away from the kosher laws even though the meat she ate was not kosher.</span> <span id="s581">The farmers were there to notify us.</span> <span id="s582">Why they didn't know...they came at five o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s583">If they would have known I can assure you we would have been warned, but this was March 5.</span> <span id="s584">Remember D-Day was June 6th.</span> <span id="s585">The Allied troops were getting ready for D-Day.</span> <span id="s586">There was heavy bombing.</span> <span id="s587">Hitler was fighting on the Russian front where all the Ger...they needed the soldiers on the Russian front, so you had the Catholic citizen, the Belgium citizen, in hiding because they didn't want to go to work in Germany, and it's hard to comprehend.</span> <span id="s588">How do you hide in your own house, but everybody was hiding, and as a whole, whoever had to send the letters out to say yes we have to go to the train station and you have to report because you have to go to Germany, these people were against the Germans too, so if you had _____ where where...I don't know what the percentage was, but there were not many.</span> <span id="s589">All you needed is one or two and they had to be careful that the underground didn't kill them because the Catholics were German-haters enough to do it because I know they did it whoever caught.</span> <span id="s590">As a matter of fact, when the Jews came back from the camps, Belgium Jews in Liege did not own property, did not own houses.</span> <span id="s591">For some reason there was a couple...and we were not friends of theirs...owned a house.</span> <span id="s592">The family, a boy, girl, mother and father, were deported.</span> <span id="s593">The girl and the boy came back.</span> <span id="s594">They were around my age...I don't remember...they were one of the first ones to come back from the camp.</span> <span id="s595">The _____ had occupied their house.</span> <span id="s596">Do you know what happened when they came back?</span> <span id="s597">People went in and had a bonfire throwing them out of the house, you see.</span> <span id="s598">So the fear we had was the fear of being caught and being caught in a cluster, which had happ...which happened.</span> <span id="s599">You see, if my sister hadn't been sick, she too would have survived.</span> <span id="s600">Uh we were also afraid of another Jew because you...the list, the names of the Jews and I'm talking strictly Liege, that it got out, was handed out, was prepared by a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s601">They ended up in hiding.</span> <span id="s602">As a matter of fact, they had two daughters, one my age and one a little bit older.</span> <span id="s603">They ended up in hiding and you know, people under certain circumstances do certain things to save their life.</span> <span id="s604">I think it's well known that certain people did things in the camps, that it went on at top levels in trying to save their lives.</span> <span id="s605">This not unknown.</span> <span id="s606">It's not uh surfaced as much as what we went though, but there was a Jewish couple...I can't think of their name.</span> <span id="s607">Only the daughter's name I remember.</span> <span id="s608">After the war, they were shunned.</span> <span id="s609">The older daughter ended up going with an American who was not Jewish...he was Protestant...someplace in Tennessee or something.</span> <span id="s610">She was pregnant before she was married.</span> <span id="s611">Now we're going back to the days when when this happened it was the worst thing that could happen.</span> <span id="s612">Everybody says he deserves it.</span> <span id="s613">So you were also concerned of what another Jew might do in order to save his...I think when everybody went into hiding, every one realized no one could save themselves no matter what they did, so this this man who who who did this, ended up in hiding like everybody else, but he was...they were separated from the girls.</span> <span id="s614">The girls ended up in a Catholic home.</span> <span id="s615">What you also had...my parents, my mother was a very good person, very soft-hearted, and this is how this couple, Rochelle and her husband and the baby, came in hiding with us, because we wanted to help them but it would have been much smarter if we didn't, if...we should have been more selfish so you didn't have as large a cluster of people together, but my parents knew her when she was what, fifteen, sixteen, and he was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s616">They knew him as a youngster, so they did for them and we went in together, but as a whole, Jews did not...I think my father ran into the man who had given out the list because you know you walked the street, you went into the city, and he knew the two girls were in a Catholic home and he wouldn't tell my father where because he didn't want...you see, he was smart in a way.</span> <span id="s617">He didn't want other Jews to find out because the more you had, the more dangerous it was for them.</span> <span id="s618">So the idea was to do the best you could for yourself, but not do for another one, not to be caught in a cluster, but we were in a cluster no matter how we tried.</span> <span id="s619">And uh Rochelle and...they came...I don't know how much later.</span> <span id="s620">It was it was not a month because after the the teenagers were, you know, had to go out and no one, no one that I know of in that group came back.</span> <span id="s621">This was right at the beginning.</span> <span id="s622">They came...it might have been a week later, ten days later, that they called them in, so they came and joined us and we were two families together which was not good so what happens when the Gestapo came, everybody was together.</span> <span id="s623">Why Rochelle and her husband never tried to go someplace else...I guess we felt very well-protected because there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s624">Nobody turned in anyone you see.</span> <span id="s625">No one turned in anyone, except the ____ because they were underground people that were being picked up and they were trying to find out who was doing it.</span> <span id="s626">Sure they found out.</span> <span id="s627">Sunday...my family.</span> <span id="s628">Thursday the twin brothers who were supposed to have gone up to Germany.</span> <span id="s629">Not only that, I think they were working with the underground, and then that...when it was found out that there were things going on uh before and they were trying to find out who was selling out, what was going...I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Question: What happened to you when you found out that your mother had been deported?</span> <span id="s631">What were you doing and what did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Answer: I was in Brussels, and Madame Friedman, when I went to get ready to make, wanted to get a package ready to send to Maline, Madame Friedman told me, no...they've been deported.</span> <span id="s633">I went to pieces.</span> <span id="s634">I was crying.</span> <span id="s635">I didn't want want to believe it.</span> <span id="s636">And she told me to...she arranged for me to go to the movie with her with her son, which I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s637">And she says the...I must go and I don't remember which movie I saw.</span> <span id="s638">I know it wasn't an American movie.</span> <span id="s639">They didn't allow it.</span> <span id="s640">And I think that the last three months I must have lived on a..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">first of all my father was in jail.</span> <span id="s643">I was separated from my father and we knew that the Allied troops were getting ready to land.</span> <span id="s644">Remember, this is May, and my family went out uh May 19 you see.</span> <span id="s645">D-Day was June 6th, so while they were at the citadel, I was busy making arrangements to send packages.</span> <span id="s646">We made arrangements to get letters in, packages meaning if you read one of the letters that was sent out of the citadel, they're asking for canned meat, anything that can be preserved.</span> <span id="s647">They're asking for shoes.</span> <span id="s648">She's asking for for candy...we call them bon bons...for the for the child.</span> <span id="s649">Uh she's asking for thread.</span> <span id="s650">She's asking for a bra.</span> <span id="s651">So during...from March 5 to May 12th was it...I was busy with that you see.</span> <span id="s652">I was with Monsieuer Madame LeBare in a..</span> <span id="s653">.</span> <span id="s654">oh no, I was not with Monsieur Madame LeBare the whole time.</span> <span id="s655">When I left where I was a maid, I don't know how...I ended up...I forgot about that...in the home of a law...oh, probably through their daughter who was married to a lawyer.</span> <span id="s656">I was in Liege.</span> <span id="s657">I remember...she lived along the river and I ended up in the home of a lawyer, a single woman who had never been married.</span> <span id="s658">She smoked a pipe.</span> <span id="s659">She had a boy friend.</span> <span id="s660">I didn't expect...understand the extent of it.</span> <span id="s661">You know, I was very naive.</span> <span id="s662">Remember from the age of fifteen to the age of eighteen, I didn't have normal growing-up.</span> <span id="s663">Yes.</span> <span id="s664">I was in the home of a lawyer, and I remember baking bread and I remember cleaning the house, but she was not...I was not the maid maid that I was before and I was arranging to make packages to send to the citadel and I was arranging to keep my father in jail, and she's the one I says you get my father released...I'll kill you.</span> <span id="s665">I was not eighteen years old, and I turned to the lawyer, the son-in-law of the home where I was hiding who was very nice, you see, and he arranged when my father came up for trial to keep him in jail, because my father was ready to surrender himself to the Germans.</span> <span id="s666">I forgot about that part.</span> <span id="s667">I stayed with her for short time, so I don't think I had time to be scared.</span> <span id="s668">I didn't have time for anything.</span> <span id="s669">I don't think...my father had the brunt in trying to pay someone to get the family released from the citadel and when I went to Brussels, I didn't know about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s670">I knew they were deported.</span> <span id="s671">I know I went to pieces.</span> <span id="s672">I..</span> <span id="s673">.</span> <span id="s674">I was going on eighteen but it was my mother who went.</span> <span id="s675">I remember crying and I remember saying no, I don't want to go to the movie.</span> <span id="s676">I remember distinctly, and I lived the last three months...we each had, each of us three girls had in the padding of our coat my aunt in Cleveland, her name and address.</span> <span id="s677">She was the only relative we had outside of Europe except an uncle who was on a kibbutz in Israel.</span> <span id="s678">We had her address and two hundred American dollars.</span> <span id="s679">Remember, this is black market, so that if we got separated the two hundred dollars helped me survive financially.</span> <span id="s680">Remember no body had money.</span> <span id="s681">No body had a lot.</span> <span id="s682">Monsieur Friedman...we won't go into this character.</span> <span id="s683">He was a character.</span> <span id="s684">Took the two hundred dollars and sold them to an American, sold to a German soldier when...remember the Germans were walk...I mean clean.</span> <span id="s685">Nothing, not a pin was out of line when they walked.</span> <span id="s686">When the Allied troops crossed the French-Belgium border, the radio was saying they were crossing the Belgium, the French-Belgium border.</span> <span id="s687">The news could not keep up with the Allied troops.</span> <span id="s688">They were in Brussels.</span> <span id="s689">I could see the Allied troops coming.</span> <span id="s690">I had been released from the hospital.</span> <span id="s691">My appendics were...had opened and there was uh uh...I had an infection and there was no bandages and I had a gauze bandage around me, and they came and everybody was kissing them.</span> <span id="s692">They wanted to pick me up and I was afraid the suture was going to open (laughter) and the Allied troops came in and I saw for the first time German soldiers...you know, this ____ with the jacket, and I remember one distinctly.</span> <span id="s693">Remember, I'm going on eighteen and I'm seventeen...dragging a horse.</span> <span id="s694">They were selling, they were trying to get American dollars.</span> <span id="s695">They were trying to get anything they could lay their hands on because the German mark, the Belgium money was worth, was worth absolutely nothing, so my two hundred American dollars, I never saw it because he kept...he kept it.</span> <span id="s696">We sold to uh German soldiers on the black market.</span> <span id="s697">It would have brought in a fortune probably.</span> <span id="s698">That I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s699">I remember getting on the train and I remember it was dusk and and I couldn't go anywhere else, because I wanted to get back with my father.</span> <span id="s700">Whether the thought of the state of my mother and sisters came into in my mind at that time...I don't think so.</span> <span id="s701">What I can recall distinctly is saying I want to be with my father.</span> <span id="s702">I want to be home for my eighteenth birthday.</span> <span id="s703">That I remember.</span> <span id="s704">Whether I thought or I wondered what happened to my mother...at the time maybe I didn't.</span> <span id="s705">My main aim was getting back with my father, which I didn't do right away because I stayed with Monsieur Madame LeBare.</span> <span id="s706">When I got to ___ there was no transportation.</span> <span id="s707">I got on an American jeep.</span> <span id="s708">Took me into Liege.</span> <span id="s709">Then I worked on getting my father, getting, you know, my father out of jail.</span> <span id="s710">He was an alien.</span> <span id="s711">They were going to send him and at the time there was already becoming Russia, that part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s712">I'm trying to think and I can't...did I wonder what happened to my mother and sisters as the Jews came out of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s713">I guess we were hoping to see them come out, because they went out very soon before D-Day, but because see they deported them once more even after D-Day.</span> <span id="s714">This is June 6th they landed.</span> <span id="s715">They didn't come into Belgium until September, so we called them ______.</span> <span id="s716">One group of Jews went out and there was another one I understand went out after them.</span> <span id="s717">So we were hoping as Jews came out of the concentration camps...Rochelle came out.</span> <span id="s718">She does not remember...I saw her in Israel...that I went to see her after she came home, but she didn't talk about what happened.</span> <span id="s719">I remember her crying, but I went to see her because when I saw her in Israel about eleven years ago, I said to her, I said Rochelle, don't you remember I saw you, and she said no, but I remember.</span> <span id="s720">Cause she told me at the time she was sterilized, that she, you know, she was not...Mengeler sterilized her, because when I was in Israel...that was before they announced that Mengeler had died, whether it's sure enough beside the point (ph), and she said to me, she says I could...in French, of course...if I could lay my hands on Mengeler, and she told me the process of her being sterilized.</span> <span id="s721">Today, at the time, could be reversed.</span> <span id="s722">She remarried, but she cannot have children.</span> <span id="s723">She could not, you know, she could not have children.</span> <span id="s724">And what I remember at liberation is when the Jews came back, this whole thing...we were hoping my mother would come back, you see.</span> <span id="s725">And then at first, you know, they were released quite easily and then they were detained to rebuild their health and, you know, they were cleaned up and that's when they straggle in and somebody told my father, you know, people survived and it was a Belgium from Liege, who had been deported earlier...I don't know at which point...he said to my father, don't keep hoping.</span> <span id="s726">I took them out myself out of the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s727">And my aunt by marriage who is the only one left in Belgium now, when I went back she made me aware, and this has always been hard for me to swallow, but this was the time when he ran out of gas, and the people were not completely dead before they went into the the ovens, and that has been a very, very hard thing for me.</span> <span id="s728">At first I told myself, oh they weren't tortured.</span> <span id="s729">They were not used for experiments, and I thought of them of going into the gas chambers and being killed right away, you know.</span> <span id="s730">They put peo...prisoners and they electrocute them, and I guess this is what I wanted to believe is they went in, until Rochelle just sent me her letter and said they were in very bad...you know, they were on trains, you know, for two days from the 19th to the 21st.</span> <span id="s731">I lived with that because I made myself believe that they went in...they went into the gas chambers and went out right away, but that is not so because they were not...that's when people did not go out completely because he was exterminating too fast and there was not enough gas before they put them in the crematories, and when this was pointed out to me...I I tried to put in the back of my mind.</span> <span id="s732">Then when I came to the States to live with my aunt, I came in May and in the fall...I don't remember what month...we had high holy days and my aunt wanted to go to ____ for my mother and I absolutely refused and I said oh no.</span> <span id="s733">I'...I remember.</span> <span id="s734">I say if I go to ____ for my mother, I'll bury her.</span> <span id="s735">And I did not want to go for that reason.</span> <span id="s736">I mean it's childish.</span> <span id="s737">It's unrealistic, but I remember saying to her no.</span> <span id="s738">I'll bury my mother.</span> <span id="s739">And I would not go to _____.</span> <span id="s740">And it took me a long time I think because I was told that my sister had a choice of going with wom...with the wom...in the women's camp and to my mother.</span> <span id="s741">I think to myself, you know, she was old enough to remember her name.</span> <span id="s742">She...I mean I was...when she went out she was sixteen in June, June 20 or 21st.</span> <span id="s743">She was old en...for many many years after hoping oh, she got lost someplace on the Russian side and she couldn't get out and maybe someday...and this is something that I must admit even to this day even though I know, I know, I know...there is a trace in me and I've never said this to my son...there's a trace in me that keeps telling me she's alive someplace.</span> <span id="s744">(Crying) I don't know why and I know it isn't so...but I didn't want to bury my mother.</span> <span id="s745">For many many years I did not want to go to ______, and I know my sister is gone, but I think it's something in you that keeps that little bit of hope, that little bit of twinge and you know, everybody had parents.</span> <span id="s746">Everybody had sisters.</span> <span id="s747">Everybody had brothers.</span> <span id="s748">Now we are slowly entering an age, you know...parents have died off and I realize that parents do die, and I think this has helped me to accept...and children loose parents at an early age because of illness, and as I get older and I have very, very close friends in Cleveland...they're family to me...whose mother and father have died, you know, from age.</span> <span id="s749">I think if the word accept is the right word, I'm learning to live with it because we do die, but at eighteen I didn't want to accept it, you see.</span> <span id="s750">And I think it's a little bit easier for me to accept and it's been many years that my mother died, because I've seen my friends loosing their mother and father.</span> <span id="s751">I happen to have friends whose parents lived for a long time, you know, until eighty, eighty©two, and they just lost them a few years ago.</span> <span id="s752">One of them just lost them two years ago, so it does happen, so maybe it's made it more acceptable to me that my mother died.</span> <span id="s753">My sisters...I don't know.</span> <span id="s754">When a friend of mine died because of illness, so I'm slowly entering the age, you know, illness and things.</span> <span id="s755">You know, I had a hard time adjusting to the high holy days, uh especially Rosh Hashanna and Yom Kippur...not so much Passover, but Rosh Hashanna and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s756">There's the family tie that I don't go to pieces anymore.</span> <span id="s757">I haven't had any nightmares or screaming for my father and fire burning in a long time I don't think.</span> <span id="s758">Uh it uh...you know, time heals.</span> <span id="s759">My sister is nowhere.</span> <span id="s760">I mean there's no two ways about it.</span> <span id="s761">I cannot, you know, kid myself and I've accepted that my mother is gone, and I try not to talk about it, to remember or to to face the reality.</span> <span id="s762">It's silly...that there was not enough gas to kill them and then since Rochelle wrote to me, you know, I..</span> <span id="s763">.</span> <span id="s764">when I see movies with the trains I can't look at them.</span> <span id="s765">I went to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s766">I'm always afraid to see pictures.</span> <span id="s767">Running away from rea...reality.</span> <span id="s768">When they have real pictures, I'm always afraid to look and to see them.</span> <span id="s769">I'm afraid to look at train pictures, you see.</span> <span id="s770">I'm always afraid to see my mother or my sisters, which is foolish because it's the real thing, and I can watch movies.</span> <span id="s771">I can watch...I can talk about it.</span> <span id="s772">When I see it, then I see them and this is...this is the part that I don't like to see is, you know, when they show those skeletal-like people.</span> <span id="s773">I know this did not happen to my mother and sisters because they went to the gas chamber right away you see.</span> <span id="s774">But I cannot watch the the trains.</span> <span id="s775">See my little sister was fourteen in March, but she was very small, so you see the children.</span> <span id="s776">My little cousin...we were very close to him because he had lost his real mother and he was in our house a lot, but I don't think I feel the tie with him as much as with my sisters, and with Rochelle, the little boy...I mean this kid, this this baby didn't sit on a chair.</span> <span id="s777">I mean he had all the adults pampering him and spoiling him, so until I get...I don't think I have fully accepted that there was not enough ___ and they were dragged out half-alive.</span> <span id="s778">I don't know.</span> <span id="s779">I tell myself maybe they didn't, and I cannot, and I cannot see the trains.</span> <span id="s780">I cannot watch it.</span> <span id="s781">The rest I can accept and I always say to the Americans, you came two months too late as far as I'm concerned.</span> <span id="s782">You know, my son is an American.</span> <span id="s783">I consider myself fully Americanized.</span> <span id="s784">All my friends are American.</span> <span id="s785">I never affiliated with people who came from Europe because Belgium is very different.</span> <span id="s786">I was one of the first...I was not a deportee and I came, I landed in New York exactly...._____ year after D-Day.</span> <span id="s787">I was really fortunate that I met girls my age.</span> <span id="s788">Whether they felt sorry because I didn't speak English very well.</span> <span id="s789">I Americanized but I always say you came too late, two months too late, and they bombed supposedly the railroad and they missed because had the railroads been damaged enough, the trains couldn't have gone out you see.</span> <span id="s790">So I had...oh is it resentment, towards the Allied troops.</span> <span id="s791">You know, I'm an adult now and I realize that especially with what goes on now you can't ______ all the time, but I remember the evenings and we waited and we waited and we hoped for the Allied troops to come and we waited and we hoped and I think that's what kept us going.</span> <span id="s792">And that's what...because I remember talking about it.</span> <span id="s793">My parents talked about it.</span> <span id="s794">We talked about it.</span> <span id="s795">We just waited.</span> <span id="s796">We talked about the Allied troops coming, and they came June 6th and they went out May 19th.</span> <span id="s797">You see how close.</span> <span id="s798">But they did not land in Belgium until September...until Septem...the early part of September, because I went home for my birthday September 14.</span> <span id="s799">So this...I think this is what kept us going in hiding.</span> <span id="s800">The feeling, the fear was only when you heard sabotage went on.</span> <span id="s801">Not even when we were in the country but in Liege...you didn't know who they were going to arrest.</span> <span id="s802">You didn't know who they were going to put in the citadel to torture, and we had these Catholics, these wonderful people who would have done anything to to to help us, you see.</span> <span id="s803">Papers were made out, I mean to such an extent that my father got called to go to Germany and then the the the mayor of the village said we made a mistake on his age, and they made him ten years older, you see.</span> <span id="s804">Uh people who found a place for me to go as a maid.</span> <span id="s805">When my sister took over, found the orphanage.</span> <span id="s806">Now let me tell you that when they went to the orphanage, my parents had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s807">The orphanages, the _____, the Catholic did not take you in unless it was paid.</span> <span id="s808">Remember these people are on donations, on income.</span> <span id="s809">They did not take them unless you had the means to pay for their support, and as it is, you know, they were rationed also, you know, so you...it was not an easy thing.</span> <span id="s810">But that you had to pay for.</span> <span id="s811">Our papers, our hou...we we paid the rent on the house, OK.</span> <span id="s812">But it was minimal because there was no electricity.</span> <span id="s813">There was no water.</span> <span id="s814">There was nothing, but the people who got us the house didn't ask for anything.</span> <span id="s815">The people made contact in us for anything.</span> <span id="s816">The people...this man who made the the the false ID papers did not get paid.</span> <span id="s817">The people who made the contacts for us did not get paid.</span> <span id="s818">Everything was done to help us as Jews without any financial reward.</span> <span id="s819">The LeBare got jewelry.</span> <span id="s820">Like I say, they were gold rings.</span> <span id="s821">We had British coins also in gold that we sold for money to survive.</span> <span id="s822">All of that was brought...anybody could have taken...it was brought for free, for no no reward, nothing, and these people have never even been recognized realize.</span> <span id="s823">When I went to Yad Vashem I saw they had names, and I thought oh, my didn't I do that, but I don't know to what extent they consider somebody helping the Jews, you know, to recognize and put their name there.</span> <span id="s824">I don't...maybe Rochelle put their name there, because there would have been cost making out the...and I mean the papers were made but if they took our identification papers when we went to the registry, we were registered in the...we were real, you see.</span> <span id="s825">My little sister didn't need a card.</span> <span id="s826">My cousin didn't need a card.</span> <span id="s827">You had to have them at age...was it fifteen we got the...even a Belgium citizen had to register and carry an identification card.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Question: Let's look at the day of liberation and how you got to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Answer: I had...this was my mother's sister...the address was sewn into my coat for that purpose to have contact with someone and via an American GI...he contacted my aunt before civilians were allowed to write and I don't know how the letter got through because it gave his location, and I lived with my father which was...as marvelous as parents as I had, my father was impossible.</span> <span id="s830">He was an entirely different man.</span> <span id="s831">He had the responsibility of an eighteen year old girl.</span> <span id="s832">The soldiers were roaming the streets.</span> <span id="s833">The girls were sleeping with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s834">You know...this post-war...this is normal.</span> <span id="s835">We're talking American...we had the Americans in Liege.</span> <span id="s836">Uh he was old-fashioned in that he came from a small village, small town in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s837">I had grown up all of a sudden to be eighteen, nineteen.</span> <span id="s838">I was...he did not allow me to wear lipstick.</span> <span id="s839">I made...became friends with a girl and we'd walk to each other's house.</span> <span id="s840">In the evening the streets roamed with soldiers, and I used to find that my father didn't quite trust me and he used to say why should you be different.</span> <span id="s841">He used to follow me.</span> <span id="s842">Uh this girl's name was Rose, and we used to go halfway...if she came to our house...back and forth.</span> <span id="s843">And we walked and it was a short distance.</span> <span id="s844">If I went out in the evening, he'd...he'd...he didn't know whether to trust me not to...every other girl was sleeping...houses turned into prostitution homes.</span> <span id="s845">I mean this is post-war situation, and he thought I would be better off to come to the United States to my aunt, and correspondence started and I guess my aunt prepared to send me the papers to bring me.</span> <span id="s846">Meantime a first cousin of my father came through the Jewish Brigade out of Israel through Italy and he wanted me to go to Israel, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s847">My papers had been started to go to America.</span> <span id="s848">It could have been very possible that I would have ended up in Israel instead, but only because we had my aunt's...my aunt had moved but somehow or other the letter reached her to where she had moved from one house to the other, and I left my father not on the best of terms.</span> <span id="s849">There was...I resented my father for not trusting me.</span> <span id="s850">My father resented me for I don't whatever reason.</span> <span id="s851">It was a very...but he did take care of me.</span> <span id="s852">He borrowed money.</span> <span id="s853">This was post-war...Belgium took all their money off the market and printed new money.</span> <span id="s854">Nobody had francs, so he borrowed money to pay for my passage by boat at that time.</span> <span id="s855">Called it a boat...I came on an American boat that had been used for troops and I used to say that I came on a boat that had no class because it didn't have first, second or third class.</span> <span id="s856">It was a ship that was used for uh civilian...as a matter of fact I had my visa...I had a trouble...I had...they had no trouble getting a visa.</span> <span id="s857">I had trouble getting a passport because I was considered without a nationality.</span> <span id="s858">I was no longer considered Czech.</span> <span id="s859">I was not considered a Russian, and the for...the Belgium Foreign Ministry gave me a temporary passport good for one year so I could put my visa on it, and I had to go to Antwerp to the American Consulate and I had to go to Brussels to the Foreign Ministry to get this called laissez-passe (ph) which I still have, to get my visa, but I couldn't get passageway because the American troops were still coming back.</span> <span id="s860">The war brides were coming in and I remember it was a Saturday.</span> <span id="s861">The travel agent came.</span> <span id="s862">I was at my friend's house, and he says I have passage for you.</span> <span id="s863">And overnight I had to prepare to come.</span> <span id="s864">I still have the suitcase I came and hard papier mache (ph)...remember this is post-war.</span> <span id="s865">I had a coat that was made...my uncle was a tailor and the navy blankets from the navy, green blankets, found their way on black markets.</span> <span id="s866">My uncle made a beautiful hand-made, hand-made tailored coat...I mean very fine tailoring, and I came to the United States with a coat and it was made from a green navy blanket, because you couldn't get fabrics.</span> <span id="s867">I came immediately after...Belgium had food.</span> <span id="s868">We had everything, and then also they allowed...you could not take money out of Belgium and they allowed five hundred francs...no, a thousand.</span> <span id="s869">My father applied two hundred and twenty-five or two hundred smacked on your passport, on your visa...my father allowed, my father applied for a thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s870">They allowed five hundred, and I remember going to the bank because I deposited it in the bank in Liege and picked it up in Cleveland and the banker said to me, how did you manage...the two of them met so I came with seven hundred something dollars, seven hundred twenty-five or seven hundred seventy-five...this...the only thing there, so my father saw to my needs, but for some reason didn't feel he could handle a nineteen year old young woman.</span> <span id="s871">He was...uh he remarried.</span> <span id="s872">I met his widow after he died.</span> <span id="s873">I went back to Belgium and she said, your father lived for his wife and his children.</span> <span id="s874">So I came to Cleveland and lived with my aunt, and I had a miserable life...don't put that on tape please...</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Question: That will be our second tape is which we will not do.</span> <span id="s876">We're going to have to stop now and we'll take the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Answer: Oh, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Question: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Answer: Oh, you know...I won't have to go into my miserable life...(laughter)...</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Question: I don't...unless you want to, but we're really out of tape...we have just a few more minutes left.</span> <span id="s881">We have a few more minutes, and what we're going to do...TECHNICAL CONVERSATION…OK.</span> <span id="s882">That picture's taken in the garden facing the house where we were in hiding and this is the vegetable garden that we grew with all sorts of vegetables.</span> <span id="s883">I imagine the back line is peas.</span> <span id="s884">Uh the man...the young man...his name in French is Jacques (ph).</span> <span id="s885">In Yiddish it was _________ who they were in hiding with us, and Rochelle, his wife, the only survivor.</span> <span id="s886">She came out of the camps.</span> <span id="s887">She is now in ____ in Israel and is married and their little boy, Ronnie, were in hiding with us.</span> <span id="s888">He was at that time a little over a year when he...he was not quite a year when he came into hiding to join us…TECHNICAL CONVERSATION…This is the house where we were in hiding for twenty-two months with no electricity, no water, no utilities.</span> <span id="s889">Uh again there's Jacques and the baby and next to him uh is...against against the window is my little sister Nellie, who was at that time oh about thirteen and Rochelle again next to her.</span> <span id="s890">My father and my mother in front of the doorway.</span> <span id="s891">I'm on the couch.</span> <span id="s892">I broke my collar bone, and I had to be home for a few days uh with my arm being in a in a bandage as best as it could be.</span> <span id="s893">We got the house where there were two rooms downstairs and three rooms upstairs and each
