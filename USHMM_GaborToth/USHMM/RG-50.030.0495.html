born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: It was Catz, is family name, Catz you pronounce it, C-a-t-z, Moisei M-o-i-s-e-i, which was Moishe in terms of a Jewish name, but they -- it was a lucified name of -- the variational form of Moishe or Moisei.</span> <span id="s18">In fact, by -- by the book, my name is Moisei Catz.</span> <span id="s19">Moisei bar Mordechai Catz a coyen, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: So when did you become Michael Cernea?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: That happened about 20 some years later.</span> <span id="s22">I change my name.</span> <span id="s23">It came first as a kind of prank, which we did as high school kids, a -- a bunch of us were -- you want the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: That happened in -- I believe in 1940 -- ’48 - ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: This is after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: After the war, yes, when -- a b-bunch of friends from our class was walking and we were walking town, and having a good time and we noticed there was an announcement about -- for a competition for sportswriters.</span> <span id="s28">The sport newspaper of Bucharest was trying to recruit -- hire, identify sportswriters and opened a competition.</span> <span id="s29">So a few of us said why not, let’s try.</span> <span id="s30">We were really kind of -- sensed that it’s not the best chance to give our names -- in addition to real names, and additionally didn’t know what the repercussion that have at school.</span> <span id="s31">So I invented the name and I took Cernea.</span> <span id="s32">And that kind of -- that was destiny kind of, I w -- I won the competition for the writing, then the -- the oral competition, I was offered the job.</span> <span id="s33">That changed a lot of things in my life, including the name.</span> <span id="s34">So this how --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So that’s how the name changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: -- I stayed with the name for a number of years until after I married, we decided to change it in the documents as well, because I married under the real name, but there was a lot of conflicts in -- in documents between the people calling me one way, the documents being different, having to explain everything [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: -- so this is how it changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: So your recollection as yourself as a child, especially during the war period is as Moishe, or Mose -- Moise -- Moisei --</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Well the diminutive name which my mother and everybody in the family used was Musi.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Musi.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Musi, which is M-u-s-i, written in Romanian.</span> <span id="s43">The name is not very frequent for men, but it’s quite frequent for girls, whose variant, you know, feminine variant of Musi is Musia.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: So we can find a lot of women called Musia.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: But I was Musi and my good old friends, since high school and before, who are still alive, those are -- call me Musi today.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Not Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Not Michael, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: No Michaels.</span> <span id="s51">And what was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: It was October 14, ‘31</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And you -- where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: In Balti.</span> <span id="s57">This is a famous town of the -- of the -- even more famous Yiddish song, Mein shtaitila Balti.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Right, it’s a great song.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: If you recall Mein shtaitila Balti, da, la, la, la, la, la, la, that song.</span> <span id="s60">It’s a beautiful song.</span> <span id="s61">It is spelled, if you need to know, B-a-l-t-i.</span> <span id="s62">It is in Bessarabia which at that time belonged to Romania.</span> <span id="s63">Then it passed.</span> <span id="s64">That is a territory between the rivers Prut and Dniester.</span> <span id="s65">And it changed state allegiance or ownership or belongingness al-along the centuries.</span> <span id="s66">When I was born it was part of Romania; in 1940 it was shifted back to Russia.</span> <span id="s67">And the Russian pronunciation of the town is Balti.</span> <span id="s68">Until 1917 - 1918, I think, the Russian revolution, it was part of Russia.</span> <span id="s69">So population there spoke Russian and the Jews spoke Yiddish, too, so my mother, who was born there and her family spoke Russian and -- and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s70">So they were all fluent in Russian and I learned the Russian, a bit of Russian from my mother, too so --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Now why were you born in Balti since your mother and father were living in Iasi?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Well Joan, you should know better how young mothers feel and behave.</span> <span id="s75">When my mother was pregnant, my father and mother lived in Iasi, which was a big city, apparently the second city of Romania at that time, over a hundred thousand people in the northeastern part of Romania, close to the border with Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s76">So Bessarabia was then part of Romania, and she decided to go to deliver in her mother’s house and be with the care of her mother, which was supposed to be even better than in the big hospital in Iasi.</span> <span id="s77">This is how I was born in Balti, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And did you go back and forth to Balti a great deal to see your grandparents, or other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: As a matter of fact, not.</span> <span id="s80">I believe I have one recollection, I don’t know whether I was four years old or so, that I was in Balti and I remember being on my grandfather’s lap on the f -- front part of his house.</span> <span id="s81">That I remember very clearly, and was confirmed by my mother, and some guy who was selling pickled apples, which was a specialty there, was passing by, and he -- I wanted and my grandfather stopped him and bought me the apple, which was very tasteful.</span> <span id="s82">I believe was the first time in my life, and the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And the last --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: And the last time.</span> <span id="s85">I never heard again about pickled apples.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: No, I’ve never heard [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yeah, in Romanian they’re called mere murate, mere murate.</span> <span id="s88">And I still have the plan to identify whether somebody knows how to do such things now.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So you can try it again, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Let’s talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yeah, but then I was again in Balti --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: -- that is the fullest ans -- fuller answer to your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when that part, which in the meantime became the Soviet Republic of Muldavia, during Soviet exis -- Soviet Union existence, became now the independent country of the republic of Moldova.</span> <span id="s97">And I -- with the help of an assignment from the World Bank, where I was working [indecipherable] in the 90’s, I made my way back to that place.</span> <span id="s98">I took a few days off from my formal mission to go back to Balti.</span> <span id="s99">And this is when I visited Balti, I believe it was ’94 or ’95.</span> <span id="s100">And so th-the place of my birth again, of course, totally changed and course the city was destroyed, the -- ravaged during the war.</span> <span id="s101">But I was there, and the part which was not fully destroyed, still existed, was a cemetery which I visited.</span> <span id="s102">So yes, I re -- retrieved my place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And you were able to see the grave of your great-grandfather, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: When I was -- that was one of ma -- my purposes, to see the grave of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s105">And that time, one of my cousin and his family were still living in Balti in ’94, they lived there.</span> <span id="s106">They went during the war, we kind of skipped over time, but anyway, they were, during the war put in camps, persecuted, some of -- many people in my family died in that period, in camps, of -- were killed, or died of typhus and other diseases, and -- in the camps.</span> <span id="s107">He was among those who survived.</span> <span id="s108">And after the war he went into the Russian army, when the army -- Russian army freed the people in the camp, and then even visited us in Romania.</span> <span id="s109">So we kept in touch with them during the war, and after the war, and now I had the chance, I went to see him and talked him into speaking up his own thoughts of leaving and moving to Israel.</span> <span id="s110">And indeed, two or three years later, they did move to Israel, and he passed away in Israel.</span> <span id="s111">But when I was in ’94, in Balti, he took me -- he and his wife Tiupa, who is still alive -- his name is Zioma Faerstein.</span> <span id="s112">Both of them took me to the grave of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s113">And I saw the grave, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s115">Let’s talk a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s116">What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Marcu.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Marcu.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Marcu, in fact, Marcu Leib Catz.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And that’s Leib, L-e-i-b.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: L-e-i-b, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s123">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: And Marcu you spell with a C.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: C, right.</span> <span id="s126">And what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: He was trained as an engineer.</span> <span id="s128">His training was electrical engineering in Romania of course, but he was also -- got for a specialization and went to France for a few months.</span> <span id="s129">But that -- the conditions were not very good in Romania for that specialty.</span> <span id="s130">Romania was an agrarian country, basically.</span> <span id="s131">So he shifted his work to the textile industry and worked as a engineer in textile industry, first for electrical engineering, but then he learned the master -- the engineering of textile work.</span> <span id="s132">So that was basically his profession as long as he was allowed to exercise it as a professional, after which he was eliminated.</span> <span id="s133">No, from among the profession, he was fired, sorry, not eliminated, but had to become a -- a merchant of textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: You know, the Jews were allowed to be merchants but not to be employed as professionals.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So was he employed in Iasi?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes, in Iasi, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Until 1939 or 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: I was going to ask, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah, when all the professional Jews were -- were, by law, fired from all places, so all of a sudden he became unemployed, as in fact I did, more or less the same time, although I was only what, eight, nine years old, because all the Jewish kids, by another law at the same time, were expelled from all the state schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: -- so you would -- you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: -- we shared -- we shared fates, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: T-Tell me what you remember about life in your home before the war.</span> <span id="s147">What -- what do you remember about your father, do you -- were you close with your father, did he spend time with you, or was that not typical at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, no, my father was a very warm person, loved me very much.</span> <span id="s149">I was his first born, so he invested himself a lot in me.</span> <span id="s150">And I loved him, and course he was a constant presence in my life, so to say th -- spiritual presence too, he gave me my religious education when I was a child, and my intellectual education he contributed very much because he was an intellectual, too.</span> <span id="s151">And -- and my mother was also an intellectual, she was trained as a pharmacist.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s154">They both, in fact, met in the university in Iasi, where they got to know -- came to know each other, then got married.</span> <span id="s155">And my mother was a pharmacist, she was well educated also in literature, which she loved, and was multilingual.</span> <span id="s156">Very bright woman, an extraordinarily strong presence in my life.</span> <span id="s157">And when I was unfortunate to lose my father in the late 60’s, after illness, which is due largely to the to the pogrom in Iasi, my mother lived until her -- close to her 90’s and she came to the States.</span> <span id="s158">I brought her to the States, in fact, and we had a very good time here.</span> <span id="s159">And therefore, she -- her presence in my life lasted until just 14 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Wow, that’s fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And it was a very presence -- a very strong presence.</span> <span id="s162">I owe -- I owe a very great deal to my mother for all I have done and for the way I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: For my values, so it was a very tight family life.</span> <span id="s165">I have a brother, is -- that is part also of your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: His name is Zolly, Zolly Catz.</span> <span id="s168">His name is -- the Jewish name is Zollman.</span> <span id="s169">And he is -- carries the name of my grandfather of my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s170">Be -- I -- my name Moisei is -- Moisei is the name of my great-grandfather, also my mother’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: So as you see, my mother ruled the --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: It’s very --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: -- the name giving in the family.</span> <span id="s175">And she told me all -- all the stories I -- she remembered about her great -- her -- her grandfather was my grand --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Uh-huh, your great-grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: -- greatfather, yes, Moisei Baraz.</span> <span id="s178">So that was my mother, and I was very fortunate to have in our home, in addition to my brother and my parents, my grandmothers, on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Both sides?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: On both sides, until late.</span> <span id="s181">I mean, my grandmother on my father’s side, named Eva -- Chava was a s-strongest religious presence in the house, lived with us until the 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I knew also my grandfather on my father’s sti -- side.</span> <span id="s184">His name is Itic -- Itic.</span> <span id="s185">And he passed away when I was a child, but I remember him when they visited us, in a kind of cart with horses.</span> <span id="s186">I remember his very imposing -- both my grandfathers were very imposing Jews, tall, both tall, with gray beards, with payas --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Payas.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s189">So they hard to forget.</span> <span id="s190">And then my parents spoke very often with great reverence about their parents, so I know a lot about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: It was a tight family, close family, and -- and you know, I inherited the -- the -- the devotion to the idea of family from -- from my own parents’.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: So you must have had a fairly large home if you also had your two grandmothers there, or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Well, we had a large home by Romanian standards.</span> <span id="s195">It would be a -- a -- a [indecipherable] or a tight home by American standards --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: American stan --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s198">You know, is -- I slept with my brother in a room, or otherwise he sl -- I slept in the -- or he slept in the so-called living room which doubled o -- [indecipherable] living room, and in a corner had a bed for my -- one of my grandmothers, so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: -- I don’t complain, it was a good family life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: It was a good family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I wouldn’t say that my family was among the poorest families, Jewish families, no, because they were middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So you felt comfortable, not -- not deprived?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No, until -- on a -- only after -- until my father was employed --</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: -- then we had periods, long periods when my father did not make, you know, a salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Had to improvise, and to expose himself to very risky activities to -- to bring something on the table --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Home.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Seindel.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: It was her first name, Seindel?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Sein -- Seindel, yes, Seindel, and her name is in Jewish, yeah Seindel -- Shinya -- no, sorry, her Jewish name is Seindel, her -- the name by which everybody knew her and called her was the Russian diminutive of Seindel, which was Shanya.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Shanya.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Shanya, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: That’s very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Shanya.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Was it an --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: She -- she was pr -- very proud of her family name as a girl, which was half a century before modern feminist bent.</span> <span id="s223">And she always liked to call herself Shanya Faerstein Catz.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Catz.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: That’s interest --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: And this is what she wanted to be written on her gravestone and this is how I wrote on her gravestone.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Was it unusual for a woman to be so educated in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes, it was unusual, it was not frequent.</span> <span id="s230">But she was bright, she wanted to get educated.</span> <span id="s231">Her father was really enamored by her, her mother.</span> <span id="s232">She was his only child of her mother, who was the second wife of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s233">My grandfather had six children for his first marriage, and then his wife died, Chava died, and -- and he married my grandmother, Brana, who came from a -- a -- another little shtetl, Briceva, also there.</span> <span id="s234">Brana Baraz.</span> <span id="s235">And their only child was my mother, so it was a child, at old age you can imagine --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: -- how dear -- in fact, I have a -- a picture of my grandfather, imposing as he was, my -- my grandmother and my mother at the age of one year, where she looks like a doll, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s239">And we’ll see that picture later, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: As you wish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And in -- wh-when you remember back, in terms of your household.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Was it a happy household, was there a lot of discussion, were you involved with your parents and your grandparents?</span> <span id="s244">I mean how do you -- h-how do you picture it when you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: -- now I’m talking before the war, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: -- yeah, it was a happy household obviously, but it was not -- it was a Jewish household where you would have a fight and you would have some people screaming, and you have arguments.</span> <span id="s248">Was a whole hullabaloo, you know?</span> <span id="s249">I do remember arguments, too.</span> <span id="s250">I do remember my father getting upset and angry and you know, using strong words.</span> <span id="s251">He was a coyen and you know, the Kohanim are -- are traditionally seen as people who are easily irritable.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: You know, they have a short fuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I’m a coyen, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: So is that true of you, too?</span> <span id="s259">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, I’ve -- you know, going through so many cultures, I try to temper it -- that characteristic, but I wouldn’t say that I am alien to my heritage.</span> <span id="s261">So I inherited that too.</span> <span id="s262">But -- so it was a normal household, Joan, nothing very special, but an educated household where, you know, discussions were very often about politics, about broader issues and the daily life values.</span> <span id="s263">Sometimes philosophy, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: -- issues, political issues, tyranism, anti-Semitism, a lot of discussion the situation in Romania, the situation in Russia, whether Jews are doing better in Russia -- this was before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: -- and during the war what -- you know, a lot of discussion.</span> <span id="s268">My mother was involved early in the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s269">And she had connection there, so the matter came up and she -- I recall that she would go to reunions of the Zionist women of Iasi at that time, and she came back and brought and spoke to me about oranges who grow in Palestine.</span> <span id="s270">Yeah.</span> <span id="s271">And then sh -- they were also involved on the left of center activities, like many other Jews at that time were in Romania, but particularly my mother, coming from Russia had friends who were really enrolled in anti-Fascist, an-and communist underground, and they, in fact, used the friendship with my mother to ask her to give them shelter when they were pursued by the police.</span> <span id="s272">And -- and some of them slept and came and hid in our house and then disappeared as silently as they came.</span> <span id="s273">Only for us to recognize them -- and my mother, of course, she knew, but then sh -- after the war, when they emerged as political leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: And one of them even became a minister in gr -- Romania’s government, who was in hiding in my mother’s -- father’s home, brought by that -- the people.</span> <span id="s276">So it was -- to come back to your question, it was a house where political issues were discussed, and I -- I listened as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I can -- I was not a participant in those discussions.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Right, but clearly around the table --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: -- y-you were not told to leave --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No, no, no, I don’t re --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: -- you -- you certainly heard this.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: -- no, I don’t ever recall that I was sent to my toys, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Sent, yeah, to your room.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: When you said your f -- your father taught you religion --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: -- or religious traditions, religious values, how did he do that, what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, he was re -- a rel-religious person himself, he got the --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: -- very strong religious education for his father -- from his father.</span> <span id="s293">Went to the synagogue pretty often, not every day, but when he wouldn’t go to synagogue he will put tefillin in the morning and do the prayers at home every single morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: For years, yes.</span> <span id="s296">So on the holidays we go to the synagogue, all of us, I remember -- like it was one year -- you know, holiday I could play with the other kids for the entire day in the big courtyard of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s297">Coming in, when the Kohanim gave their blessing of -- for the congregation, something which doesn’t happen here unfortunately.</span> <span id="s298">It’s the only thing I am disappointed because the Kohanim here are not -- except for very Orthodox synagogues are not called on high holidays to give their blessing you know, for the -- for the congregation.</span> <span id="s299">So at that moment th-the prayer, even when I was small child, five, six, seven I was called in and I s-strained to hear and recognize my father’s voice because if you saw sometime the scene, the Kohanim are the front, then they say to the back, to the congregation which is behind them, and at a certain point they all turn around but they have their heads covered by the big talit -- talitim.</span> <span id="s300">And their hands, which are -- are covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Yes, expla -- explain that because some people who are watching this may not understand what you’ve just done with your hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well, the Kohanim are supposed to give a blessing on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur on the congregation.</span> <span id="s303">They -- there is a special text which is the blessing and which they have to pronounce when they give the blessing.</span> <span id="s304">The -- they have to keep their hands in a blessing movement, and the -- the way the hand have to be kept is to keep two fingers together on each hand, tight, and separated the two, and you keep your hand this way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: [indecipherable] I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Which is not very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Not everybody can do it.</span> <span id="s309">But the Kohanim are trained to do that.</span> <span id="s310">I’ll -- I can tell you how I was trained to do that.</span> <span id="s311">And he would then say the blessing and the long prayers, stay with the back of the congregation and when they have to say lvareh’ha adonai ve’ishmereha and so on, they turn around to the congregation and say that in loud voice.</span> <span id="s312">And this is when I was trained --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: -- straining to recognize the voice of my father, and to tell you frankly, honestly, it still rings in my ears when I think of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah, is really -- he was really yelling, and I was able to recognize, among the chorus of the voices.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So did he teach you things at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: So, as a child before Bar Mitzvah you are not supposed to do that, but after Bar Mitzvah you are [indecipherable] you have to po -- so, as part of the -- when it came time to be prepare for the Bat Mitzvah, there were terrible times already in Romania, the war started, the -- there was a massacre, the pogrom of Iasi to -- in ’41, and I was to be Bar Mitzvah’d in ’44.</span> <span id="s319">So from ’42, in fact, they took -- he took -- and my mother [indecipherable] for me a Melamed to teach me at home because -- I believe we are jumping history, you know, again, but after the pogrom I couldn’t go to the school so I stayed at home for a full year.</span> <span id="s320">The Melamed would come and teach me, and will teach me Hebrew and other things, but one of the things of those teaching was to keep my hand this way.</span> <span id="s321">And this was done very simple, anything body can do.</span> <span id="s322">Take a string and tie those two fingers together and those two fingers together --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And you separate --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: -- and then separate them.</span> <span id="s325">And do that several times and you’ll end up able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: -- to do it.</span> <span id="s328">And most people when they try, they do it this way, and they cannot, th-they tremble, and -- try it, you’ll s --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Right, it’s not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: It’s not easy, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: -- you -- you tend to think that you cannot do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: But you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: But you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: If you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: I’m afraid we have to stop and to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: What sort of friends did you have when you were a ki -- and I’m -- I’m really trying to distinguish if we can, before the war.</span> <span id="s344">Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends, did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?</span> <span id="s345">How do -- would you de-describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah, wi -- we live in several houses, my parents never owned a house, so we had to move every two, three years for rent purpose and for other things, so I remember some of our houses, and you know, you ca -- friendships depend on geographical location and on space patterns, so I -- I remember I had a very good friend, his name was Marcu Grunberg, in one house, which I terribly missed when we moved in another house and I kept looking for him years, and I found him again when I was in my 20’s or so -- looked for him.</span> <span id="s347">So there were some friends th -- this way then, in the last house we lived in the year before we went on refu -- or became refugees, I had some kids in the same courtyard, which was basically a Jewish courtyard with one Romanian family, and I befriended -- befriended also the girl in that family, who was about my age.</span> <span id="s348">So basically I had a mixed group of friends, I think.</span> <span id="s349">Most of them were Jewish, and then when I was thrown out of school and I resumed ler -- schooling after a year in a community, Jewish community school, of course all my friends were Jews, yeah.</span> <span id="s350">That was my childhood, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: All right, e-explain something to me, because yo-you -- you used a nomenclature that seems very typical in Europe, but not necessarily here.</span> <span id="s352">You said there were Romanians, and there were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: But you are Romanian, so why the nomenclature -- do you think this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Because in Romanian -- rom -- in Romania we were identified as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Not as Romanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Not as Romanian, Romanian was a second kind -- of course we were -- my father was Romanian citizens, we all were Romanian citizens, but we were the Jews of Romania.</span> <span id="s358">Here in the States, and you know, the American culture, you say always both, you know, Romanian Americans, or Jewish Americans, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: So -- but over there it was very distinct.</span> <span id="s361">So when I say Romanian, I mean non-Jews.</span> <span id="s362">They could be Romanian or even Hungarian people, and others, all kinds of national -- it didn’t matter to me at that time, the exact ethnic identification, but we knew who was Jewish and who was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s365">In fact, we were reminded very often that we are Jewish by those who were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And -- and how did it manifest itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: In all kinds of ways.</span> <span id="s372">In school you are known and remembered.</span> <span id="s373">We had the very clear identifier, the name.</span> <span id="s374">So being named Catz was from the very beginning a clear identifier to everybody, first the teachers, who knew that we are Jewish, and I’m Jewish, and many of the kids, who heard a lot of things about Jews and non-Jews in their families.</span> <span id="s375">It was -- no, yo-you need to understand also the background.</span> <span id="s376">Moldova, that part of Romania was heavily populated by Jews, and by the turn of the century, many townships in Romania and some bigger towns too, had -- a majority of their population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s377">So the presence was massive, there was always an issue, and in Romania when I lived, it was the second town of Romania, and by that time it was almost half -- a little bit less than half of the population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s378">I read documents which said at a certain point in time, the beginning, turn of the century or [indecipherable] before, the Jewish population exceeded a little bit, 50 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: This is in Iasi?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: In Iasi, yes.</span> <span id="s381">So that made everybody conscious and clear who it is and who isn’t.</span> <span id="s382">The heavily populated Jewish areas are almost homogeneously Jewish.</span> <span id="s383">Ours was not, we were a bit farther away from the massive Jewish concentration of Iasi.</span> <span id="s384">But our courtyard had still a majority of Jewish people, even though our house was very close to the most important chur -- cathedral in -- in Iasi, the Mitropolea, Mitropolea, which was a very important, the most important religious place, Christian religious place.</span> <span id="s385">So this explains my reference, Joan.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: But it must have been more comfortable in Iasi because there was such a complement of Jewish people, where it’s almost 50 percent, if not more at certain times.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, you can reason this way --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Or maybe not?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: -- the question wa -- the question is whether that was real what happened.</span> <span id="s392">In fact, the presence of many Jews made it easier for the ideologically anti-Semites to build their entire propaganda and advocacy ag -- against Jews, that here is a population which is a parasitic population, which is oppressing us -- which was not true because they just didn’t have the political power -- which absorbs our economic resources.</span> <span id="s393">Which again was false because the Jews being in economic activities were the -- in fact the engine of -- of many activities and facilitating.</span> <span id="s394">They were not land owners, or maybe large land owners never Jewish.</span> <span id="s395">But they facilitated the trade between agricultural sector and the urban consumers.</span> <span id="s396">And so -- so the number made it easy to mount a very strong chauvinistic, anti-Semite attitude for those who wanted to exploit that.</span> <span id="s397">Not everybody bought that on the Romanian side.</span> <span id="s398">Some did not buy.</span> <span id="s399">Not every single Romanian was anti-Semite, but there was a long tradition of anti-Semitism in Romania.</span> <span id="s400">The literature is replete with description of Jews in a very negative way.</span> <span id="s401">You know, the Jidan was the equivalent of Kike, and this was thrown very liberally to everybody.</span> <span id="s402">Not liberally in the positive sense, but very easily to everybody as an insult.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Is -- you know, go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s405">I mean, I know that -- the existence of Palestine I learned from the curses which were thrown at me as a child.</span> <span id="s406">When I came home and asked my mother, what is Palestine?</span> <span id="s407">So in that time there were boys who knew that and say you don’t have a place here, and use that.</span> <span id="s408">So this accounts for the distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Was this hard on you as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I-It was something which was intended as a humiliation.</span> <span id="s411">And when you are a child and you are cursed, everything which is accepted as a curse is -- becomes a curse.</span> <span id="s412">So yes, you were -- you were -- you felt very bad, and insulted and all of a sudden kind of sad that’s you are -- you are something totally different and base.</span> <span id="s413">That was, again, in the context of literature which described Jews often as -- as evil.</span> <span id="s414">There is now a book, a very interesting book, written by a -- somebody in Romania, a Sociologist who is Jewish [indecipherable], “The Image of the Jew in the Romanian Culture.”</span> <span id="s415">The book is that thick.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Because there is a lot to write about the image of the Jew in the literature, in poetry, in -- in paintings, in design, in -- in all -- all the means of arts.</span> <span id="s418">The -- very unfortunately, the main poet of Romania, Mihail Eminescu was really a very great, romantic poet.</span> <span id="s419">In his political philosophy he was very reactionary on various grounds, including being an anti-Semit -- Semite.</span> <span id="s420">And he wrote -- well, his poetry is beautiful and everybody can enjoy it, and -- and really feel the emotion and identify with the poetry.</span> <span id="s421">His article, because he was also a j -- a journalist, were replete with base, evil reasoning, which are a shame.</span> <span id="s422">In fact for him, now as you look at him in retrospect, and for -- very unpleasant and uncomfortable for Romanian culture, but it’s a fact.</span> <span id="s423">This is how -- so however the reputation of his poetry somehow gave more weight to -- to the evil political reasoning, and that captured too, a lot of minds.</span> <span id="s424">So anti-Semitism has been a -- a big problem in Romania, and Romania is not -- has not expurged even today, yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: When you were a -- when you before --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Despite all the changes which Romania has gone --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Gone through.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: -- and all the progress --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: -- and now moving to a totally different pass, a democratic pass, anti-Semitism, paradoxically, despite the small number of Jews who are still there, is still visible, yes.</span> <span id="s431">Not so widespread, certainly not as of -- official pol -- policy or ideology, definitely not so, but still present.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s433">When -- when you were a kid, di -- there were special things in school that you liked.</span> <span id="s434">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: You have to ask me what school, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Okay, which school?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s438">I started school in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s440">And you were seven then?</span> <span id="s441">Six?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yeah, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Seven, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Seven, yes, seven, exactly seven.</span> <span id="s445">But two years later, in 1940, by decree of government, all Jewish children were expelled from state schools.</span> <span id="s446">And therefore I had to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s447">The community had to create in a hurry, school for all this mass -- big mass of children who were suddenly all expelled.</span> <span id="s448">I -- so my first recollections are from the school where I went together with other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: All kind of children, like any school in my district.</span> <span id="s451">From that school I have very good memories too, about little kids.</span> <span id="s452">I felt good, I didn’t feel bad in the school, on the contrary.</span> <span id="s453">But I have one scene.</span> <span id="s454">We had the most beloved teacher we had -- we had two teachers.</span> <span id="s455">In elementary school you don’t have many teachers.</span> <span id="s456">One was particularly loved by everybody.</span> <span id="s457">And we didn’t know why, but in a -- one good day, a gang of people with green shirts, leather bands, and came and simply pulled him out of the classroom, beat him in front of us, and turned and pull him away and we are left without our teacher.</span> <span id="s458">It was -- this was Iron Guard, as I learned afterwards.</span> <span id="s459">He apparently was a democrat.</span> <span id="s460">I don’t know what his political -- I didn’t know what that political al-allegiance.</span> <span id="s461">And they knew of that.</span> <span id="s462">And he was a very good teacher, that’s the only thing I knew, but they did not hesitate to come and pull him and beat him in front of the children and took him away.</span> <span id="s463">And I never saw him --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: They beat him in the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: In the classroom, in front of the children.</span> <span id="s466">This was the Iron Guard, thugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: That must have been really scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Oh, I -- I don’t forget it, I cannot forget it to this day.</span> <span id="s469">I -- I know the name of the teacher was Motas, Constantin Motas.</span> <span id="s470">I mean, that moment seared him in my memory forever, more than even his being a beloved teacher -- beloved teacher.</span> <span id="s471">Could have remembered him anyway, or forgotten him, but that made him unforgettable to me.</span> <span id="s472">And the Iron Guard persecuted a lot of Romanian intellectuals.</span> <span id="s473">In fact, the Iron Guard, which was the Fascist party, the Nazi party of Romania, even killed the -- the most -- the highest reputed scholars of Romania, the -- a scholar of international reputation, who was an historian, Byzantineologist, history of Byzanthe -- Byzantine Empire.</span> <span id="s474">And he was a democrat, a liberal, western oriented, French oriented, not German and Nazi oriented.</span> <span id="s475">They knew of that.</span> <span id="s476">He was also a politician.</span> <span id="s477">They simply pulled him out, and -- one night from his house when they were fighting for power, took him in a forest near Bucharest and shot him to death.</span> <span id="s478">It was a uproar in the entire country and in -- in the world, because he was highly respected scholar internationally.</span> <span id="s479">So the fact that they pulled an elementary school teacher was not -- as I learned more, was not an isolated event.</span> <span id="s480">They were fighting the democrats in the -- in Romania.</span> <span id="s481">And not only the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s483">And what was his name, that scholar?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: That scholar was Nikolai Iorga, Iorga.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I-o-r-g-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: When you went home after seeing your teacher beaten, did you talk to your parents about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: I was scared --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: -- tha -- everybody ask what happened, and I told them, and the mother didn’t know at first what happened, but then she understood, and a few days we didn’t go to school, we didn’t have a teacher.</span> <span id="s495">And when -- and then we had somebody, but I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s496">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s497">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s498">I tried asking --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: But you have ne -- never found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Never found out.</span> <span id="s501">And that’s all I knew about his name, but [indecipherable] hear laters on, but no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s502">He did not reappear to the school, and next year I -- I went to another school, closer to home.</span> <span id="s503">As a matter of fact, the other school I was registered for my second class was the school of a monastery which was close to us.</span> <span id="s504">They had a school, and their name was Trei Ierarhi, which exists still in Miaj.</span> <span id="s505">Beautiful church, nicely painted.</span> <span id="s506">And they also had the school, it was not a confessional school, it was a, you know, secular school, but it was on the grounds of that and because it was close, I was given there, registered there, and I learned there.</span> <span id="s507">My mother -- my parents were not, you know, how to say, so closed [indecipherable] oriented to give me only -- and to register me only on -- on a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s508">But I -- I was there part of the year and then I was expelled.</span> <span id="s509">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And you were expelled in 1940, or 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: 1940, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: So, after the attack on Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: That was in ’39, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: The -- when the law came, I don’t recall exactly when the law for expelling the children came back, it was a state law.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: The good thing about that, because it was a good thing in -- in -- which I didn’t realize at that time, of course, the community mobilized itself to create schools, and created schools in synagogues.</span> <span id="s522">And when I resumed school, which was one year later because it was also the -- the pogrom and the massacres started, the war started, and I lost a si -- a year, I went on the last to the improvised school to finish my education.</span> <span id="s523">And what was a good thing is that not only the children who are expelled, but all the Jewish teachers were expelled from all the state schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: So the community had a good supply of very good teachers, and they were very good teacher, maybe among the best.</span> <span id="s526">So we -- we had, all of a sudden, a very good complement of teachers in those improvised schools in synagogues.</span> <span id="s527">So th -- they were not only the only good teachers.</span> <span id="s528">As I said, my teacher, the Motas was not Jewish, clearly was a good teacher himself, very good, I loved him.</span> <span id="s529">But then we had, and I realized later on how good my teachers were, because I continued in -- you know, beyond elementary school.</span> <span id="s530">And I realized they were all one and one.</span> <span id="s531">As a matter of fact, when things changed in Romania after the war, some of those people who taught elementary school or high school kids, turned out to be, in fact, scholars of high capacity in Romania, mathematicians who were recognized immediately and made into university professors.</span> <span id="s532">Yes, yes, immediately after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Including Minyash, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Do you remember your parents talking about Nazis, talking about Iron Guards?</span> <span id="s538">Because Iasi becomes, when Antonescu takes power, Iasi is considered the capital of the Iron Guard, which sounds really ominous.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yeah, it was -- of course a topic of discussion.</span> <span id="s540">We didn’t call them all the time the Iron Guard, in Romania this is Garda de Fier.</span> <span id="s541">But they called -- called them the Legionari, legionnaires.</span> <span id="s542">And it was a full -- how to -- how to protect ourselves from them, how to avoid them.</span> <span id="s543">I -- we knew where there was the building where they had their headquarters.</span> <span id="s544">It was, as a matter of fact, not far from our house, on a major street of Iasi, which was called Stefan cel Mare, which is, you know, the name of a Romanian king.</span> <span id="s545">And this is where they had their headquarters, and of course called cuibue, the nest of legionnaires.</span> <span id="s546">And I tried always to not walk on that side of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: To walk on the other side.</span> <span id="s549">Other times, later, when they were defeated by Antonescu, it still remained a building with all kind of political -- with -- and there was a flag hanging on there, including this flag with a swastika.</span> <span id="s550">I -- anyway.</span> <span id="s551">This -- yes, of course.</span> <span id="s552">So the answer to your question is the discussion we were aware of the [indecipherable] were aware of their campaign.</span> <span id="s553">It was a matter of parents training children to not go on that street, to pass away, to avoid them, to not look into their eyes, to -- when you see, if you can turn around, go turn around.</span> <span id="s554">If you cannot go on the other side of the sidewalk and avoid them because they can hit you again.</span> <span id="s555">As it happened, I mean it happened to me, I was beaten -- beaten up, but you know, the -- the discussion was constant.</span> <span id="s556">We were aware, it was -- as we came closer and closer to the war, and as I became more and more conscious, that was a per -- constant concern.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Were you conscious in 1939 of the attack on Poland at the time, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: My father was talking politics all the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: -- so we knew that the war started.</span> <span id="s561">When I really became conscious of that was when the stream of Jewish refugees from Poland came down south and went through -- came through Romania, and some of them tried to move further to the seaside to leave for Palestine.</span> <span id="s562">But some stayed in Iasi, and -- and created synagogues and Hassidim or Hassidim, and my father -- and a lot of them, I mean we knew it was convoys of refugees coming from Poland.</span> <span id="s563">Romania was not yet in war at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: That was ’39.</span> <span id="s566">And my father took me to one of those Hassidim’s synagogue [indecipherable] the rabbi and -- and I remember that visit because they prayed and then afterward they sang, and they started to dance.</span> <span id="s567">It was probably holiday, with a tune which I remember for years.</span> <span id="s568">I will not produce it now to you, but I remember the tune, I think I still remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Can you try?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I probably can, but it’s on video, so anyway -- but it was with -- was oh, you know, ta, ta ron, ton, ton-ton.</span> <span id="s571">It was a real nice tune, and at certain time it has -- it turn around and you start it again and start it again, and every time faster.</span> <span id="s572">And it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And you liked that.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s575">I did like it, yes, I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Do you think -- I know you -- you probably didn’t know it at the time but maybe your mother told you after the war, did they talk about leaving, or was that not a possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s578">The -- as I told you, the my -- my mother was Russian -- well, I mean, not Russian, w-was educated in -- her childhood in Russia, so she knew Russian literature very well.</span> <span id="s579">As a matter of fact, later on in life, she had to make a living out of her knowledge of Russian and of Russian literature and Russian language, so she took a second degree in -- in the 50’s in Romania and became a teacher before my father ma -- was already in and didn’t have a job and she had to sustain the family.</span> <span id="s580">And wi -- she went back to -- to school at the university and studied for four years.</span> <span id="s581">I mean part time, but took all the exams, because she already had a -- a diploma, university diploma, and became a qualified teacher of Russian, and knew a li -- Russian literature.</span> <span id="s582">So her friends -- there were a number of friends who were, you know, who thought that everything in Russia is fine, and considered living in Russia.</span> <span id="s583">Some considered leaving for Palestine, other for Russia.</span> <span id="s584">So discussion about -- some, in fact, left for Russia, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s585">In 1940 when -- when Russia took that part back, with Hitler’s support, the people who were born in Russia had permission by law from Romanian authorities to emigrate in Russia.</span> <span id="s586">And some of my parent’s friend did, and lost their life soon thereafter, and after everything.</span> <span id="s587">So they discussed, I mean, other friends of my family, the family Gluckman, also the lady was a classmate of my mother, and a good friend.</span> <span id="s588">They also considered, but they decided to leave for Palestine.</span> <span id="s589">And they did, and they were so smart.</span> <span id="s590">They left, they escaped the life, and my good friend, childhood friend Irma left with them, and grew in Palestine, then in Israel, was trained there.</span> <span id="s591">Then went to tea -- to study at Berkley, and became an economist.</span> <span id="s592">And years later, when both her parents, whom my mother retrieved by correspondence after the war, they reestablished contact, but both died and my mother lost contact again.</span> <span id="s593">In 1970, by -- absolute by miracle, when I was, for the first time invited to the United State, to that think tank at Stanford for my -- because I wa -- the [indecipherable] Romania arriving there the first day, the second day, I was told there is a Romanian lady scholar, an American -- sorry, an American scholar who was born in Romania, who is also the same roster of fellows.</span> <span id="s594">And do you want to meet her?</span> <span id="s595">Why not?</span> <span id="s596">So she came, she introduce her, she told me her name Irma Adelman, I told her my name, we started to discuss, and she said she is from Romania, childhood and so on.</span> <span id="s597">And that started triggering my memory.</span> <span id="s598">I said, “Ar -- Irma, you said Irma, right?”</span> <span id="s599">“Yes, Irma.”</span> <span id="s600">“By any chance, could it be possible that your maiden name was Gluckman?”</span> <span id="s601">I mean, she was dumbfounded.</span> <span id="s602">It was like stricken by -- it was my actual first day in the Center for Behavioral -- Advanced Studies and Behavioral Sciences.</span> <span id="s603">The highest reputed think tank for social scientists in the U.S., she was there a fellow.</span> <span id="s604">I arrived much later because the Romanian government would not allow me to go in time, and it’s another story.</span> <span id="s605">But in the first time -- day of meeting -- telling her, she said, “[indecipherable] how do you guess that?”</span> <span id="s606">“So I said, if you are that, I am your childhood playmate.</span> <span id="s607">Do you remember the name of Musi?</span> <span id="s608">Musi Catz?”</span> <span id="s609">She looked, “Yes, of course I remember.”</span> <span id="s610">And -- and this is how I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s613">And -- and she is one of the foremost economists of the United States, I mean, is extraordinarily accomplished in her field, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s615">We’re going to have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s620">Michael, what was the statistical possibility here of the two --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, you know, the -- Irma’s husband was a ph -- ma -- physicist, and -- who took the year off to accompany her to the think tank, to the center.</span> <span id="s622">And everybody was so stunned.</span> <span id="s623">And he thought to calculate the statistical chance, likelihood, in fact for us to meet after so many years, with names changed, and factor in also the fact that it’s different country, different profession, she’s an economist, I’m a sociologist, and that that think tank has a pattern of one year roster, so we could have been on two different years and just go like the stars in the night and never met -- meet again.</span> <span id="s624">And he calculated statistical probability of that to actually happen, and he came up with a number like that, and show it to everybody, so all -- there are a lot of scholars there, and everybody was amazed on that.</span> <span id="s625">So all of a sudden from my second day I became a -- a cause celebrity.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: All -- but it was also good because I was coming at that time from Romania, the -- the managers of the center knew me.</span> <span id="s628">Some of the people who knew my work and invited me knew, but all the others didn’t know anything and -- and knew that I’m coming from Romania, who am I?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: All of a sudden there was a friend, a recognized person of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: -- who -- who vouched for my family, for who -- I am where I’m coming from, so I felt all of a sudden so well in that center.</span> <span id="s633">That year in the center was a marvelous year, and influenced the -- the rest of my life, Joan, for all my work subsequently in the States, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Well let’s go back now.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: 1940 is a very pivotal year in -- in Romania, and I don’t -- Antonescu takes over, he signs an agreement with the Germans and by 1941 he’s going to be part -- Romania will be part --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yes, right, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: -- of the attack on Russia.</span> <span id="s639">Do you feel this as a kid?</span> <span id="s640">As -- 1940 is there -- is there a big change as you see it, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I -- what I recall from 1940 is that shift from the -- the fact that I was expelled from the school, and that my father lost his job suddenly, and he wouldn’t go any more to -- he -- he was an engineer in a textile factory.</span> <span id="s642">And all of a sudden he would be at home, and not go to his work.</span> <span id="s643">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: And was that because of the anti-Semitic legislation that came up in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah, that was, yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s648">The other thing, not immediately after, but the end of ’40 - ’41, they were clearly more military in tone.</span> <span id="s649">So this what I remember.</span> <span id="s650">That was -- he was very grim, kind of heavy, and we were increasingly worried about what might happen, what might happen.</span> <span id="s651">In Romania there is a, I would say [indecipherable] fear really, it was a -- the epitome of worrying, what can the future bring us.</span> <span id="s652">And this what I recall.</span> <span id="s653">Nothing else, but this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: -- describes to you the atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Do you n -- you didn’t hear any words about concentration camps that were in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: -- and people weren’t talking -- I g -- I suppose people couldn’t imagine what could possibly happen anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: I don’t recall --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: -- anything of that [indecipherable] I cannot say that they wouldn’t talk, or some would not --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: -- speculate, but I -- I have no recollection of that, and I don’t think anybody at that time was aware or -- or could anticipate what was likely to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Now, when your father’s off of work, is your mother still working?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: My mother wasn’t working, she was a -- she was a pharmacist by training, but she worked very little in the beginning of her -- after i -- after the marriage, her marriage [indecipherable] but then she didn’t practice pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: So she was, you know, keeping the house and my father was making an income.</span> <span id="s670">When -- when he lost the job, there was no context in which she could found -- find work.</span> <span id="s671">Had she been employed she would have been eliminated as well, so no.</span> <span id="s672">And my father quickly had to make some living and what they did was to transform the front room of our house with the exit -- with the entrance, into a store.</span> <span id="s673">And to have a number of shelves built.</span> <span id="s674">And my father bought a few pieces of textiles, you know, to sell.</span> <span id="s675">But that was an improvisation because our home was not in a commercial district, nobody would come there.</span> <span id="s676">In addition our home was somewhere in the middle of a courtyard, it was not at the street.</span> <span id="s677">So nobody could see it, all passersby on the street wouldn’t no -- see nothing, just a big gate and the entrance to a big courtyard.</span> <span id="s678">So we had that in the front and he will go in the -- the commercial center, talk to one merchant, to another and then possibly from time to time bring somebody, pull somebody to our home.</span> <span id="s679">And that was always an event.</span> <span id="s680">So what happened, would he buy anything?</span> <span id="s681">And he became an intermediary in a way between people who had various textiles.</span> <span id="s682">He was a specialist engineer, he had more knowledge about those fabrics than the usual merchants of them, and how they are produced.</span> <span id="s683">And he would intermediate buying and selling because the commercial quarter still was alive, those people were not expelled, they were their own shops, and Iasi was a big city and there were a lot of people coming and buying their textiles, their, you know, clothes.</span> <span id="s684">By that time they were not ready made clothes, and they would buy everything from cotton for shirts to -- to fabric for -- for trousers, to heavy coats and so on.</span> <span id="s685">So that was a very lively area.</span> <span id="s686">I know it because when I started to go through to school, I had always to cross that street, that long street, which was called Colonel Langa.</span> <span id="s687">So I know, and even before that, my father would take me sometimes and keep me by hand and we go from shop to shop and he will ask, do you need that, do you need that, you know?</span> <span id="s688">There is somebody who has such a thing, would you like to buy?</span> <span id="s689">He carried some kind of briefcase with samples, simply to make a living, because by having a small commission from mediating a sale, he would get a small commission, and that was a livelihood.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And were you okay, I mean can you -- could your parents afford the rent?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, there was -- th-th-there -- there was strain at that time, there was [indecipherable] you know, the -- there’s a concept in Yiddish, parnasa, which means making a livelihood, you know.</span> <span id="s692">Th-There I learned that term, and that is a cen -- there was, at least at that time, a center concept in -- in the effis of -- of Jews, and whether they were able to make a living or not, because it was a matter of -- of making a living.</span> <span id="s693">So, do you have a parnasa, what’s your parnasa, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Good parnasa, and it’s like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: When is your brother Zolly born?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: In ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yes, May eighth, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: So that added a burden in a way, I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: It -- very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: The moment was not the best choosing by my parents, but it happened, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s704">In ’38 the situation was different in Romania.</span> <span id="s705">So, he was born in ’39, and you know, was not aware of what was around him except he does remember, I -- I checked to him, as it happens he is visiting with us this very week, so I checked him and he has this -- th -- the -- even at two years, he remembers the pogrom and what happened to him at that time.</span> <span id="s706">But nothing else.</span> <span id="s707">However, I -- I know that he didn’t have good years in his childhood.</span> <span id="s708">The war, the first years were --</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: His is the whole childhood, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s711">But the whole, he was -- you know, the end of the war was in ’45, and then the situation started to improve.</span> <span id="s712">And he was -- at that time he was six, so it was better times.</span> <span id="s713">But the first six year were really bad, really bad.</span> <span id="s714">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Do you remember the attack on Russia?</span> <span id="s716">Was there an announcement that the Romanian army is going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes, there was an announcement, yes, yes, yeah, yeah, there was a big announcement, very dramatic announcement of Marshall -- Marshall Antonescu, was broadcast all over when it happened, on the radio, on the, you know, public speakers and so on, everybody heard it, and the war started, the -- before that, the town was already full of military, it was obvious to everybody, imminent that something will start sooner or later because the city of Iasi was at 19 kilometers, which is equivalent of about 11 miles from the border with Bessarabia, which by now was Russia already.</span> <span id="s718">And when you have so much might, army in town, the Romanian and German, you don’t have to be too smart to -- to know that something will happen.</span> <span id="s719">So then he said the famous four words, “Va ordon treceti Prutul!”</span> <span id="s720">Which means, you are or -- I order you, cross the Prutul, the river, which is the border.</span> <span id="s721">That remained in -- in the Romanian folklore, almost as a -- as a prototype of a dramatic order.</span> <span id="s722">It’s -- that I remember, that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Do you remember his signing the agreement with Italy and Germany, bef -- before this, this is a -- I don’t think -- I think it’s November of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Was there as big an --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: There was -- I don’t -- I don’t remember knowing at the time how things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: That there was an agreement between Germany, and imposed in Romania because Romania, although was gravitating to the Germans, moving away from the traditional allegiances to the -- to France and to England, to the western Europe, and moving to the Germans, it was a process.</span> <span id="s729">But I was not aware of the politics or the process, but I was aware when that big thing happened at Bessarabia was moving back to [indecipherable] then when Transylvania was lost, also by Hitler’s dictate, everybody talked about that.</span> <span id="s730">You know, the Romanian map became so distorted by that, totally different from -- from a round piece to something which looked like a big parenthesis.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Shaved on the east, shorn of a big piece all the way to the heart of the country, given away to another country, to Hungary, so -- so everybody -- it was a national trauma at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: So I knew that something very bad happened.</span> <span id="s735">I didn’t know the mechanics, the politics of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: But now, very few days after the attack on Russia --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: -- there’s something that’s going to start in Iasi which is extremely shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: So tal-talk about what it is you remember as a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I remember there was -- the Iasi -- the ci -- the city was f -- the city was full -- [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Is that you?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, I have right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: All right, we were going to -- you were going to start to talk about what you remember about the pogrom, which happened days after the attack on Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes, well we were in our home, I mean all of us at home, the war started and everybody was frightened to death.</span> <span id="s748">There was some bombing on -- on the town in the first week of the war.</span> <span id="s749">N-No big damage, I mean no damage at all in our area.</span> <span id="s750">They might have fallen some other places, but as I recall, the newspapers didn’t report any major damage from those bombing done by the Russians.</span> <span id="s751">However, those bombing were used as one of the pretexts to justify what became the -- that -- the pogrom, the massacre of the Jews of Iasi.</span> <span id="s752">Just one week after the war started, it was a Sunday, it was -- the war started on June 22nd, that was June 29th, we were on the house and we saw that there are columns of people moving on the street.</span> <span id="s753">We saw -- we had a view through the gate of the courtyard into the street, and you could see a narrow corner.</span> <span id="s754">We saw they were moving, we didn’t know were [indecipherable] but they recognize there were Jewish people in those columns, so we understood that something bad happened, and we’re all kind of huddled.</span> <span id="s755">And sure enough, very soon, a group of individuals came in.</span> <span id="s756">There’s some military, some police, some civilians, started knocking this first -- go -- a couple of them, two, three, went to each one of the houses in the courtyard, and they started knocking the door, came to us, entered the house, opened -- pulled the door, entered the house and said, “Out, out, all Jews out, all Jews out.”</span> <span id="s757">And violently pulling everybody from -- from the house away.</span> <span id="s758">This is when -- a moment which is remembered even by my brother, happened, as I mentioned before, in our house lived both grandmother’s.</span> <span id="s759">My grandmother on my mother’s side, was a short woman, rather heavy woman, and very religious, if I said that, really she was a -- a bearer of religion, she imposed on my mother to be very kosher for her, nothing was kosher enough, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s760">And she had speaking [indecipherable] she would berate my mother often for -- for -- this is relevant, I’ll tell you why it is relevant, for not being kosher enough.</span> <span id="s761">So she was heavy, she was ill, and she was laying in bed, really laying in bed.</span> <span id="s762">And they were pull -- and they saw that woman is laying in -- in bed.</span> <span id="s763">So they say, “Out, come out.”</span> <span id="s764">She barely spoke Romanian, but she wasn’t able to move.</span> <span id="s765">So -- so one of them, very angry, went and -- and caught her by the hair and pulled.</span> <span id="s766">And there the hair came off.</span> <span id="s767">Because she was wearing a wig as a very, very Orthodox woman.</span> <span id="s768">And the guy wa -- and the guy said -- and -- and this is what my -- my brother remembered because he was two years, and sh -- he told me, down in there, he was so scared, saying that he -- he pulled all her hair.</span> <span id="s769">And -- and you know, my father was begging and praying, she’s ill, she’s very heavy, she’s very old, please, please forgive her, let her be there, she cannot move.</span> <span id="s770">They tried to pull her, but she was too heavy.</span> <span id="s771">And they realize that she will be unable to move into the column, so they left her in the bed, and pulled us, all of us.</span> <span id="s772">Fortunately they didn’t shoot her on the spot, but this is why it was relevant that she was very Orthodox, and -- and we were pulled, put in the columns, and then the column started moving, slowly, slowly, because it was s-s-stopping at every next courtyard, and waiting for the Jews of that courtyard to be pulled.</span> <span id="s773">And the next courtyard was -- a friend of mine was living, a very good friend, Nuni Steinberg, who -- his family was pulled and -- and brought in our back, and put into the column.</span> <span id="s774">And so it was until the -- our entire street, that was street Colonel Langa, on which we lived, came to the main street.</span> <span id="s775">The main street had been already combed by prior groups, so once we got to the main street, we simply marched, were marched further, we didn’t have to stop because from the main street on, the place were already judenrein.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: They had already shot Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No, they sh -- cha --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Oh, they just moved them?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Shot, or -- or moved them.</span> <span id="s780">Not all shot on the -- they -- so we moved.</span> <span id="s781">But with us was my brother.</span> <span id="s782">We had all to -- to go with hands up when we moved.</span> <span id="s783">When we stayed, they allowed us to keep the hands down, but when we moved, we had to -- and my brother was two years old, so he couldn’t move, a child of two years, so my father put him on his shoulders.</span> <span id="s784">And my father was supposed to keep I -- hi -- hands up, and they little boy keep -- kept.</span> <span id="s785">And I remember him, I -- that image I see him, and he remembers, si -- was staying on his father’s shoulders with his hands up, like everybody else in the column.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So he was sitting on his shoulders with the legs down on --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Legs, right, right, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: The legs here, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: -- [indecipherable] and with his little --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: With his hands up.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: -- little hands up.</span> <span id="s794">And this is how we were marched.</span> <span id="s795">Then as we were marched, they saw corpses on the street, and we --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You did see corpses?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yeah, we did see corpses on the street here and there, kind of people who obviously didn’t move, dead or -- or mortally wounded, who knew, were -- we -- er -- people in the column were beaten, I mean they were forcibly marched, screamed at.</span> <span id="s798">People screamed from the sidewalks who were not in the columns, [indecipherable] the inhabitants, insults and so on, and were moved there, and whoever was old was pushed, and you know, there -- the rifle, the butt of the rifle pushed and -- and hurried to advance faster.</span> <span id="s799">As a -- and we were shepherded toward the headquarters of the police in Iasi.</span> <span id="s800">As we approached that -- that place, we noticed there were columns coming from different other directions, cause you had to pass a -- a square, a big square and that was on the other side of the square.</span> <span id="s801">So we -- really that happened from all parts, and there were -- so the streets were full with columns.</span> <span id="s802">There was a -- a -- a lot of people, a crowd was on front of the big gate of the -- which was a big metal gate, a wooden gate, but closed, you couldn’t see inside the courtyard, but part of the gate was opened.</span> <span id="s803">So when we were brought in, our turn came, then they will be the triage, the selection.</span> <span id="s804">They kept all the men and the grown up boys, and sent women back with children.</span> <span id="s805">And as we arrived there, they pulled my father in, and they waved us all back.</span> <span id="s806">I was at that time, in ’41, was -- was I --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: -- nine and a half -- yes 10, almost 10, but I was a small kid at that time.</span> <span id="s809">Now I am taller, but I started to gr -- grow after 13, I had a tonsils operate and started to grow fast, but as a child I was a very small child, so at 10 I was still small.</span> <span id="s810">Other children, I mean boys of 13 - 14 - 15, some were sent back, some were kept.</span> <span id="s811">Then my father disappeared through the gate.</span> <span id="s812">I -- we didn’t see what happened to him.</span> <span id="s813">Later -- later I -- I learned what happened to him, and we were sent back.</span> <span id="s814">At that time my father passed my brother to my mother, and we were hurrying back.</span> <span id="s815">The coming back, in small groups not in column, was a real scare, enormous scare, and hellish because we were not in a column, only a small group.</span> <span id="s816">Everybody who was not Jewish knew what happened, and so, and there were people beating my mother, and my grandmother, who was with us.</span> <span id="s817">And my mother would -- would embrace Zolly, my brothers, and screaming all the time, copilul, copilul, please, we’re all c-copilul, protecting him.</span> <span id="s818">And I started to protect him too.</span> <span id="s819">And my hands was -- were beaten by, you know, the -- you -- sticks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: -- and -- and we are running and my poor grandmother was running with us.</span> <span id="s822">So we made it almost -- so this was really -- there -- by that time there were more corpses, I remember seeing more corpses laying on the streets, and blood here and there.</span> <span id="s823">And as we came close to our home, another gang of people stopped us all and collected us again, and said, “Wo -- how do you go?</span> <span id="s824">Where do you go, home?</span> <span id="s825">No, no, no, you should go to the police.”</span> <span id="s826">And -- and stopped and started to collect all the people who were coming back, who were only women and children, or elderly people, not men, including some other people from our courtyard.</span> <span id="s827">A family called Zilberman, with two girls older than I, Lidia and Mia, whom I knew very well, but they also stopped there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s828">And then the women started to beg and to pray, say, “We were at the police, please allow us to go home.</span> <span id="s829">They released us from the police.”</span> <span id="s830">“No, no, no, you are lying, you are escape.</span> <span id="s831">We’ll shoot you.”</span> <span id="s832">So they -- they made like they were about to shoot people, say, “You stand to the wall.”</span> <span id="s833">And then somebody came and say, “Leave them, let them go.”</span> <span id="s834">And all of a sudden they were let go.</span> <span id="s835">We were already close to home, so we ran home.</span> <span id="s836">And that happened to the family, that Zilberman family, and that other, but with all the men.</span> <span id="s837">In our house, in our courtyard there was another family, Barad, who was also a -- a merchant, and with a family lived there, and they had three sons.</span> <span id="s838">And it was only the lady who was released, and the two smaller sons, children.</span> <span id="s839">The father and the elderly son was retained, like my father.</span> <span id="s840">Well, what happened -- and I learned later, to my father, to everybody who was pulled there, was that they had to move through a -- I would say the gauntlet of people, you know, two rows of people, soldiers, policemens, [indecipherable] people with iron bars, with rubber truncheons, simply beat them with rifles, beat them bloody, then stepped on them.</span> <span id="s841">And they were forced to -- to pass through that, and to run, and move, move, move, while beating.</span> <span id="s842">Some fell, were trampled, others were hit.</span> <span id="s843">My father were -- was badly hit, and they ran, and in the back of the courtyard, thousands of people were already gathered.</span> <span id="s844">So they gathered the crowd.</span> <span id="s845">That I learned later.</span> <span id="s846">At home my mother was scared and concerned to death and said, “What will happen to Tata?”</span> <span id="s847">And what they believed, they are still very naïve, is that they are rounding up the Jews to send them to labor camp as labor.</span> <span id="s848">And she said, “But he left with nothing, I mean, with the clothes on him.</span> <span id="s849">Let me make something and see what I,” -- she was, as I told you, she was extraordinarily -- very courageous.</span> <span id="s850">She got in front of the mirror, dress herself with her best clothes [indecipherable] everything, put lipstick -- she was very pretty woman -- to look as elegant as possible, not Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s851">Made the bundle, a little -- with a -- with shirt, with a -- some -- some towels, soap, some medication, maybe a little package, to take and get to the police to be able to pass on to her husband so he has something where he is deported to a labor camp, because he didn’t have a shirt, nothing.</span> <span id="s852">And prepare them, you know, we are afraid and my grandmother say don’t go, her mother say don’t go, don’t go.</span> <span id="s853">She would say, “No, I have to go, I have to go.</span> <span id="s854">Nobody will recognize me, I will try to do, you know, and if then they will beat me, they will send me back, they retain only -- but I have to go, I cannot leave him.”</span> <span id="s855">And she was just about to go when my father appeared to the door.</span> <span id="s856">Bloodied, beaten, but appeared at the door of the house.</span> <span id="s857">What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Well, I think we have -- let’s wait til the next tape, and you’ll tell us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yeah, okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Cause we’re right at the end of this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Michael, I’m sorry about the interruption.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: We were -- we ended where your f -- your mother was going to try and go see your father and give him something.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: But sh -- he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yeah, she was ready with a little package, and bundle to -- to take, and he came back and -- beaten, full of blood here and limping.</span> <span id="s869">And he make -- and he kind of fell into the house and push her back, and say, “Stay, stay, don’t go.”</span> <span id="s870">“Wh-What is happening?”</span> <span id="s871">He was shocked to see her so elegantly dressed, but she -- what happened at the police, the police had a big courtyard, but as time passed, I mean, they start in effect the rounding up of Jews not only the 29th, but on the 28th in the evening, as I learned later -- we had no way of knowing, but later I learned that in fact on the 28th of th-the -- the -- of June, they also killed a lot of people in their homes and in their houses.</span> <span id="s872">In the 29th in the morning they were surrounding, and also killing, but o -- occasionally killing, mostly bringing them to the police.</span> <span id="s873">So as they brought column after column and -- and selected only the men, even the men were too many for the courtyard.</span> <span id="s874">So the courtyard became full brim -- full to the brim, they couldn’t push any more people in that.</span> <span id="s875">So people -- the column kept going -- they accumulated in front of the -- so something happened that they brought -- my father described that exactly.</span> <span id="s876">They pushed some -- brought a table, two chairs and two Romanians officers, with a paper and a stamp, and making a list, and s -- started to call people come.</span> <span id="s877">And whoever was in the front row started to move one by one.</span> <span id="s878">Say name, address and giving them a piece of paper, take it, with a stamp, that say he can go.</span> <span id="s879">Lieber, it was written in that.</span> <span id="s880">And that gave them the permission to go out of the -- so, going out was another difficult moment, they had to run because again were the beaters there.</span> <span id="s881">And people started to be freed from the -- the police to create room for others to enter.</span> <span id="s882">And that apparently lasted for some time.</span> <span id="s883">My father saw that, he tried to be in the front, push himself, ran [indecipherable] and was beaten down and got up and got -- he was on the side come -- as I said, you know, and finally he got the line to go and got the thing and came out.</span> <span id="s884">This is very relevant because as we also learned later from other people and the survivors, after awhile of giving those tickets to many people, not just to a few, to many, creating room, some German officers appeared there.</span> <span id="s885">They had a discussion with the Romanian officer, and they stopped giving out those things.</span> <span id="s886">From that moment they wouldn’t give any more.</span> <span id="s887">Those who got it, got it.</span> <span id="s888">That accredited idea, that those who got the ticket and gave the address were kind of hereby enlisted for the future collection for labor camp, or maybe they thought of deporting them, who knows?</span> <span id="s889">But -- but the others who are -- in the meantime, the day was over, s -- dark started to -- to come down, and the columns stopped too.</span> <span id="s890">And that -- that I haven’t seen, but I know from the stories.</span> <span id="s891">And my father was home, this is how my father was home.</span> <span id="s892">I am telling my family story, not what happened, but I explain how he got home.</span> <span id="s893">So when he got home, my mother told him and they understood immediately, they said, “You have to hide.</span> <span id="s894">Yo -- they have your name, address, they can come after you.</span> <span id="s895">You have to hide.”</span> <span id="s896">My mother remained -- undressed, dressed again normally.</span> <span id="s897">And next to our ho-house in that big courtyard was a kind of -- the land, I cannot say the word in English.</span> <span id="s898">In Romanian it’s a Ripa.</span> <span id="s899">It’s a kind of little valley with some stream and a little small lake, I mean [indecipherable] in the bottom.</span> <span id="s900">And that little valley had kind of this undulation going down, with a -- we used always in winter that valley this way to put our -- how do you call that?</span> <span id="s901">Sleighs.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Sleighs?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Sleighs, yes.</span> <span id="s904">And to go down, and every time we go here, jump, and they caught, you know, lots of speed and it was fun and the whole thing was to get down in high speed and to avoid the little water, the little lake where the -- otherwise you fall on your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: And it was -- this is what I -- I learned my mastery in conducting the sleighs.</span> <span id="s907">And it was very fun, and in the winter there was nothing but this -- this tops from the corn which was growing.</span> <span id="s908">In summer, however, that was all cultivated, it was fertile land, with corn.</span> <span id="s909">So the corn in June was already tall.</span> <span id="s910">So where could my father fall -- the -- my mother made some food for him, a piece of clothes to lay on the ground, and he immediately disappeared into the corn, because the corn tall, you know, and big and -- and have a -- and disappeared and didn’t see anything, and stayed there, hidden.</span> <span id="s911">And we were in the house.</span> <span id="s912">Indeed the nay -- night came, my father didn’t come back, he was hidden there, and sure enough during the night, we hear again beatings.</span> <span id="s913">I don’t know whether my mother slept or not, I sure did.</span> <span id="s914">And we heard heavy beatings, and then screams, th-the door was already kind of barricaded and strong, but we were afraid, we couldn’t resist, so immediately my mother called us.</span> <span id="s915">We were dressed.</span> <span id="s916">We were asleep, but I was dressed, and my brother was dressed.</span> <span id="s917">And again my -- my grandmother was in bed, but the other was mobile.</span> <span id="s918">And while they were beating in the front door, we exited through the back door.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Oh, when you say beating, you mean they were hitting the front --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Hitting, yes, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: -- hitting the front door, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: La -- ra -- yeah, beating the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Beating the door at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Trying to enter, and we heard immediately there were a big noise and they were beating the door, hitting the door and screaming, open, open, open.</span> <span id="s927">So we immediately -- what is?</span> <span id="s928">And we went down to the back of the house, which also had a door, looked [indecipherable] looked, nobody was there out of the group of the front, so we ran away through the back.</span> <span id="s929">And we ran to the back of the yard where there was that single Romanian family in the -- in the courtyard, who was Mihaescu, Mihaescu -- Mihaescu something.</span> <span id="s930">When I had my playmate, that girl, Coca.</span> <span id="s931">They were not very friendly with my mother and my father, generally speaking, not very pleasant, but they sheltered us.</span> <span id="s932">So they were a bit -- you know, now they’d be really rewarded for that.</span> <span id="s933">But they received us and we hid there.</span> <span id="s934">And we wouldn’t know what happened in the house.</span> <span id="s935">We were sure that my father hears the noise, because if -- he was in the corn, but not far, and hope he will not come out and they will not find him.</span> <span id="s936">And we stayed the whole morning, and in the morning my mother went first -- sent the neighbor and then went first, and found indeed the house -- the house -- the -- the front door was badly damaged, but they didn’t break in.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Oh, they didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: They didn’t break in and the -- they found the house.</span> <span id="s939">And then, slowly, we came back, and then my mother went onto the corn with more food to find my father.</span> <span id="s940">And she found him, with Marcu, Marcu, you know, s-slowly, she [indecipherable] found him, he heard all -- sh -- he was very happy hearing that everybody is fine.</span> <span id="s941">He kind of understood because those people could be overheard as they spoke, and -- and cursed, you know, that they didn’t catch us.</span> <span id="s942">He imagine what had happened.</span> <span id="s943">In short, he stayed there for three days and three nights.</span> <span id="s944">And my mother would go and bring him food and water and come back, and he would not come back into the house for the fear that they will come again and -- and pick up the men, or the people, whatever.</span> <span id="s945">So he slept on -- on the -- the ground because of cour -- and on the fourth day he first came o -- in the meantime we started to learn through voices and people that a lot of people didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s946">In our courtyard some came back, but others didn’t.</span> <span id="s947">In the family Barad, which I believe I mentioned, only the woman with two children came back, the man was -- and he didn’t ex -- ec -- access the -- the point to where they got the ticket.</span> <span id="s948">And I learned that a lot of people were killed in the courtyard of the police, and that others were taken to -- to the train station.</span> <span id="s949">Again, I didn’t know what happened, train station made it plausible that they were taken to some labor camp somewhere, to be -- as it turned out later, it was not a labor camp, but the -- the -- the si-situation a bit calmed in the sense that there were not gangs of people roaming the s -- the town to pull out the Jews.</span> <span id="s950">There were other things on their agenda because the war was already in the 10’s or 12’s or 13 days, you know, and the army broke through the Russian row -- armies -- and advanced, and all the news were very happy.</span> <span id="s951">The newspapers said, you know, the victory of that, and -- and it appeared that the interest in the Romanian Jews faded for the moment, it was felt.</span> <span id="s952">My father came, stayed in the house, didn’t go out for months, weeks, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s953">Kept me in the house, everybody stay, we -- the -- they exchanged food between neighbors.</span> <span id="s954">It was very, very little food; water we had.</span> <span id="s955">And this is how we passed the time after the thing.</span> <span id="s956">Then, only later on, we started news to percolate, or at least for me to learn that in the -- what happened, that people were put in the trains.</span> <span id="s957">And these were the famous death trains of Iasi, which became, you know, the equivalent of Nazi chambers on the wheels.</span> <span id="s958">There were box cars stuffed with Jews to the brim, cars which normally couldn’t take anything else but -- but, you know, bags and sacks and -- and freight.</span> <span id="s959">People were like sardines in a box, 150 - 200, I don’t know, but it was full.</span> <span id="s960">And all the boxcars were filled, and then they sealed the boxcars so the doors cannot be opened, and there is no air, and the train started to move and to go in a direction nobody was told.</span> <span id="s961">But in fact, they didn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s962">It was moving between stations.</span> <span id="s963">If you ask me why it was moving, I don’t know whether they didn’t know where to go or whether one pulled -- I mean the -- the -- th-the -- there were soldiers on the train guarding those things, or whether they intentionally did that back and forth to kill the people in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s964">But with no food, with no water, people started to scream and -- and die, in fact, and -- and were horrible scenes which were told by the survivors after several days, six or seven days, one of the trains reached a far away point, after shuttling far away, but a point which could have re -- be reached in several normal hours of train, and only a few of the people still were alive and were taken out.</span> <span id="s965">Another, second train, was in fact never moved farther away, they were shuttling between very close places.</span> <span id="s966">No, because it was -- people were screaming all the time, and they were stopping in stations, the soldiers wanted to stop to do their things, they also realized that people dead -- there were dead people, an-and they opened the door, and asked the people from the boxcar to throw out people who were dead.</span> <span id="s967">And they brought and throw them on the pavement.</span> <span id="s968">And they -- the -- those who were all right were not allowed to -- to come out, wa -- and they left on the pavement, sealed the doors again and the train left.</span> <span id="s969">Those who were there -- in some places there were some Jews in those little towns.</span> <span id="s970">Not in all, because before the war, the Jews from the smallest places were forcibly relocated in the bigger towns.</span> <span id="s971">Was a political design in -- in fact.</span> <span id="s972">But this what happened, nobody knew at that time why.</span> <span id="s973">But in some smallest towns there were some Jews who were not on the trains and who were summoned to collect those people, and to bring them in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s974">In other places, they were simply loaded on horse drawn carts and dumped in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s975">Were some interesting scenes because as a train like that, screaming, comes and stays, and people hear of that, and some of the locals came too.</span> <span id="s976">Some cursed, some others tried to help.</span> <span id="s977">And there are -- there are records made by the survivors who testified that some of those who came really wanted to help, and to give them water.</span> <span id="s978">Some traded the water and the people in the boxcar gave them rings, and gold, and whatever they had on them.</span> <span id="s979">Others simply grabbed and give them.</span> <span id="s980">One -- I remember that one of those who was reported doing so was recognized by Yad Vashem as among the Righteous of the People.</span> <span id="s981">And her name is there, and he’s -- she’s very much revered -- revered.</span> <span id="s982">Victoria Agarici is her name.</span> <span id="s983">She is being described by the survivors by setting the gendarme aside.</span> <span id="s984">“I don’t care about you, I need to give water and bread to those people.</span> <span id="s985">Beat me if you want.”</span> <span id="s986">And she broke through the rows and approached the train and gave people water.</span> <span id="s987">I mean, it’s a very emotional, but this is the story, and she saved probably the lives of some of those people who were -- you know, people drank the urine of other people.</span> <span id="s988">There was a hole in the wooden -- in the board, they would struggle among themselves who could put his mouth on that hole to breathe some fresh air from outside.</span> <span id="s989">So horrible Danté-esque scenes inside.</span> <span id="s990">And here was a good, honest woman, was willing to fight the police to do what she felt was right, and to give the food and to save other people.</span> <span id="s991">So this is what happened.</span> <span id="s992">This is how so -- the m -- the majority of the people who were put on the trains died on the tra -- either died on the train, or came out at the arrival point of the first train and died in the next several hours.</span> <span id="s993">And their numbers, which probably the Holocaust Museum has, about how many exactly survived, and how many died, because statistics were kept, all -- all those by -- by the killers, and they reported so many corpses, which were [indecipherable] in fact, there is a report which was discovered in the archives of the -- the special service, security service of Romania, who apparently organized the massacre of the Jews, about the total number of Jews who were killed.</span> <span id="s994">That was a report th-the pride, accomplishment and was reported by numbers, and the document exist which reports a -- a -- you know, a scary figure.</span> <span id="s995">If you can imagine that 13,100 or 200 people in total were killed in those days.</span> <span id="s996">And this was a report sent by the local unit of that special service to their superiors, as an accomplishment.</span> <span id="s997">I couldn’t give you my own opinion, I don’t have a number, but I know how many I saw myself.</span> <span id="s998">But this is a total number, so they kept numbers also on the people who survived from the trains, and people who were unloaded.</span> <span id="s999">But I can again say that I saw in this -- in the 90’s, when I was able again to travel to Romania, and I did travel.</span> <span id="s1000">I got married in the meantime, here in the States, and I took my wife, who is American, and we went through the route of the Moldova, and stopped in all these little t-towns until we went to Iasi, where I was born and showed her, and then went further.</span> <span id="s1001">She’s also an anthropologist, Ruth Cernea, very interested in the story of my family, and the story of the Jews in -- in Romania.</span> <span id="s1002">She’s -- her field of study is Jewish culture, and the Passover Seder, which -- she wrote books on that.</span> <span id="s1003">No -- well -- very well known anthropologist.</span> <span id="s1004">And of course was interested herself in seeing what happened.</span> <span id="s1005">And in those little towns, coming close to Iasi, where the train stopped, we visit cemeteries, and you can see huge graves, collective graves, in which those bodies were dumped, without any identification, nobody knows who was buried where.</span> <span id="s1006">Shortly thereafter, the war, those common graves covered, you know, by soil and -- and branches got, you know, stone covers, and immediate after the war, the community, the town put huge slabs of concrete.</span> <span id="s1007">It’s not normal gravestone, but they are -- they are enormously impressive because you see slabs of concrete covering the collective graves of those killed in the trains, which are stretching from here all the way to the wall there, one after the other, one after the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: So 20 or 30 feet of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: 20 or 30 feet of concrete.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: There were about even more, seven, eight meters I would say, which yes, exactly 25 feet length.</span> <span id="s1012">All standard cement, you know, some -- but those are the collective graves, which were set immediately after the war -- I mean, the -- the -- the slabs.</span> <span id="s1013">And historical -- historical paradox and irony, and the sociological paradox is that those -- the graves of those killed in those -- in the massacres, are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the cemetery, which co-contained the graves of people who were killed during the first World War, and in some prior war, which was called the War of Independence, when some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in the army.</span> <span id="s1014">Still distinguished as Jews, but they’re very willing to fight and proud to fight for the independence of Romania.</span> <span id="s1015">And then they were buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their remains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud that part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for Romania’s independence.</span> <span id="s1016">It was a matter of honor, and the desire to make their contribution to the country and identify with the right cause of independence of the country they were living.</span> <span id="s1017">And that corner of cemetery, the heroes of the independence war, and of the first war is always treasured, and kind of honored specifically.</span> <span id="s1018">And next to it you can see the -- the Jews killed in Romania in a massacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year on a even larger scale to so many other hundreds and thousands of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: So this is -- it was -- later when we -- some of the people who remained alive, send messages where they are, and their families went and contacted, and tried to find out whether their own relatives were among the survivors.</span> <span id="s1021">One arrived in some wha -- Calarasi.</span> <span id="s1022">And another, which was farther away, another was in Portleroi which was closer and easier from Iasi to travel there.</span> <span id="s1023">And you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family members, and were -- got the news that their father, or their brother, or their son didn’t make it, was killed, and others was all right, no, you know, that -- you know, Sroul Abramovitch died.</span> <span id="s1024">I know for sure because he died in front of me.</span> <span id="s1025">And the other died, and I know when his body was -- was thrown down.</span> <span id="s1026">So they found -- they got the certainty of having lost those people forever.</span> <span id="s1027">So it was a continuous awareness of that pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: [indecipherable] in some way, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No, no, I mean the -- the -- the climate the people who disappeared were first deemed alive and hopefully will return, because as I said, not only my parents, but others thought that eventually they are being transpor -- transported to some labor camps.</span> <span id="s1030">The country was in war, the need for labor was obvious.</span> <span id="s1031">It was a plausible -- maybe it was wishful thinking, but nobody could imagine that they -- people, live people are being put in train and shuffled from one place to the other, without food and wa -- to be killed, or be killed in -- s -- but this happened, so awareness seeped in more and more, and the tragedy, and the crying and th-the suffering and the fear was -- were prevailing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: So it was very hard months and years, and my parents kept me the entire year, inside the -- the house and would not allow me to go except in the courtyard under supervision, to know all the time what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1034">No going out on the street.</span> <span id="s1035">And I was not the only child treated this way by their families.</span> <span id="s1036">So, it was a time of hard oppression, of fear for the -- in the entire community.</span> <span id="s1037">And the awareness of -- of the loss, and of the massacre, which nobody would have conceived that.</span> <span id="s1038">You know, there -- that was not actually the first in Romania, there were pogroms before, in ’97 -- 1907, some Jews were killed, there were riots in Romania [indecipherable] killed.</span> <span id="s1039">There was a small pogrom in 1940, apparently done by the military, which some people learned about it.</span> <span id="s1040">I did not know about that at that time, I was a kid, but it was in Dorohoi.</span> <span id="s1041">A number of Jews, two or 300 were killed.</span> <span id="s1042">I read about it later.</span> <span id="s1043">My parents could have known that it happened in 1940.</span> <span id="s1044">We all knew, however -- I also knew tha -- about what happened in January in ’41 before Romania entered the war, when there was the -- not the riot but the attempt to a coup -- coup d’etat that -- the coup by the Iron Guard to grab power, and Antonescu was the leader, use the army to -- to squelch that -- that attempt to grab the power, an-and defeated the Iron Guard.</span> <span id="s1045">But during the Iron Guard upraising and attempt, they killed Jews, and they killed also Romanian police or Romanian soldiers who fought them.</span> <span id="s1046">When they took the Romanian soldiers, which were Romanian, they would still kill them.</span> <span id="s1047">But for the Jews, there was a special treatment.</span> <span id="s1048">They took the Jews whom they caught, brought them to the town slaughterhouse, killed them, and hang their bodies.</span> <span id="s1049">And the newspapers carried pictures of that.</span> <span id="s1050">The reason the newspapers carried pictures was bay -- because the newspapers of Antonescu, who fought the Iron Guard, was interested to show what the Iron Guard was doing, killing Romanians, and also those jidan, you know, th-the Jews.</span> <span id="s1051">And look what they did, they were savages and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: I’m afraid we have to stop.</span> <span id="s1053">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Michael, can you give us some sense of what that year of being in the house pretty much -- I mean, I know you went into the courtyard, but you were not a free kid any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: No, no, well it was a very hard year.</span> <span id="s1058">It was a general year of -- of -- a sense of impending doom.</span> <span id="s1059">After all we heard that ha-happened, the fear was pervasive in our bones, it could re-happen again every -- every day in fact.</span> <span id="s1060">We were seeing that the presence of the army was less, and there was apparent quiet, but the rumor mill and the fears, the -- the -- the sense that, you know, we have no -- no -- no protection whatever, you can -- absolutely -- are absolutely at the mercy of anything anybody wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1061">And there was now and then, news coming about somebody was beaten, somebody was -- you know, in the open day, everything was stolen from him, and beaten and left there in full day -- full daylight.</span> <span id="s1062">And police didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1063">So, the sense was that you were under siege all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Were you conscious of this as a 10 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yeah, I wasn’t -- I was, beca -- you know, I did have at that time, 10 - 11 years, but those events make you more mature than your age, and your fear makes you sensitive.</span> <span id="s1066">No, th -- and real things happened, it was not simply a -- an anonymous or kind of general unexplained fear.</span> <span id="s1067">My father for instance, and other Jews, received a paper which was called Call Order.</span> <span id="s1068">Was a military paper from the military service saying -- and this was tha -- six months we -- after the -- the massacre, in beginning of ’42.</span> <span id="s1069">They say, hereby you are informed that you are to deliver to -- to work as labor -- forced labor.</span> <span id="s1070">You are part of a team number 38, or some number, under the team leader is so and so.</span> <span id="s1071">This is the place where you have to be present when called.</span> <span id="s1072">The calls will be made publicly, by public speakers and other ways, and you immediately have to present yourself at that place, under severe penalties.</span> <span id="s1073">Signed, the military circle of Iasi.</span> <span id="s1074">So we received that, and that document I -- I remember was the -- the scariest of all.</span> <span id="s1075">So finally they said they are coming now around to put out all the Jews, to round them up and to send, and this is even official, and not unan -- announced.</span> <span id="s1076">And with -- make -- happen all the day because there is no today.</span> <span id="s1077">And so you lived in fear that that order would be executed any time, and would not know what would happen to -- to him, or to us.</span> <span id="s1078">And sure enough, shortly thereafter that order came another one asking him to -- to come to be present for forced labor at the place, which was the address of the train station.</span> <span id="s1079">Now this was a train station from where the -- the death trains were sent out.</span> <span id="s1080">And here is a paper asking him to come there and -- and work, so you can imagine what he thought.</span> <span id="s1081">Will he ever come back, or are they all rounding them up there under some kind of order, pretext, whatever.</span> <span id="s1082">They will load them on the train and here it will happen again, they will be killed, taken away, you will never see them.</span> <span id="s1083">On the other hand, he couldn’t not go.</span> <span id="s1084">How could he not go, because it was obvious they had his name and his address and in full.</span> <span id="s1085">So, with all the fear in your heart, and other people also received, so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill k-kept going, did you receive, did you receive, I did receive, I didn’t receive, why didn’t that receive, what will happen.</span> <span id="s1086">So on the appointed day, he was all dressed, equipped with heavier because it was a cold winter, with a package, you know, to last him, and he was summoned and he had to go to the train station.</span> <span id="s1087">At the train station they were all put to shovel snow, and clean that and clean that, and we were waiting, waiting.</span> <span id="s1088">And it was the explosion of joy when at the end of the day we saw him back.</span> <span id="s1089">We didn’t know whether he will come back.</span> <span id="s1090">And he worked there for I don’t know how many, a -- a week, or [indecipherable] and he came back every day, and others came back.</span> <span id="s1091">They did not send those -- them again or kill them.</span> <span id="s1092">Was hard work, forced labor, but they all came back.</span> <span id="s1093">But with the indication that they can be called again any time.</span> <span id="s1094">So if -- we all lived in expectation of another call, so the -- the sense of fear, the terror, the impending risks or -- were there.</span> <span id="s1095">And he was called indeed, but he came back.</span> <span id="s1096">Interesting enough, the par -- the bureaucracy works in all system.</span> <span id="s1097">He received a document that he did present himself to that place, and he did the days of labor.</span> <span id="s1098">And I have the documents of, you know, the call order, and the confirmation that he was present and did the hard labor, signed by the military, you know, department, with the dates exactly what it is.</span> <span id="s1099">So that was the year -- oh, yes, I was saying about all the Jews, there was, at the end of spring, the -- the -- the news came that all the Jews will have to be submitted to a census, the entire Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1100">And that should be done through the Jewish community, the Jewish community was responsible that -- that all the Jews be recorded.</span> <span id="s1101">Now, we knew that the Jewish community knew who the Jews are and where they are, so why is there all of a sudden need to do again such a thing?</span> <span id="s1102">Again, th -- all the inferences and the fears.</span> <span id="s1103">It was just short of a year from the pogrom, from the massacre in May, June.</span> <span id="s1104">And it was announced and we lived in fear and then there were cards sent for each to fill in, because it was a census to be filled in.</span> <span id="s1105">Indeed, the community was asked to do, to submit to the government.</span> <span id="s1106">We didn’t hear the community, we fer -- we feared what was going to happen, and everybody had to receive, old, young, child, no matter, so we fe -- I -- I filled the card of that census myself, as the original document, which was titled, you know, census of all inhabitants with Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s1107">Recensamintul locuitor cu ringelvreese.</span> <span id="s1108">I mean, this is how blunt it was, nothing veiled, nothing hi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And this is the Romanian government [indecipherable] this is not Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: This is the Romanian government, no, no, no, this is absolutely the Romanian government, and -- and it was [indecipherable] my name, my age, my place of -- my address, my everything.</span> <span id="s1111">And because I was a minor, my father was -- had -- there was a place to record that -- his signature, to guarantee for the accuracy of the data.</span> <span id="s1112">So I was also on the record as a inhabitant with Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s1113">You know, available for pick up, if needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Now, is this true of everybody in the household, your mother, and your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Everybody, yes, everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Everybody?</span> <span id="s1117">So all the women --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: -- and all the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: All the -- inclu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Including your little brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Including my little brother.</span> <span id="s1123">Everybody with Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s1124">He may have his own card, because my -- my father and my mother saved that.</span> <span id="s1125">I have mine from my -- through my mother and I don’t know that he has it.</span> <span id="s1126">But it is, it has all the stamps on the four -- front, on the back.</span> <span id="s1127">It’s a document, you know.</span> <span id="s1128">Maybe sometime I’ll donate it to the Holocaust Museum, because it [indecipherable] a document.</span> <span id="s1129">So you may realize from those moments which I try to reconstruct, the -- the climate in which we lived, and how everything like that was like a -- a jolt of fear and you know, shaking us up and throwing us back into fear and uncertainty and th-the sense of constant siege, and a risk of life.</span> <span id="s1130">You know, I told you when I came -- I was near execution on the way back from the police quarters when they caught us, stopped us and put us with the face to the wall.</span> <span id="s1131">And they said, you escaped, you will -- going to be killed, until that voice sounded, let them go.</span> <span id="s1132">But it was impending execution to be with your face -- so you don’t forget easily such things.</span> <span id="s1133">So that was what we felt at the time and how the year went, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Just -- was your sleep disordered?</span> <span id="s1135">I mean, during that year when you were in the house, and clearly by then you know that things are extremely tense and something horrible can happen at any moment.</span> <span id="s1136">Do you have nightmares?</span> <span id="s1137">Do you -- I mean are you still this -- a kid whose -- and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Y -- like I say, it’s very likely plausible, I -- I -- perhaps it was.</span> <span id="s1139">I don’t have a recollection to say specifically that this happened to me.</span> <span id="s1140">The only thing I knew that I do recall that I lived in fear, that I was afraid to go out re -- there was no need for parents to restrain me too much to not go on the street, I wouldn’t go on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: [indecipherable] here.</span> <span id="s1143">And it was justified because later when I was star -- started leaving the house, I was once knocked down by somebody who was coming across me, didn’t show any sign of hostility except he stopped one meter in front of me, and when I came close, he really slapped -- knocked me down until I was down.</span> <span id="s1144">He -- in fact, I saw him taking the glove, and stopping them, he knocked me down, and then I was down.</span> <span id="s1145">He didn’t say a word, he put his gloves back, and walked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: So I waited for him to walk away, I collected myself and -- and ran back home.</span> <span id="s1148">Well, so this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: -- so I don’t know whether I had nightmares, but I know that it was a nightmare during --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: -- awake hours yes.</span> <span id="s1153">In wake hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: An-And how did your mother and father get food for you all?</span> <span id="s1155">Where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: I cannot say, but it was -- they had to do expeditions outside, they were selling certain things.</span> <span id="s1157">There were -- yes, I do remember some things.</span> <span id="s1158">You know, Romania was an agrarian country, a lot of f-food was brought by -- and there were women peasants who would bring thing in the market, and then they started to bring things to home, realizing that people don’t come to the market, but they may be customers at home.</span> <span id="s1159">And they will say [indecipherable] smintina brinza, which is sour cream, or cheese, or other things, some vegetables.</span> <span id="s1160">And -- and this was truck, this was exchange of food for items.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: I was going to say, because your parents don’t have money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: No money, no.</span> <span id="s1163">There were things being given to those women, and then a bag to come back, and they would come back after three weeks or four weeks, bring another thing, sometime they brought a -- a chicken.</span> <span id="s1164">And this was the way we’re getting food, they were trading things from the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1166">Did you feel hungry during that period, or do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: I -- well, I think that whatever food there was came first to me and to my brother, in the house, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: And then your parents last, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Because we were very loved as children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: -- and I know that my mother ate very little.</span> <span id="s1174">My father ate a bit more, but no, I don’t -- I don’t recall being hungry, I don’t recall being hungry.</span> <span id="s1175">Oh, my parents did something.</span> <span id="s1176">They realized -- yes, this is significant, they realized how lonely I am, and how bad it is for a child to not have anybody.</span> <span id="s1177">So they reach an understanding with another family who had many children, to take one boy of my age to live with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yeah, his name was Haim, Haimala.</span> <span id="s1180">Simply to give me -- to create a companion for me.</span> <span id="s1181">There was no payment exchanged.</span> <span id="s1182">Those -- but they promised to share the food with him.</span> <span id="s1183">For that family, where there were about six children, that was a good relief.</span> <span id="s1184">They knew my parents as very respectable, and they allow that child to come.</span> <span id="s1185">And this was Haimala, and my father, who was an engineer, was a good chess player, taught us both chess.</span> <span id="s1186">And that was very fortunate because to learn chess you have to have a partner of more or less the same caliber to be play -- yes.</span> <span id="s1187">And we learned at the same time, and it was match each other and the other, and we played for hours.</span> <span id="s1188">For hours we played chess, and he lived with us for a few months and I had a -- a friend in the house, in the house.</span> <span id="s1189">Some times we go in the field, and -- I don’t remember his family name, but his first name, Haim, Haimala.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Haim.</span> <span id="s1191">And you got along?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes, we got along very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And this went on for a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: For a few months in -- in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: In ’42.</span> <span id="s1197">A period after the massacre, not beyond the -- the summer of ’42, because in the fall of ’42 I -- I start to go into school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: School, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1200">But -- so this was the period then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: It’s interesting that your parents would come up with an idea like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable] yes, yes, yes, they did, and that -- I wish I can name that person, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1204">Did you play with your brother also, cause here it is, your tiny, little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Well, not chess [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: No, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: But yes, I played, but he was really small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I mean, he was -- in ’42 he was three years old, ’44, so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: -- I was already 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Right, you’re a big guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yeah, so he claims that I wasn’t very nice to him always, but -- but so I loved him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: I mean, he was my -- I protected him when people were beating my mother with him in her arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: So I love him, and he was my brother, but I don’t think we played a lot together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1220">At that time it was a big age difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: I mean later, you know, the age didn’t count so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Now, some time in ’42, you’re able to go to a Jewish community synagogue school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yes, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Does that -- so that you leave the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Yes, I leave the house, as I said, things slowly, slowly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Got a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yeah, we had the -- the census of the Jewish community done by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1229">We are afraid that something will happen.</span> <span id="s1230">A month passed, two months passed.</span> <span id="s1231">People from the community said no, we gave the data over here, but we don’t think s -- the danger is -- send your children to school, we’ll do the best to protect, so they encouraged, and then they send me to school indeed.</span> <span id="s1232">Indeed we saw -- we saw that although the census was made, and my card bears the date of the census, which was June, I believe, ’42, and one month, two months later, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1233">There was evidence of who are the Jews, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1234">At the same time, which was a very important factor, the Romanian army was victorious.</span> <span id="s1235">It was far away, deep into the Soviet Union, and -- and there was a -- a -- a sense of triumph in the Romanian community and clearly they were -- there were a lot of things being stolen from Russia and coming in, it was known there is a -- trains of items were brought and officers came with cars loaded, military cars with their own build -- I mean, their items stolen and -- so somehow the concern with the Jews decreased a bit, and we felt that.</span> <span id="s1236">So it was a bit more relaxed and they send me to school.</span> <span id="s1237">They wanted to -- me to learn something.</span> <span id="s1238">I told you that during the same year, I was -- a Melamed came to our home.</span> <span id="s1239">Again my father asked somebody who was younger than him [indecipherable] to come and teach me.</span> <span id="s1240">And again, the payment was in -- in things.</span> <span id="s1241">And he came and taught both me and Haimala the -- the Hebrew alphabet, and this is when I actually started.</span> <span id="s1242">I know -- I remember we weren’t too good students and he was not a very tough teacher and ri -- we didn’t do our schoolwork and so on, it wasn’t -- I didn’t learn too much.</span> <span id="s1243">But he came -- he came and he tried, so I was a bit prepared.</span> <span id="s1244">And my mother would talk to me about literature, so some kind of home schooling, and my father did with me, math.</span> <span id="s1245">Math, mathematics, you know, arithmetics, to -- to teach me the f -- the things, because he was an engineer.</span> <span id="s1246">And then Haimala, too.</span> <span id="s1247">So we had some kind of improvised schooling at home.</span> <span id="s1248">And then they said, you know, the child grows, he has to go to school.</span> <span id="s1249">And they send me to school, and first I was accompanied, then finally I would go by myself.</span> <span id="s1250">They advised -- the parents want for us to come in groups, so say if something happens, you run and tell whoever you can what happened, so we’ll come to help.</span> <span id="s1251">And I was crossing the Jewish quarter in fact, all the way to school, and the school, what was the school?</span> <span id="s1252">The school was a big synagogue with a shtender, you know the shtender, it was individ --</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: What is a shtender?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: The shtender is the -- the piece of furniture on which you keep your -- your Sidur, to read when there is an individual bench.</span> <span id="s1255">Otherwise there is a full bench.</span> <span id="s1256">A lot of times there is, you know, a chair, and the shtender at a chair.</span> <span id="s1257">Here we were given the shtenders to be able to use the boxes to put our copy books -- prayer books.</span> <span id="s1258">It wasn’t proper equipment for children, that was made for ad-adults, but I remember very well how we learned.</span> <span id="s1259">We had teachers and we went to school.</span> <span id="s1260">We had breaks, you know, we played in the breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in.</span> <span id="s1261">And this was end of ’42 - ’43, and then Stalingrad happened, and then we became happy, and the Romanians, and the others people there started to understand that the war is turning.</span> <span id="s1262">And since [indecipherable] and casualties were on the Romanian side pretty severe -- very severe in fact, because the Germans put always the Romanian troops and regiments in the -- in the fire, you know, in the most dangerous, and there were many casualties and losses.</span> <span id="s1263">So the situation turned generally grim, but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening, and some hope started to -- to come up, that the Germans are going to be defeated, and the war is going to be turned around.</span> <span id="s1264">So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope grew.</span> <span id="s1265">The situation generally didn’t worsen, and it didn’t worsen for Jews as it was -- became apparent much later, I did not have any way myself to learn that, but for the overall picture it appeared that the politicians, including the government, Antonescu, realized sooner than we did that the war is turning and then the risk of being -- killing the Jews is 10 times as high because they may be a -- become accountable.</span> <span id="s1266">So the -- the state’s anti-Semite activities did not grow, or did not expand their -- I am not aware of any other massacre or pogrom, or further very severe -- I don’t recall my father being called again in ’43 to -- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean there are documents which show that the -- the government wanted to -- to change course.</span> <span id="s1267">They send also representatives on the sly to contact the allies, without Germany knowing.</span> <span id="s1268">And that was ’43, in ’44 Romania turned sides already.</span> <span id="s1269">So for us the situation was better on that.</span> <span id="s1270">Still fear, still Jews.</span> <span id="s1271">We had an episode of wearing the yellow star in the period of ’41, I don’t recall in -- exactly how long, but I still have the yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in fact.</span> <span id="s1272">One was also exhibited in New York, and -- which were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to go out of the house, and stayed on the garments except that if we had to change the garments, we had to move those things.</span> <span id="s1273">So there was -- that situation of living between how do you I say it, one fear and the other, and one hope and another hope.</span> <span id="s1274">Until -- but then, you know, the -- the sense of hope and the sense of possible escape started to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again because the Russians were successful in pushing the Germans and the Romanian armies back.</span> <span id="s1275">And that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of fear that if they are defeated, and if they are going to retreat, we can be again in great jeopardy, and another massacre may occur when the armies will be here.</span> <span id="s1276">That was one -- one thing.</span> <span id="s1277">The other thing which happened in that - those years, is news percolated to us that our relatives were deported, or -- but some of them may be in camps.</span> <span id="s1278">Not -- not specifically was about our relatives, but news about the Jews in Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s1279">My mother was desperate all the time, knowing that so many of her cousins and brothers -- my mother had four brothers -- half brothers of course, but brothers very good, and two sisters, because from her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Mm, it’s a big family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yeah, her -- her -- her father in the first marriage had six children.</span> <span id="s1282">She was the youngest but she was very close to the youngest because she was from the second wife.</span> <span id="s1283">But very close to the youngest child from the first wife because my grandfather, when he lost his wife, and a man with six children, tried to marry soon again and he did marry and his wife bore him a child, my mother, who was very close in age to the smallest child he had from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: So that particular child became the friend of my mother, a boy about three years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s1286">What his name was?</span> <span id="s1287">Not shu -- I remember.</span> <span id="s1288">I knew his name.</span> <span id="s1289">I know the name of his son.</span> <span id="s1290">And as she was extremely energetic, hoping that some of those people, of her brothers and cousins and aunts, and then there was a family on her mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1291">All these brothers and sister I mentioned were on her father’s side.</span> <span id="s1292">But her mother had also three sisters, who got married there, and those sisters had children who were her cousins and so on.</span> <span id="s1293">So she wanted to find out who is where and if anybody was alive.</span> <span id="s1294">You couldn’t write, there was no post.</span> <span id="s1295">But something happened.</span> <span id="s1296">Romania got short of medical personnel.</span> <span id="s1297">There are a good number of Jewish doctors and Jewish paramedics, and so on, of course, health personnel, who was fired from all positions when my father was fired in ’94, they weren’t allowed to practice, and they practiced then for the community, Jewish community [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1298">And then they -- some kind of decision was made to re-allow, to bring back some of the Jewish doctors in the military to tend to the wounded, because there were enormous amount of wounded people and they needed to be treated and the Romanian doctors were not enough.</span> <span id="s1299">So the Jews -- the Jews were -- physicians were brought back, given a military uniform, with a distinctive sign that they are not -- they are military doctors and they are not the regular army, and which identified them with Jews.</span> <span id="s1300">But they were put to practice.</span> <span id="s1301">That was [indecipherable] that was permanent.</span> <span id="s1302">My father as engineer was put to forced labor, unqualified labor, but they were put to qualified labor.</span> <span id="s1303">And they were sent to the front, going to the front back and forth by train, they stopped here and there.</span> <span id="s1304">And some of them became couriers in trying to give messages and visit camps.</span> <span id="s1305">My mother found one of such doctors, gave her -- him the name of our people, the Faerstein family, Zioma and Uca and Monea and other names and told him, begged him, please whenever you have a chance, ask who has ever heard of the Faerstein family from Balti.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: We had to stop here, so we can stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: How do you know -- End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Michael, you were talking about your mother giving information --</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: -- to these doctors so they could find --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yeah, so it was more than one, two, three, whomever she could catch.</span> <span id="s1313">As I said, my mother was extremely energetic.</span> <span id="s1314">You can see that I loved my mother very much from the way I speak about her, but she is -- truly was, truly extremely energetic she was.</span> <span id="s1315">And she, being the first university educated person in her family in all -- among all her brothers and uncles and so on, nobody had [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1316">And moving to the big city, she became the center, the -- the -- the anchor point, not the center, the anchor point.</span> <span id="s1317">When everybody needed something, they would contact Shanya, before the war, already, and she was there.</span> <span id="s1318">And she kind of assumed responsibility for them.</span> <span id="s1319">Somebody ill would be sent from Balti to Iasi, that was in the years before the war.</span> <span id="s1320">And she would take care, go with them in the ho-hospital and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1321">So -- and she loved them, she grew up there, she was very much concerned.</span> <span id="s1322">She tried to identify them and -- and lo and behold, one of those doctors -- ambassadors, ambassadors to the camps, this is what they were, one comes back one good day and says, “I found it, I found your family.”</span> <span id="s1323">You know, I remember that moment, I mean that was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1324">Whom did you find?</span> <span id="s1325">She found, in -- in -- not she, he found, in a camp farther away from Balti, the family of one of her brother -- brothers, Yosl, with two of his children and his wife.</span> <span id="s1326">The two children were Zioma and Uca.</span> <span id="s1327">And as, you know, the -- then I learned that from my mother, the details, because it’s -- it’s such an extraordinary story, and how did he found -- he was going from camp to camp, and asked do you know somebody from -- and no, no.</span> <span id="s1328">And then somebody told him, in that camp may be somebody with that name.</span> <span id="s1329">And he went, apparently towards Marculesti, or -- I have to remember -- one of th-the camps was Marculesti, and the other was Cecilnica.</span> <span id="s1330">I don’t recall which one was that, but -- and then somebody else, we have got your family here, and they pointed there and he goes and he found one -- one of the two younger brother, and not -- not my mother’s fa -- brother, and the mother of the two boys.</span> <span id="s1331">And indeed it was her family, and she said, “You know, I am the doctor, I was sent by Shanya Catz, and she’s your relative.”</span> <span id="s1332">And then they told him the whole story and what happened to them, and they came, and the address.</span> <span id="s1333">And my -- those people are my cousins.</span> <span id="s1334">There were four brothers.</span> <span id="s1335">So the story was that one of the four got sepa -- when they were marched -- th-the -- the whole thing is that the Jews of Balti were marched, walking by -- by soldier of the Romanian army on horses.</span> <span id="s1336">Put in column and marched for tens of kilometers to be evacuated out of Balti.</span> <span id="s1337">When the army entered they were first put in a prison, in the Balti prison.</span> <span id="s1338">They were kept there a couple of weeks or some shorter time, and there they were started to march.</span> <span id="s1339">If you look -- to march them to the east --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: East, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: -- to the east.</span> <span id="s1342">And they stayed in a place, and then moved further and pushed further and pushed further.</span> <span id="s1343">All the time no transportation offered, no -- no help to people who are old or sick or incapable of doing.</span> <span id="s1344">Lots of them perished on those marches, you know, they weren’t given horses, the soldiers have the horses.</span> <span id="s1345">And until they stayed in a place for awhile, they had to beg their food, they are receiving very little, beg their food from the peasants around them, steal the food from the field, eat whatever they could find on the field, potatoes, raw potatoes and any other thing.</span> <span id="s1346">And he found them -- and then were stayed in houses emptied by people who went when the Russian army retreated, they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1347">And those camps were not in the system of the German camps, you know, the barracks were well organized German style, were simply improvised, the same way like the -- you know, the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in the pogrom, which I already told you, was a very artisanal killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: It was a very?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Artisanal killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Artisanal, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: I mean, in death trains, you know, hacking them to death, it was not the gas chambers, the type of thing, the horrible.</span> <span id="s1352">And maybe the fact that, you know, the gas chambers are so well known is not due only to the huge numbers but to the industrialized manner of killing Jews.</span> <span id="s1353">Here it was more the traditional manner was used, you know, kill directly, or the innovation was putting them on trains.</span> <span id="s1354">But i-in the camps were -- do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1355">They were herded to a place, compelled to work, or left abandoned there, fell on the ground, found someplace to sit down.</span> <span id="s1356">And then in a week or two days or three days or maybe two months, when the new order came, or when the soldiers rested, they were shepherded further.</span> <span id="s1357">So he came back and told us that my uncle Yosl died of starvation and -- and illness.</span> <span id="s1358">He was not shot, but he caught typhus and -- and he died in the arms of his sons.</span> <span id="s1359">That the -- his wife is alive, Surka, Aunt Surka.</span> <span id="s1360">Who was, as it happened in a Jewish family, she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1361">So the grandmother, my grandmother married as a second wife, her husband, who had sons from the first wife.</span> <span id="s1362">Some of the sons were much older than [indecipherable] young people.</span> <span id="s1363">So one of them at the -- some point, married the youngest sister of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1364">So the son married the sister of his father’s wife, second wife.</span> <span id="s1365">But it was perfectly [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1366">And she became -- and she gave birth to four sons, who are my direct first cousins.</span> <span id="s1367">And the story came that one of them, in that terrible evacuation being herded, separated from the family and was lost.</span> <span id="s1368">As it turned out, he didn’t separate by chance.</span> <span id="s1369">He wanted to -- to run away and to run away with the Russians and to reach the Russians and to fight.</span> <span id="s1370">And he did succeeded, went east on his own, crossed the front line, reached the Russians line, and became a soldier.</span> <span id="s1371">And for the entire war in the Russian army, all the way to Germany, survived.</span> <span id="s1372">Was crippled, unfortunately, and remained cripple -- shorter leg for -- but came back alive.</span> <span id="s1373">And we are very proud of him because he wanted to fight and he fought the Nazis to -- to the end.</span> <span id="s1374">And -- and then another one, who lived not with his father in Balti was caught in an -- another thing, and also apparently left and was on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1375">So to escape that war and the camps, the father died, the boys survived, and the mother survived.</span> <span id="s1376">And the doctor brought us the information only about those who he fou -- he found in the camp, we -- at that time we didn’t know about those who fought in the army.</span> <span id="s1377">And then next time when he went, my mother gave him money, gave him a blanket, gave him medication.</span> <span id="s1378">Not too much, because he couldn’t carry.</span> <span id="s1379">He went back to the same camp, found them and gave them the blanket.</span> <span id="s1380">Now imagine what it means in that condition to receive something like from heaven, you -- you get, and it was -- and they never forget.</span> <span id="s1381">I met th-the cousin Zioma, one of them I mentioned, I believe before, that I met him in Balti years later and then he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1382">The youngest one, Uca, is fortunately still a-alive.</span> <span id="s1383">He left the Russia earlier than his older brother, he came to Canada.</span> <span id="s1384">And he’s still alive in Canada, and I talked to him on the phone a few days ago.</span> <span id="s1385">And he -- he -- you should interview him because he was in camp.</span> <span id="s1386">I was not directly in camp, I was with the massacres, but his story is extraordinary, how he -- they were moved from camp to camp, marched in -- in the worst conditions, not fed.</span> <span id="s1387">How he had to go and steal and bring home some food for people, how his father died in his hand, sick and no-not medicated by anybody.</span> <span id="s1388">The stories are horrible, but he is alive.</span> <span id="s1389">He is almost 80 or more.</span> <span id="s1390">And he has his daughter and son and they live in Toronto.</span> <span id="s1391">If you want I will give him your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: It’s Uca Faerstein, you keep the name and so -- so th-this -- that was again a hor -- a typical event for our family, typical Holocaust event which marked our lives because we were able -- my mother was able once to send those things.</span> <span id="s1394">But then she co -- started to collect things and prepare, in the hope that she will be able to send again and again and again.</span> <span id="s1395">And collected from whoever she could, that and the other thing.</span> <span id="s1396">There was no other option to send.</span> <span id="s1397">But at least we knew that they were alive.</span> <span id="s1398">And they kept hope that they will survive.</span> <span id="s1399">So this is how we moved through ’43.</span> <span id="s1400">And then ’44 came, and the front was coming closer to -- closer.</span> <span id="s1401">This is when the panic started in the Jewish community again, that as the army would retreat, they were already visible retreating and convoys of people, very poorly looking, came through Iasi.</span> <span id="s1402">You know, in the early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi.</span> <span id="s1403">In the later years we didn’t see Russian prisoners brought through Iasi any more.</span> <span id="s1404">We saw convoys of the Romanian army, or of the Germans coming in a very ragtag shape.</span> <span id="s1405">They were visible in ’43, I remember, not ’42, but in ’43 I remember.</span> <span id="s1406">And the stories was, you know, between people, telling whoever saw, communicated to the other, you know, I saw another convoy, it doesn’t go good for them.</span> <span id="s1407">[indecipherable] So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Oh, Michael, ha-have -- are you hearing anything about all the killings in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: No, no, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: You hear nothing about killing centers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: No, that’s -- I -- I ask myself the same thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: -- and for instance there were the killing of the Jews in -- in Kiev, which was -- that time I -- I don’t recall, I cannot say that my father and mother knew nothing, but I am inclined to believe they didn’t learn about such things.</span> <span id="s1414">There were some things I believe about Odessa because shortly after the beginning of the war, the Romanian army moved fast, they arrived in Odessa and then they did a bloody massacre of the Jews in Odessa, which were very close to Romania and the news came.</span> <span id="s1415">But never did the news tell of the proportion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: But I am frankly not surprised about that, Joan, to tell you the truth, because I -- I know how the massacre in Iasi happened, that was the largest pogrom, I mean 13,000 people in one community is huge, is a huge -- men -- mostly men, maybe a few children and some women, so -- but th-there was a veil of silence afterward, nobody talked.</span> <span id="s1418">At that time no newspaper reported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: How would people know?</span> <span id="s1421">Nobody discussed, that was buried under silence [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s1422">Th-Th-The west didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1423">Later on, you know, if you read those things, you find out that apparently some news percolated to the U.S. embassy in Romania, of course still an embassy then in ’41, and some allusion -- you should ask your expert in the museum, some reference was vague in a -- some dispatch from the U.S. consul or embassy in Romania about some events in Iasi.</span> <span id="s1424">But without proper description, nobody realized.</span> <span id="s1425">And then the system kept it all the way secret until the war.</span> <span id="s1426">In the war there was a process of them s -- at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Some of the people who are caught with very little full evidence, and then when the communist system took over in Romania, they put another veil of silence because they didn’t want to -- Romania to be blamed for doing such things, such a massacre.</span> <span id="s1429">In fact, however that massacre was o-of a magnitude unprecedented in Europe.</span> <span id="s1430">Even at Kristallnacht in Germany, there were no 13,000 Jews killed.</span> <span id="s1431">A lot of destruction, and a number of victims, but not 13,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1432">So that was th-the first big event on the European scale of killing Jews en masse.</span> <span id="s1433">Maybe in Poland it happened too, in ’39 or ’40, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1434">But then it was repeated in Odessa, it was repeated in Kiev.</span> <span id="s1435">Babi Yar was a clear copycat of that, these people brought and killed in front of their trenches and [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s1436">But there are description from the pogrom in Iasi that people -- corpses were loaded on trucks and when trucks came to a grave, first they -- they carried body by body, then they become too cumbersome, and they say, you know, let’s shovel all of them at once, to fall straight into the grave.</span> <span id="s1437">This was how it was treated.</span> <span id="s1438">And the -- the -- in short, there was -- what happened in Romania was huge, and yet little known.</span> <span id="s1439">So therefore I’m not surprised that we didn’t receive the news from all the things which happened under the occupation in the Russian territory.</span> <span id="s1440">We only realized through that doctor who came, when we got the story how they were pushed from place to place, that they were pushed to the east to be beyond any line which could presumably still remain under Russia.</span> <span id="s1441">That that territory had to be clean of all the Jews, which that territory which was expected to become Romanian in the event of the war ending with a German victory, should be clean of Jews.</span> <span id="s1442">This is why they -- they moved them, they killed some of them, but whoever stayed alive should be on the other side to Russia.</span> <span id="s1443">Which was -- which -- that is what today we call th-the proper concept, ethnic cleanstick -- cleansing.</span> <span id="s1444">That preceded with decades the ethnic cleansing in -- by Serbia’s -- or -- or by the Muslims in Croatia, and in what happened in Yugoslavia very recently.</span> <span id="s1445">But it was ethnic cleansing.</span> <span id="s1446">This throwing an ethnic group, either by direct killing, or by starvation, or by hunger, or allowing them to be killed by epidemics.</span> <span id="s1447">And pushing the -- the remainders o-out beyond the border.</span> <span id="s1448">So this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: When was it clear to you how big the pogrom was in Iasi?</span> <span id="s1450">Because your own experience of the pogrom was limited.</span> <span id="s1451">The fear was enormous, but you clearly wouldn’t have known at the end of the four days --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: That so many thousands --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: At the year of the -- end of the four days, we -- we didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: What happened.</span> <span id="s1457">When we started to learn the story about the trains, we started to get more and more information and a grasp of events.</span> <span id="s1458">Then the news percolated that a lot of people were killed then -- I mean, the people who saved the life, s -- told and communicated home that we are alive, but we saw that that and that was killed.</span> <span id="s1459">The Iasi families [indecipherable] through messages, through friends, including Romanian friends, to contact those whom we ler -- who they learned are in Calarasi, I mean far away, to -- what happened to, you know, Avram Roitembaum, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1460">And the news we -- I saw him dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: So this -- the -- the realization of the -- of the magnitude seeped in gradually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: And we s -- we realized it was bigger and bigger and bigger than we could realize then.</span> <span id="s1465">We had it firsthand because in my courtyard, two people did not return, the -- Mr. Barad and his older son.</span> <span id="s1466">And the family was -- stayed Shiva when they learned about that thing.</span> <span id="s1467">So we realized continuously th-the inc -- increasingly realized the size of the -- the numbers we only found out and learned after the war, the total numbers.</span> <span id="s1468">And as I mentioned to you during the communist system, there were no reports and le -- except the -- the trial of some of the criminals who were involved, no publicity was made.</span> <span id="s1469">The Jewish community would have a commemoration of the massacre each year and they would say there were so many people killed, the -- 11,000 was the number at a certain time, which they believed it was, just huge.</span> <span id="s1470">Then the documents were discovered that there were -- in the special services reported more then 11,000 killed.</span> <span id="s1471">And gradually we’d realize the size, but not when I was a child.</span> <span id="s1472">From a child my -- my direct experience was about the reality of that happening to me, to my family, to the neighbors in the immediate --</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: -- in the most indisputable and tangible way.</span> <span id="s1475">The proportions I learned later, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: So y-y -- from what I can tell, you would describe the years following the m -- the massacre, the pogrom, as being sort of up and down.</span> <span id="s1477">There are times when it’s ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: -- when your fear is heightened, and there are times when the fear seems to be less but it never goes away --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: -- because you’re never sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: -- until the war is completely over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Like a sword hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: And then really happening, I mean my father receiving the piece of paper that he had to -- to show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: And then having to show up and then us being on edge the whole day whether he comes back or not.</span> <span id="s1491">Then with the census, with all our data, and our mind was this is a list for them to come and systematically pick up and make sure that nobody is -- is -- is omitted from the pick-up.</span> <span id="s1492">So, of course we had very strong indication that things can happen any day.</span> <span id="s1493">Wh-When things worsened on the front, we -- we started having hopes that who knows, maybe we’ll be lucky enough to survive that ordeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: That -- that was -- but we were, you know, fearing disappearance and death every time, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: [indecipherable] time.</span> <span id="s1497">Do you think it changed you a lot?</span> <span id="s1498">Of course it’s very difficult to know what you would have been if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Exactly, how could [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: -- hadn’t had the experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: -- but it’s un-unforgettable.</span> <span id="s1502">It shaped my mind at that time because all my [indecipherable] when I came out from the war and when I started to go to school, and when the first years of freedom, everything was fresh in my mind and you know, I joined a group of more consciously thinking kids in our school, and even politically oriented kids, too, and engage in discussion, you know, what -- so what will happen?</span> <span id="s1503">Will that happen again, what -- are they [indecipherable] are -- the Jewish problem, that was a [indecipherable] problem nationale which we discussed endlessly and shaped our aspiration, political conviction, desire to do something to create a different type of society.</span> <span id="s1504">And that is a very clear chapter in -- in my life.</span> <span id="s1505">After the war, as a result, a conscious result of the extraordinary sense of oppression and injustice which I had, which was imprinted in my cells and my genes, and I came out with that.</span> <span id="s1506">And that, you know, such oppression, such injustice shouldn’t happen, I mean, again.</span> <span id="s1507">So in that respect, it -- it changed me.</span> <span id="s1508">Without that experience I -- definitely I would have been a different person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: But otherwise it did change me, and it’s -- it -- it’s rooted in my mind, certain aspirations and values which I believe I still carry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: [inaudible] Did you leave Iasi in ’44, or you stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Well, that’s what th -- worry we -- we reached the point --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: -- as the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: -- as the Russians --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: -- the Russian was approaching, we fear -- the fear thermometer, I’d say.</span> <span id="s1517">The fear thermometer, or barometer went up again, and say well, they’re coming, they’re going to destroy us when -- if the Russians are victorious and pushing them, when they retreat through Iasi, they will kill again all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Ah, the romane -- when -- when the arm -- Romanian army retreats --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yes, that’s what they fear --</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: -- it’s they -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: -- Romanians and German --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: -- because the front was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: We are going to be decimated, and destroyed, and -- because even the first time they took revenge, Romanian army took revenge on the Jews in Iasi and in other places, also on account that the Jews of Bessarabia, when the Romanian army retreated from Bessarabia in 1940, kind of rejoiced in that retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: And then they had to pay -- to payback, and they paid back by killing.</span> <span id="s1528">So with a -- they’re going to retreat, that will be the end of us.</span> <span id="s1529">We -- we survived until now, but that, no.</span> <span id="s1530">And then everybody who could, say we have to run.</span> <span id="s1531">We have to run, we have -- how to run?</span> <span id="s1532">And this is when my parents, and other people started to -- to think how they can ran -- run away from -- where to run?</span> <span id="s1533">There was no -- nothing, no place to run, but they said, if we can run to Bucharest, which is a big city with a much smaller proportion of Jews, we’ll -- we’ll disappear in the mix, perhaps we’ll get lost ra -- in -- in Bucharest, a pogrom like that did not happen.</span> <span id="s1534">So we -- that’s was -- was the reasoning.</span> <span id="s1535">And th-this -- my parents started to prepare themselves, and to do whatever they could to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: And that prepared their -- their running away and becoming refugees and running away from Iasi at the end of the month of March, 1944.</span> <span id="s1538">Which we, at that time, you know, they identified a taxi driver, in fact, who was -- or somebody who owned a car, I don’t know whether he was a taxi driver, but owned a car, and reached a deal with him to pay him to transport us from -- from Iasi to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1539">And that’s the entire story, I have to tell you [indecipherable] the trip, because we didn’t have enough money, there was no cars, and we had to fit ourself in that car, all my family and the Barad family, who lost the head of the family and one of the sons.</span> <span id="s1540">So we were five of us, I tell you about my other grandmother, and three of them to fit in one car, one small car.</span> <span id="s1541">My father kind of took charge of the Barad family who remained without a man in the hou -- without a head of the family.</span> <span id="s1542">And they were very close friends.</span> <span id="s1543">And indeed, we were all loaded in that car, and that was an ordeal, but they made it to Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1545">We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1547">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Michael, before you get to tell us about your trip to Bucharest, were there other relatives killed in other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yes, unfortunately there were, there were.</span> <span id="s1552">And the one other uncle of mine, my mother’s elder brother, half elder brother, whose name is Moise Leib was in a totally different camp, also coming from Balti, but they were driven, chased to another camp, and he died in Obadovka, this was the name of the camp.</span> <span id="s1553">It was already in Ukraine, that Obadovka, like Cecilnica, which I said before, as they were pushed, and they arrived there, but died in the camp, and that camp, also his son, my cousin, if I recall correctly the name, I was -- it was also Yosl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: But he was still a small child, or a child of eight, 10 - 12 was -- who also was killed.</span> <span id="s1556">Only his wife escaped, the wife of Moise Leib.</span> <span id="s1557">That was again his second wife, of that uncle of mine whose son was killed.</span> <span id="s1558">She survived, her husband and her son was killed.</span> <span id="s1559">My uncle and my cousin were killed, she survived.</span> <span id="s1560">But my uncle had two other sons from his first marriage, and they also either disappeared or were killed, I cannot tell you for sure about each one and all of them, but there were much more losses.</span> <span id="s1561">Those which I mentioned I know for sure, and I know their names and I recall the instances we discussed.</span> <span id="s1562">But my mother, who kept a very sober count, and a very loving count of them, in fact dedicated a number of trees in Israel, growing trees, to their memory and altogether it must be a big forest in -- in Israel only for them.</span> <span id="s1563">And she also created the plaque with their names, the names of all who died from the family Al Kidush Hashem, and made a plaque which I have, a plaque at home, I have it, you can see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: If you want to put it on record with this.</span> <span id="s1566">What is meaningful is that in fact, she did that plaque early on enough that she arrived here, in the States, and [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s1567">But then we found out about the others, who also were killed in the camps, and for whom -- my mother thought that they were disappeared in the war, or in the evacuation with the Russians, and they were war casualties rather than Holocaust direct massacred or killed people.</span> <span id="s1568">But they were -- they didn’t fit yet in -- in the -- in that table, in that plaque.</span> <span id="s1569">So there are more than in the plaque.</span> <span id="s1570">The answer yes, in Romania we -- you have very many casualties on that side.</span> <span id="s1571">Everybody had casualties, I mean on -- on my grandmother’s side, there were her sisters who were there, and who had their children and grandchildren, some of them were killed, some of them escaped, some of them were killed.</span> <span id="s1572">There was no family which was left unscathed by that, that losses.</span> <span id="s1573">I mentioned to you Uca, the one who is now in Toronto.</span> <span id="s1574">He married, when he came after the war, surviving and came back to Balti, he married a woman in Balti.</span> <span id="s1575">That woman was the only survivor of her family.</span> <span id="s1576">Yanya is her name, and she’s alive and his wife now.</span> <span id="s1577">But she was a survivor in her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: So the casualties were terrible, and many, many [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: So more -- more than half of the Jewish population were killed in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: Yes, I mean, the statistics show that altogether, the Romanian Jewry was one of the most numerous Jewish population in -- in Europe.</span> <span id="s1582">Before the war about 850,000 Jews lived in Romanian territory.</span> <span id="s1583">By -- after the war only four -- 400,000 were alive.</span> <span id="s1584">Half or more on the eastern side, a good number on the Romanian territory, as happened in Iasi, and in Dorohoi and in other places which I mentioned.</span> <span id="s1585">Bucharest and so on.</span> <span id="s1586">And a good part in the western part of Romania, which was taken away from Romania before the war, and was under Hungarian regime, and under Nazi control, and the Germans and the Hungarians deported the Romanian -- the Jews from that part, from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s1587">So it was not the Romanian government which killed them, but they were part of the Romanian Jewry who were killed in the west, as opposed to in the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Some of them we -- went to Auschwitz and to other big camps, and never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: So it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: So it was how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: -- exactly how you count --</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: -- yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: -- but the counting is difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: -- the -- the fact is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: But still, it’s a huge number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: -- it doesn’t matter on -- so much on whose account -- I mean on whose count of murders they -- their names are, what matters is a murder took place, mass murder, mass killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: So you’re in this car, eight people in a small car --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: -- I can only imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Do you have any luggage, is there anything, or it’s just people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: No, no, we couldn’t like -- take any luggage, very, very few things, but those few things were some of the things, the documents, and some of the Jewish heirlooms which my mother saved.</span> <span id="s1604">In other words, the whole house was left un -- untouched, as you know, we left and [indecipherable] they tried to -- to run away for life, and escape with their lives.</span> <span id="s1605">So the entire house we don’t what happened to the house, to the furniture, to whatever was left in the house, depleted enough as it was for th-the -- the exchange of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: -- house item for goods and food.</span> <span id="s1608">But there was still a household.</span> <span id="s1609">The car -- I mean, what I remember is something which you d -- understand that a boy of that age would remember, I remember the -- the brand of the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Oh, what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: At that time, oh I -- you know, it was a Plymouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: P-l-y-m-o-u-t.</span> <span id="s1614">And at that time I didn’t know English, and so for years I -- I kept it in mind, in the Romanian reading, Plymouth.</span> <span id="s1615">But now I can tell you.</span> <span id="s1616">And it was a spacious Plymouth because in addition to the normal seats it has those banquettes, you know, the seats which -- so this is how we fit, but it still was an ordeal.</span> <span id="s1617">So I don’t know exactly how everybody was divided, but first of all we had a very heartbreaking situation with my grandmother on the mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1618">We were preparing to leave and it was absolutely obvious that she cannot make the trip.</span> <span id="s1619">She was very heavy, still ill, everybody catered to her.</span> <span id="s1620">She was more -- more lying than standing.</span> <span id="s1621">Advanced in age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: This [indecipherable] for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Yes, and -- for years, but as -- with every year, worse.</span> <span id="s1624">So -- and -- and she said, “Leave me here, leave me here.”</span> <span id="s1625">And my father said, “I don’t want to, how can we take you, what should we do?”</span> <span id="s1626">And he wa -- we were desperate.</span> <span id="s1627">But it -- it was impossible to -- to take her, and eventually they found a solution.</span> <span id="s1628">The solution was they went to the same family where the child Haim came, who was a family with children.</span> <span id="s1629">They did not contemplate to -- to leave, or they didn’t have the means, I don’t exactly know.</span> <span id="s1630">But they were s-saying we are staying here and if you want, we can take Chava as a family member, and we will take enormous care of her, whatever we can do for -- for us, we’ll do for her.</span> <span id="s1631">So this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1632">Chava moved to the family of Haimala, and stayed there, and lived a little bit longer and then passed away indeed, because she was close to that moment.</span> <span id="s1633">I believe she survived a few months, and passed away.</span> <span id="s1634">I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s1635">But we knew, and they took good care, because she got ill, and she was hospitalized, too.</span> <span id="s1636">There was a former Jewish hospital owned by the Jewish community, which -- it was a very powerful community there, but then it was taken by the state.</span> <span id="s1637">But we -- we learned that she was taken to the hospital for good care and that she died in the hospital, so at least we know that she didn’t die abandoned and -- and [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: -- but she -- it was a -- you know, she was very old, too.</span> <span id="s1640">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: But it must be very difficult for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: It was very -- it was heartbreaking, and worse [indecipherable] my parents were in touch with Iasi by that -- those time the phone was terrible, but they were in touch even after we arrived in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1643">But I, in the 90’s, when I was in Romania again, before I left, I couldn’t track her down.</span> <span id="s1644">But when I came back from the States after that, I did everything to find her out, and we went to the cemetery in Iasi and tracked down who passed out in that years in the Jewish community, and we found the record.</span> <span id="s1645">And I went to the cemetery in Iasi, and we found the place, but everything was, you know, weeds and soil and debris and so on, with a lady -- caretaking woman and the man at the cemetery, we started to dig and clean at the place where the numbers coincided, and lo and behold, the -- the grave appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: You found it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Yes, and we found the name there.</span> <span id="s1648">So I know where my grandmother is buried.</span> <span id="s1649">So this was the -- one thing about departure.</span> <span id="s1650">And then the other grandmother was in much better shape physically.</span> <span id="s1651">And indeed, she survived until ’66 or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: She did, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yeah, another 20 years after that.</span> <span id="s1654">And we got all loaded, there was no room, and I was the smallest -- not the smallest one, there’s Zolly, but I was the smallest adult, so to say.</span> <span id="s1655">So they combined me with the youngest boy from the Barad family, took up only one seat.</span> <span id="s1656">So he was a bit older than me, his name was Eugene, and again I can tell you some of a little story how I rediscovered him later.</span> <span id="s1657">But I was on his knees the entire trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Now this is a trip of what, 500 miles or something [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: No, this was about 500 kilometers -- 400 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Aha, so it’s a little less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: -- four -- four --</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Four -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: But it was not the distance, it was the duration which was killing us.</span> <span id="s1664">A distance is a distance, but it was the -- the highways were not highways, or -- you know, roads as they were ’44, and they were clogged with refugees on carts, on -- on cars, trucks, military people coming from the war, ambulances, checkpoints which slowed the tr -- down the traffic, everything.</span> <span id="s1665">Y -- military units going to the front, and military units retreating from the front.</span> <span id="s1666">So the -- the trip was I don’t know, almost 24 hours, leave one day and arrive the next day in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1667">The poor driver drived all the time.</span> <span id="s1668">He secured some piece of paper for him to prove, and really that was a -- lifesaving, because we were stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: He was showing the paper, and my mother was pushing the bribe.</span> <span id="s1671">That was a pattern because alone the paper justified, but they wouldn’t let it.</span> <span id="s1672">And my mother had, you know, one thing and another thing, precious thing, some jewelry went.</span> <span id="s1673">And we -- one after the other went through all the -- the checkpoints.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: So she was the really imaginative one in terms of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Sh-She -- she was, yeah, she was the real --</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: My father, as I told you, came wounded and ba -- and he suffered for rest of the life for the consequences of those --</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: The beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: -- thing, which became more psychologically damaging than physically damaging.</span> <span id="s1680">He recovered physically from what he had, but psychologically it was really bad.</span> <span id="s1681">So he had good times, but he was out of kilter for many.</span> <span id="s1682">And then had strokes and -- a series of strokes, you don’t -- cannot say for sure that the -- that is a direct relationship, but -- so we arrived in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1683">I remember I was not able to stand, and every time we stopped I wasn’t able to stand, this is how numb --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: -- my -- my legs were from sitting on his knees and being bent, because the car was low and -- and the room was extraordinary tiny.</span> <span id="s1686">So, but we made it eventually to Bucharest and we arrived at the friend of my father, whose name was Lupu Catz, the same name, but they were no relative.</span> <span id="s1687">There was also a Catz from the town of my father, and they were friend in -- in childhood, and they remained friends through the lifetime, and in time of need they had the house, and we all decamped to their house.</span> <span id="s1688">And we stayed there for awhile and I remember he had one daughter, a bit -- one year younger of me, so my age, practically.</span> <span id="s1689">And she was -- she had a cold at that time, so she was bedridden.</span> <span id="s1690">So here I see a -- a girl who became my friend and she’s still alive and fine, and we are friends.</span> <span id="s1691">But I remember the moment when I see -- saw her first time.</span> <span id="s1692">Jenica is her name.</span> <span id="s1693">And we stayed in their house [indecipherable] it was totally different for me, it was a big city, bigger indeed, it was close to the Jewish quarters of Bucharest, but a bit out.</span> <span id="s1694">And indeed, the Jewish community was kind of smaller and lost in the total population of Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1695">And nothing bad happened since then directly about Jews.</span> <span id="s1696">The bad thing which happened is the -- the -- the allies started to bomb Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1697">The front was coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: So we -- we arrived at Bucharest virtually -- less than one week from the biggest ever bombing of Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1700">And the fourth of April, 1944, that was the biggest bombing of Bucharest by the British planes, based somewhere I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1701">In the Mediterranean, the Greece, and they were coming to bomb the Romanian gas hills, Romania had the gas, and those were within 40 miles of Bucharest, so they drop part of the bombs there, on the gas field, and come with the rest.</span> <span id="s1702">That was putting pressure on the population of the government to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: -- to stop the war and to come out, preparing them to -- softening them for -- for the political negotiation to get Romania out of the war, and against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1705">Because the Russians were pressing from the east, and here was the government, and -- who had to be bombed into submission, and bombed to -- to accept the -- the ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: That’s quite an entrance after you’re trying to escape from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Yes, and we escape the war only to -- to fall here, and mind you, what happened after that first bombing, the raids continued to the point that they came every single day to bomb Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: And to increase the political pressure, they came every day at the same hour.</span> <span id="s1710">Ele -- 11 of the morning, we knew that this is the -- and [indecipherable] away I -- all the -- always the -- the -- it was deliberate, it was not -- so, I guess -- I didn’t have any contact with the British headquarters to know, but why would they send the planes every day the same hour, except to demonstrate something, they are able to do it, and this is not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: -- and you -- you -- you still fear, and you know that the next day they to -- come again.</span> <span id="s1713">And then you cannot [indecipherable] so when will this stop, I mean how long?</span> <span id="s1714">The -- then -- you know, the sirens would start screaming wildly, everybody would run away, everybody -- Bucharest wasn’t bombed during the war, it was far from -- from theater of war.</span> <span id="s1715">In the beginning maybe some, but I wasn’t there, but during the -- the -- the height of the war it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1716">But when the war came to the end, the pressure was put on Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1717">It wasn’t Dresden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yes, but it was a lot of pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: It was bad enough for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: So we knew that every day.</span> <span id="s1724">And then we had to -- to hide ourselves now in the basement of the building, eventually move from my friends and my father’s -- my mother found a small apartment in a building in which another family from Iasi, also going as refugee escaping, which is a family of -- Rosenhaupt family.</span> <span id="s1725">And in fact, it was the parents of the famous Israeli lawyer and politician, Meier Rosenne.</span> <span id="s1726">Our parents were friends in -- in bu -- in Iasi, so hum -- somehow they got together, found the same building, and they moved into an -- one apartment.</span> <span id="s1727">It was a small building with several apartments.</span> <span id="s1728">And they were in another apartment in the same building.</span> <span id="s1729">They knew -- th-the parents knew th -- I knew Meier from -- from his childhood, but then we really became close because we’d be together, we’d play together, and we would run to the -- to the basement together at 11 o’clock when the sirens will -- will start.</span> <span id="s1730">And that happened for weeks.</span> <span id="s1731">A number of houses were destroyed, and unfortunately the Barad family found an apartment in another place, the one I talked to you.</span> <span id="s1732">And unfortunately that was -- that place was close to the Bucharest railway station.</span> <span id="s1733">And the railway station was a part of the -- the bombing target in the fourth of April.</span> <span id="s1734">There was blanket bombing there by the British.</span> <span id="s1735">A lot was destroyed, the station was almost un -- disabled, I don’t know was completely.</span> <span id="s1736">But their house was bombed, and she was killed.</span> <span id="s1737">The -- the baby was -- was with us one week before in the car and escaped the war in Iasi, was killed, and the -- the two boys were buried in the rubble of the house, which we learned later, when the youngest boy found ou -- us, after having been buried under the rubble for three days and three nights.</span> <span id="s1738">And he came out, they were pulled out from the rubble by rescue teams when they found him in the rubble, and they found there was some plaque hanging there by his mother saying, if this boy is found somewheres, you know, alone, bring him either at that address, her address, or to the fa -- Catz family, who is on the street Mogos Vornicu five, where we are [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1739">Or not Mogos Vornicu five, it was Kolono Moraro, one of the addresses.</span> <span id="s1740">But this is how he could found us -- find us.</span> <span id="s1741">He was -- his face and head were swollen from being hit by the bombing and debris and being on no food and no water [indecipherable] the air for under the debris until he was rescued.</span> <span id="s1742">He could move, but his head was very swollen, I remember his swollen head, and he found us and told what happened.</span> <span id="s1743">And in the process, you know, she had the -- the -- her purse with all her -- their fortune was lost.</span> <span id="s1744">She -- they had money and, you know, gold coins, whatever they had they lost, and they were poor like [indecipherable] so we had to help them, too, in that situation.</span> <span id="s1745">But -- and they were victimized a second time, that family Barad, a really unlucky case.</span> <span id="s1746">And then the -- then, you know, we went through the spring with so many bombings.</span> <span id="s1747">Yes, my -- given the risk, I -- there were the same treatment.</span> <span id="s1748">I had to carry here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: In case something happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Yes, with a name and who I am and where I should be brought.</span> <span id="s1751">And my mother sewed some things which they still had, some gold coins in my -- in my pants, yeah, and tell me always keep that pants, don’t -- don’t give it away and you know, know that in the need, that’s what -- how you can pay for your food.</span> <span id="s1752">Fortunately, our house was not bombed, and we lived in it throughout the bombing, until the middle of August, 23rd of August when Romania shifted sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: And two, three days later, the Russian tanks came into Bucharest, because the -- Romania came out of the war by -- by political maneuver with the king, and the -- Antonescu was arrested, and the Romania shifted sides.</span> <span id="s1755">Then the Romanian army stopped fighting, and the Russian army was already in the east and with no opposition, advanced very quickly and tanks came into Bucharest, and I remember the Russian tanks coming, and me waving them, and my mother waving them, and finally the liberators.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: You know, you hear -- s -- hear so many things about American liberating people in Dachau and then all the camps.</span> <span id="s1758">We were not in a physical camp like that, but I -- I surely recognize the feeling of people who are in a -- in that state, and are liberated by -- by the army who comes there, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: And a smile on your face, that’s how you felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Oh, it was terrific --</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: -- you know, yes.</span> <span id="s1763">And in addition, you know, my mother was able to talk to the Russian soldier who are [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Ah, cause she can speak Russian, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: -- she speaks Russian, yeah, I knew a few words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: I even had an adventure with them because then, you know, I was there and next two or three, four or five days the Russians all came, and they -- a few of them camped in a little square.</span> <span id="s1768">And I came to them, I said, you know, “Dobry Deni,” and they were really surprised --</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: -- so all very happy, all of them were missing their own children, gave me bread, gave me other thing.</span> <span id="s1771">And then they said, “Do you want to come in the -- in -- in the truck?”</span> <span id="s1772">We are going here, they say.</span> <span id="s1773">I understood something that they g-go to fetch something, and will come back.</span> <span id="s1774">And I say yes, and I got into the car.</span> <span id="s1775">And they started driving and driving and driving and I mean I don’t know whether the story is of any interest, so let me stop here.</span> <span id="s1776">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: The place -- they were taking you someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: They were taking me -- well, in short, they took me to a forest where they have an ammunition depot, and loaded the truck with ammunition.</span> <span id="s1779">That was still when the Germans were bombing Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: And that took a few hours and in the meantime, my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Was hysterical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: -- absolutely mad, hysterical, and I couldn’t do anything, I was with them, and they could have taken me.</span> <span id="s1784">They brought me back, late, after six hours of -- my mother was on the street, saw me, and I don’t want to put on video, but I got my pants down and I got a spanking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Spanking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: A spanking in the street, I will never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Did she ever spank you before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Not quite, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Not this way.</span> <span id="s1793">I mean, she said never, never [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1794">No, she didn’t -- she didn’t spank me, but sometime it happens, you get -- and you got that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1796">But this was real, this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: This was real, yeah, oh I mean she -- she was out of her mind, she was -- that’s the end of me, that I was kidnapped, I was killed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: -- I was something, I will never return.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: That’s the benefit of a cell phone, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Ah.</span> <span id="s1802">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1803">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: All right, we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Michael, I know that the -- that we have a -- a -- many, many years we could still cover, but for today I don’t think we’re going to be able to do that, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: It’s -- it’s late, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: It’s late.</span> <span id="s1810">So that if you can give a kind of summary of -- a sort of outline of what happened to you, and then we can close it off and -- and start on another day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: Yes, well, I believe we reached the -- virtually the end, almost the end of the war, when Romania shifted sides, and then what happened, relevant to the past, that th -- we mean the past is, that we -- we really tied ti -- tried to find out what happened to everybody else in our family.</span> <span id="s1812">As I mentioned, we had a large family on the other side --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: -- where they were in camps.</span> <span id="s1815">And my mother had a very, very intensive way to do the search, and wiv -- she found some of the people, found out about others who died.</span> <span id="s1816">My cousin, Zioma, who was in the camp, as I mentioned, in Marculesti, and hi -- another camp he was, I remember he and Uca were first in Rawoutsel, a camp, and then in Marculesti, and then in Cecilnica.</span> <span id="s1817">As they came back to Balti, my cousin Zioma went into the army after a little while, because the war still went on, and lo and behold, he appears in Bucharest in the uniform of the army which freed, you know, so you can imagine our -- because the last we knew was -- of him was when that doctor found them and brought them the -- the blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: And he reported to us with a letter from them that the blanket was delivered, which was a lifesaver for them in that time.</span> <span id="s1820">So he came and we were happy, in fact, I have a picture with him coming, and I don’t have it here with me if you ask for it, but it’s at home if you need it.</span> <span id="s1821">So we were very happy.</span> <span id="s1822">The other cousin of mine, Monea, who fought all the way to Berlin, and we are very proud, and was decorated, and was wounded, and became a cripple for the rest of the life his [indecipherable] came twice to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1823">And so we were very rejoicing in those -- and also, you know, mourning those whom we learned were lost.</span> <span id="s1824">So it was a f-family stock-taking of what happened to all of us, and how we -- we went through.</span> <span id="s1825">And that again, before -- beyond the stock taking, helped cultivate in me the sense of family and what -- how important, I mean the solidarity and the family solidarity is a very big, important value for me throughout my life and I believe those hard times instilled that value, and my mother deliberately instilled it.</span> <span id="s1826">And -- to the point, in fact, that even after my mother’s death, I felt the need to go to -- as I -- I think I mentioned, to the place of my birth, to Balti and to find out the place, and I found that [indecipherable] the synagogue didn’t exist, but I found there another si -- very relative moment of Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1827">In that synagogue, you know, people who came back to town -- it was also my family, my town.</span> <span id="s1828">And they said Kaddish, and I -- I was given by the Jewish community from Balti, some Kaddish cardboards, and where the Kaddish words were written in Slavic le -- letters, for people to be able to pronounce the -- the Hebrew word, you know, [speaks Hebrew here] ___________.</span> <span id="s1829">But all thing with Russian letters because, as I was explained, the people in Balti, many of them didn’t know the torit Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1830">And I got that cardboard, one of them is in the Holocaust Museum, but not in yours, in the Holocaust Museum in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: [indecipherable] in New York</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: -- in New York.</span> <span id="s1833">I have another one, which is a -- a historic document, Kaddish, and -- and -- wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: And we’ll show that in a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Fine, fine, if you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: -- you’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1838">So then, you know, the life fell back into normal except that we are -- w-we were bearing memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: -- and the consciousnesses we gained.</span> <span id="s1841">I went back to school, I went to a Jewish school, my parents kept me to a Jewish school as long as Jewish schools were around in Romania, until ’48 when the education system was reformed, all became state schools.</span> <span id="s1842">And I continued my Jewish education, I had my Bar Mitzvah with a very memorable teacher, Mrs. Eisenstein, who was another formative element, maybe I’ll tell you privately another time about her, but she was a remarkable person, Hannah Eisenstein.</span> <span id="s1843">A book about her was printed in Israel, includes my memories of her, and Meier Rosenne’s memories, because he also was a -- a student of her in Romania before he left for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: And she taught you Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: She taught me Hebrew, she taught him Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: [indecipherable] that his parents decided to go to Israel very soon, when my parents decided to apply for immigration it was too late, and they were rejected.</span> <span id="s1848">So that’s why I stayed in Romania.</span> <span id="s1849">But she was our mora, our teacher at the beginning and we both -- every time I meet Meier Rosenne now, we still talk about what she taught us, you know.</span> <span id="s1850">She was very important to me.</span> <span id="s1851">And then I -- I went into research after I went to [indecipherable] training, I did research, learned sociology.</span> <span id="s1852">Also, it’s a complex period, with a lot of political implications and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: -- it -- it was kind of profoundly affected.</span> <span id="s1855">I believe you asked me a question how it changed my life.</span> <span id="s1856">So my life was changed in the sense that I became concerned professionally too, about how societies develop and change in political systems.</span> <span id="s1857">And I did my research in sociology when that became possible.</span> <span id="s1858">I am trained in philosophy and sociology and then my research was -- became of interest to other scholars internationally, so I was invited to the United State, to the Center for Advanced Studies [indecipherable] that think tank, which I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Yeah, think tank, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: And my wife, Stella Cernea was also a sociologist.</span> <span id="s1861">She was trained and she became a assistant profe -- associate professor at the university.</span> <span id="s1862">When I applied to become the same, and I got my Ph.D., I was told no, we don’t take Jews any more, point blank.</span> <span id="s1863">And this was happening in -- in ’58, ’59.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: In -- in communist Romania.</span> <span id="s1866">So fortunately I was able to continue my work as a researcher in the system of the academy of sciences, and I did my research there, which apparently was important enough to be picked up by American scholars.</span> <span id="s1867">Then, unfortunately, my wife died -- Stella, and -- by a brain hemorrhage and aneurysm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: And this was in the 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: And this was in the -- ’68.</span> <span id="s1870">Put it very briefly, I -- I received at that same time the invitation to go to the center where I went two years later after a epic fight between that center and Romanian authorities, who would not allow me -- would not give me a visa, period, until they gave it under American pressure.</span> <span id="s1871">And I was there -- I had to come back because they came -- kept my two children hostage, and my mother took care of them while I was away.</span> <span id="s1872">So I stayed from ’71 until ’74, when I again was invited by the American Sociological Association and traveled to Canada and the U.S..</span> <span id="s1873">I decided not to return at that time, and I could do that because the children were -- were older and I could still count on -- on them to survive well and to -- until I was able to get them out.</span> <span id="s1874">And really, it took an hour and a half -- I-I’m sorry, a year and a half, almost, to -- to get them out.</span> <span id="s1875">Fortunately I was offered a job as the first sociologist to be hired by the World Bank, that happened in ’74, just when I left Romania.</span> <span id="s1876">So that was another one of the twists and chances in life which happened, and hey, I did, I hope well in that job.</span> <span id="s1877">So it brought me great gratification, realizing a lot of my values and ideals in helping poor people in societies and changing people’s life.</span> <span id="s1878">I honestly believe I made some contribution in that.</span> <span id="s1879">And that brings me to the present day, Joan, wh-when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: -- I retired from the bank.</span> <span id="s1882">I do continue my work and my writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: When did you retire from the bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: I retired from the bank at the end of ’76, beginning ’77.</span> <span id="s1885">I published a number of books in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1886">I keep laboring on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Wait a minute, ’76 or ’77?</span> <span id="s1888">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: No, sorry, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: ’96.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: ’96 - ’97.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Sorry, sorry.</span> <span id="s1894">’96 - ’97.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: And when did -- you remarried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: That was a -- I was about to say, I remarried in ’87.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: With Ruth, my wife, she is also an anthropologist.</span> <span id="s1899">If you want to know the story, there’s a very funny story because -- anyway, I have to -- let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1900">It was a nice -- after so many sad stories, this is a nice story to record.</span> <span id="s1901">As an anthropologist at the World Bank in Washington, I was trying to be in touch with the community of Washington anthropologists, which there is an association, WAPA, Washington Association of Professional Anthropologists.</span> <span id="s1902">And while at anthropological meetings, I bought a book at the meeting, because I saw an interesting book, which was about -- it’s called, “Afikoman in Exile”, about the ritual of Passover from an anthropological viewpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Which I read, I enjoyed very much.</span> <span id="s1905">I knew much -- learned much more about that.</span> <span id="s1906">And in one of the outings of that Washington Association for Professional Anthropologists, sa -- and went -- went to the races, if you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1907">And we ate, we gathered a large group and somehow in anthropology the discussion came about Passover rituals and somebody said something, you know, we engage in a discussion and we have a little -- a really sharp discussion because I thought I was there -- maybe another Jewish, or anthropologist or two, and I knew well to say that I, you know, knew the book, and I kept my thinking sa -- on some points.</span> <span id="s1908">Somebody had a different opinion, there was there a lady who had a different opinion and that intrigued me.</span> <span id="s1909">And she was very firm in her opinion and I was very firm in mine.</span> <span id="s1910">But I couldn’t convince her, so that’s was it, you know, we went home and the boss as -- before telling -- saying goodbye, I told her, “And I think really I was right, you were not right on the point, and to see that, you need to read the book about that.</span> <span id="s1911">And this is a book called “Afikoman in Exile,” and you will see,” I said.</span> <span id="s1912">“No, I don’t, I know -- I think -- I think I know I’m right and I don’t have to read that book.”</span> <span id="s1913">So that was -- I say, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1914">She said, “I wrote it.”</span> <span id="s1915">Well that concluded the argument, that concluded the argument, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: And did you start dating soon afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Well, I -- I tried to -- yes, I went straight to the book and looked at what they said about the biography of that lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: In the bio-note of that book --</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: -- and yes, I did call her, and we met and fortunately we could get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1923">That’s a very interesting beginning, it might have been disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Yes, that was the first argument she won, I have to say not the last.</span> <span id="s1925">But it was -- I -- I -- I won also some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: You won some arguments, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: And your -- you have two children from your first marriage, both of whom are physicians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: I have two children, yes, both are physicians.</span> <span id="s1930">This is my daughter Darna, who -- I didn’t tell you that after my -- I saw -- they took me a ni -- year and a half to bring me my children.</span> <span id="s1931">I had family here in America, also branches of the family from Bessarabia, again cousins, the Jacobsen family from Buffalo, and the Rochester fami -- the Davis family from Rochester.</span> <span id="s1932">Also a relative of ours, whose, you know, grandfathers, or fathers left earlier from Balti and came to the States long before the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: And my mother tracked them down and mobilized them to plead with their political representative in the Congress, and in the Senate, to press for the freeing of the children and of my mother from back in Romania.</span> <span id="s1935">And they did, they -- you know, the senator of New York was -- Rochester, Buffalo, you know, for New York the senator was Senator Javits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Javits, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: So they told him the story, he wrote the letter to the -- to the Romanian ambassador.</span> <span id="s1938">In Stanford while I was there, I met Alan Dershowitz, who was also a fellow like myself with -- to whom I entrusted my -- my desire to -- to come and he say, “Michael, if you want to come now, I will help you now, legally.</span> <span id="s1939">If you want to go back, go back to the children.</span> <span id="s1940">But when the moment -- you decide the moment comes, I’ll give you all my support, you can count on that, this is my word.”</span> <span id="s1941">And indeed I go -- went back, but when the moment came, I called, and Alan Dershowitz was right there to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: He had sent in fact, a student of his, Ben Segal to check on me after I went back in Romania [indecipherable] student.</span> <span id="s1944">And when I came back that student was already a lawyer in Washington as it happened.</span> <span id="s1945">So I got all the -- the best and the strongest --</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: -- legal assistance and help.</span> <span id="s1948">And they wrote -- Ben Segal’s father, who was a former rabbi, in fact, knew ha -- Hubert Humphrey.</span> <span id="s1949">Hubert Humphrey wrote a letter to the Romanian government for my children.</span> <span id="s1950">I was put on the U.S. Congress family unification list as a condition for the most favored nation clause, which was renewed every year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: -- under the Jackson [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: -- so it was a interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: It was an interesting time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: And I got the children, and f -- you know, my daughter Darna came when she was 17 and she was accepted straight into Brandeis after an interview, and she studied there.</span> <span id="s1957">My son had to go to high school here, at Georgetown [indecipherable], he was a very good student.</span> <span id="s1958">He wanted to get circumcision as I told you, at his initiative which he is proud to this day, I am proud to this day.</span> <span id="s1959">Because he didn’t have the chance of a Jewish education in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1960">And now they created their own family, Darna is married, Eric [indecipherable] who has a Jewish French origin.</span> <span id="s1961">They have three children.</span> <span id="s1962">Darna decided to shift to a kosher home, with all my credit for that.</span> <span id="s1963">And her children are going to Jewish day school in -- in New Hampshire, and get a very solid Jewish education, a very solid secular education.</span> <span id="s1964">I’m very proud, we just had the Bat Mitzvah of the older one, Sarah, who has the name of my first wife, S-Stella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Stella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Stella.</span> <span id="s1967">So she is Sarah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: They go to Jewish day school in New Hampshire, or New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: In -- sorry, New Jersey --</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: -- did I say New Hampshire?</span> <span id="s1972">Q: You said New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: Sorry, no, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: It’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: In Englewood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: There are Jewish schools, and all -- they are, all three of them, Sarah, Rebecca and Alana, and going to the same Jewish school in -- in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1978">And they learned Hebrew, they were wonderful Bat Mitzvah, in which again we talked about family and so on.</span> <span id="s1979">And my son and [indecipherable] she’s a physician, my son went to medical school, too, he is a anesthesiologist.</span> <span id="s1980">Of course, he’s the vice president of the anesthesiology group in [indecipherable] if you ever need somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1982">I’ll remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Remember.</span> <span id="s1984">But he is a very good physician in general and an excellent anesthesiologist.</span> <span id="s1985">He establish his family, his wife Lauren is a psychiatrist, a very good one, they have two children, wonderful, delightful children, Evan and Dylan, who -- whom I see -- you know, close, they live three blocks --</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: -- from my house, and a -- av -- a very happy family, and we are very thankful to -- to our faith, for our faith and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1989">Well, Michael, I thank you so very much for being willing to take so much time in telling us what’s a very moving and I know very difficult story for you to be telling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yes, it is a difficult story, I thank you for your patience, and prompting and good questions and keeping so well, track.</span> <span id="s1991">I think it’s important that that story be known because it has -- you know, it’s lifes, individual life’s which interfere with history in crucial juncture moments of history, which therefore individualized may -- in happening, may become more relevant for broader purposes of identity or of faith, of history, of social change, political change.</span> <span id="s1992">So I’m glad that you invited me to put on the record those things, and I hope that my children children’s children and so on will sometime also see that video, you and me talking, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: I hope so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: -- and they will know what is the history behind that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Right, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: Thank you, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: This -- the picture of my great grandfath -- parents.</span> <span id="s2002">This is -- the lady’s name is Chaya.</span> <span id="s2003">The man’s name is Ushar.</span> <span id="s2004">Chaya is the mother of my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein.</span> <span id="s2005">And this picture was taken apparently about exactly a century ago in 1905, or maybe 1906 because the family’s story is that they left Balti at that age in that state.</span> <span id="s2006">Apparently they were above 70 or even more, deciding to leave their family behind and going to the Holy Land to die there and to be buried in the Holy Land.</span> <span id="s2007">And lo and behold, they had the courage, the stamina, and the strength, to accomplish that dream, and left Balti in 1906 or 1907.</span> <span id="s2008">Finally they arrived in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2009">I don’t know how they did it, because they spoke only Yiddish and maybe a bit of Russian and they had to travel, of course, by horse, and by cart until they got to the train and then from the train they should have crossed the sea by boat, and then to arrive, but they made it.</span> <span id="s2010">And they arrived in Jerusalem, lived Maya Sharim.</span> <span id="s2011">As you can see he’s -- has a beard, and has payas and the -- the traditional caftan.</span> <span id="s2012">And my mother and I visited the cemetery in which we knew that they were buried.</span> <span id="s2013">And that was still during my mother’s life, and my mother discovered in the books their names.</span> <span id="s2014">And we found their -- her grave in the cemetery of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives.</span> <span id="s2015">We didn’t find Ushar’s grave because Ushar grave was desecrated by the Jordanians when they controlled that part of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2016">Last year I spent six weeks in Jerusalem at the Hebrew University, and I went back to retrieve the -- the grave of my great great great-grandmother.</span> <span id="s2017">So fi -- I did find it, cleaned the -- the gravestone, her name is there, exactly when she died, and I brought the pictures back to my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2018">I would hope to get there with my grandchildren so they get a tangible sense of heritage, of -- of family history.</span> <span id="s2019">And I still try to find out, to construct the full family tree, which -- for which I have a lot of data, but I have to put it on a good chart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: And this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: This picture is real historic picture, is a picture of the synagogue of Balti before the war, when the synagogue was -- is -- it still existed.</span> <span id="s2022">People attended the service and somebody took that picture which somehow arrived in my mother’s hand and she saved it through the entire ordeal of my family lifes until -- then brought it to the United States.</span> <span id="s2023">So here in that picture you can see my grandfather, Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, whose name is carried by my brother Zolly, as an old man there.</span> <span id="s2024">And two of his sons, who are my mother’s cousins and my uncles.</span> <span id="s2025">This is Uncle Yosl on the extreme right of the picture and Uncle Shrul, a bit younger.</span> <span id="s2026">So the others -- I know some names from my mother, but they are not relatives.</span> <span id="s2027">But we are very proud to have this picture.</span> <span id="s2028">But I like to say that I was very gratified realizing at my granddaughter’s Bat Mitzvah that all my grandchildren were extremely happy and proud to have their pictures of their family tree, counting themselves as the sixth generation down from Haier Faerstein.</span> <span id="s2029">So this great great great-grandmother, that made them very happy and very proud.</span> <span id="s2030">So I am very proud of them, too.</span> <span id="s2031">We have other pictures further, if you want to look.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Yes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2033">And this picture?</span> <span id="s2034">A: This picture is my grandparents on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s2035">It is Zollman Mayhel Faerstein, the man whom you saw in the prior picture in the synagogue, the elderly gentleman.</span> <span id="s2036">This is shortly after my mother was born.</span> <span id="s2037">In the picture is also my grandmother, Brana -- Brana Baratz Faerstein, and her little daughter Shanya, or Seindel Faerstein.</span> <span id="s2038">She’s barely one year old, and the picture apparently was taken at the same time with the initial picture when the family went to the only photographer in town, because the -- the parents, Chaya and Ushar decided to leave the country, so they made pictures.</span> <span id="s2039">Zollman Mayhel is already the father of six children before my mother.</span> <span id="s2040">And you can see he is still looking as a young -- relatively young man.</span> <span id="s2041">For Brana, his second wife, this is the only and first child -- the first child and the only child, Shanya.</span> <span id="s2042">This is how families were at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: In this picture you can see my other grandparents, on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s2045">This is Itic Catz, or Itac Catz, and his wife Ava, or Chava, of whom I -- whom I both mentioned in -- in the prior narrative of my life.</span> <span id="s2046">They were in Roman.</span> <span id="s2047">He was a -- a s -- a very small shopkeeper, is a grocer.</span> <span id="s2048">They were rather poor.</span> <span id="s2049">My other grandparent in the prior picture had a workshop producing soap, also very artisanal thing.</span> <span id="s2050">But as you can see, he was also very distinguished in his looks, with a very respectable beard.</span> <span id="s2051">Kind of stiff in the picture, unusual for him to be photographed.</span> <span id="s2052">His wife Chava is the person whom I described to you as my grandmother who was rather short and heavy.</span> <span id="s2053">You can see that he is sitting and she is standing and they are almost the same height, because she wasn’t very tall and she grew bigger.</span> <span id="s2054">The young man there is my father at a young age.</span> <span id="s2055">He was in his teens, I believe; my father, Marcu Catz.</span> <span id="s2056">I believe he was maybe 16 - 17, because his brother, Bernard, my Uncle Bernard is not in the picture, otherwise he would have been in the picture.</span> <span id="s2057">The reason he is not is that he had to leave the town in which they left, Roman, because he was -- he got involved in some political activities a bit of the left, and he was badly beaten up and threatened.</span> <span id="s2058">We have some pictures in the family of his being bitten -- I mean, the wounds he -- he endured in that beating and it was unsafe for him to stay so he left -- had to leave with his left leanings to Paris, where he could practice them a bit more.</span> <span id="s2059">And then he left France for Canada where he established a family, but married in the typical Jewish way with a girl he met on the boat, and established the family.</span> <span id="s2060">He’s had one son, Charlie Kent, my cousin, who established a very beautiful family, the Kent family with four children in Toronto and Phoenix and the States.</span> <span id="s2061">Many grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2062">Charlie married -- married Ida, who is still alive.</span> <span id="s2063">My uncle -- Charlie Kent passed away, but they helped decisively in the -- in taking out my brother Zolly from Romania.</span> <span id="s2064">In fact, ransoming him with money from the govern -- Romania’s government, and this is how Zolly and his family arrived in Canada.</span> <span id="s2065">But Bernard, unfortunately, is missing from this picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Right [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: And who’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: This is my grandmother, again on the mother’s side.</span> <span id="s2070">I called her Babba Brana, this is Brana Baratz Faerstein, and the little person over there is me.</span> <span id="s2071">That -- there is an inscription on the back of the picture which shows that at that age I was 11 months old.</span> <span id="s2072">But you can see that my grandmother still looked very -- was a very beautiful -- the very beautiful woman she was here, with -- with white hair.</span> <span id="s2073">In the earlier pictures with my mother at that age, she had hair was still dark and black.</span> <span id="s2074">Young and beautiful and now she has -- that is what, about 30 years later, or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: And here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Here are my two grandmothers.</span> <span id="s2077">On the right there is Babba Brana, yes, who is my mother’s mother, and on the other side is Babba Ava or Chava, who was my father’s mother.</span> <span id="s2078">They were with us in Iasi.</span> <span id="s2079">This is a picture taking -- taken just about a year after the -- before the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s2080">The front person is -- small baby is my brother Zolly, and I am hiding behind him, showing only my head.</span> <span id="s2081">Zolly this age had -- about 15 months or so, the grandmothers are both very proud and keep a very possessive hand on him, this was the latest sign of the family.</span> <span id="s2082">And this is a very happy picture because it’s a first -- the last picture I have with both my grandmothers in the same picture.</span> <span id="s2083">When the war started, they didn’t make pictures any more.</span> <span id="s2084">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: What you can see now is the yellow star, the famous yellow star which the Jews from several parts of Romania were forced to wear.</span> <span id="s2087">That part included Iasi.</span> <span id="s2088">And that was the star I had, in fact, the stars were circulating in the family between me and my father.</span> <span id="s2089">They had to be sewn on our garments whenever we went out.</span> <span id="s2090">They -- if you use the same garment it stays the same, but if we change the garment we cannot go outside without the yellow star.</span> <span id="s2091">So my mother saved two of our yellow stars.</span> <span id="s2092">One of them is in the Jewish museum in -- Holocaust museum in New York, this is the second and I -- I -- that was my own and my father’s, for some time.</span> <span id="s2093">For --</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: And did you -- did you have to purchase these, or were these homemade?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: No, no, they were handmade by each family and this is why you have also variety.</span> <span id="s2096">They were sewn in the house out of yellow fabric and black fabric.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: And the pens are for scale?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: And the pen is in for scale, and you can see how it was.</span> <span id="s2099">In fact, we had in our home, a sewing machine, and that was used; I remembered how it looked, and it used for garment too, cause at -- every family sew a lot of garments at that time for themselves.</span> <span id="s2100">But it -- it was used to manufacture our yellow stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: And what are these documents right here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: These are documents from 1942, in the height of the Holocaust period.</span> <span id="s2103">The first one is an order which my father received from the military authority of Iasi for the commandant -- you know, the commander of the military authority, to be on call, to be ready that he is going to be called for duties, unspecified, and he should be ready any time such call will be made.</span> <span id="s2104">It will be communicated loudly and he’s bound to come to the address mentioned in the order, under sever -- severe penalty.</span> <span id="s2105">It’s also indicated that he was allocated to be a member of a -- a labor team number 38, to be led by another Jewish man named Kaufman, Yuda.</span> <span id="s2106">His name was also written there.</span> <span id="s2107">The name of my father is up there, Marcu L from Leib, Catz.</span> <span id="s2108">The -- the threat was terrible because it does not -- it did not specify what will happen to them.</span> <span id="s2109">Other Jews from Iasi received the same order, and the fear was that this is a systematic call again to -- to eliminate them, to kill them.</span> <span id="s2110">Indeed then it was -- became known that they have to present themselves, the specific place was the railway station, exactly the same station where the Jews in the -- were put on the death train.</span> <span id="s2111">So then my father was informed that he has to be present at a certain day there, together with other Jews.</span> <span id="s2112">And with fear in his heart, he had to go.</span> <span id="s2113">The bureac -- and he went.</span> <span id="s2114">Fortunately we saw him back.</span> <span id="s2115">But this second document is the certificate which the military bureaucracy handed over to him to -- as a proof that he indeed responded to the call and was there.</span> <span id="s2116">That was important document too, to protect him from the accusation that he did not show up.</span> <span id="s2117">So this our family document saved.</span> <span id="s2118">There were more like that, but not all were sa -- saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: And what is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: This is a document about myself.</span> <span id="s2121">I believe I mentioned earlier that in 1942, the Romanian government decided to make a full census of the Jewish population and they asked the Federation of Jewish Communities to do that.</span> <span id="s2122">It was called the Center Organization of the Jews.</span> <span id="s2123">Whatever the name -- Centrala Evreilor din Romania.</span> <span id="s2124">So again we got extremely afraid that the -- the census of all Jews is being made to keep good track of where they are and who they are, when the decision will be made that they could be picked up and -- and something done not very good to them.</span> <span id="s2125">So this card however, is also very important historical document because it’s -- it’s blunt, it say, this is a census -- Recensamintul locuitoriln cu ringelvreese.</span> <span id="s2126">The census for inhabitants having Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s2127">I mean, this is -- they were not mincing words.</span> <span id="s2128">The ethnic bias is clear, blood bias.</span> <span id="s2129">You have Jewish blood, you are a different category of person.</span> <span id="s2130">The name is there, Catz, Moise, my name, our address, Iasi, street Colonel Langa, tracepervachi, which is 13.</span> <span id="s2131">My fa -- because I was a minor in 1942, my father and that -- June ’42 is mentioned there as the date, my father has to put his identity number on the left side of the card.</span> <span id="s2132">Now, on the back of the card, you can see two stamps.</span> <span id="s2133">One is the -- the stamps of the Iasi police, and the other one is -- the first one is the Iasi police with the crown of the king over there you can see in the first.</span> <span id="s2134">And the second is the stamp of the Jewish community of Iasi, giving authenticity to this document.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: And this document?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: This document is something -- is a gift which I received from the Jewish community of Balti in 1994 where I returned to my birth -- town of birth, simply to see how it looked at that time.</span> <span id="s2137">I was on a World Bank mission to Moldova for developing programs which the bank was developing for Moldova, in my capacity the senior advisor at that time at the bank for social policies.</span> <span id="s2138">I also spoke the language of course, so I went on that mission, and I took a few days off from the work problem to be able to visit my town, Balti.</span> <span id="s2139">At that time I wanted to see the synagogue in which my -- my grandfather was praying in his time, but it had been destroyed long before by the war, and very little was left from Balti -- from past Balti.</span> <span id="s2140">So I was told however that the new synagogue was created in a home, which was built like a usual home, a dwelling, but in -- it’s used as a synagogue and was taken there.</span> <span id="s2141">And then I saw there indeed, in ’94, through the people who are living in Balti, the Jews living in Balti, in a -- in a Saturday morning, with a full service done as -- by usual service.</span> <span id="s2142">My leader, th-the person who brought me there was my cousin, first cousin, Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I mentioned before, who was living with his family still at that time in Balti, in ’94.</span> <span id="s2143">He took me to the synagogue and explained to me -- I -- I wanted to have some kind of memory and I asked whether I can have something from that -- they say we cannot give you any sidur, because we have very little sidurim, there are not enough, we don’t have any other items.</span> <span id="s2144">But I notice in that corner, some cardboards with some inscriptions.</span> <span id="s2145">I say, “What are these?”</span> <span id="s2146">They say, “Well, these are things which we had to write when we opened up -- came back from -- from the camps and there were a lot of people who died in the camps, and those who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after them, pray.</span> <span id="s2147">But they didn’t know to the Kaddish, the Hebrew Kaddish words.</span> <span id="s2148">So we had to write the Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- with Cyrillic letters so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic letters, the -- the words of the Kaddish.</span> <span id="s2149">At that time we wrote -- we created the black -- the cardboards, and these are some of them.”</span> <span id="s2150">On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word from Kaddish, the dollit is missing.</span> <span id="s2151">Only k-u then sheen.</span> <span id="s2152">On the left hand corner is Kaddish the same word with Cyrillic letters, and then the whole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter.</span> <span id="s2153">[speaks Hebrew] ________ and so on.</span> <span id="s2154">And this is a prayer which Jews from all the entire world are saying in the memory of those whom they lost.</span> <span id="s2155">It was very moving to me to see that -- that document, historic document improvised, a product of the Holocaust whose -- who was needed because of the Holocaust, who will -- had to be manufactured by hand because there was no prayer books.</span> <span id="s2156">And I ask whether I can have at least one of them to me.</span> <span id="s2157">They said you can have them all because by now we have [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2158">And they ended up giving me three of them.</span> <span id="s2159">So I brought them with me.</span> <span id="s2160">One is this one, another one is in the Holocaust museum in New York.</span> <span id="s2161">The third one is with me still, waiting if your Holocaust museum, Joan, want to exhibit it, I’m happy to -- to give it there.</span> <span id="s2162">It is extremely meaningful for me because it is from the same town I was born and from the synagogue, but I believe it’s meaningful for the entire history of what the Holocaust mean -- meant, and how people came out of the Holocaust having to cry for those whom they lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Okay, and this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: This is a plaque, a memorial plaque which my mother commissioned after she arrived in the U.S. to -- for the memory of those in the family who died during the Holocaust and for the other people in the family who passed away.</span> <span id="s2165">She donated the money for planting trees in Israel in their memory, and then ordered this plaque and she’s -- it’s written there, this garden of trees in Israel is in honor of the families Faerstein, Catz and Baratz, the families which I mentioned, made by Shanya Faerstein Catz.</span> <span id="s2166">In parenthesis, Buchika which is a nickname which the small kids a -- you know, gave to her, my kids gave to my mother, Buchika, and this is how she was left in our family.</span> <span id="s2167">And on the left hand side there are the names of people who died in normal circumstances before, or maybe after the Holocaust, but not in camps.</span> <span id="s2168">It includes my grandfather, my grandmother and so on.</span> <span id="s2169">Some of them were in the Holocaust, my father, including my late wife, Stella Yavetz Catz Cernea.</span> <span id="s2170">On the right hand side are the names of many of those who died in Transnistria, I mean in the -- in the former Bessarabia, Balti and the other camps which I mentioned during my narrative.</span> <span id="s2171">All of them whom she knew as certainly having died in those camps by the time she -- she ordered this plaque.</span> <span id="s2172">Subsequently she found out that others, who are not here, also passed away, but their names are not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2173">In fact, there were more than the 25 she mentions here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: And which is the right side?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: This is the right side, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
