id="s312">Next to our ghetto we had a building with Russian prisoners, and they were wounded.</span> <span id="s313">And we had a doctor, Dr. Wollash.</span> <span id="s314">I h -- I don’t remember what I did yesterday, but I remember his name, and he was a doctor and he used to go every d -- every day and take care of them, whoever was needed and wounded.</span> <span id="s315">And he was going to their -- to the -- to their building and one day he comes in and -- and one day he comes in there, and a Russian prisoner says, doc, I gotta tell you a secret, but don’t you dare tell -- tell that I told you.</span> <span id="s316">And he says, well, what’s that secret?</span> <span id="s317">He says they’re digging graves in Cusack and in a day or two they’re gonna have liquidation for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s318">So he came to the ghetto and he says, in Jewish, kinderloch, run, because so and so and whatever.</span> <span id="s319">So my parents heard that and they -- they had a Ukraine family that they had no children, and they said -- my parents gave them money, gold, and whatever, jewelry, and they promised that they gonna save me and my older brother.</span> <span id="s320">And my mother and dad said that we should go there.</span> <span id="s321">And I said, no, I’m not going.</span> <span id="s322">If they going to kill you, I’m not going.</span> <span

id="s325">And she started to pack for me that we are leaving.</span> <span id="s326">And I says, if I go, I am not taking nothing, and I’m not going.</span> <span id="s327">And they said, no, we made arrangements, and you and your brother are gonna go there, and she’s gonna save us.</span> <span id="s328">And well, I said, I guess we have to go.</span> <span id="s329">And it got dark, it got maybe eight o’clock, nine o’clock, I’m not sure, and we ran out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s330">The ghetto was not wired, you can go.</span> <span id="s331">And we heard shooting.</span> <span id="s332">Somebody was shooting, and we hid under a bush.</span> <span id="s333">And then there was a -- I remember, was a -- like a -- not a -- pond, or what, and you had to cross that in order to run away, and we jumped over there, and I was 10 years old, 11 years old, I didn't know how to swim, and my brother pulled me out by my hair, and we -- he was a -- a man, a boy, and he stronger than I am, he knew how to swim, and he saved me.</span> <span id="s334">And we ran over that water, or whatever, I di -- I can’t tell you what it was.</span> <span id="s335">And we were hiding under that bush.</span> <span id="s336">And we went, we ran.</span> <span id="s337">It took us more than an hour, two hours to get to that -- to those people.</span> <span id="s338">And we came and it was already 10 o’clock.</span> <span id="s339">We knocked in the door, and we said, we came to you, and we didn’t say nothing, killing or whatever.</span> <span id="s340">And she said, oh my God, oh my God.</span> <span id="s341">And she said -- we said, we like to stay here for a day or two.</span> <span id="s342">And she says, oh, okay, then you can go in the barn and hi -- and sleep there.</span> <span id="s343">And we did.</span> <span id="s344">And in the morning she came, and she says, I heard that they killed already, everybody in Koretz.</span> <span id="s345">It’s -- everybody’s killed.</span> <span id="s346">And -- and we started to cry, and we knew that that’s it, they killed our parents and the two brothers.</span> <span id="s347">And every morning she would come in and tell us that we must leave because they gonna find out that she is hiding Jews, then they gonna kill her.</span> <span id="s348">And that was every morning.</span> <span id="s349">And she would bring us a piece of bread and a glass of milk.</span> <span id="s350">And anyway, I told my brother, I’m leaving.</span> <span id="s351">I can’t stay here.</span> <span id="s352">And he says, well, there’s nothing we can do.</span> <span id="s353">And I wa -- in the morning, I got up, and I says, I’m going.</span> <span id="s354">Because she would come in and she said we must leave.</span> <span
