Klein and I come from Hungary and we lived in a little town in Hungary, the name is Bodrogkisfalud.</span> <span id="s9">It’s a long name but a little town.</span> <span id="s10">Three, actually four, Jewish family lived in the town where I lived and I had a brother who was 15 ½ when they took us away.</span> <span id="s11">He was in the, in a big city where he went to Hebrew and Hungarian school.</span> <span id="s12">He lived there for already--but he come home for vacation and summer vacation--but he was in that school already for five years because my father wanted him to have a better education, Hebrew and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s13">He was taken away right from there with all the boys.</span> <span id="s14">It was a boy’s school.</span> <span id="s15">I never hear, never heared from him after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">GS: Do you know the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">SE: Yes, he was in a big city, Kosice.</span> <span id="s18">Kosice was in Czechoslovakia but later it became Hungary so they call it Kosice, it was a big city and we have some relatives there too so my mother figured it would be close to relatives and in a good school.</span> <span id="s19">My father begged him to come home March 19th when the Germans come in, they occupied Hungary, and my father begged him, "Come home, come home, be with us," and he said, "No, Daddy, I cannot go home.</span> <span id="s20">What would I do [in] that little village and I want to finish my education first."</span> <span id="s21">He didn’t figure they would took us away, but my father want us to be together but he don’t want to come home.</span> <span id="s22">He come home for Christmas vacation and Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, every vacation he come home during summer.</span> <span id="s23">He was with us for certain weeks then he went back to learn more Hebrew…</span></p> <p><span id="s24">GS: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SE: …in summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">GS: What type of education did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">SE: I have, they took me away at the ninth grade.</span> <span id="s28">I didn’t have a chance to finish ninth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">GS: Ok, did you have any type of Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">SE: Yes, I was at the same city for a couple, for one year, only one year…</span></p> <p><span id="s31">GS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">SE: …in a Hebrew school because my mother and my father want me to have some more Hebrew knowledge, and that was a Hungarian Hebrew, that was a regular school, boys and girls school.</span> <span id="s33">I was there only one year and after that, that was 300--150 mile away from us and after that I wanted to go home to be with Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I was mother girl.</span> <span id="s34">I don’t want to go back no more.</span> <span id="s35">And I have friends where we went to, it wasn’t a Catholic school, it was like a regular school, not a Catholic school, how you call it?</span> <span id="s36">Like here, not, not, how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">GS: Like a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SE: Public school, yeah, but there was a lot of Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s39">So when I went to the third grade we walked in two mile just because mother and father want us to be with Jewish kids together.</span> <span id="s40">First and second grade, I went to Catholic school because in my little village was only Catholic school and I couldn’t walk the two mile, but the minute I was able to walk, my brother become third grade and I become, I’m sorry, I become third grade and my brother become fourth, then we walked in, two miles every day back and forth.</span> <span id="s41">We took our lunch with us, not like other children, other children lived in, not so far like us.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">GS: Were there many Jews in your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">SE: No, we just have four Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">GS: And what were the relations with the non-Jewish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">SE: Our neighbors was very nice comparing to the rest of the villages.</span> <span id="s46">Our neighbors know my parents, my old father, I mean the grandfather too and they respect them, and they were really nice to us but the next village, when we walked in, they were hard time to walk in because, "All right Jews, give me candy."</span> <span id="s47">My father have a store and they figured I can bring candy for them but how I bring the candy for them, what I get from my father every night, he worked with us, teach us, and if we know our lesson, he give us a piece of chocolate, a small piece, reward us.</span> <span id="s48">And my father didn’t know it, I didn’t eat it and my brother didn’t eat it, because we cannot go into school, the kids they were bugging us, "Ok, Jews give us candy," and you have, there was only one road where we have to go through and that corner, they were always waiting for us for the candy and we give the candy for them, then we can go farther.</span> <span id="s49">But when you close it, I tell you further that story.</span> <span id="s50">I don’t want to tell here what was the end of the story.</span> <span id="s51">Can you close it please?</span> <span id="s52">[tape shut off temporarily]</span></p> <p><span id="s53">GS: Sylvia, you were going to tell an incident that happened walking to school and it involved the candy?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SE: Yes, my father would teach us every night instead of having a tutor.</span> <span id="s55">You cannot even get a tutor, so my father was teaching us every night, taking over the lesson and whenever we know our lesson or the timetable, he always give us a piece of candy or a piece of chocolate, that was the reward.</span> <span id="s56">But we didn’t eat the candy or the chocolate because when we go in two miles and one of the corner, we must pass that road where we have to go to school and the kids, the boys was standing and waiting for us.</span> <span id="s57">"Sylvie, Tibie [phonetic], give me your candy," and if we didn’t give our candy, they would run after us with stone and they was stoning us, and we have to run our heart out to run faster then they can reach us with the stone.</span> <span id="s58">One morning--one night we didn’t know our lesson and we don’t have no candy to take because my father only reward us if we know our lesson, and he didn’t give us candy because we didn’t know our homework, and we looked at each other with my brother, what we gonna give now for the kids if they gonna come?</span> <span id="s59">"All right kids--all right Jews, not kids--all right Jews where’s the candy?"</span> <span id="s60">And you always give it to them but this time we don’t have the candy and we start to run.</span> <span id="s61">They take the stones, whatever stones was, they were running after us, they want to stone us.</span> <span id="s62">So one day we don’t have the candy and I said to my father and my brother, I said, "We cannot go to school."</span> <span id="s63">"Why can’t you go to school?</span> <span id="s64">You’re not sick."</span> <span id="s65">"Yes, we not sick but we don’t want to tell you every morning, we have to give the candy for those kids, otherwise we cannot pass by because they’re running after us, all right Jews, give me your candy, and I have--you don’t give us candy tonight, I can, we cannot go to school."</span> <span id="s66">And my father said, "Ok, look, I tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s67">What you have to take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s68">I can’t be always with you.</span> <span id="s69">I can be never with you when you grow up.</span> <span id="s70">You have to learn how to take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s71">Here is a piece of stone."</span> <span id="s72">He give us a piece of stone but my brother don’t want to take it and he says, "No way!</span> <span id="s73">No way!"</span> <span id="s74">he said to me, "Sylvia you gonna take it in your hand, hold it this way and when they ask, give me your candy, give them the candy, punch up his…" how you call this?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">GS: Chin.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">SE: "Chin, punch up his chin with this stone.</span> <span id="s77">They have to learn once and for all, Jews or not Jews, you are, they don’t gonna get your candy because they were not working for it.</span> <span id="s78">You learn for it.</span> <span id="s79">Tonight you don’t know your lesson, you have no candy and you’re going to go to school."</span> <span id="s80">We were shaking in our boots, especially my brother, he was not a fighting type.</span> <span id="s81">I never fight myself either but maybe I can run faster like my brother did when they was throwing the stones, and I did it.</span> <span id="s82">We went that corner, we come to that corner, it was about a mile away from my house and when they asked the candy, I punched up his chin and was bleeding.</span> <span id="s83">I, myself get afraid because now they really gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s84">We were running like crazy to school, "Well, how we gonna go home?</span> <span id="s85">How we gonna go home because we have to take the same road to go home."</span> <span id="s86">There was no telephone I should call my father.</span> <span id="s87">Europe there was no telephone, how can I tell my father?</span> <span id="s88">We went all around, around, around, you know on other road, maybe other two miles, not to pass by to this corner.</span> <span id="s89">When I went home, I said to my father, "I did it but I am sorry, it was bleeding."</span> <span id="s90">So my father said, "Next time they will know not to hit you or hurt you.</span> <span id="s91">They have no right to hit you or hurt you."</span> <span id="s92">But afternoon, I saw the Joe mother and Joe come into my house and he asked, "Mr. Klein, why did you hurt my son?"</span> <span id="s93">He called me in.</span> <span id="s94">My father called me in, and although I don’t want to do it, but my father said, "You must take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s95">I can’t be with you every step in your life.</span> <span id="s96">If you won’t hurt him, you gonna learn your lesson, I’m gonna hurt you."</span> <span id="s97">So I had no choice, I just had to hurt him.</span> <span id="s98">And I explain it, why I was hurting Joe because he was running all the time after us, "Jews give me your candy," him and the rest of the boys and I have no candy that night because I didn’t know my lesson and the mother of the, Joe mother, he was shocked, she was shocked, and she took Joe hand and he, she ask him, "Is it true?"</span> <span id="s99">"Yes, they didn’t give me the chocolate.</span> <span id="s100">That’s why we run after them all the time because I want the chocolate."</span> <span id="s101">The mother of this Joe take this child and I’m telling you with all her might, she spanked this, her son, Joe, as hard as she can, and she said to him, "Why you do that?</span> <span id="s102">Sylvia had the right to do it, and I don’t you dare come to cry for me.</span> <span id="s103">She was right, and I don’t want to hear it again and I’m sorry Mr. Klein, my son did that."</span> <span id="s104">And my father said, "I understand it’s not your fault.</span> <span id="s105">You never teach him.</span> <span id="s106">I know you very well but the kids teach each other," and everything was ok after.</span> <span id="s107">Next time, they don’t ask no more candy from us, we pass by, never again they ask candy from us.</span> <span id="s108">Because they were afraid they were gonna get it.</span> <span id="s109">Yes, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">GS: Did you have any friends in the class that were non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">SE: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s112">I have a lot of friends in the classroom who were very nice.</span> <span id="s113">I have a lot of friends in my town because all my friends from the Catholic school, first and second grade, they were all my friends and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s114">In the town itself, there were some of them who wasn’t too nice.</span> <span id="s115">For instance, my father speaked German at that time, and there was across the street a neighbor who the mother was very nice and everybody was very nice except the son, who my father give him lesson because he went to high school already and always come to Mr. Klein to help him with the German and my father always helped him with his lesson.</span> <span id="s116">One Friday night we were just ready to close the store, because we were religious, and we closed the store [unclear] we pulled down the shade, there was shade from steel and this Joe came and he said, "Mr. Klein, what’s that mean kaput?"</span> <span id="s117">And my hus, my father said, "You know Joe, what’s that mean kaput, you know that word."</span> <span id="s118">"Yes, I know but, but we…," what you mean, "But?"</span> <span id="s119">"I just come from the next town," and we had a big river there across the street of the pasture and there was a Jewish kid who was coming from the Hebrew school, he couldn’t go home to Tokaj, so he come down where we lived, that was eight mile in the pasture.</span> <span id="s120">And the Germans they went and they shoot him through the big river.</span> <span id="s121">They were playing who can shoot?</span> <span id="s122">Ten soldiers was shooting the bocher [boy], and they said, "It’s kaput.</span> <span id="s123">That’s why I tell you kaput," and my father said nothing because he can’t tell, you should of shame of yourself to come and tell me this way.</span> <span id="s124">But that’s the way he let us know the Germans shooting the Jews under that town.</span> <span id="s125">That’s what that is and we went to school in that elementary school, regular elementary school and I was at the ninth grade.</span> <span id="s126">We went out for recess and the bell was ringing, one of the--principal actually, not the teacher, the principal said, "Jewish kids gonna make a line here and the Christian kids gonna make a line this way."</span> <span id="s127">The Christian kids went into the classroom all.</span> <span id="s128">We all the Jewish kids were standing in line from first grade till ninth grade.</span> <span id="s129">There was no teacher who would teach us.</span> <span id="s130">Not one of the teacher would volunteer to teach us, so we were standing there till lunchtime and finally one of the teacher who was of Russian descent, we find out that time, we didn’t know that he was a Russian descent.</span> <span id="s131">He said, "We gonna teach--I gonna teach you."</span> <span id="s132">And he teached the nine class from first grade, we went in all the Jewish kids in that one classroom, and this teacher was the only one who took us and teach us.</span> <span id="s133">The rest of the teachers, they don’t want to teach us, they don’t want to talk to us, nothing.</span> <span id="s134">When we went in to this classroom, all the kids, then we realized that we are Jews, really Jews.</span> <span id="s135">They hate us.</span> <span id="s136">If they don’t want to teach us, that means they hate us.</span> <span id="s137">There was not one teacher, just this man and he explained it to us.</span> <span id="s138">He’s a Russian descent and he knows what that means to be not a pure Hungarian because he was a Russian descent, and "I gonna teach you but what I gonna teach you remember but good.</span> <span id="s139">I expect you to learn," and he start to teach us.</span> <span id="s140">That was the--I still remember what he teach us, that was the first lesson.</span> <span id="s141">He said we human beings have brains.</span> <span id="s142">In Hungarian they call it a different way, we have èsz, èsz means brain.</span> <span id="s143">But animal has no èsz, no brain.</span> <span id="s144">They just have erston, they have sense.</span> <span id="s145">They will remember for 15 minutes what you tell them and you have to repeat, and repeat, and repeat, that’s the only time they gonna remember.</span> <span id="s146">That was the first time I heard that story.</span> <span id="s147">I never knew it, because we lived in the town and we always had ducks, but I was never thinking they have no ase, they have no brain, you know?</span> <span id="s148">That’s the time--that was the first lesson that he teached.</span> <span id="s149">And then one day, before Easter, we cannot go no more, no more from one village to the next, and this village was where I went to school, the next village.</span> <span id="s150">So I cannot go no more school because Jews were not allowed to go from one village to the next village and they have to put on the yellow star.</span> <span id="s151">Then our--then we know who was our friend in my town, in my little town, they were spitting on us, dirty Jews, from my own friends some of them.</span> <span id="s152">My own friends when we put out the, when you have to put on the yellow star.</span> <span id="s153">Then we really find out who was my friend, who was my real schoolmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">GS: Was that in April 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">SE: That’s right.</span> <span id="s156">That was April 1944.</span> <span id="s157">The Germans come in March 19th.</span> <span id="s158">But the minute they come in, we cannot go no more from one village to the next.</span> <span id="s159">We were closed in to our home and then they took us to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">GS: And where was the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">SE: Satoraljaujhely, ok?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">GS: What…?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">SE: That was about 50 miles from us, where we lived, but that was exactly one--next day after our Jewish Easter, next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">GS: Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SE: Passover, right after our Passover, but at Passover my uncle wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s166">He was in labor camp and my two aunts, three aunts was there and a little girl was eight year old, her name is Katy and they want to hear the seder, but how they gonna hear the seder?</span> <span id="s167">My uncle was in the labor camp, one of my aunt’s husbands was in the labor camp, the little girl father was in the labor camp, so we walked down about a mile where my aunt lived and we had the seder at their house because we don’t want all of them to walk to our place.</span> <span id="s168">It’s very funny when all the Jews coming to one place.</span> <span id="s169">My father went first, then I went, my brother wasn’t home, my brother was in that city, and then my mother further away from me, like we don’t walk together, and then we went into the house, to my aunt house and we had the seder.</span> <span id="s170">We cried through all night.</span> <span id="s171">My father said this, all the seder, but we cried through all night because we were so much of afraid they gonna come in, the German gonna break down the door.</span> <span id="s172">And I was at that time 14 ½ year old and I never saw my father crying in my life, but that time I saw my father and my mother crying.</span> <span id="s173">I couldn’t really pick it up so fast, how come my father cry?</span> <span id="s174">Is it really so bad?</span> <span id="s175">But I was shaking, because that time we cannot walk from one village to the other.</span> <span id="s176">I cannot go to school and I was afraid, I know that something gonna happen, and we finished up the seder and we walked home.</span> <span id="s177">It was still cold and I was freezing and shaking till we don’t go into the house.</span> <span id="s178">It was nice.</span> <span id="s179">The moonlight night, it was such a beautiful moonlight night and I was so much of afraid that I couldn’t wait till I go into the house, to my house, and finally we, I didn’t ask my father or my mother, I don’t want to ask my father or my mother why they were crying because I know why they were crying but I couldn’t figure out how come this was so horrible if my father cry and my mother cry.</span> <span id="s180">Then come Saturday, it was between one Saturday, between--because Pesach is eight day.</span> <span id="s181">And came one Saturday and my mother stayed home.</span> <span id="s182">Me, my father and me, we went down to see and how my aunt and my three aunt, was three girl, three women and a little girl.</span> <span id="s183">So afternoon we went down with my father and when we come home, my mother was shaking and she don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s184">"What happened Mama?"</span> <span id="s185">I ask.</span> <span id="s186">The German came in and they pick up one of the beds from our bedroom.</span> <span id="s187">There was like here the two bed what goes together with a little thing, clinched together.</span> <span id="s188">They pick up one bed and take it away, and my mother was afraid they even gonna kill her because they went in, "Jews, give me your furniture."</span> <span id="s189">So my mother figured everything they gonna take.</span> <span id="s190">But they took one bed, only one bed for themselves.</span> <span id="s191">Somebody wanted to sleep in a bed and they took my mother, my mother bed, and we were, I was a child but I was so much of afraid, I was so shaken, they gonna come again and they gonna do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">GS: What had happened to your father’s store in the meanwhile?</span> <span id="s193">Was he able to still operate?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">SE: In the meantime, we were operating, but we Jews, we were not allowed to sell flour, sugar, petroleum.</span> <span id="s195">None of the Jews' store, was able to sell all this stuff.</span> <span id="s196">In the meantime people go to shop, they don’t want to shop this in my store, the rest of the things because they gonna go where they can buy the salt and everything, but my father was a, have to go back.</span> <span id="s197">He just come home, he just come home, he was a labor camp too.</span> <span id="s198">My father was in the labor camp

can pick up from the garden, that’s what we were living but that was already wintertime, so we saved--my mother saved some apple and some beans and potatoes.</span> <span id="s207">So we lived on that

id="s211">When my father was in the labor camp, I was so much of afraid we close the door, even nobody was coming in at that time because Hungarian people, the neighbors, they don’t go to steal from one another, you know?</span> <span id="s212">But the--we were always afraid that maybe some stranger is gonna come in, but when my father came home, I was so relieved my father is home and nothing

we have no bathroom.</span> <span id="s241">We just have a wash, a little room where we wash ourself in a, from a dish."</span> <span id="s242">But then I, I said to myself, "They don’t mean dirty,

"Do a good job because a year is too long and my grandmother used to say: a year is too long and you don’t know who gonna take it off [out] and I don’t want them to say that was--you were not doing a good job."</span> <span id="s255">And I said to myself, when my mother said, who go, "God knows who gonna take it off."</span> <span id="s256">What my mother mean, "Who gonna take it off?</span> <span id="s257">Why we don’t take that off?"</span> <span id="s258">I wasn’t thinking they gonna take us away.</span> <span id="s259">I wasn’t thinking of that, we won’t stay there in the house.</span> <span id="s260">And all of the sudden came morning and I, we washed the dishes and we have to go on steps to bring it to… [tape one, side one ended] Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s261">GS: This is side two of the interview with Sylvia Ebner.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">SE: Ok, so we were, I was washed it, I washed the dishes, dryed it, and I went to the steps, step ladder, how high, it was high, high there, not like here, step ladder have to go up high, and I bring up the dishes, and I just came down, I was up the step ladder and I saw my Aunt Olga come in and fall in [fainted].</span> <span id="s263">We have the sukkah.</span> <span id="s264">That was the summer kitchen; the sukkah was our summer kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">GS: Ok.</span></p>

<span id="s269">You know, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s270">I get scared.</span> <span id="s271">She was 24 years, 26 year old.</span> <span id="s272">And my father went and take a dish and poured the cold water on her and finally she come to herself, she said, "Make some food right away because the next town, Jews, they were picked up and they just marched front of our house with the gendarme.</span> <span id="s273">The gendarme taking all the Jews from the next town and they gonna come for us any minute but if we have some food put up fast."</span> <span id="s274">But we cooked with the regular stove, not gas.</span> <span id="s275">We had, we have wood stove and my mother got so nervous, what to cook, what to do, we have some leftover, you know, at least put it and warm it up and eat it, and we have fruit garden and every time when the fruit fall down my mother cut it up to pieces and dried it.</span> <span id="s276">My mother cut up the fruit and dried it and that was for wintertime, you know?</span> <span id="s277">Mother went and put a dish full of apple, those dried fruit and cooked it and we have some leftover, but bake, they have, we have no time to bake, they said, my aunt said, "You have no time to bake because I saw they carried just, just as much what they can carry on their back."</span> <span id="s278">That was around 9:30, 10:00.</span> <span id="s279">12:00 the gendarme come and, "Let’s go Jews, let’s go, let’s go."</span> <span id="s280">What they mean, "Let’s go," I said to myself.</span> <span id="s281">"Where will we go?</span> <span id="s282">Well what do you mean, let’s go?</span> <span id="s283">Where you wanna take me?"</span> <span id="s284">But I was afraid to ask.</span> <span id="s285">The gendarme was not like here, the police.</span> <span id="s286">They were with, how you call that?</span> <span id="s287">Feather on the, on their hat, and they know us, they know us because they every time they come to check the store it is clean or not.</span> <span id="s288">This time they don’t know us no more.</span> <span id="s289">They don’t want to know us no more.</span> <span id="s290">But when they come to check the store, years before, years before ’42 that time was Mr., Mr. Klein.</span> <span id="s291">This time, "Let’s go Jews.</span> <span id="s292">Let’s go."</span> <span id="s293">And I said, "Where will we go?"</span> <span id="s294">"Pick up what you can pick, fast.</span> <span id="s295">Put it on your back."</span> <span id="s296">We have no valise.</span> <span id="s297">In Europe there was no valise.</span> <span id="s298">We lived in a little town.</span> <span id="s299">How you gonna take that few thing?</span> <span id="s300">Takes fast, whatever you can carry, that’s all you can take.</span> <span id="s301">First thing was the bedding, that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s302">You have to take bedding, because that’s what my father said, "Let’s pick up some bedding and let’s pick up the food what we have."</span> <span id="s303">But my father said, "Even if we pick up the beans and the potatoes and the flour, where we gonna cook it?"</span> <span id="s304">So we didn’t pick up any beans and any potatoes, just what we have ready and a couple of things what we can carry with us.</span> <span id="s305">My fath--my mother was carrying the bedding.</span> <span id="s306">In Europe we had different bedding, like here the heavy bedding with the goose down, goose down cover, you know?</span> <span id="s307">It wasn’t bedding like here.</span> <span id="s308">Like here you know those blankets, those light things, it was heavy, so my mother put it on her back and my father put it on his back, and I carry what I carry in my two hands, dishes.</span> <span id="s309">My father said, "Shall we take dishes," you know?</span> <span id="s310">"Yes, take some dishes."</span> <span id="s311">"Ok, if we can carry dishes, then we have to take some food, potatoes or something, so we carried whatever we could.</span> <span id="s312">We, they took us, put us up on a, there was already a horse and buggy front of our house, and they said, "Up on the horse and buggy, on the carriage," and we went up.</span> <span id="s313">"Where they gonna, where they gonna take us?"</span> <span id="s314">We figured you know and the st--the station was just about maybe 400 steps from us but no, they took us to the third town with the carriage because in the meantime we picked up all the Jews from my town and the next town, and then they took us in the third town and picked up all the Jews around, everywhere was carriages already, you know?</span> <span id="s315">And they put us up on the carriage--we went about two blocks from my house, from our house--two blocks, and I looked back.</span> <span id="s316">I have a beautiful little dog, I always love animals, I love dogs and cats even here I have, for 32 years I have cats and dogs all the time.</span> <span id="s317">And I look back and my little dog was running after us as fast as he can with his little foot.</span> <span id="s318">He was running after us, after the carriage, because I left her there.</span> <span id="s319">And I said to my mother, "Why don’t you stop and pick up Morzsa?"</span> <span id="s320">Her name was Morzsa--Itty Bitty, that’s why I have Pici here in my house, because her name was--Itty Bitty means Morzsa.</span> <span id="s321">That’s why I have here Morzsa, and I put my dog name and [cleared throat] when we, when I looked back I saw my little dog running after us and I saw people are going into our yard.</span> <span id="s322">I said, I asked my mother, "Mother why are they going in to our yard?"</span> <span id="s323">We have a big yard, a long yard with fruit trees and everything.</span> <span id="s324">"Why are they going in?"</span> <span id="s325">I said.</span> <span id="s326">She said to me, "Honey, don’t look back.</span> <span id="s327">Don’t look back."</span> <span id="s328">My mother know it, why they went in.</span> <span id="s329">They come, they went in already to steal, the minute we were, the second corner of the house, it was a long street you know, and my mother know it, they went in to steal but she don’t, she don’t want to tell me.</span> <span id="s330">The last minute I never forget.</span> <span id="s331">She said to me, "Put this under…" we have those closets, those furniture, the one furnitures where we keep our closet, our bedding nicely, we iron it and everything was my mother put it, everything nicely to make it surely straight, and she said to me, "Sylvia fix this up because that doesn’t look good."</span> <span id="s332">When we look back already they were going, running in and my mother know why they running in, and they took us to the, to my aunt’s place from my house, they took us to my aunt’s place, they picked up my aunt and my little cousin, then we went to the next town, there was one Jewish family.</span> <span id="s333">There was one Jewish family, they picked up that family and then we go to the third village where they picked up the [unclear] 10 or 12 carriage was already, where they picked up all the Jews and the people, you know?</span> <span id="s334">We have a carriage, we have, we were in one carriage, my aunt was in the other carriage, you know?</span> <span id="s335">And, in the meantime, while we were going on the carriage the mail lady came, and she was running after us, "Mrs. Klein, I have a letter from your son," and she give it, gived the letter from my mother because she know that my mother was always waiting for the letter.</span> <span id="s336">She was a nice lady, a nice lady, and she was the mail lady, she was carrying the mail and she said, "Mrs. Klein, here is a letter from your son," because she knows it my mother was always waiting the letter from her son.</span> <span id="s337">That was the last letter what my mother got from my brother.</span> <span id="s338">My mother and my father was with us so thank God my father was there because I figured no, no, nobody can hurt me because my father is there.</span> <span id="s339">Then they took us to that place, to that third village.</span> <span id="s340">I never knowed the neighbors, only one of them, who [unclear] one of the young lady who was later on my sister-in-law, who become my sister-in-law later on, when we both come from back, from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s341">We were at together, they took us first to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s342">Where would they put us in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s343">I heard the ghetto, they were talking but I don’t, I couldn’t figure what is ghetto, you know?</span> <span id="s344">There, only on the road we heard that they going to take us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s345">What is ghetto?</span> <span id="s346">Ghetto was that where was fenced in one of the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s347">The most Jewish, that was the most Jewish neighborhood in Satoraljaujhely that we had, that was a city.</span> <span id="s348">And they bring us in to one of the Jewish house and there was the kitchen not bigger than this kitchen like we are here, my Aunt Berszka, Carmill [phonetic], Olga, and her little girl, eight and the three of us was laying on the, there that’s going to be our room, kitchen.</span> <span id="s349">That’s where we were sleeping, on the, there was no linoleum there, there was wood floor.</span> <span id="s350">At least wasn’t so cold like linoleum.</span> <span id="s351">At that time it was after Easter in Hungary, no more cold.</span> <span id="s352">It’s not hot, but it’s not so cold.</span> <span id="s353">Well where you going to go to the toilet?</span> <span id="s354">Toilet was on the, it was a big, big house and it was one toilet in the middle of the yard, in the middle of the yard was one toilet.</span> <span id="s355">That’s where we all, the whole house, that was the whole house there, from the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s356">I never forget when somebody wanted to come in the kitchen at night from the rest of the rooms or for the, for you know this people, this had two rooms, two bedrooms, a corridor, even the corridor were people laying, because they pushed in as much Jews as much they can in one house and my mother said, "Stand up," middle of the night.</span> <span id="s357">What you mean, "Stand up?"</span> <span id="s358">Because they want to make warm something for the kids, so I have to stand up otherwise they would step on you, there was no room.</span> <span id="s359">There was no room there, so we have to stand up till they make it warm then we go back to, not a bed, on the floor.</span> <span id="s360">We were there for--my aunt wasn’t there, my aunt and, no, no, not this aunt, my, this aunt was there.</span> <span id="s361">This three aunt was there, but later on they

staying in the synagogue on the floor, that’s where they were, living.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">GS: How long were you in this little house?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">SE: In this, in this

our aunt where she lived.</span> <span id="s370">Also in the ghetto, that was a ghetto, it was the same street, you know?</span> <span id="s371">The same neighborhood, you cannot get out from the ghetto, it was impossible to get out from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">GS: Were there any activities organized for the children or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">SE: Nothing, nothing, nothing--nothing, nothing, absolutely one dress I have and one dress I took because you cannot carry so much.</span> <span id="s374">You cannot carry so much you know?</span> <span id="s375">And then

all the Jews in the synagogue, closer and closer, closer to the synagogue, whoever was no room in the synagogue are laying on the ground, on the synagogue ground.</span> <span id="s377">And one afternoon, but how, what I eat there, I can’t remember, would you believe it?</span> <span id="s378">I can’t remember if that, only once I remember we ate, my mother made some cholent in the baker, we

id="s383">There was, you cannot wash it, there was no place to wash it.</span> <span id="s384">For four weeks, we didn’t wash ourself.</span> <span id="s385">There was no bathroom, there was no bath, where you can wash yourself, for four weeks, so my father cut it off.</span> <span id="s386">I have long hair to my waist, cut it off, that was my first shock because I was a teenager and I was so proud of my hair, and I take such a good care at home, my mother used to, even so I was a teenager, my mother used to wash my hair all the time, and she cut it down, cut it down, and she, they were afraid it’s gonna, we gonna have the tic.</span> <span id="s387">Finally, they took us to that, to that synagogue.</span> <span id="s388">There was Jewish people with children, young and old, and crying at night, walking on top of each other because we were so piled up there.</span> <span id="s389">One day I have Aunt there.</span> <span id="s390">We met there in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s391">They live far away from us.</span> <span id="s392">I never know them before, because in Europe, I was 12 year old when I first sit on the train.</span> <span id="s393">I, we not like here,

bring into that Satoraljaujhely.</span> <span id="s396">They bring all the Jews there and they lived, packing us in to each other.</span> <span id="s397">And I met this cousin there, at the synagogue because by then they bring them into the synagogue, the beautiful little girl, Klárika, beautiful.</span> <span id="s398">And Elsa nèni was a young woman, her husband was not there anymore and Linka nèni husband died and Elsa nèni husband died, but that little girl, we loved her so much and we were playing all the time with her.</span> <span id="s399">We were in that synagogue and all the sudden one afternoon, we were there for at least two weeks in the synagogue to piled up but I can’t remember what I eat, even if you kill me, I am trying to think back, where my mother took the food or what I eat, I can’t remember, like washed out completely.</span> <span id="s400">And one night we were sleeping next to each other naturally, we were already sleeping next to each other.</span> <span id="s401">Every family was trying to be close each other.</span> <span id="s402">My aunt, my mother and then the little girl, we were all on the floor, sleeping there and one day they took, I, we

this people use to send them from the post office, there is somebody from the gendarme and that’s why they bring.</span> <span id="s412">You have relatives in America, and my aunt, my Aunt Elza, we call her Aunt because everybody was all Aunt we called it, and she said every time they were hollering, "This is for your aunt in America.</span> <span id="s413">This is for that Jew in America."</span> <span id="s414">and they hit him, they almost black and blue till he come home, she was black and blue, she was screaming, crying, she can’t sit because it was right--and I see that my mother crying too, but again I still say, "How is that possible because we’re Jews, that’s why," but America, I always heard from America because my mother lived ten year in New York when she was a

only four year old.</span> <span id="s418">She was a young woman, she looked like an old woman, broken, broken, busted all the way down.</span> <span id="s419">It was a horrible, horrible time, it was a horrible time, and about two weeks we were in that, in that synagogue, all the Jews and all of the sudden one afternoon said, "Everybody out," in Hungarian language because the gendarme, all the police was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s420">There was, we didn’t see no SS at that time, just in my town, but in the ghetto I didn’t see no SS there, only Hungarian SS Police, they took it

we were sure we go there.</span> <span id="s677">In the meantime they bring us into B Lager, not to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s678">We were so surprised, you know?</span> <span

if they check you, God forbid, right away they put on underwear because we were separating those packages that was near the station and they bring in with big, big wagon all the stuff what we Jewish people were carrying, all the big packages, valises, everything was there, and clothing what we bring in, our clothing there, we took us, we cannot change the top because we have a number on it, on the gray unless we have a red mark you know?</span> <span id="s695">And they give us number and Haftling, we were Haftlings [prisoners] so we cannot change the top but we put up underwear and we change right away our shoes and the hat, the kerchief instead of one, we double it, triple it, you know, and then we put it on our head.</span> <span id="s696">We gonna go back to the camp, you know?</span> <span id="s697">What do you think I was sitting on the toilet, they call it toilet latrine.</span> <span id="s698">Latrine mean rod like this here, and you sit there on that thing when you have to go to the toilet and you sit, that’s where you see right away, who is who, that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s699">"Who are you?"</span> <span id="s700">And I ask, "Where you come from?"</span> <span id="s701">Hungarian, you know?</span> <span id="s702">She said, "I am from Fershiga [phonetic] and right away I recognize my cousin, my cousin voice.</span> <span id="s703">She said Fershiga, I look at that, we don’t recognize each other because we were all run down already but the voice I recognize, we recognize it--Sylvia, Margo, you know?</span> <span id="s704">[Hungarian phrase] "How they--how you come here, how you come?"</span> <span id="s705">She said she’s under the next Lager, next block, about four or five block away and I was already in Brzézinka, "Oh my God," right away I took off my hat, you know, and I tell her, I just have single then, you know?</span> <span id="s706">And the first thing was to change her shoes.</span> <span id="s707">She had no shoes and I have already good shoes.</span> <span id="s708">Right then in the toilet I changed her shoes right, but she has small foot, that her shoes was still from home and I have always a big foot, but I don’t care, I have to take it, I have to change it, ok, but what, how I gonna give her food, the minute we were in that Brzézinka, you know, we were allowed, we get half a bread, half a bread, brown bread.</span> <span id="s709">We cut it in pieces, we cut it in slices, because there was knife and we put a marmalade, you know, in, schmaltz, what anything was good we put it in, you know, anything food we put it in, we thought we didn’t know we gonna meet anybody, but whoever was with me in the barrack, they all was there, they all was working there, but for our cell.</span> <span id="s710">But when I met her, right away you know, I went, I run into my barrack, "Wait here," and I give her and my cousin have the food there too, right away, we give her food and we give her so much she can bring to her sisters.</span> <span id="s711">Every night we come home, we were coming into the Lager maybe four weeks from that Lager, from Brzézinka, we come into the same Lager to sleep.</span> <span id="s712">You know, where we were, they put us first, and every night we were packing in food but this time we get smarter because people get already their stomachache, running stomach you know?</span> <span id="s713">So what we do, we have, there was Tablett, there was some kind of a tablet what stopped the running stomach, and we find there so many medicine between the packages, not everybody was so poor like we were, you know?</span> <span id="s714">From all the… [tape two, side one ended] Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s715">GS: …two, side two, an interview with Sylvia Ebner.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">SE: You know and there in that Brzézinka, everything we have to bring in, all the big packages.</span> <span id="s717">It was a long barrack, was maybe ten barracks.</span> <span id="s718">One was separated, we, we, they bring into us, so we have to put separate, underwear, men underwear, women underwear, tallis, tefillin, and all the shoulder pads, we have to check the shoulder pads, they know it, they know the Jews gonna hide the gold and whatever they have.</span> <span id="s719">Even so, before we have to go to the Townhouse and bring in all the jewelry, they said, they were--bum, bum, bum, bum, bum:"Every Jew should bring all their jewelry and everything to the, to the city hous--Townhouse," whom the hell they were saying that, we were altogether four Jews, we were all around the town, but every goy have to hear that, "All the Jews have to bring in their jewelry," and everything.</span> <span id="s720">But my father outsmart them, I tell you later on, let me finish that.</span> <span id="s721">Ok, this place was all the clothing, everything, and we have to separate--ladies, separate men’s, separate children, separate the soap, separate the medicine, the, the, the meat, the schmaltz--how you call the schmaltz--the oil things, separate.</span> <span id="s722">We have an elderly woman from my town also working at the same place with two of her daughter, and she find her own package, what she bring in.</span> <span id="s723">She find her own package, and those people wasn’t poor, and they have a lot of jewelry.</span> <span id="s724">She find it and she said, "Kids, we find good jewelry, we don’t gonna throw..." there was a valise, you have to throw it in monies, jewelries, we have to check all the bottom of the sweaters, where anything that was turned back because they know the Jews was hiding the jewelry, you know?</span> <span id="s725">And we have to pull it out and throw it in that valise.</span> <span id="s726">I never in my life saw so much jewelry, money, dollar, first time I saw dollar in my life, everything but this woman said to us, Mrs. Adler, I think her name was Adler.</span> <span id="s727">She said, "If we find something kids, just to put it into the ground," the barrack where we work, it was covered both sides but the ground was ground, you know?</span> <span id="s728">It wasn’t wood or cement.</span> <span id="s729">It was ground.</span> <span id="s730">And everybody take a piece of carpet and there we were working on the carpet, Jews bring the carpet, Persian carpet and everybody was allowed to work on that, because they don’t want the clothing to get dirty, so here they allow us to work on the carpet.</span> <span id="s731">"Lift up the carpet and push it into the ground, push it into the ground, deep into the ground," that lady said.</span> <span id="s732">We wouldn’t think of it but this lady said, we won’t think of it, you know?</span> <span id="s733">You should have seen later on the people, the Polish people they went and they were selling it by the bucket, the ground, they know it.</span> <span id="s734">They know there is jewelry in but they were smart, they take out the jewelry and they sell the ground for their friend.</span> <span id="s735">They take out the jewelry and the friend, they sell the ground for the, for the, because in that place everybody know we were, there was jewelry, and they no dummies.</span> <span id="s736">They figured they throw it in the, they shtup it in, you know?</span> <span id="s737">But they were smarter, they kept the jewelry and they sell their own friend the ground.</span> <span id="s738">Maybe they put some junk in it, one piece here and there, and everybody was buying the ground, because the Jews put the jewelry there.</span> <span id="s739">So here I was and all of the sudden come around, every day, oh no four weeks we went into the same camp, after we sleep over already.</span> <span id="s740">We didn’t go every day in to the camp till we working, till we went to the camp, my cousin was all right because we bring in the food, if they would find out, we stealing food, first thing would be cut off our hair, what we don’t have no hair, but already growed a little bit, it was four week.</span> <span id="s741">Like here you know when you cut it down completely, so slowly it start to work.</span> <span id="s742">That would be the first thing to cut our hair.</span> <span id="s743">Second thing, we would never be able to go to Brzézinka, that was comparing, that was something where you can find food, steal food.</span> <span id="s744">My cousin was very good stealer.</span> <span id="s745">She was older cousin.</span> <span id="s746">She was very smart, and always watching the German, the German didn’t see if she was already there and pulled some food out and bring it in and give it to us.</span> <span id="s747">But anyhow, we bring in four week the food for my cousin, and later on we put in medicine in the bread.</span> <span id="s748">If they would find it, I’m sure we won’t go no more there to work or they would hit us, kill us.</span> <span id="s749">It was really, we risk our life.</span> <span id="s750">So my cousin give me that shoes, I don’t ask how I went into that place, and we have to march, you know, one, two, three, march.</span> <span id="s751">What happened, we were there for two weeks, and all of the sudden the other, and every day we changed shoes, every day.</span> <span id="s752">Somebody come and we give it to them because shoes was finished already, we were there already six weeks and the, the mud and everything, eat it up.</span> <span id="s753">All of the sudden I see a girl come in that was from the second village where I lived.</span> <span id="s754">I saw her only once and she said to me, "Sylvie, my sister’s shoes is very bad.</span> <span id="s755">Can we change it?"</span> <span id="s756">So I change the shoes from her foot and she give her shoes for her sister, and she has again a small foot.</span> <span id="s757">"How I gonna go in?"</span> <span id="s758">and it was already rotten and everything, and they know we work there and they know we have to have shoes already on us.</span> <span id="s759">"How am I going to make it to look like a shoes?"</span> <span id="s760">you know?</span> <span id="s761">I took the, we get jam, we get jam, you know?</span> <span id="s762">Marmalade…</span></p> <p><span id="s763">GS: Oh, ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">SE: Marmalade, and I smeared it in the shoes to look like, you know, like a good shoes, doesn’t, shouldn’t look like a used out shoes because if they would find out, they know I am already working there and I have a good shoes.</span> <span id="s765">I remember when I marched by in that door, Arbeit Mache der Leben Süss, and there were SS watching on both sides, so fast I marching when I, and I was in already.</span> <span id="s766">My God, a big stone went down after somebody else, I was standing it was the place there to sleep.</span> <span id="s767">They give us the place there to sleep, and we were--this come the blue dress.</span> <span id="s768">Here we get the blue dress and the other barrack, there were--crema--near the crematorium, it was so near the crematorium, not as far like that tree, no, maybe three times like that kitchen, we were so close to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s769">And the one barrack was the red, blu--tüp, the wine tüp and the other barrack was the blue tüp and I was in the blue, blue dot.</span> <span id="s770">Dressed up, everybody have to have blue dress and everybody in the other barrack have to have red dress, but there we weren’t no more, we aren’t going in no more to the, to the place.</span> <span id="s771">Every day while we were marching in for four days--four weeks they come the Sonderkomando, you know what is the Sonderkomando?</span> <span id="s772">.</span> <span id="s773">They were carrying a big junk of wood on their, on their shoulder, and we know why for they carry, because we know already there was a crematory and we know this, this, this people by then they put them and they change them and you know that was the Sonderkomando, they call it.</span> <span id="s774">Anyhow, we were sleeping on the barrack and every morning we would march out to work, sorry.</span> <span id="s775">Every morning we march out to work, at night we come back and we sleep there, and food they give us junk, came Yom Kippur they give us the best of food.</span> <span id="s776">No, wait a minute that was Tisha B'Av, first was Tisha B'Av, yeah, when we fast, they give us the best of food, the best of food.</span> <span id="s777">But you think we ate?</span> <span id="s778">That girl said, "Don’t eat girls, don’t eat that," because this have bacon and milk and some tzibele [onion] cooked together, "So don’t eat it because this is bacon and things," so definitely we didn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s779">They couldn’t believe it, and the Jewish girls was, who take care of the barrack, they threw it out, you know, they threw it out because they don’t want the Germans to see we didn’t eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">GS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">SE: You know?</span> <span id="s782">They threw it out because they don’t want Germans to see we didn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s783">Anyhow it was--we know some--we know already everything.</span> <span id="s784">All day we see there was not enough room in the crematorium, it was so fast, the [unclear] the people was coming in, they were big ditches and we saw when they throw in the people in the ditches.</span> <span id="s785">First, first, there was no tent front of us, there was only wire, but they, they later on, they don’t want us to see, so they put the blanket, they covered all, they used all the blankets what we Jews was bringing to make a cover, like a shield us, shield us from the peop--, we should not see the crematorium.</span> <span id="s786">You know, that time we didn’t see no more the crematorium because first of all we were not interested because we know, what is it, you know, and then they cover it down, cover it down with the things.</span> <span id="s787">Once we, before it was covered down, there was a man from Munkacs, he burn his own children, his own family, as he told us.</span> <span id="s788">"Can you imagine what I did today," he said, "I had to burn my own children."</span> <span

Polish girls in our line you know, hollering there take off your glasses because they gonna take you to a transport, take off your, you know, you tell them you know how to sew or you tell them you work in an office, that’s why, you know, take off.</span> <span id="s1061">So I figure Polaner that all, but they’re friend, why would they holler that take off your glasses or, or you know how to sew, tell you are a sewer, but we were the first on the line, we had no choice, we had to march, and when I heard that, you know, and my girlfriend have glasses, she was, she was, she can see but she cannot work, she cannot sew.</span> <span id="s1062">I said Dudush, her name was Dudush, take off your glasses and put it in somewhere, hide it somewhere.</span> <span id="s1063">Well she hide it, she hide it under the, under the arm in the dress.</span> <span id="s1064">It’s really, they come a German and come a Jewish girl, a German girl, a German man and he was asking who is a sewer and who was working in the office, and I, right away, I learned to sew what I didn’t sew at that time.</span> <span id="s1065">I was fourteen and a half year old.</span> <span id="s1066">But my father, my aunt was a dressmaker and she said you have to go to a corner to learn how to sew because you won’t be there all the time, you must have something in your hand.</span> <span id="s1067">My mother said, "No, I don’t want her to go because if she sew, she learn how to sew…," my mother was a sewer here for ten year, my mother was working in a factory while she was in America.</span> <span id="s1068">And she said, "If she gonna learn how to sew, she have to sew all her life," like she wouldn’t know it, she knowed, she felt it.</span> <span id="s1069">"I don’t want her to go, to learn to sew."</span> <span id="s1070">And my father said, "Yes, she must learn a trade."</span> <span id="s1071">So at night my aunt was teaching me how to sew and I said right away, "I am a sewer."</span> <span id="s1072">I was in the first line and my girlfriend, she come right after me.</span> <span id="s1073">I am, I work in an office, she don’t wait, so we were there from the 3,000 girls they choose about 35 girls all together, 35 girls from the 3,000.</span> <span id="s1074">They took us in one place, you know?</span> <span id="s1075">And then we march back and the rest of the girls march back to the barrack too.</span> <span id="s1076">We all march back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s1077">Then went one week, went two week, they still--they catch us again to work, catch us again to work, catch me to work, my girlfriend come with me because she don’t want to be alone, and finally that morning they didn’t catch us.</span> <span id="s1078">She went in and they catch me to for the Scheissewaggon, she looked back, I wasn’t there already.</span> <span id="s1079">That was after three or four weeks and they choose us for this transport, and it was raining, and I was so dissapointed and so much low.</span> <span id="s1080">I was coming back from the Scheissewaggon walking slowly because then we can go into the barrack, ok?</span> <span id="s1081">In the meantime, I met some people from the next town, the Tokaj and I asked her, "Where you from?"</span> <span id="s1082">She said, "I am from Tokaj" "Do you know my cousin?"</span> <span id="s1083">"Yes, I know Edith.</span> <span id="s1084">I know Rachel," so we were already friends, you know?</span> <span id="s1085">But we were walking slowly, and finally I went into my, my, I want to go into the house, into the barrack and she was in another barrack.</span> <span id="s1086">In a minute I run in to her, "I saw my girlfriend," you know?</span> <span id="s1087">"My Lager sister."</span> <span id="s1088">"Where, were you, I didn’t you see you.</span> <span id="s1089">I said, "They catch me too."</span> <span id="s1090">"They want to put somebody into your place, we gonna go with the transport.</span> <span id="s1091">Where, were you?"</span> <span id="s1092">They want to put in--the Polish Jews, they want to put in--once they said the Hungarian, I don’t know, you were there when the Polish woman said the Hungarian was very bad to us, the Hungarian people was very bad to us.</span> <span id="s1093">He said to me, when I never hurt nobody, he was like wanted to kill me right then in that synagogue, you know?</span> <span id="s1094">And the Polish people, I’ll tell you between you and me, they were [unclear], they were there very long.</span> <span id="s1095">No wonder they become like rude.</span> <span id="s1096">They were looking only for themself, you know?</span> <span id="s1097">They were there three year and we were there one year, you know?</span> <span id="s1098">So in a way they have the right because they were there too long and they become like rude and they steal and everything the food away, when they give it to all the Lager and all the people, and those Polish girls, they take it for themselves, for their relatives and everybody, and we don’t have to eat nothing, bread they steal.</span> <span id="s1099">We don’t eat the food anyhow, I mean the soup, but the bread they take it, they cut it instead of giving us a pieces like that, they give us a pieces like that and they steal it for their relatives.</span> <span id="s1100">Maybe I would do it too, if I would have, you know.</span> <span id="s1101">But anyhow, she was screaming, "Where, were you?</span> <span id="s1102">They taking us away to the transport."</span> <span id="s1103">And first I went into my line to 35 people were--from the three barrack was 35, from there was maybe 15, maybe 10 from that barrack--and finally they took us to the shower room to take another shower room, that's for the shower, to take us a shower and they give us other clothing, you know.</span> <span id="s1104">And finally they put us up on the train, winter, it was already winter--cold.</span> <span id="s1105">It was November, end, beginning of Decem, December.</span> <span id="s1106">They give us a whole bread, oh my God a whole bread, and some wurst--liverwurst and some jam.</span> <span id="s1107">We couldn’t believe it, we have whole bread; but why would they give us the whole bread?</span> <span id="s1108">We were not thinking we gonna travel from the mid, from the middle of the week till the end of the week, you know, on the train.</span> <span id="s1109">We were not thinking, you know.</span> <span id="s1110">But in the meantime, when they put us into the train and it wasn’t SS, it was Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">GS: Oh, ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">SE: That was already Wehrmacht, ok.</span> <span id="s1113">And they were not so rude, like the SS.</span> <span id="s1114">They still have SS you pass before they bring us to the train, but they put us on that train and bring the bread and it was straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s1115">That was a horse board, not a regular train.</span> <span id="s1116">It wasn’t regular train.</span> <span id="s1117">It was a, you know, those that they bring the merchandise and the horses, and still not a regular train but still was ground clean, clean on the floor and they close the door and the German was sitting near the door, you know, and we were sitting where ever we can sit, on the floor.</span> <span id="s1118">But in the meantime, the German was trying, sing us, was singing a song.</span> <span id="s1119">I don’t know what was the song but I still have the memory in my ear, “The lolla, lolla ha, the scweitza boone la ha”[phonetic], he was in a good mood and something give me a good feeling, it must be, they must be taking us to a good place.</span> <span id="s1120">Something like that, if you tell us, you know, something, the voice, he was like a [unclear] star, you know, when they were singing.</span> <span id="s1121">Finally we went down from the train in maybe three days to go, three nights, three days, cold like anything, there’s no cover, nothing, but they have no cover either, they were just sitting on the door, you know, the two Germans were sitting on the door and we were going and going.</span> <span id="s1122">Finally we went down from the train and we had to walk for the other big wagon, to go up on the big wagon.</span> <span id="s1123">It was snowing, snow already and on the snow, I find a--not a plum, not a plum, a--pear.</span> <span id="s1124">It was [unclear] on the floor, not on the floor, on the snow.</span> <span id="s1125">Oh, my God, I didn’t see a piece of fruit, a piece of food since we left Hungary, you know, and that, that, now that piece of pear, naturally we shared it with my girlfriend, you know, because she was there with me and they bring us in.</span> <span id="s1126">It was a school, it was a, it was a school, a big building but they made out of the factory from it.</span> <span id="s1127">It was in, it was in Oberhohen-elbe, Oberhohen-elbe, that was Sudeten Germany, become Sudeten Germany, and we were working downstairs, my girlfriend work upstairs and I was working downstairs, but I was worrying, how’s she gonna work without the glasses?</span> <span id="s1128">If she gonna put up the glasses, what they gonna say but she had no choice, but they don’t say nothing there.</span> <span id="s1129">It was private people, it was a factory to make lamps for submarine, radio and all kinds of tubes from glass in this factory.</span> <span id="s1130">And we were, we have a German, a German woman, we have a German woman for four of us was taking care, and we had to work from morning six o’clock, till at night six o’clock, on one slice of bread, one potatoes and some kind of a soup, soup which wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s1131">At night when we go back then we get that one.</span> <span id="s1132">And this woman was a Hungarian, she was a maid in Hungary, she speak a few words in Hungarian, who was taking care of us.</span> <span id="s1133">And she was, in a way, nice and let me tell you one thing, between you there was also some nice people.</span> <span id="s1134">This, you wouldn’t believe it but there was human being between you too.</span> <span id="s1135">We would die hunger if this woman didn’t steal.</span> <span id="s1136">One day she steal a piece of, a sandwich for me, one day she bring a sandwich for the other girl but not to say a word because she would be killed, if she would, they would see that, where we going, we were working on the schleie.</span> <span id="s1137">I was working on the schneife machine [cutting machine] and we have to watch it.</span> <span id="s1138">You know the lamp on the radio from, all the pieces is inside.</span> <span id="s1139">My girlfriend was doing that, she put the pieces in those lamps.</span> <span id="s1140">And I was making, make it sure with the schleifen machine, the machine was going like this, and making sure it's straight, every minute have to check if it’s straight, that glass bottom because that had to be very straight.</span> <span id="s1141">And we said, I never going to drink from glass no more, we have some kind of that, some kind of a powder, we have to put it, it was a hole here and have to put that powder there on top of the schleifen machine, eat up our hand.</span> <span id="s1142">Yeah, you should have seen, we were full with, full with sh--with wound, because that thing what was strong for that, eating up the glass part, you know that eat up our hand, both of our hand because it work on both hand, and food, we were so hungry already if that woman once in a while didn’t give a piece, we would drop dead right there, honestly.</span> <span id="s1143">But in a way, they were taking us even for spazieren, would you believe it, every Sunday.</span> <span id="s1144">They take us spazieren, the Aufsehen, Aufschen, the German SS, they take us for walk, they take us for walk, and we saw the free people was walking free, the people was walking free.</span> <span id="s1145">We were even jealous for the birds because we were closed in, fenced in.</span> <span id="s1146">We were jealous for the birds, to see a bird free, to go and fly free, we were even jealous of that.</span> <span id="s1147">And this Aufschen--when we went at night too--I was working dayshift and my girlfriend was working nightshift but somehow like, we don’t never have a watch, but like we sychronize it, we met at the toilet every night.</span> <span id="s1148">We met, we didn’t have no food but we would say hello to each other and there was a washroom and we met there every night, just like the watch was ringed and you wake you up, like, like a, we don’t even know what time is it, what time was it, we have no watch, but we met every time at the toilet because during the day we cannot meet because she was working at night.</span> <span id="s1149">There was an Aufschen sitting on the corner, sometime you don’t know if he going tell them, "Aufsehen can I go rausgehn, can I go out to the toilet?"</span> <span id="s1150">If you wake them up, they could be so mad they could of kill you.</span> <span id="s1151">If you don’t gonna say, "Can I go out," and if they catch you they figure you gonna, you wanna walk out on you--on

near us, everything was built in stone, they still, even the top of the clay, we have red clay tops in the houses, not like here the houses, every house was red clay, but the houses was standing but no window was, not one window was, that all the windows was torn out because people said the German horses was looking out of the windows.</span> <span id="s1264">It was full with horse manure.</span> <span id="s1265">What I find, I find one of my doll, but I was never suppose to play with that because somebody, one of my cousins from here, America, she has, he has the factory.</span> <span id="s1266">The Ideal Doll factory was his.</span> <span id="s1267">And he send it to my one of my cousins and when my cousin growed it out, she give it to me, that Sylvia, she give it to me.</span> <span id="s1268">I find that doll sitting on the top of the horse manure and my mother’s sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1269">That’s all I find, nothing at all, not one old dress what my mother was wear to remind my mother for that.</span> <span id="s1270">But I saw half, about a yard and a half of one wall was standing, and the minute I saw this wall I know I find the jewelry, because before we went to the concentration camp, before we went to the ghetto, my father, he was a very smart man.</span> <span id="s1271">They give in to the townhalls whatever they think we have jewelry, but my mother lived in America for ten year and all her money she was saving for the house if she come home and jewelry, she was bringing home a lot of jewelry, and they never knowed that, he have, she have it.</span> <span id="s1272">And my father before they took us to the ghetto, he opened up in the store, one hole and put in a straw and put in cement, cement it in except the straw was standing out and she send, he send me in to see, go in the store and see where you find fresh cement because the stone was cemented, all cemented together, and you find the fresh cement, there I put the jewelry and he said, "Go in, first you, and then mommy."</span> <span id="s1273">I said, "Why can’t…" I said to myself, "Why can’t we go together?"</span> <span id="s1274">you know?</span> <span id="s1275">I couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1276">When I come home and I saw that the only wall was standing, full with grass, the grass was up to my knee, the house was full with horse manure, not a knife, nothing I find it, everything was torn.</span> <span id="s1277">I said, I gonna go over one of my neighbor house and I gonna ask a knife from her.</span> <span id="s1278">And I said, "Can you come with me, Mrs. Sznuznyk?"</span> <span id="s1279">In the meantime, I find on the floor, the chicken was drinking from a beautiful dish what my mother was the dowry in Europe.</span> <span id="s1280">When somebody get married, they don’t give money, they give present, dowry, they call it, they call it…</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">GS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">SE: All kind of ceramic or things like that and my mother never let me to, never let me to drink from that, eat from that thing because we gonna be good when you got a big, when you gonna be a big girl.</span> <span id="s1283">I said, "Where did you take this Mrs. Sznuznyk?"</span> <span id="s1284">"I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1285">One kid bring it here."</span> <span id="s1286">So naturally, I right away picked it up.</span> <span id="s1287">In the meantime, I look in the, in the stall, I saw my cow, my mother cow there.</span> <span id="s1288">"How come--the name was Pirosh, reddy.</span> <span id="s1289">How come Pirosh come here?"</span> <span id="s1290">"Ahh, they take mine and I take yours."</span> <span id="s1291">Not even think to give me back, no way, or the house to give me back, no way.</span> <span id="s1292">I have to go to the city, her had to fight it, that was my father's house and I want it, I want back the house.</span> <span id="s1293">"No, the German give it to us," you know?</span> <span id="s1294">So I said, "Why don’t you clean it up?</span> <span id="s1295">Why did, why is it full of horse manure?</span> <span id="s1296">Why don’t you clean it up?"</span> <span id="s1297">Anyhow when I saw that, you know, the doll and the house was full, the ground was full with big, big thing, you know?</span> <span id="s1298">So this, when she saw, I took out the jewelry, she saw I’m taking out the jewelry, she was looking, what are you doing there?</span> <span id="s1299">"You know, what?"</span> <span id="s1300">I said, "You see my father outsmart you."</span> <span id="s1301">My father, and that’s the jewelry I save my life when I escape from Hungary to go to Canada, that was the jewelry I bribed down the Czechoslovakian gendarme, police.</span> <span id="s1302">The, if not that, I wouldn’t find it, I wouldn’t be able to come, because I need some money to bribe them.</span> <span id="s1303">They catch us.</span> <span id="s1304">The Czech, the Czech catch us.</span> <span id="s1305">Can I use your phone for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">GS: Certainly.</span> <span id="s1307">[tape shut off] [ tape three, side two ended, interview
