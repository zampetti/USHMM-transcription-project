<p><span id="s9">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">I was born in a small town called Koprzewnitz which is approximately six kilometers from the Vistula; in Polish they call it Wisla.</span> <span id="s11">The Vistula divided Galicia and Poland.</span> <span id="s12">Poland became, after World War I, became independent.</span> <span id="s13">The other side of the Vistula was belonged to Austria, that's why they call it Galicia.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Were you born in the southern part of the country or the northern part?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">I would say if it's near the Vistula, that would be the northern part of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">What was your name when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">In Yiddish, they call me Wolzalik (ph)(c.28).</span> <span id="s18">In public school, they call me Wolf.</span> <span id="s19">Of course, when I came to the United States, my name was changed to William and I kept that name

sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">I had a younger brother, Izzy, and I had a younger sister, Hannah.</span> <span id="s24">Of course, they're both not here with me.</span> <span id="s25">I am the

the store.</span> <span id="s32">He was a very religious man, worked five, six days a week.</span> <span id="s33">The seventh day was Sabbath and he never had the store opened.</span> <span id="s34">This was our income.</span> <span id="s35">That was his livelihood, the business.</span> <span id="s36">The people who lived in the town, actually lived from one another.</span> <span id="s37">You buy from me, I buy from you.</span> <span id="s38">Whatever the other person was selling, that's even.</span> <span id="s39">You sell shirts or pants, you sort of exchanged it.</span> <span id="s40">Most of the time there used to be a market on a Thursday.</span> <span id="s41">Every Thursday, the people from the villages or the farms would come into the town which was the biggest day of the week.</span> <span id="s42">Everybody was doing business, buying and selling.</span> <span id="s43">That's how everybody made a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Your father had his own store?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Yes, we had our own grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">His customers were from the town and from outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">From outside and in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s50">At that time everything was beautiful, perfect.</span> <span id="s51">No problem whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">How about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">My mother was mostly house.</span> <span id="s54">Took care of the children, three children to take care of.</span> <span id="s55">But when my father had to go to purchase merchandise, so she covered that particular day.</span> <span id="s56">Also, on Thursday which was market day, she stayed in the store with him.</span> <span id="s57">_______(c.53) Did you live in an apartment in the same building as the store or separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">No.</span> <span id="s59">The store was my mother's sister lived in the back of the store.</span> <span id="s60">This was originally my grandparents' house.</span> <span id="s61">We used the front as a store and the rear was my aunt's apartment.</span> <span id="s62">We had our apartment a few minutes away from where the store was located.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">You had a large family then?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Yes, so to speak of, yes.</span> <span id="s65">My father comes from a family of nine children.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">So he was one of nine children?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">He was one of nine children.</span> <span id="s68">My mother comes of a family of six children.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">They had known each other before?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">I saw a picture of them earlier, when they were engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">My father and my mother, I was told, during World War I, was a lot of smuggling going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s73">That's the only way you were able to make a living.</span> <span id="s74">People were traveling from city to city to buy merchandise and bring it in.</span> <span id="s75">I understood that my mother and father met during that traveling period back and forth.</span> <span id="s76">Then they got engaged around the time, I think it was either 1920 or 1921.</span> <span id="s77">Why not?</span> <span id="s78">[Female voice: "You were born on--"] They got engaged that doesn't mean they got married!</span> <span id="s79">[Female voice: "They were so young."]</span> <span id="s80">It doesn't mean a thing.</span> <span id="s81">In those days they believed in the Jewish tradition, you're supposed to get married at the age of eighteen, a girl anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Your mother was married at age 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">I assume she was, at 18, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">You were the first child?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">I was the firstborn.</span> <span id="s86">Of course, in those days, I was born in 1927 so maybe they got married in 1926, I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">That was a longer engagement than---?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Yes, in those days, was long engagement.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Both families, would you say both families were religious families?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Very religious families.</span> <span id="s91">As a matter of fact, the grandfather I'm named after; he was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s92">He was a teacher in the town.</span> <span id="s93">I was named after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">The grandfather on your father's side or your mother's side?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">My mother's side.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Your mother's father was a rabbi and you were named after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">My father's father, he was a merchant.</span> <span id="s98">He was actually, what you call, in the dairy business.</span> <span id="s99">He was buying cheese, eggs, all sorts of dairy products.</span> <span id="s100">He was doing business with bigger cities.</span> <span id="s101">That was his profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">What kind of schooling did your parents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">My parents had mostly Hebrew education, no Polish education.</span> <span id="s104">At that time, when they were born, Jewish people were not allowed to get educated under the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">They were born under Russian rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Under Russian rule, right.</span> <span id="s107">I think I was the first generation that was able to get a Polish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Both of your parents had attended Jewish schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Only Jewish, hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Wasn't an open school, was a hidden school in the Sellis(ph)(c.089) where this book is all written all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">What languages did your parents speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">At home?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">At home, Yiddish was spoken primarily.</span> <span id="s116">The only language I was able to speak Polish was when I attended school.</span> <span id="s117">But among my friends, if I came along my Jewish friends, we spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s118">The gentile friends, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">You were bilingual?</span> <span id="s120">Yiddish and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Yiddish and Polish, yes.</span> <span id="s122">And also Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">And Hebrew.</span> <span id="s124">Your father also knew Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Yes, because he was born under the Russian system, so he spoke Russian, Polish and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">What kind of school did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">I started the schooling at the age of seven which was 1935.</span> <span id="s128">I went to school until the age of, let's see, 1939 the war broke out, five years.</span> <span id="s129">Five years of schooling I had in Polish.</span> <span id="s130">But in Yiddish I had more than that.</span> <span id="s131">My Polish schooling stopped when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s132">The law came through, no Jewish child is allowed to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">September, 1939, you did not go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s135">The day the Germans came in, I remember it like today is Sunday.</span> <span id="s136">I was in the middle of the street and finally, we could hear shooting coming into the city.</span> <span id="s137">Houses were burning, everybody was petrified.</span> <span id="s138">Everybody was running back and forth; they didn't know what to do with themselves.</span> <span id="s139">People were screaming, what's happening?</span> <span id="s140">what's going on?</span> <span id="s141">The Germans had come.</span> <span id="s142">Well, it was about 10, 11 o'clock in the morning, September 1, 1939, the German patrol entered the city.</span> <span id="s143">They were all full of dust.</span> <span id="s144">I remember there were two jeeps, two motorcycles and a truck.</span> <span id="s145">The German officers came in with machine guns and the first thing you could hear is handt holdt (ph)(c.115), raise your hands.</span> <span id="s146">We all stood still, we didn't move.</span> <span id="s147">We raised our hands.</span> <span id="s148">I was trying desperately to get to my parents' house, to the store so they could be warned what's happening, where I was.</span> <span id="s149">But I couldn't.</span> <span id="s150">I ran across the street to the other side.</span> <span id="s151">Meantime, the Germans surrounded the whole circle.</span> <span id="s152">The town had a circle, a square.</span> <span id="s153">Machines guns pointing to each like towards the houses.</span> <span id="s154">I figured this way, if I run to the back of the city, all around the circle, I'll be able to reach my home.</span> <span id="s155">That's exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s156">But my parents didn't know that I was in the house.</span> <span id="s157">They were looking for me, because I was in one area and they were in another area.</span> <span id="s158">In the meantime, the Germans went from house to house and get everybody out into the circle.</span> <span id="s159">We didn't know what the consequences were going to be but we felt, we don't have a choice.</span> <span id="s160">There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to run.</span> <span id="s161">The war is on, shooting was going on like crazy.</span> <span id="s162">The Polish army was around they had no place where to put them anymore.</span> <span id="s163">They came in with horses, the infantry came in.</span> <span id="s164">There was no artillery, they had no artillery.</span> <span id="s165">The Polish army had a very poor artillery, about six horses pulling one anti-aircraft _______, (c. 131) okay.</span> <span id="s166">one anti-aircraft was pulled by six horses.</span> <span id="s167">That's the strength.</span> <span id="s168">I mean they were good military personnel, no question about it, but they had nothing to fight against armored.</span> <span id="s169">The Germans were well-armed.</span> <span id="s170">In the meantime, more German trucks started to come into the city.</span> <span id="s171">They felt the city safe, they will come in.</span> <span id="s172">Every house was entered, they entered the house and emptied it.</span> <span id="s173">Everybody out in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s174">When it came to my house, where I was living, the Germans came in; so we all raised our hands.</span> <span id="s175">They says, march out.</span> <span id="s176">So we marched out and my parents saw me.</span> <span id="s177">My mother says, where were you?</span> <span id="s178">.</span> <span id="s179">I says, I run home when I saw the German trucks coming in, I got panic and I run to the other side of the street and then I run home.</span> <span id="s180">Of course, what are you going to do in a situation like that?</span> <span id="s181">You don't have parents, yet.</span> <span id="s182">They got very panicky too, looking for me.</span> <span id="s183">We stood out there in the square for about 45 hours.</span> <span id="s184">Then they told the women and the children may go back to their homes.</span> <span id="s185">Either they were holding us as hostages in case they find maybe the Polish army resisting, whatever the situation was, I don't understand it.</span> <span id="s186">I don't know.</span> <span id="s187">All I know is that after a period of time, they let the women go back to their homes with the children and then later on, the men were allowed to go home.</span> <span id="s188">This was the first experience with --.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">This was the first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">The first day, I have it written out in a book in the house in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s191">Everything in Yiddish but that particular day took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">This was on the first of September?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">On the first day when the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">As far as you can tell, there was no real Polish resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">How could they resist?</span> <span id="s196">They had nothing to resist with.</span> <span id="s197">You can't take an infantry fight mechanic.</span> <span id="s198">They came with heavy tanks and trucks and airplanes.</span> <span id="s199">The first thing that came in, airplanes that start softening up the area there.</span> <span id="s200">Where we lived, around this area there, in one particular place is called Merrick (ph)(c.157), where they had ammunition factory, was the first place they catch.</span> <span id="s201">On the other side of the Vistula was a factory.</span> <span id="s202">We could see that they were so powerful and so strong, we have no way of defeating them.</span> <span id="s203">Still and all, the Polish army held out a long time, held out three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Your town was not bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">It was bombed in one area there which was ________(c.163) anything of value.</span> <span id="s206">Just dropped a bomb maybe to scare people.</span> <span id="s207">That's about it.</span> <span id="s208">Nothing of value.</span> <span id="s209">There was no particular bridges that had value, they had roads and everything.</span> <span id="s210">The bomb didn't do any particular harm at all whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Of course I was frightened!</span> <span id="s213">Who wouldn't be frightened when you see, first of all, we knew the atrocities that happened in Germany in 1938; what happened in Austria.</span> <span id="s214">Because a lot of those Jewish people from those countries were pushed back to Poland.</span> <span id="s215">Anyone who was Polish born, lived in Germany, had to leave Germany, go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s216">Those people came in to our town, we had to allocate them.</span> <span id="s217">We had to give them food; we had to give them lodging.</span> <span id="s218">This was a must.</span> <span id="s219">They told us the atrocities, what happened in those areas where they lived.</span> <span id="s220">Of course you get frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Did you recall any specific stories that they told about German?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Yes, they said that they used to come in their houses at night, to take out the women, rape the women.</span> <span id="s223">They used to take out the men, cut their beards off, put them to work or drag them alongside, hooked them up to a truck and drag them alongside the streets.</span> <span id="s224">I mean they told stories that you were shivering.</span> <span id="s225">As a youngster, which I was, my ears were always open to hear, to know what was going on, to see what I can do.</span> <span id="s226">You cannot rely 100% on the city, or the people, or your own parents.</span> <span id="s227">You are on your own when something like that happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Did you know any of the refugees, personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">No.</span> <span id="s230">There were no relatives of ours, was total strange people.</span> <span id="s231">Each family that entered the city were assigned to a certain family.</span> <span id="s232">You have to give them breakfast, you give them lunch, you give them supper.</span> <span id="s233">All were welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Was anyone assigned to your household?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Yes, we had three families who were assigned to us.</span> <span id="s236">Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they would come to our house for breakfast.</span> <span id="s237">The other family were assigned Thursday, Friday and Saturday for lunch.</span> <span id="s238">Then they keep changing around.</span> <span id="s239">Every family cooperated as much as they possibly could.</span> <span id="s240">My mother became the breadwinner when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s241">She was blond, she looked like a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s242">She put on a babushka, like a kerchief, a disguise.</span> <span id="s243">She used to go into the towns called Townocheck(ph)(c.190) which is across the Vistula, six kilometers from my town.</span> <span id="s244">She used to purchase the merchandise which was necessary for the house.</span> <span id="s245">By horse and buggy, the stuff would be brought back into the city.</span> <span id="s246">I used to wait for her as a youngster.</span> <span id="s247">When she crossed over the Hampton(ph)(c.200) bridge, the Germans built across the Vistula; when I saw my mother, I was delighted to see her.</span> <span id="s248">Of course, who wouldn't?</span> <span id="s249">She used to make those trips twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">All by herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">All by herself because the disguise that she was able to go through.</span> <span id="s252">They didn't know she was Jewish, they let her cross over the bridge.</span> <span id="s253">On the other side of the bridge, as soon as she came off, I sort of approached to her and helped her.</span> <span id="s254">If she had to carry something, I helped her carry.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">What was your father doing during the months after the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">During the months of the occupation, he had to stay in the store.</span> <span id="s257">He couldn't go anyplace.</span> <span id="s258">He had to cut off his beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">He cut it himself or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Sure, he had to.</span> <span id="s261">There was a rule, right away.</span> <span id="s262">You had to cut off.</span> <span id="s263">Between 1939, the Germans came in, to 1940, September, was a couple of months, the rules were laid as follows: They had a curfew from six in the evening to six in the morning, nobody's allowed to go out unless you had a specific permission from the German headquarters.</span> <span id="s264">Otherwise you go out, you're shot.</span> <span id="s265">The German patrol was marching up and down from the top of the city to the end of the city.</span> <span id="s266">They had six patrolmen.</span> <span id="s267">Not even youngsters were allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s268">The store had to be closed at 5:30, no business will ______(c.218).</span> <span id="s269">We were fortunate that in the back of each store, where families lived, we had a tremendous yard.</span> <span id="s270">We all got together in the evening in the back of the yard and we discussed this.</span> <span id="s271">We consoled each other.</span> <span id="s272">We knew the consequences, what's happening, what's going on, but what can you do?</span> <span id="s273">We were in a situation where you have to do whatever time allows.</span> <span id="s274">In 1940, the beginning of 1940, Poland was very fortunate when the winter came along, lots of snow, lots of snow.</span> <span id="s275">An order came through from headquarters, everybody at the age of 12 and every man the age of 60 had to assign themselves to work.</span> <span id="s276">We all had to sign our names.</span> <span id="s277">Every day, I had to go out on the highways and shovel snow so that the German armor can go freely about.</span> <span id="s278">We got paid for that, not much, but we got paid for this.</span> <span id="s279">As the days and the months went by, we sort of got accustomed to the idea.</span> <span id="s280">This is part of life, this is the way we're going to grow up, what else can I do?</span> <span id="s281">Right through the 1940's, being it was a small town, the Germans demanded that the town should establish a headquarters, Jewish men and women.</span> <span id="s282">They called it a geminda(ph)(c.239), what you call it here is a city hall, a city hall.</span> <span id="s283">In German, it's a geminda (c.231).</span> <span id="s284">They took the top notch men from the town and they formed a committee.</span> <span id="s285">What was the purpose of the committee?</span> <span id="s286">If the Germans needed something, assume they needed some boots for the German officer, they would come to the committee and says, I would like you to supply us within two or three weeks, three hundred pair of boots.</span> <span id="s287">They gave us the sizes and everything.</span> <span id="s288">Of course, the committe paid for them.</span> <span id="s289">They needed a certain amount of people to go and clean the headquarters of the German camp.</span> <span id="s290">The committee had to assign a certain amount of people to go there and do the work.</span> <span id="s291">This was the purpose of the geminda.</span> <span id="s292">Whatever they demanded, they didn't go to individual people, they went to the committee.</span> <span id="s293">The committee, more or less, had an idea who has money, who didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s294">Believe me, they had to really drag out money from the people.</span> <span id="s295">Who wanted to part with money?</span> <span id="s296">You work all your life, it's a poor town, this wasn't a rich town, it was a poor town.</span> <span id="s297">This was the main purpose of the geminda.</span> <span id="s298">The people they call the Yudenrach (ph)(c.250).</span> <span id="s299">Yudenrach is a committee who decides, who makes decisions.</span> <span id="s300">My father's brother, he was older than my father, he was a member of that Yudenrach.</span> <span id="s301">Every time when my father had a chance to talk to him, he says it's no good, it's no good.</span> <span id="s302">What's the matter?</span> <span id="s303">, my father asked him.</span> <span id="s304">He says, they're demanding so many things from us.</span> <span id="s305">We don't know where to get it from.</span> <span id="s306">We don't know where to get it from.</span> <span id="s307">They demanded housing for their officers, demanded shoes, demanded clothing, demanded food, whatever they were able to get, whatever their mind was working on, they came to you, give me, give me and give me.</span> <span id="s308">There's a limit to everything, right?</span> <span id="s309">This was in 1940 right through that.</span> <span id="s310">Everybody from the city had to go to work for the Germans, everybody.</span> <span id="s311">Except once a week, thank G__ for that day, on Thursday, which was market day, they allowed the gentile people to come into the city and bring in some merchandise, rice, corn wheat, flour, chicken, eggs and we sort of exchanged it to survive.</span> <span id="s312">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s313">Bread was scarce, there was a ration of bread, sugar and flour.</span> <span id="s314">People started to become penniless, hate one another, because when you feel in your heart, you're hungry, your liberty is being taken away from you, you sort of become an animal.</span> <span id="s315">You hate people because--for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s316">But it's there, the hate is there.</span> <span id="s317">You shouldn't hate one another because we're all in the same boat but nature works tricks on you.</span> <span id="s318">Because he comes over and demands from you things, you have to give it to them.</span> <span id="s319">Then you say to me, why do you come to me, why don't you go to them?</span> <span id="s320">You understand?</span> <span id="s321">That's how we create a war.</span> <span id="s322">That's their policy was.</span> <span id="s323">This was their idea, to create a revolution among one another.</span> <span id="s324">They would gain by that.</span> <span id="s325">In the beginning of 1942, new rules and regulations came forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">From 1940 to '42,the situation was--?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">The situation was stable.</span> <span id="s328">You were able to get whatever you want and supplied with rationed food and all that.</span> <span id="s329">Nothing was restricted except six o'clock in the evening, six o'clock in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">How about wearing armbands or badges?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">This came in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">No schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">No schools, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Your brother and sister are really not doing anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Nothing, whatsoever.</span> <span id="s336">Except at home, we were able to read ourselves books and teach ourselves.</span> <span id="s337">Then we had a private tutor coming to the house, in secret.</span> <span id="s338">He was able to teach us.</span> <span id="s339">Then the rules came through, every Jew, the age of twelve, men and women had to wear armband with the Star of David on the left arm.</span> <span id="s340">Everybody had to put it on, there was no way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">What date, do you remember what date this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">It was approximately February, I think, 1942.</span> <span id="s343">Then we start reading in the papers that they forming ghettos.</span> <span id="s344">Mortch (ph)(c.307), Cracow, the main cities of Poland.</span> <span id="s345">Then they started to restrict in our town, how far you can travel.</span> <span id="s346">We only had a limited amount of area which you could go, no further.</span> <span id="s347">That's the end of it.</span> <span id="s348">You go any further, you're shot, no questions.</span> <span id="s349">People from the villages, from the surrounding towns, were pushed into our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">They had to be Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Right.</span> <span id="s352">They had to leave the village, all their belongings.</span> <span id="s353">If they were able to sell it, fine.</span> <span id="s354">If not, you had to give it over to your neighbor and come into our town.</span> <span id="s355">How much can a town like us absorb?</span> <span id="s356">We were population of Jewish people, 150 families.</span> <span id="s357">The total population of our town including the gentiles were together over 500 families.</span> <span id="s358">When they started to bring in people from the villages, and including we have people already refugees from Austria, from Germany, our town was choking.</span> <span id="s359">We couldn't move around any more, food was scarce.</span> <span id="s360">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s361">1942 was here and we knew things were happening already in Poland.</span> <span id="s362">Elimination of people, sending them out, pushing them to work.</span> <span id="s363">Then one day, it was in June, my father's brother came over to my father and said,--.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">This is the one who works in the council?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">That's right.</span> <span id="s366">He says, it doesn't look good.</span> <span id="s367">They demanding a _____(c.336) amount of people to be sent to a labor camp, to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s368">It doesn't look good.</span> <span id="s369">He said to my father, I would suggest you let your son, Zalek, go to work on the highways.</span> <span id="s370">Wherever they have a group of people work on the highways, once you were there, you were safe.</span> <span id="s371">During the day, trucks will arrive and pick up the amount of people that we have joined tonight.</span> <span id="s372">Who do you take?</span> <span id="s373">, the newcomers, right?</span> <span id="s374">People who influxed into our town from different towns so the first ones you take is them.</span> <span id="s375">You put them into a holding place until the Germans came with the trucks.</span> <span id="s376">They arrived approximately nine, ten o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s377">We were already on the highways working.</span> <span id="s378">Telephones in those days was very scarce.</span> <span id="s379">There wasn't like in here; you pick up a telephone and make a telephone call.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Your parents didn't have a telephone?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">We didn't have a telephone.</span> <span id="s382">We didn't have electricity either.</span> <span id="s383">I went to work with another hundred fellows on the highways.</span> <span id="s384">Our duty on the highways was to pick up the gravel, straighten out the highway, whatever it was damaged down on there, we did the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">These are all Jewish guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">All Jewish people.</span> <span id="s387">When the trucks arrived, we received a telephone call from the post office.</span> <span id="s388">The post office sent a telephone call to the village where we worked telling them, they are coming to get us.</span> <span id="s389">This man who received the telephone call panicked and disappeared.</span> <span id="s390">He took off!</span> <span id="s391">We didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s392">Later on, I found out that one guy who was captured at night and held in a pen until the Germans come, came forward.</span> <span id="s393">He says if you want more people, you go to this and this highway and you'll find plenty of them.</span> <span id="s394">Then the trucks came out to the highways and where you going to go?</span> <span id="s395">No place where to go because it's also out of limits.</span> <span id="s396">About a hundred of us surrendered.</span> <span id="s397">They took us on the trucks and brought us into the town.</span> <span id="s398">We came into the town.</span> <span id="s399">Was my parents waiting, start to carry on, got hysterical.</span> <span id="s400">Says, what do you want me to do?</span> <span id="s401">Believe me, this is the honest truth.</span> <span id="s402">I'll never forget it, the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s403">I was sitting in the truck, numb.</span> <span id="s404">Didn't know what was going on, didn't know what's happening, just sat there and stared at my mother.</span> <span id="s405">They could have taken her too; they could have taken my father too and shoved him in the truck.</span> <span id="s406">She was brave enough to come forward.</span> <span id="s407">She says, he's a young boy.</span> <span id="s408">He's not a healthy boy.</span> <span id="s409">Can I take him off the truck and go home?</span> <span id="s410">The German turned around and said to her, he's a good boy, he's a strong boy.</span> <span id="s411">We'll make him stronger.</span> <span id="s412">He can work for us.</span> <span id="s413">Those were the words he said.</span> <span id="s414">I listen.</span> <span id="s415">What I wore was a shirt, a pair of pants, short pants; it was the clothing of youngsters and a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s416">Within the hour, my mother and father stood there.</span> <span id="s417">My brother I didn't see any more, my sister, I didn't see any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">They were home?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">They were home, hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Why were they hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">They were afraid they might have taken them too!</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Even the very young--?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">They didn't care, they need people, able people.</span> <span id="s424">They're not going to take somebody that's 60 years of age or 50 years of age.</span> <span id="s425">In those days, a 50-year old man looked like 80.</span> <span id="s426">My father says goodbye, my mother says goodbye to me.</span> <span id="s427">I was able to go down to hug her and go back into the truck.</span> <span id="s428">A hundred and five of us, in my hometown, were taken to ________(c.404).</span> <span id="s429">This was my first experience riding in a truck for three and a half hours.</span> <span id="s430">When we got into the town of _________(c.407), the Jewish committee provided us with a bath.</span> <span id="s431">The first thing I do is take a bath.</span> <span id="s432">We had to be disinfected--</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Deloused.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Deloused, right.</span> <span id="s435">That's what they called it, deloused.</span> <span id="s436">Disinfected and I didn't know I had a belt on.</span> <span id="s437">I left the belt in my clothing.</span> <span id="s438">The belt came back, it was only ______(c.414) falling apart.</span> <span id="s439">I had to use a cord to hold my pants up.</span> <span id="s440">I lost a lot of weight because I didn't eat all day.</span> <span id="s441">About midnight, it was later than midnight, I don't know what time it was already, I was so exhausted and dumbfounded and sort of disgusted.</span> <span id="s442">Believe me, if somebody would come with an ax and hit my hand, I wouldn't feel it.</span> <span id="s443">At that age, at that age!</span></p> <p><span id="s444">You were what, ___?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Fifteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">This was June.</span> <span id="s447">This would have been around the time of your birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">That's right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Do you remember the date?</span> <span id="s450">Was it just before--?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">June 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Just before your birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">That's the day you were rounded up and taken to _________.</span> <span id="s455">(c.424)?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Your parents were left alone.</span> <span id="s458">They were not taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Thank G__, they were not taken.</span> <span id="s460">They could have been taken from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">They were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">That's right.</span> <span id="s463">They could have been taken too.</span> <span id="s464">But they needed a certain amount of people.</span> <span id="s465">This was the typical German.</span> <span id="s466">If they say to you I need ten, I don't want eleven.</span> <span id="s467">Ten is enough for me, that's all I want.</span> <span id="s468">If you give them eleven, twelve, I don't want it.</span> <span id="s469">I want ten only.</span> <span id="s470">We left the town of Skarzysko into their camp.</span> <span id="s471">We arrived at night, it was dark.</span> <span id="s472">It was a tremendous building, I don't know what that building was consist of.</span> <span id="s473">All it was inside of there was hay and straw.</span> <span id="s474">They let us out _____ (c.407) inside.</span> <span id="s475">______ Six o'clock in the morning woke us up.</span> <span id="s476">Experience in the camp.</span> <span id="s477">Everybody out.</span> <span id="s478">Lined up, counted everybody.</span> <span id="s479">We were so valuable, we more valuable than gold.</span> <span id="s480">G__ forbid if one person is missing, we stood there for hours until they found them, either dead or alive.</span> <span id="s481">That's the typical German system.</span> <span id="s482">Everybody had to be accounted for.</span> <span id="s483">After they counted us, they gave us black coffee and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s484">They marched us to the German headquarters which was in the factory already.</span> <span id="s485">In there we stood in the line, to be fingerprinted, to be given ID cards and pictures.</span> <span id="s486">Everyone of us had an ID card with a picture on it.</span> <span id="s487">It took forever.</span> <span id="s488">By the time the last person got through, was three o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s489">We stood there and waited, what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s490">The night shift begun six o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s491">They took us to the factory, introducing us to the factory.</span> <span id="s492">I had never seen a factory in my life; I'd never seen a machine in my life; I don't know what it's all about.</span> <span id="s493">They start giving us the first meal for the evening.</span> <span id="s494">It consist of cabbage and horse meat.</span> <span id="s495">I didn't know it was horse meat.</span> <span id="s496">I was told later on, it was horse meat.</span> <span id="s497">Do I have a choice?</span> <span id="s498">There's nothing else to eat, I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s499">After we finish eating, six o'clock arrived, inside.</span> <span id="s500">We went, each lined up in the factory.</span> <span id="s501">The assignments were different machine.</span> <span id="s502">I was assigned to a machine that was making the pins that ignites the bullet.</span> <span id="s503">When you press the pin, they can hit it and shoot out.</span> <span id="s504">It was a tiny, little thing; the machine was a very fast machine.</span> <span id="s505">The Polish supervisor took a liking to me.</span> <span id="s506">It was very fortunate, he liked me.</span> <span id="s507">Vilak (ph)(c.479), he called me, Vilak.</span> <span id="s508">He says to me, this is the way you operate this here, this is the way you release it.</span> <span id="s509">Remember the electricity.</span> <span id="s510">Talk to me, electricity!</span> <span id="s511">What do I know about electricity?</span> <span id="s512">I light candles, lamps and kerosene, okay?</span> <span id="s513">This is electricity.</span> <span id="s514">He says, you put the switch on and the machine runs.</span> <span id="s515">You run the wheel like this here and bring it over and you see that the pin becomes thin.</span> <span id="s516">Then you have a tester over here.</span> <span id="s517">You put on the tester, you see that the pin fits.</span> <span id="s518">If the pin fits, you continue, if it doesn't, call me over.</span> <span id="s519">I says to myself, okay, I guess this is what I have to do.</span> <span id="s520">I sat there on the machine, on a high chair, diligently, doing my job so fast.</span> <span id="s521">My fingers were bleeding, but I _____(c.494), my hands touched the machine.</span> <span id="s522">It was the spinning of the wheel.</span> <span id="s523">The wheel had also a stone, a sharp stone.</span> <span id="s524">Every time I hit it, my hands was brushing off.</span> <span id="s525">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s526">What can I do?</span> <span id="s527">Who am I going to ask?</span> <span id="s528">I might as well continue and learn the hard way until I learn what's going on.</span> <span id="s529">Well, it didn't take me long, I learned the procedure.</span> <span id="s530">I mastered it so beautifully that every time the German officer passed by, he says beautiful, beautiful.</span> <span id="s531">Thank you.</span> <span id="s532">I sat there but I didn't realize the hours that went there, twelve hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Night shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Night shift.</span> <span id="s535">This is the worst.</span> <span id="s536">I didn't sleep during the day.</span> <span id="s537">From six in the evening till six o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s538">In the meantime, when we got back to the camp, the other shift came back in.</span> <span id="s539">Then we saw more Jewish people arriving with trucks in different towns.</span> <span id="s540">Oh, how long you been here?</span> <span id="s541">Since yesterday.</span> <span id="s542">When you longer been here?</span> <span id="s543">Three days ago.</span> <span id="s544">We actually were the ones who opened up this particular camp.</span> <span id="s545">This Skarzysko camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">So you were the first--?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">The first group to be there.</span> <span id="s548">After a couple of days, we sort of get acclimated.</span> <span id="s549">Right away, as a youngster, I accepted the fact that this is going to be my lifestyle.</span> <span id="s550">For how long, I don't know.</span> <span id="s551">As a human being, I have to accept the fact, that this is going to be my lifestyle.</span> <span id="s552">I have no choice.</span> <span id="s553">I have to do the best I can if I want to survive.</span> <span id="s554">I wanted it so desperately.</span> <span id="s555">In the meantime, during the period of time as you work in the factory, some of my landsleit (c.29), landsmen, acquainted themselves with gentile people.</span> <span id="s556">This man who was supervisor said to them, I make a deal with you; you take letters home from us, to my hometown.</span> <span id="s557">They'll pay you well and bring us news from my home through the town.</span> <span id="s558">This was fair enough.</span> <span id="s559">G__ forbid, if this man is caught, no trial.</span> <span id="s560">The answer was hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">So the Pole could be hanged if he is caught carrying letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">If he is caught carrying letters or anything that didn't look---.</span> <span id="s563">Everybody was searched coming out from the gates.</span> <span id="s564">It was fortunate that he wasn't caught, very fortunate.</span> <span id="s565">Many times that I have seen with my own eyes, that this gentile man was caught carrying things for people in the factory.</span> <span id="s566">Not bringing it in, taking it out.</span> <span id="s567">You see that's when they catch you, when you go out from the factory.</span> <span id="s568">Very strict.</span> <span id="s569">Who were the searchers?</span> <span id="s570">Ukrainian soldiers, they were miserable.</span> <span id="s571">They were miserable.</span> <span id="s572">They beat you up for no reason whatsoever, for no reason, they beat you.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">They beat up Jews and Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">And Poles.</span> <span id="s575">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s576">They didn't discriminate.</span> <span id="s577">They didn't like the Poles to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Did they wear German uniforms, these Ukrainian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Yes, they wore German uniforms with old-fashioned rifles.</span> <span id="s580">Very large ones, World War I rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Russians' old rifles?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Right, exactly.</span> <span id="s583">That's the type of weapons they carried.</span> <span id="s584">But they wore German uniforms.</span> <span id="s585">They spoke German and Ukrainian, both languages.</span> <span id="s586">When they called this man, they always had to bring the people to see the result of the consequences.</span> <span id="s587">They made a circle, go around it, called this man out, tied his hand, put him in the tree, nothing.</span> <span id="s588">They teach everyone a lesson not to do it.</span> <span id="s589">As I said, we were very fortunate, we send this man home every Saturday and he brought news for us on Monday morning when he came back from Koprzeunitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Was he from your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">No.</span> <span id="s592">We gave him directions how to go, paid him well for it.</span> <span id="s593">He was very nonchalant.</span> <span id="s594">Was he going to make it, obvious.</span> <span id="s595">In the meantime, they were building already barracks for us.</span> <span id="s596">As the population in the camp was growing, they needed more space.</span> <span id="s597">They used army barracks.</span> <span id="s598">Each barrack was built with two bunks and a belly stove in the center, in case it gets cold.</span> <span id="s599">A number of the barracks.</span> <span id="s600">Each barracks was holding approximately, I would say about 50 to 60 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Who was doing the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">They had people from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Inmates.</span> <span id="s605">Everything was done by the inmates.</span> <span id="s606">In the meantime, every day when I went to the factory, I felt good.</span> <span id="s607">I lived another day.</span> <span id="s608">This was my thinking.</span> <span id="s609">I survived another day.</span> <span id="s610">When I came to the factory, I was more at ease than I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s611">This was still in 1942.</span> <span id="s612">I finished this project, I was transferred to a different machine.</span> <span id="s613">The machine was called a automatic driari (ph)(c.805), they call it in German.</span> <span id="s614">It made stutchrigen (ph)(c.605).</span> <span id="s615">Stuchrigen is a cover of the 50-caliber bullets.</span> <span id="s616">The 50-caliber bullet consist of three parts.</span> <span id="s617">I made one of them.</span> <span id="s618">Each tray, had on my machine.</span> <span id="s619">On my machine, I had two trays which d____(c.618) Each piece approximately had to be tested to make surethat the groving inside is properly.</span> <span id="s620">I was more concerned thqn they were bcause they could find out that I'm doing damages.</span> <span id="s621">This was my project.</span> <span id="s622">I make sure the circle's good.</span> <span id="s623">If it didn't work good, I call over the supervisor to adjust it.</span> <span id="s624">Many times the machine broke down, which happens.</span> <span id="s625">By the way, the factory that I was working was called Hasak (ph)(c.621).</span> <span id="s626">Hasak was a German company, originally in Germany way back in Germany.</span> <span id="s627">They had a few munition factories located in Poland.</span> <span id="s628">One was in Skarzysko Kamienna, the other one was in Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">They took over Polish buildings, had Polish supervisors, but the ownership was German now?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">German, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">The guards were Ukrainian?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">The Germans controlled it?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">The German officers, were they Wermacht or were they SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Wermacht, wermacht.</span> <span id="s637">They lived around the territory of the ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s638">They drove away the Polaks, they wouldn't let them live around that area, they settled themselves down.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">All the workers were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">All the workers were Jewish, except the supervisors.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Who were Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Who were Poles.</span> <span id="s643">Between June and August, we all got paid for our work.</span> <span id="s644">We got 80 zlotys a week.</span> <span id="s645">Eighty zlotys a week, I don't know how much it was that time in dollars but we all got paid.</span> <span id="s646">Our food supply wasn't bad either.</span> <span id="s647">They allowed to come in from Skarzysko, a truck with bread and we were able to purchase it.</span> <span id="s648">The nicest part was also we could get permission from the headquarters, inside the camp, to send out, let's see, a group of two or three men, to go near the store which was located in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s649">You could buy butter, could buy milk, all the little commodities because we had the money.</span> <span id="s650">There was no restrictions at that time.</span> <span id="s651">The camp consisted of, at that time already, approximately between four and five hundred inmates already.</span> <span id="s652">Because they kept bringing them in each day until the factory had built up the camp.</span> <span id="s653">So the camp wasn't too far away from the factory.</span> <span id="s654">I would say was about two kilometers from the factory so we marched every day.</span> <span id="s655">After they finished building the camp, this building was closed.</span> <span id="s656">We went over there.</span> <span id="s657">In the meantime, they expected, I assume, more inmates to be brought in.</span> <span id="s658">They build it where this tremendous building was all the way in the back, another tremendous camp for about 10,000 inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Were you still wearing your shorts?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Yes The same clothes that you had on in June?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">The same clothes but what I did.</span> <span id="s662">Every evening when I come home from work, I was able to get myself from the warehouse, they had a warehouse over there, get me a change of clothes.</span> <span id="s663">They gave me the first long pair of pants and some kind of button shirt that I had on and the rest I was able to wash myself.</span> <span id="s664">I took home some soap and a piece of paper to put in my pocket and I washed it outside.</span> <span id="s665">We had a big washing rack like water___(c.655) and I was able to wash my laundry.</span> <span id="s666">What else could I do?</span> <span id="s667">When we moved to the other barracks, immediately they build electric fences.</span> <span id="s668">Of course, in German, they wrote down and also in Polish, any one who crosses the fence would be dead.</span> <span id="s669">The electric would get hold of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Now you know what electricity is?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Now I know electricity, right.</span> <span id="s672">Believe me, I have no intention to leave, I have no intention to run.</span> <span id="s673">Anyone who would run away at night and thought they not going to be caught, I have bad news for them.</span> <span id="s674">They were caught.</span> <span id="s675">They were brought back into camp.</span> <span id="s676">Make a circle of us, put them in the center.</span> <span id="s677">Boom, boom and that's the end of it.</span> <span id="s678">They shot so many of them.</span> <span id="s679">You think somebody would learn a lesson.</span> <span id="s680">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s681">In 1942, there were already ghettos formed all over Europe.</span> <span id="s682">There was no more Jewish people in small towns.</span> <span id="s683">Everybody has been evacuated, either to ghettos or send away someplace else.</span> <span id="s684">In September, 1942, we sent home this gentile to our hometown.</span> <span id="s685">It was on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s686">He arrived in town, and he saw the whole Jewish community in the center of the city with packages, belongings, leaving town.</span> <span id="s687">Those who were sick, those who couldn't move, those who resisted, were shot.</span> <span id="s688">The ones who carried out all these atrocities were not the Germans.</span> <span id="s689">Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s690">They're the ones who did this.</span> <span id="s691">I mean they were ______(c.69), but they were delighted to do it.</span> <span id="s692">We all know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Your employment now?</span> <span id="s694">This is your supervisor, the one who keeps coming and going with messages?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Right, right.</span> <span id="s696">When he came back, he came back to me and he said, sorry I have to tell you this sad story.</span> <span id="s697">When I came into town, everybody was already packed in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">This was in September--?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">September, oh no, it was either before the Jewish holidays or after the Jewish holidays, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s700">I know it was in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Around the time of Rosh Hashonah?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Rosh Hashonah, right.</span> <span id="s703">In a group of people from my hometown who were police, who were committee, they were all slaughtered out.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Including your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Including my uncle.</span> <span id="s706">For what reason, what crime did they commit?</span> <span id="s707">That's their system.</span> <span id="s708">If you're too strong with them, they didn't like it.</span> <span id="s709">You knew too much.</span> <span id="s710">They had to annihilate you.</span> <span id="s711">They work the same system in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s712">If you were assigned to the group of people to burn them or to take them out and push them in the gas oven, you were next.</span> <span id="s713">There would be no sign, no witnesses.</span> <span id="s714">This was their system.</span> <span id="s715">A few were able to escape through the woods and able to come into our camp, to a different town, where a town was evacuated that particular day.</span> <span id="s716">They sort of dragged themselves along.</span> <span id="s717">When they came into our camp, a newcomer you could tell immediately.</span> <span id="s718">When they came in, I says, what's happening, what's going on?</span> <span id="s719">He says, Koprzewnitz was annihilated.</span> <span id="s720">Evacuated on Saturday, so many people were shot, so many people were killed, I didn't even want to ask who survived, who was killed, or what.</span> <span id="s721">I don't know.</span> <span id="s722">Right there and then, my whole life went like this, shut off from the world.</span> <span id="s723">My mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my aunt, my uncles, large families.</span> <span id="s724">Everything was cut off from this world for me.</span> <span id="s725">I'm all by myself.</span> <span id="s726">Nothing to look forward to.</span> <span id="s727">It's a dark world coming.</span> <span id="s728">The future looks very bleak but I am not going to give up.</span> <span id="s729">I'm here to fight it, I want to see the end of this war.</span> <span id="s730">I don't care how long it's going to take.</span> <span id="s731">I had a tremendous determination, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s732">As young as I was, I never gave up.</span> <span id="s733">I never volunteered, I did my work the way it should be.</span> <span id="s734">I don't care if anybody would criticize me, the way I worked, diligently.</span> <span id="s735">I had to do it in order to see the end of the war.</span> <span id="s736">I received the last letter from my parents.</span> <span id="s737">It says, my father wrote, we don't know where we're going but we know we want you to survive.</span> <span id="s738">We____(c.714) Your father knew that he was going to be deported somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Somewhere.</span> <span id="s740">He knew at least you will survive.</span> <span id="s741">I was going to survive.</span> <span id="s742">I was just in the same predicament as he was.</span> <span id="s743">My life was more valuable than his was?</span> <span id="s744">All right, so I was working over here.</span> <span id="s745">What happened if I get sick?</span> <span id="s746">I cannot work.</span> <span id="s747">They going to send me to a hospital, treat me?</span> <span id="s748">There was no such a thing.</span> <span id="s749">They had an infirmary for people in their hospital over there.</span> <span id="s750">As long as you were able to stay there once a week, a truck will come, pick out the people from the hospital, take them away.</span> <span id="s751">That's the end of them.</span> <span id="s752">If you're sick, you don't need it.</span> <span id="s753">As long as you are able to walk, able to work, you were valuable to those people.</span> <span id="s754">The Germans didn't care because there was no problem of people.</span> <span id="s755">They could bring in more and more and more people to replace you.</span> <span id="s756">You had to be alert, ________(c.726) Every week, once a week, either it was on a Wednesday or Thursday, the truck would come, clean out the hospital, send the people away.</span> <span id="s757">That's the end of those people.</span> <span id="s758">One day, it didn't miss me either, I had typhoid.</span> <span id="s759">I was very sick, I run a high fever.</span> <span id="s760">I was in the infirmary.</span> <span id="s761">You can't go to work, you got to go to the infirmary.</span> <span id="s762">I said to my friend, very close friend of mine, he says to me, let me know when the truck is coming.</span> <span id="s763">Somehow, he was able to find out when the truck was coming.</span> <span id="s764">He came in a day earlier to me, he says get the hell out of here, go to the bathhouse.</span> <span id="s765">Once you got out from the infirmary, we were able to go to the bathhouse to wash up.</span> <span id="s766">I dragged myself out to walk, my legs and my hands, crawled, hold on to my friend.</span> <span id="s767">Together, we walked to the bathhouse.</span> <span id="s768">It wasn't far away.</span> <span id="s769">I sat there in the water.</span> <span id="s770">The water kept pouring on me like crazy.</span> <span id="s771">I says, I have to get better.</span> <span id="s772">I can't go on like this.</span> <span id="s773">Somehow, a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s774">I came out from the bathhouse, all cured.</span> <span id="s775">I never had to go back into the hospital.</span> <span id="s776">I went right back to my barracks.</span> <span id="s777">A few day, I lined myself up to go to work.</span> <span id="s778">My machine was empty while I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s779">How long do you think they going to keep the machine open?</span> <span id="s780">I came into work; my supervisor was awful nice to me.</span> <span id="s781">He says to me, Vilak, how do you feel?</span> <span id="s782">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s783">, I says.</span> <span id="s784">I could eat something, I'll have something to eat.</span> <span id="s785">So he brought me over a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s786">I was very grateful.</span> <span id="s787">My strength came a little bit stronger each day.</span> <span id="s788">There was nothing to look forward to except every single day the same thing.</span> <span id="s789">Seven days a week.</span> <span id="s790">Twelve hours a day, labor, labor and more labor.</span> <span id="s791">The end of '42, we had already in the camp, close to ten thousand people.</span> <span id="s792">Skarzysko Kamienna with ten thousand.</span> <span id="s793">There were three departments.</span> <span id="s794">Verk ah (ph) (c.754), verk bay (ph) and verk tzen (ph).</span> <span id="s795">That's what they called them, departments.</span> <span id="s796">Verk ah (ph) which I was in, did mostly ammunition work, bullets for 50-calibers and what you call those heavy ammunition for anti-aircraft.</span> <span id="s797">They worked on levels, very hard working by the way.</span> <span id="s798">In verk beh, they mostly make these bombs, was a big factory, they made bombs.</span> <span id="s799">Verk teh, everyone who worked over there was yellow from the powder that they used to pour in into the ammunition.</span> <span id="s800">Was a liquid powder, I worked on it later on.</span> <span id="s801">You couldn't help working it because you had no protection, your face was open.</span> <span id="s802">The stuff grew on you.</span> <span id="s803">When you saw these people, looked at them, says where you come from, outer space?</span> <span id="s804">Completely yellow.</span> <span id="s805">They came once a week, to the bathhouse, to take a bath.</span> <span id="s806">Their clothing was taken away from them to be cleaned out and all that stuff and you take a bath.</span> <span id="s807">The yellow, that stuff doesn't come out so easily.</span> <span id="s808">There were three departments and that's Skarzysko area.</span> <span id="s809">People were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s810">Every single day the truck would leave and there were people taken out from the barracks.</span> <span id="s811">Boxes outside, near the camp they had it, boxes lying around, just dump them in there until the middle of the day.</span> <span id="s812">Then they take them out and must bury them.</span> <span id="s813">Then immigration stopped, all the ghettos, I understand, I don't what's happening, I don't know what is going on but I could listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s814">At twelve o'clock, the German radio would give announcement about the war in Polish.</span> <span id="s815">It says everything is great, the Germans are winning, the Germans are making progress.</span> <span id="s816">They are beating the hell out of the Russians and all this.</span> <span id="s817">Use your own imagination.</span> <span id="s818">All I know is one thing that the Germans are working 24 hours a day making ammunition like crazy.</span> <span id="s819">People are dying like flies for lack of food.</span> <span id="s820">Our daily ration consist of, in the morning, a cup of black coffee.</span> <span id="s821">You used to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning because 6 o'clock we had to be in the factory.</span> <span id="s822">At lunchtime, at 12 o'clock, you got a cup of soup, you were lucky if the supervisor, the Jewish supervisor gave you the soup; otherwise he give you water.</span> <span id="s823">We had a choice with it?</span> <span id="s824">We had no choice.</span> <span id="s825">This had to be your contentment.</span> <span id="s826">In the evening when you came home from work, each barrack had to go to a consumer's place where they brought in all the bread and sometimes a little margarine with jello.</span> <span id="s827">Each barrack was assigned a certain amount of bread.</span> <span id="s828">When they brought in the bread into the barracks, for so many people, everybody stood at the table because we assigned one man to be in charge.</span> <span id="s829">Please, you divide the bread.</span> <span id="s830">You were hungry, you were _____(c.794).</span> <span id="s831">He took a knife, carefully measuring each slice like this here, like this here.</span> <span id="s832">At the end of it, then he measured it and if everybody eyes' were content, then he started to slice it.</span> <span id="s833">You write down numbers, we all have numbers we write.</span> <span id="s834">Put the numbers on a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s835">You throw it into a hat.</span> <span id="s836">Which one gets the first slice?</span> <span id="s837">which one gets the second slice and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s838">Each group that you belong to, you try to get yourself somebody that you like, somebody who's friendly because ______(c.800).</span> <span id="s839">You're not dealing with human beings any more, you're dealing with vultures.</span> <span id="s840">You're hungry, you worked 12 hours a day.</span> <span id="s841">You have nothing to eat--your stomach is empty, your stomach is crawling.</span> <span id="s842">After you divide the bread, you ____a little ____(c.804) in it, with whatever margarine they give you or a little jelly.</span> <span id="s843">You go out into the yard and get yourself a cup of water.</span> <span id="s844">This was your supper.</span> <span id="s845">Then you sat in your barrack or you sat outside after dark reminiscing in the good olden days.</span> <span id="s846">This was your concentration, reminiscing about home, family, what was prepared for supper, what was prepared for the holidays, what you did at home, what kind of business.</span> <span id="s847">You talked to each other, you made yourself a little bit homey, make you feel good.</span> <span id="s848">We all strive for one purpose, we want to survive.</span> <span id="s849">We also gave up, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s850">We had a motto written out in every barrack.</span> <span id="s851">Hold onto your skin, brother, hold onto yourself.</span> <span id="s852">Don't give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">In German or Polish or Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">In Yiddish.</span> <span id="s855">Polish and in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s856">German?</span> <span id="s857">, we don't like German.</span> <span id="s858">We had a German supervisor, I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s859">He was a tall, old man.</span> <span id="s860">When he came into the camps, whoever he saw in front of him, pfft, just like that, like flies.</span> <span id="s861">Like a fly, didn't mean anything to him.</span> <span id="s862">For what reason?</span> <span id="s863">I mean this guy just came from 24 hours of work.</span> <span id="s864">What'd he shoot him for?</span> <span id="s865">I came out from the bathhouse in the camp, when I was washing myself, getting myself ready to work.</span> <span id="s866">All of a sudden, I see this guy shooting.</span> <span id="s867">I took off like the devil!</span> <span id="s868">Where I got the energy, I don't know but I run.</span> <span id="s869">That day, it didn't happen one day, it happened practically every day--whenever he came into camp.</span> <span id="s870">Whenever he saw a person, boom, just like that.</span> <span id="s871">Didn't mean a damn thing.</span> <span id="s872">After he retired in 1943, we got in another one, worse than he was.</span> <span id="s873">Was an old man, he had a hunchback, he walked around with a dog.</span> <span id="s874">He considered a human being as an animal.</span> <span id="s875">He says to the dog, he says Mensch, Neim din hundt (ph)(c.831), Man, take this dog.</span> <span id="s876">You were the dog, he was the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">The dog was the man?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">The dog used to grab hold of you, pulled you down, he'll go and get the gun, just like that.</span> <span id="s879">There was no remorse.</span> <span id="s880">This particular man, if I ever heard of him, I don't know whether he's alive or dead, he had the rights to decide who should live and who should die.</span> <span id="s881">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s882">This particular old man, walking around with a cane and a hundt (ph)(c.837) and he decided who should live and who should die.</span> <span id="s883">One day I was working outside the munition factory, I was transferred to another munition factory.</span> <span id="s884">It was also a very nice place there, wasn't too many people, -- You mean out of Verk ah (c.841) A?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">It was part of Verk ah (c.842).</span> <span id="s886">I didn't work there too long it was just a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">You're on the day shift now since the time you were sick, you're on the day shift?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">I went on the day shift.</span> <span id="s889">Every week we changed around.</span> <span id="s890">The day shift changed Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s891">If you were on the day shift Sunday morning, you started six o'clock, you go home at 12.</span> <span id="s892">Night shift went in at 12, worked till 6.</span> <span id="s893">Then you went back at six in the evening, worked a full day until six in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">The horse meat, that was only in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Later on, we got it too.</span> <span id="s896">Then later on all the meat disappeared.</span> <span id="s897">I was standing over there working.</span> <span id="s898">All of a sudden I see this woman being brought into camp.</span> <span id="s899">A young girl, how nervous she was, she walked around.</span> <span id="s900">He yelled out to her, why she was already in the middle of the camp.</span> <span id="s901">He yelled out to the dog, mensch nem der hundt (ph)(c.878).</span> <span id="s902">He jumped on her and throw her down and then he _____(c.877).</span> <span id="s903">There was no trial, no questions asked.</span> <span id="s904">You run away, you're caught, you die.</span> <span id="s905">No questions asked.</span> <span id="s906">In '43, we had different stories.</span> <span id="s907">Also the rumors were going around in the camp.</span> <span id="s908">That each town in Poland is being evacuated and sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s909">Treblinka, Majdanek.</span> <span id="s910">Those were the camps, mostly exterminated camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">You heard of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Yes, not before, not before.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">But in '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">In '43, how did I hear about it?</span> <span id="s915">They needed more labor in Skarzysko, they brought these people from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s916">How did I know they were Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Tatoos.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Had the numbers.</span> <span id="s919">When they came in, they told us it was this and this, I couldn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">You had it bad, but this was worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Worse, right.</span> <span id="s922">Then an order came, everybody has to pack up and we are going into the main factory.</span> <span id="s923">We didn't know we're going into the main factory.</span> <span id="s924">We thought we're being evacuated on trains because we saw trains on the rail tracks, empty trains.</span> <span id="s925">We believe for us.</span> <span id="s926">Believe me, in those days, it didn't mean damn thing.</span> <span id="s927">A train was there, the train wasn't there.</span> <span id="s928">Whatever fate will take place, will take place.</span> <span id="s929">It didn't make any difference any more.</span> <span id="s930">We were so acclimated like.</span> <span id="s931">I was over there already over a year.</span> <span id="s932">Life was to me, it was like; it has to be like that.</span> <span id="s933">This is the life I going to lead for how long, I don't know but I want to see the end of it.</span> <span id="s934">Everybody packed up, all the camps, went into the main factory.</span> <span id="s935">Over there, we hear commotion going on, screaming, yelling and carrying on.</span> <span id="s936">If you have any money, gold, silver, anything valuable, toss it out Leave it there and if we catch it, boom.</span> <span id="s937">That was the threat what I tell you, shoot.</span> <span id="s938">No questions ___.</span> <span id="s939">I said to myself, I don't have anything and I have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s940">They want to search me, search me.</span> <span id="s941">Papers I got plenty, garbage I got plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">You're not getting the 80 zlotys a week any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">No, that stopped, let's see, about three months later, it stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Three months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Three months later.</span> <span id="s946">I was getting it, I'm telling you 80 zlotys a month, great.</span> <span id="s947">I was able to buy food, I thought it was a paradise comparing with what was at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">You're not with this Polish supervisor any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">No more, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Are any people in your group from your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Yes, with them I __.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">You still have some friends from ___.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Yes, but a lot of them died out already.</span> <span id="s954">They're still here, a few of these still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">They're still with you when you go to this big factory, in '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Yes, they're still there.</span> <span id="s957">Ten of my hometown boys have decided to disappear.</span> <span id="s958">They took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Escaped.</span> <span id="s961">I kept warning.</span> <span id="s962">I says please don't run.</span> <span id="s963">There's nobody at home.</span> <span id="s964">If you going to go back to town, they're going to catch you.</span> <span id="s965">You're going to be outstanding like anything.</span> <span id="s966">Where you going to go?</span> <span id="s967">But he wouldn't listen.</span> <span id="s968">Only wants to run.</span> <span id="s969">That was my problem.</span> <span id="s970">That's what I felt.</span> <span id="s971">I have decided right there and then.</span> <span id="s972">I'm not going to run away.</span> <span id="s973">I'm not going to do anything drastic.</span> <span id="s974">It's not in my power any more.</span> <span id="s975">I'm in somebody else's hands, somebody else's fate.</span> <span id="s976">Whatever will happen, will happen.</span> <span id="s977">G__ wants to give me life, I'll survive.</span> <span id="s978">If not, what else can I do?</span> <span id="s979">We all got into the big factory.</span> <span id="s980">They start going one by one searching.</span> <span id="s981">Do you have anything of value?</span> <span id="s982">I says, I have nothing.</span> <span id="s983">Open up your bag.</span> <span id="s984">Don't _______.</span> <span id="s985">Bag it up, get it out of here.</span> <span id="s986">I had nothing, so what do you want me to do?</span> <span id="s987">I'm a youngster.</span> <span id="s988">Those who they found, they found a ring, they found valuables, they took them out.</span> <span id="s989">They beat the living daylight out of them.</span> <span id="s990">Whoever they found anything on them.</span> <span id="s991">They didn't declare it or give it back to the Germans.</span> <span id="s992">They collected gold, silver, jewelry, anything, any kind of jewelry, watches, anything that was valuable, you had to turn it in, money.</span> <span id="s993">I don't have anything, I don't give you anything.</span> <span id="s994">Enough that we got out, we sort of felt a relief because we thought that we're going on the trains.</span> <span id="s995">Back to the barracks, we spent a whole day in the camp, went back to the barracks, that same day, back to work again in the factory.</span> <span id="s996">Back to the factory.</span> <span id="s997">We worked those systems and then we knew already 100%, that 99% of the Jewish people in Poland have been evacuated, either to Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek or to labor camps.</span> <span id="s998">No other news came forward.</span> <span id="s999">There was no other news we get from.</span> <span id="s1000">Anyone who run away and he was caught, he couldn't tell us anything because he was killed immediately.</span> <span id="s1001">Immediately, no question there.</span> <span id="s1002">We had Jewish supervisors too, policemen.</span> <span id="s1003">They just as lousy as the Germans.</span> <span id="s1004">Whether it was their fault, they had to do a thing, so they did it.</span> <span id="s1005">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1006">I'm not going to put my self in their situation.</span> <span id="s1007">They had it good.</span> <span id="s1008">They didn't have to do what they did.</span> <span id="s1009">Point out that this man tried to run away, this man tried to do this here.</span> <span id="s1010">They pointed fingers which wasn't the proper thing to do.</span> <span id="s1011">In 1943, December, before Christmas, it was very bad.</span> <span id="s1012">We didn't have much food.</span> <span id="s1013">They didn't supply anything for us.</span> <span id="s1014">No work, no food.</span> <span id="s1015">You had one day off, one lousy day off, Christmas.</span> <span id="s1016">We looked forward to the day we go back to work.</span> <span id="s1017">At least we get something to drink, something to eat.</span> <span id="s1018">Water, we had plenty, there was no question about it.</span> <span id="s1019">People were swelling from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1020">If you were overage, you didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1021">Younger age, you have a chance.</span> <span id="s1022">Then the fateful day came, 1944.</span> <span id="s1023">I don't remember when it was in June or July, I was assigned to a project, to evacuate machines onto the trains.</span> <span id="s1024">We knew the war was coming closer, we heard shooting at night, we could see lighting up at night.</span> <span id="s1025">By the way, in the camp itself, we had the security guards, right in the smack of the camp, in the middle of the camp.</span> <span id="s1026">A post very high up there, he could see anybody walking out at night or whatever.</span> <span id="s1027">It didn't mean a damn thing anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Was your camp ever bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">No, not in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Even though it was a munitions factory, it was not bombed by American or Russian --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Russia could have bombed it if they wanted.</span> <span id="s1032">I guess they wanted to prevent it.</span> <span id="s1033">Then the Germans cleaned out the whole factory.</span> <span id="s1034">They took out all the machineries and sent it to Germany.</span> <span id="s1035">["When did they have the _______?"]</span> <span id="s1036">The extortion was in Germany, in Schleden (ph)(c.983).</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">The factory, even though you guys were amateurs, you were making shells and ammunition, there were no accidental explosions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">No, no.</span> <span id="s1039">As I said.....</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">You guys were pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Everybody had to watch out for themselves.</span> <span id="s1042">As I said, you could not do sabotage.</span> <span id="s1043">Every ammo that went through your system, your number was marked on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Someone could make a mistake.</span> <span id="s1045">I know in this country, there were some big explosions in ammunition factories where it wasn't a question of sabotage, it was just a question of someone making a mistake, carelessness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">You couldn't make mistakes in here because they watched you.</span> <span id="s1047">The watchers are very careful.</span> <span id="s1048">Believe me, every ammo that came out from the machine, the water was pouring on it.</span> <span id="s1049">I used to pick it up right away, test it immediately, put it in the tray.</span> <span id="s1050">When the German supervisor came around and he picked up and checked it, goes like this here, okay.</span> <span id="s1051">How can you do damage?</span> <span id="s1052">You can't do any damages.</span> <span id="s1053">He watched me many times, the way I worked so diligently.</span> <span id="s1054">He called over the Jewish supervisor.</span> <span id="s1055">He says to him, he's better than youga, gaden, dri sumpn (ph)(c.001), I want you to give this young man three soups a day.</span> <span id="s1056">I says, oh boy, I did something good, he's going to give me extra soup.</span> <span id="s1057">You think he gave it to me?</span> <span id="s1058">He didn't give it to me.</span> <span id="s1059">["Who, the Rottenberg?</span> <span id="s1060">(ph)"] Yeah, he didn't give it to me.</span> <span id="s1061">["The relative of..."] Forget about it.</span> <span id="s1062">He didn't give it to me.</span> <span id="s1063">I went over to him, I said, you stood there by the machine when this German supervisor said to you distinctly, I heard you and you heard me; give him extra.</span> <span id="s1064">Why didn't you give me?</span> <span id="s1065">Why don't you give it to me?</span> <span id="s1066">Go away.</span> <span id="s1067">How can I forget these things?</span> <span id="s1068">It lies in your mind.</span> <span id="s1069">Food is your main object, right through the camp.</span> <span id="s1070">Food, number one, that's all that was on your mind.</span> <span id="s1071">Forget about relatives, forget about your parents, forget about your brothers and sisters, forget about your property, education, nothing existed from this world except food.</span> <span id="s1072">That's the only thing was on your mind.</span> <span id="s1073">Food, you were hungry!</span> <span id="s1074">You had worked on empty stomach, you were hungry.</span> <span id="s1075">As I was saying, I was transferred to this ammunition factory to move machinery on trains.</span> <span id="s1076">All the time I see the whole camp from a distance.</span> <span id="s1077">I was this side, they were camped over there.</span> <span id="s1078">The whole camp was lined up, one line.</span> <span id="s1079">This German officer, a crippled guy, with the dog, deciding your fate for the day.</span> <span id="s1080">This way, this way, this way, this way.</span> <span id="s1081">The minute you went to the left, you were right on the truck.</span> <span id="s1082">You had no mercy to say anything, right on the truck.</span> <span id="s1083">They kept saying, where we're going, he says you're going to another camp.</span> <span id="s1084">Everybody knew what it was.</span> <span id="s1085">Within two hours, the camp was selected.</span> <span id="s1086">Those who were on the trucks, a half an hour later, you could have moved the whole selection away.</span> <span id="s1087">That was the end of those people.</span> <span id="s1088">The remainder, they brought them into the factory to unhook all the wires.</span> <span id="s1089">The trains came in, we loaded them up on the trains and they sent us back to camp.</span> <span id="s1090">As I said, if I was in camp, I would have been in the line too.</span> <span id="s1091">Would be they say left, I would go right.</span> <span id="s1092">Faith was with me.</span> <span id="s1093">I had a strong faith; I knew I had to make it.</span> <span id="s1094">I wouldn't give up.</span> <span id="s1095">This was in '44.</span> <span id="s1096">Enough to be finished loading up the freights.</span> <span id="s1097">They brought in empty cattle wagons and loaded us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Loading you into ....</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Into cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Cattle trains, open or closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Open.</span> <span id="s1102">There must have been a tremendous train load, either 50 or 60 cars, I didn't count them.</span> <span id="s1103">Going around, I was trying to see how many trains--to me everything was a novelty.</span> <span id="s1104">I never seen a train in my life.</span> <span id="s1105">This was the first time I see trains.</span> <span id="s1106">I see ammunitions, I see factories, I see machinery, I see electricity.</span> <span id="s1107">I was a youngster, I was growing up.</span> <span id="s1108">My life here, my youthhood was take away from me.</span> <span id="s1109">I'm learning something which I have no choice to control, which I'm forced to do it, beyond control.</span> <span id="s1110">What else can I say?</span> <span id="s1111">Once we are aboard the train, they didn't count where we're going, just we go.</span> <span id="s1112">As long as we stood on the station, we were going crazy.</span> <span id="s1113">Warm, open train, nothing.</span> <span id="s1114">We had to go.</span> <span id="s1115">______ ______ (c.068) What can you do?</span> <span id="s1116">You were lying in a cattle train with a hundred men or so.</span> <span id="s1117">They said we have to go, what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1118">Had no choice.</span> <span id="s1119">We were riding fro Skarzysko Kamienna either two or three days, all around to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1120">When we arrived at Czestochowa, we recognized the area from history, Matka Boska, the Madonna.</span> <span id="s1121">Recognize that period.</span> <span id="s1122">It was also a coal area there.</span> <span id="s1123">When we arrived, we saw the same factory, Hasak.</span> <span id="s1124">The war's going on over there.</span> <span id="s1125">This is, let's see, 60 kilometers from the German border.</span> <span id="s1126">Kratersberg (ph)(c.081) was the first German town from Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1127">We got off there, they sent us into the camp.</span> <span id="s1128">We got our first meal in three days.</span> <span id="s1129">I couldn't walk, I was so weak.</span> <span id="s1130">I held on to my friend, he held on to me, the two of us went together.</span> <span id="s1131">We stayed in Czestochowa a couple of days, not too...then line up again.</span> <span id="s1132">We lined up and in the meantime, the people who lived in there before, they worked in that factory.</span> <span id="s1133">A munition factory same as we had in Skarzysko Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1134">From there we boarded trains again and we kept riding and riding.</span> <span id="s1135">For one week, it took us more than a week; we stopped in a place called Leipzig.</span> <span id="s1136">In Leipzig, they took off the women from the train.</span> <span id="s1137">I think they had a factory there someplace in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s1138">They took the women off the train and then they moved to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1139">We continued to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1140">Buchenwald is located very deep in the woods.</span> <span id="s1141">Buchenwald, itself, in German, is forest.</span> <span id="s1142">When we arrived in Buchenwald, the train stopped, everybody, outsteinen (ph) (c.104), off the train.</span> <span id="s1143">We got off the train, we held on to each other.</span> <span id="s1144">The first notice we saw, Kasette Lagen (ph)(c.107).</span> <span id="s1145">_________ Work makes life sweet.</span> <span id="s1146">How these skeleton figures on the top of the gate when we walked in.</span> <span id="s1147">We thought that this is the end of us.</span> <span id="s1148">We start mumbling to each other.</span> <span id="s1149">Says okay, so what can we do?</span> <span id="s1150">We're here, we don't go any place else, what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s1151">We go into this big, tremendous ground and they said everybody sit down.</span> <span id="s1152">We sat down and they took fifty people at a time.</span> <span id="s1153">They march you in the room.</span> <span id="s1154">In the room there and you don't see them any more.</span> <span id="s1155">They take another group, and another group and another group.</span> <span id="s1156">You don't see these people coming out again.</span> <span id="s1157">We assume that this is the end of us all.</span> <span id="s1158">We turn around to each other, whoever was remaining here and says, look, wait and see, nice to know you.</span> <span id="s1159">Maybe we'll see each other in Heaven.</span> <span id="s1160">In the meantime, whatever you have left over in your food, let's share it and eat before we die.</span> <span id="s1161">Once you get on the other side you don't see anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s1162">This is the assumption we took.</span> <span id="s1163">When you go into a room and nobody comes out again, what do you assume, right?</span> <span id="s1164">My turn came with 50 others.</span> <span id="s1165">The first thing when you walk into this big room, all your clothes you take off.</span> <span id="s1166">Every belonging that you have, you just leave behind.</span> <span id="s1167">Don't even touch anything.</span> <span id="s1168">Open your mouth, open your rear, they looked inside to see if you're carrying any gold or silver, jewelry or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1169">I don't have anything.</span> <span id="s1170">They always yelling, screaming, you know, to make you be afraid.</span> <span id="s1171">There's nothing to hide.</span> <span id="s1172">Leave everything behind you.</span> <span id="s1173">That's when I have pictures of my parents, my brother and sister.</span> <span id="s1174">I had to leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s1175">After we got through the yelling and the screaming, we go into another room.</span> <span id="s1176">When you come into the other room, you get unlousy.</span> <span id="s1177">They clean you up.</span> <span id="s1178">Barber standing there with electric machines and clean you up all the way, top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1179">Then you go into a bathroom and they give you a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s1180">On the soap, was written down, rif, r-i-f, rein yiddish fat (c.154).</span> <span id="s1181">Pure Jewish fat.</span> <span id="s1182">That was written down on the piece of soap.</span> <span id="s1183">We translated that way because what else could the rif stand for, okay?</span> <span id="s1184">We assumed that maybe that's what it means.</span> <span id="s1185">Everyone got a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s1186">Believe me, the twenty-five people who were with me in the shower room, we looked up there to see whether water's coming down or something else is coming down.</span> <span id="s1187">We never saw anybody else except our own little group.</span> <span id="s1188">Once inside, the doors closed.</span> <span id="s1189">Could be only one thing coming down, either water or gas.</span> <span id="s1190">Water came.</span> <span id="s1191">What a relief.</span> <span id="s1192">Ah, vasser!</span> <span id="s1193">, what a relief.</span> <span id="s1194">You know, your mind works on you with such tremendous tricks.</span> <span id="s1195">You're so confused, you go around in circles, why you standing anticipating, what is going to come out of this hole.</span> <span id="s1196">water or gas?</span> <span id="s1197">Everybody stands there, anticipating, holding each other's hands.</span> <span id="s1198">I've never before you--the best friends in the world.</span> <span id="s1199">Everybody held a hand when they stood inside waiting for the water to come.</span> <span id="s1200">The water finally came, what a relief.</span> <span id="s1201">We could hear, everybody saying, uhhh, that's the relief it was.</span> <span id="s1202">We took the soap and start washing our hands like this.</span> <span id="s1203">When we got through, they give you a uniform, like pajama stripes and they give you a number.</span> <span id="s1204">One number ______ you sew up in here, one number you sew up in your clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">One number on your chest near your breast pocket and the other on your thigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">On your thigh, yes.</span> <span id="s1207">This is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Your number was 68,548.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Right.</span> <span id="s1210">That number, I can't forget.</span> <span id="s1211">This goes with me for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s1212">It's embedded in my head.</span> <span id="s1213">That number, you wrote down it here, they all stamped it already, but you have to sew it on.</span> <span id="s1214">So later on, you sew it on, one over here, over here.</span> <span id="s1215">The pajamas you got like, you know, striped clothing and you walked out on the other side, then you see the other groups.</span> <span id="s1216">What a relief.</span> <span id="s1217">Came back to life.</span> <span id="s1218">This was Buchenwald... They send us into a area with a tremendous camp.</span> <span id="s1219">They had Russians, French, Poles, Yugoslavians, Czechs, they had practically from all European people in that particular camp.</span> <span id="s1220">G__ knows how many thousands were there.</span> <span id="s1221">The Russians were treated terribly.</span> <span id="s1222">They were terribly treated.</span> <span id="s1223">It was a gas chamber in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1224">They used it in '41', '42, '43.</span> <span id="s1225">They stopped using it in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Do you remember when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Yes.</span> <span id="s1228">What year it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">The date.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">The date was July 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Nineteen forty-four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Nineteen forty-four.</span> <span id="s1233">July 18, 1944 was a hot day very hot, very hot.</span> <span id="s1234">We were allocated in that particular area.</span> <span id="s1235">It was called the tent camp.</span> <span id="s1236">Others had barracks.</span> <span id="s1237">We had tents.</span> <span id="s1238">There were supervisors over there who were, quite a long time ago, were communists, communists.</span> <span id="s1239">Polish people, Jewish, they believe in communism.</span> <span id="s1240">When we...</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">(Tape 2) You were describing your new communist supervisors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Right.</span> <span id="s1243">He asked us to point out to him the Jewish supervisors who were with us in Skarzysko Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1244">They _____they performed over there.</span> <span id="s1245">He says, from here on, they not going to go anyplace with you any more.</span> <span id="s1246">We pointed them out.</span> <span id="s1247">They took them out at night and took care of them.</span> <span id="s1248">The Germans didn't care, as long as they were counted, 500 people, one dead.</span> <span id="s1249">That doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1250">How he died is nobody's business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">These were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">The new supervisors killed the old supervisors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1255">That was the whole idea.</span> <span id="s1256">What revenge could I take on this man, what he did in the camp and what I saw with my own eyes?</span> <span id="s1257">What revenge could I take possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Which supervisors did they kill?</span> <span id="s1259">These are the kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">The kapos, yes.</span> <span id="s1261">Jewish kapos, policemen.</span> <span id="s1262">They were policemen, they were dressed up they think G_ sent from this world, that they could walk around with a cane in his hand saying, here this is no good this man, get rid of him.</span> <span id="s1263">What the hell is this here?</span> <span id="s1264">Why turning people in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">The Polish supervisor you talked about before, he's not with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">No.</span> <span id="s1267">That was the end.</span> <span id="s1268">Once the camp was evacuated, all the machinery was taken out; the Polish workers stopped.</span> <span id="s1269">They went back to their homes.</span> <span id="s1270">That's it.</span> <span id="s1271">They had no work any more.</span> <span id="s1272">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1273">They waited for the Russians to come in.</span> <span id="s1274">If I would have remained in Czestachowa two extra weeks, I would have been liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1275">This case, in reverse, I had to suffer another year.</span> <span id="s1276">We are in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Since July 18th, you're there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Right.</span> <span id="s1279">Buchenwald, we started to go out to work immediately the following day in a quarry.</span> <span id="s1280">There was a tremendous quarry located in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1281">We picked up stones, loaded them on wagons and automatically the wagons went up the hill all the way to the top and unloaded with trucks, whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s1282">This was going on, not 24 hours a day, 8 hours a day, which wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s1283">Buchenwald, we thought, comparing to the other camps, was sort of a paradise.</span> <span id="s1284">It didn't have the Ukrainian supervisors, was an SS Kommando there, headquarters who took charge of the whole camp.</span> <span id="s1285">Each camp was located with an area which was bordered off.</span> <span id="s1286">You couldn't get in from one camp to the other one, with a border guard.</span> <span id="s1287">You had your own board of supervisors, camp inmates rather.</span> <span id="s1288">They were gentle.</span> <span id="s1289">They weren't as brutal as the ones we had in Skarzysko Kamienna, where other camp inmates had.</span> <span id="s1290">This is comparison to the ones I went through.</span> <span id="s1291">Was already so to speak, much easier.</span> <span id="s1292">I was working there for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s1293">Then they needed--a new camp opened up in Schleeben (ph)(c.41).</span> <span id="s1294">It's a village in the woods, 60 kilometers from Leipzig and 60 kilometers from Berlin, something like that.</span> <span id="s1295">That's what they told us, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1296">I didn't measure it, that's what they told us when we were going there.</span> <span id="s1297">They lined us up, they says they need, 500 people.</span> <span id="s1298">Okay, so loaded up train load of 500 people, with guards and they send us to Schleeben (c.46).</span> <span id="s1299">We arrive at the station in Schleeben.</span> <span id="s1300">We marched for two miles into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">You went by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">By train, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Open cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Yes, open cars.</span> <span id="s1305">When we arrived to Schleeben, they unloaded the train, counted the people again.</span> <span id="s1306">You see how important we were?</span> <span id="s1307">Never stopped counting.</span> <span id="s1308">Morning, noon and night, they counted us.</span> <span id="s1309">We arrived at Schleeben into the camp.</span> <span id="s1310">Barracks were existed over there already.</span> <span id="s1311">They had barracks all around, had a kitchen.</span> <span id="s1312">They lined us up and they assigned each group to a barrack.</span> <span id="s1313">I was assigned to barrack number 20 with another 35 men.</span> <span id="s1314">They told us that tonight we're going to stay here, tomorrow morning we start arbeiten, work.</span> <span id="s1315">The factory from the camp was approximately between two and two and a half kilometers which was very deep into the woods.</span> <span id="s1316">The factories consist of mostly anti-tank grenades.</span> <span id="s1317">They call them in German, panzer faus (ph)(c.58).</span> <span id="s1318">Was an oblong shape, a head with a long pipe.</span> <span id="s1319">I think the Americans...</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Like the bazooka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">The bazooka, exactly.</span> <span id="s1322">Just like a bazooka.</span> <span id="s1323">I was assigned to a factory where we poured the liquid into the head of the anti-tank grenade.</span> <span id="s1324">The person sat downstairs, we have to turn about and let it pour in one after the other.</span> <span id="s1325">Then you put it in the water, standing in the water so you can cool off.</span> <span id="s1326">In the other side, transport begin the powder in sacks.</span> <span id="s1327">That's where the people got yellow, from that powder.</span> <span id="s1328">I was fortunate, I wasn't working inside; I got some of it, I still have it, I have a mark on me, that powder.</span> <span id="s1329">I was on the outside but I used to bring in the sack, hand it over to the man upstairs.</span> <span id="s1330">He had to pour in, into a kettle, was an aluminum two kettles, aluminum, a certain amount of this type of ingredients, a certain amount of that ingredients.</span> <span id="s1331">It goes into a certain degree of temperature before you're able to release it into those heads.</span> <span id="s1332">Once you go into the heads, you line it up.</span> <span id="s1333">Then you have another group of people picking it up, putting it further, cleaning it, grinding it off and everything.</span> <span id="s1334">There were seven factories.</span> <span id="s1335">Each factory had a different department of jobs to do.</span> <span id="s1336">There was one factory over there where they bored a hole in the head, where they could put in the pin.</span> <span id="s1337">The pipe and the pin went together.</span> <span id="s1338">Once you put this compartment--in other words, if you put the pipe and the pin together and twist it in together, you put it on your shoulder, you're able to fire it.</span> <span id="s1339">Each bomb that was produced, your number went on it.</span> <span id="s1340">Understand?</span> <span id="s1341">That's why sabotage was prevented.</span> <span id="s1342">It was no incidents while we were working there.</span> <span id="s1343">Then there was transportation.</span> <span id="s1344">Transport people had to unload and load this ammunition.</span> <span id="s1345">They worked very hard, very very hard.</span> <span id="s1346">Everything was heavy, with me, I was a youngster, I could squeeze myself in with somebody else.</span> <span id="s1347">I was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1348">I worked on the outside bringing in the sacks with the powder, hand it over to the other man upstairs.</span> <span id="s1349">He in return, had to pour it into kettles, aluminum kettles, constantly under the supervision of a German officer, constantly.</span> <span id="s1350">Your eyes never went off of him.</span> <span id="s1351">The work was from 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening, 12 hours a day, 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1352">I worked in this factory, everything was fine.</span> <span id="s1353">We came home in the barracks in the evening.</span> <span id="s1354">We got our ration, like every place else.</span> <span id="s1355">A quarter pound of bread, a little margarine and a cup of water, that was your supper.</span> <span id="s1356">Each day was the same there.</span> <span id="s1357">I don't remember exactly, it was in November, October, 1944; it was on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1358">I worked the day shift, 6 in the morning, 6 at night, I went home.</span> <span id="s1359">By the way, Germany, there was no changing shifts.</span> <span id="s1360">Only on Sunday, change of shifts.</span> <span id="s1361">Czestochowa, you worked from 6 to 12, you go home and come back at 6.</span> <span id="s1362">You work the night shift.</span> <span id="s1363">In Germany, you worked from 6 in the evening to 12, then you change the shift the following day.</span> <span id="s1364">I went home that evening with my friend when all of a sudden, it was two o'clock in the morning, or three o'clock in the morning, hear a tremendous blow out.</span> <span id="s1365">Like a bomb would fall right in front of your nose.</span> <span id="s1366">It shattered all the windows.</span> <span id="s1367">I got hit with the glass in the forehead.</span> <span id="s1368">There was bleeding.</span> <span id="s1369">I didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1370">I run under the table, start to hide.</span> <span id="s1371">Everybody run out of their beds because you couldn't run anyplace else.</span> <span id="s1372">You look out the window, facing the factories, you could see blowups and blowups, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1373">Explosions going like crazy.</span> <span id="s1374">You couldn't imagine, right away you knew it was the factory.</span> <span id="s1375">What was the first thing that came into your mind?</span> <span id="s1376">Your friends are working the night shift is killed.</span> <span id="s1377">That's the first thing that came into your mind.</span> <span id="s1378">The Germans were afraid that something is going to happen here because the explosion is so terrible.</span> <span id="s1379">They took us all out from the camp.</span> <span id="s1380">They pushed us into a field, away from the camp.</span> <span id="s1381">They needed help to dig ditches so the fire wouldn't spread.</span> <span id="s1382">They came around and they grabbed whoever is able to walk.</span> <span id="s1383">Whoever was able to crawl, he gave them shovels.</span> <span id="s1384">There was a very small fire department, a village like that would have a big fire department?</span> <span id="s1385">A small fire department.</span> <span id="s1386">We kept digging ditches, all around the factory.</span> <span id="s1387">This explosion could go in, this was ammunition.</span> <span id="s1388">Ammunition there, live ammunition!</span> <span id="s1389">Powder!</span> <span id="s1390">How many tons of powder were lying in those sacks that blew up to smithereens?</span> <span id="s1391">The train tracks, crushed like this here.</span> <span id="s1392">Trains were turned over, the cars were turned all upside down.</span> <span id="s1393">And we got after--this was during the night.</span> <span id="s1394">When we got there during the daylight, everything was just flattened as a ....</span> <span id="s1395">We lost at that time over a hundred people, they just disappeared.</span> <span id="s1396">Just disappeared!</span> <span id="s1397">I said to my friend, you see G__ would be with us.</span> <span id="s1398">We worked the day shift.</span> <span id="s1399">We would have gone tonight, the night shift, we would have been the ones.</span> <span id="s1400">So they were able to find all these people after they opened up the halls.</span> <span id="s1401">They knew where each factory was located.</span> <span id="s1402">And they took out and buried them in a massive grave.</span> <span id="s1403">There were over a hundred people.</span> <span id="s1404">The ones you lived with,l the ones you stayed in the barracks with, the ones that went through with you the whole camp, 1942.</span> <span id="s1405">And then we had two days of peace because we all enjoyed inside, what happened.</span> <span id="s1406">Nobody knew what happened.</span> <span id="s1407">There was no air raid, there was no alarms, no airplanes coming along, was it sabotage?</span> <span id="s1408">Nobody knew what happened.</span> <span id="s1409">We still don't know, I still don't today, I don't know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Either sabotage or an accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1412">We can assume a lot of things but we have no valuable evidence to say that a plane came along and dropped a bomb.</span> <span id="s1413">Nobody knew it was a factory over there, it was so deep in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">And you didn't hear any noises in the air?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">No, we listen to places.</span> <span id="s1416">During the day you could see planes flying over.</span> <span id="s1417">But I'm sure they didn't know there was a factory there.</span> <span id="s1418">Was hidden so deeply in the woods.</span> <span id="s1419">So two days, we were fortunate, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1420">The third day, they brought train loads, Hitleryuden, (ph)(c.143), youth, seventeen, sixteen, fifteen years of age, eighteen years of age.</span> <span id="s1421">They brought along to camp.</span> <span id="s1422">And they took us to work.</span> <span id="s1423">They beat the living daylights out of us.</span> <span id="s1424">They were screaming and yelling and hitting you for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1425">We were trying to get all the gravel, all the rocks, all the bricks that were lying there, into a location, into one area.</span> <span id="s1426">They lined us up like snakes, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1427">One hands over the other, hands over the other.</span> <span id="s1428">How fast can you hand over one thing to the other one?</span> <span id="s1429">They were standing with whips and kept going and going and going.</span> <span id="s1430">At last we can't do it any more, impossible.</span> <span id="s1431">How much can you do?</span> <span id="s1432">No mercy.</span> <span id="s1433">After we finished off cleaning up all the gravel, we found more bodies.</span> <span id="s1434">Then they started to lay the railroad tracks again.</span> <span id="s1435">Those railroad tracks are heavy.</span> <span id="s1436">When you get four people like this, weak as hell, you expect these people to pick up a track?</span> <span id="s1437">They kept beating the hell out of us for no reason.</span> <span id="s1438">We kept saying, we cannot pick it up, it's too heavy, need a machine to pick this up.</span> <span id="s1439">Nein, you must pick it up.</span> <span id="s1440">Okay.</span> <span id="s1441">We finished laying the tracks.</span> <span id="s1442">Took us a week or something like that.</span> <span id="s1443">We laid the tracks.</span> <span id="s1444">Then they started bringing in prefabricated factories, prefabricated factories.</span> <span id="s1445">If I tell you, within four weeks, between three and four weeks you builded up seven new factories, the way it was before, you wouldn't believe it, would you?</span> <span id="s1446">That's exactly what we did.</span> <span id="s1447">Seven new factories with a railroad track to bring in fresh stuff back in again to continue making ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">So you basically rebuilt the factory that had been destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Destroyed from scratch, from scratch.</span> <span id="s1450">Took us four weeks, we had the whole, because of these youngsters, went in.</span> <span id="s1451">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">They didn't work though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">No, they kept pushing us.</span> <span id="s1454">The only time they gave us a break was 12 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1455">Twelve o'clock, they gave us a break, we had our lunch.</span> <span id="s1456">What did the lunch consist of?</span> <span id="s1457">Some vegetable soup and that's it.</span> <span id="s1458">Then you continued working till six o'clock in the evening, go home.</span> <span id="s1459">I have no shoes, my shoes wore out.</span> <span id="s1460">I couldn't get any new shoes.</span> <span id="s1461">I kept begging these kids, something to wrap around.</span> <span id="s1462">So I find myself some rags.</span> <span id="s1463">Something in the back.</span> <span id="s1464">I made the rags wrapped around like shoes, around and around, here and there with strings attached to it so I can walk.</span> <span id="s1465">Because the weather was getting cold already, the winter was approaching.</span> <span id="s1466">So when the winter season came along, it got worse.</span> <span id="s1467">'Cause we could hear more airplanes approaching the area.</span> <span id="s1468">If they had to come this way, how do we know which direction they were traveling?</span> <span id="s1469">Whether they were going to Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, ____(c.180), I don't know.</span> <span id="s1470">How am I supposed to know?</span> <span id="s1471">But the planes were coming from every direction.</span> <span id="s1472">This was in the winter time already, January, February.</span> <span id="s1473">We kept going to the factories every single day.</span> <span id="s1474">They were so short of food, they gave us potato, what do you call that?</span> <span id="s1475">, flour like, you know potato flour, what do you call that, Rosie?</span> <span id="s1476">["Potato starch?"]</span> <span id="s1477">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1478">If you put it in water, it melts right away so you're able to eat that.</span> <span id="s1479">We made a soup but then you get heartburn out of it.</span> <span id="s1480">So they gave us that to eat because they had no food for themselves.</span> <span id="s1481">In Germany, they had no food.</span> <span id="s1482">One thing for sure, though, if you weren't killed in the factory, the Germans weren't going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1483">You were safe there.</span> <span id="s1484">In 1945, the beginning of '45, you felt in you, if you don't die from starvation, the Germans are not going to kill you because they needed you.</span> <span id="s1485">They needed every labor they could possibly get.</span> <span id="s1486">Because the demand for ammunition was so much.</span> <span id="s1487">They used to go out with the Germans on the firing range.</span> <span id="s1488">Used to take those panzer faus (c.195), the anti-tank grenades.</span> <span id="s1489">They tested them before they shipped them out.</span> <span id="s1490">Those panzer faus, anti-tank grenades were able to penetrate four inches of steel.</span> <span id="s1491">Can you imagine how powerful that was?</span> <span id="s1492">Had one German sitting in the ground.</span> <span id="s1493">We were surrounded by him, helping him out.</span> <span id="s1494">He just put it in his shoulder, tapped him in its head, boom.</span> <span id="s1495">Four inches of steel, a dent, not a hole completely, but a tremendous dent.</span> <span id="s1496">So we tested it for about two or three days.</span> <span id="s1497">Not continuously a full day.</span> <span id="s1498">Let's see, we go out , let' see, two o'clock in the afternoon till about four o'clock testing the ammunition.</span> <span id="s1499">Then they tested different types of ammunition .</span> <span id="s1500">Tremendous firing range there.</span> <span id="s1501">This episode went on until about April, 1945.</span> <span id="s1502">We were almost finished.</span> <span id="s1503">There was very little food.</span> <span id="s1504">We were fed once a day because they didn't have food for themselves.</span> <span id="s1505">The commanding officer took us out in the middle of the camp and he said we are going to leave this camp soon.</span> <span id="s1506">What day I don't know but you'll be notified.</span> <span id="s1507">Around this time of the year, ....</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">April, we knew at least a holiday, trains arriving.</span> <span id="s1510">This time we have closed cattle trains, closed.</span> <span id="s1511">We see them on the train, ____ lined up.</span> <span id="s1512">We were in that camp approximately between five and six hundred people.</span> <span id="s1513">Small ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s1514">They loaded us up on this train, they gave us food, the Germans and he was awfully nice, the commander.</span> <span id="s1515">He says, I thank you for what you did.</span> <span id="s1516">Maybe we'll meet again.</span> <span id="s1517">And whom do they send along with us on the trains?</span> <span id="s1518">Old men, retired, 60, 70 years of age, with a pigeon rifle.</span> <span id="s1519">Where you shoot down pigeons.</span> <span id="s1520">They didn't even have rifles to handle anymore.</span> <span id="s1521">But who was going to run anyplace?</span> <span id="s1522">Who was going to do anything to them?</span> <span id="s1523">You had no energy.</span> <span id="s1524">you had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s1525">You're in a strange land.</span> <span id="s1526">So the train was going with these---, he was sitting with us, inside the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">So inside the cattle car, you had guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Yes, inside the cattle car.</span> <span id="s1529">Every third cattle car had a guard with us.</span> <span id="s1530">An old man, he was sitting with them, talking to him in German.</span> <span id="s1531">He was telling about his family, he says he had a wife, he has grown children.</span> <span id="s1532">He has a son in the army, whether he is alive, he doesn't know.</span> <span id="s1533">He has grandchildren who go to school, hopefully, the war is over soon.</span> <span id="s1534">I says, I hope you don't take revenge on me.</span> <span id="s1535">I says, I have nothing against you.</span> <span id="s1536">You haven't done anything to me.</span> <span id="s1537">It's not your fault, I'm here.</span> <span id="s1538">You have to obey orders, you're in the army.</span> <span id="s1539">I mean everybody was talking with him and everything.</span> <span id="s1540">When we arrived at the first station after we left the camp, the commanding officer went out and took a group of men from the trains and went into the town bakery.</span> <span id="s1541">And says I have approximately 500 and 600 people.</span> <span id="s1542">I need bread.</span> <span id="s1543">He says, where am I going to get bread for you?</span> <span id="s1544">He says, you make it, your business.</span> <span id="s1545">You have to give them bread.</span> <span id="s1546">So they gave us black bread which consisted of 60% potatoes and 40% flour.</span> <span id="s1547">Because when you eat the bread, you could feel, it's so soft.</span> <span id="s1548">It taste very, you know, soft inside.</span> <span id="s1549">So they told us, this is made from potatoes and flour.</span> <span id="s1550">Some of the guys who were in the camp were bakers, too.</span> <span id="s1551">They could tell the difference.</span> <span id="s1552">So this black bread tasted terrific.</span> <span id="s1553">No problem.</span> <span id="s1554">Each one of us received a nice big slice of bread and we stayed on the station for about two or three hours and we continued.</span> <span id="s1555">Then at night, I fell asleep on the camp and every morning they took us the bodies and put it... There were two trains, two cattle trains especially for that purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Two trains or two cars?</span> <span id="s1557">Two wagons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Two cars, two cars especially for that purpose.</span> <span id="s1559">The pictures are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">In other words they take out people who died during the night ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Died during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">And they put them in wagons of the dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Yes.</span> <span id="s1564">Then we reached Tereza (ph)(c.253), that's when they took them out to bury them.</span> <span id="s1565">So then the second stop was Dresden.</span> <span id="s1566">We stopped behind the station and we heard tremendous alarms going on.</span> <span id="s1567">The bombing was going unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1568">So we ask the guard, we says, what town is this here?</span> <span id="s1569">He says, that's east Dresden.</span> <span id="s1570">Dresden, yeah.</span> <span id="s1571">They were bombing it like crazy.</span> <span id="s1572">I says, ve canish gain forward, (ph)(c.259), we can't go forward because they have to pick up the trains, or the tracks until they able to move.</span> <span id="s1573">In the meantime, we were hungry, no food.</span> <span id="s1574">G__ sent down a miracle.</span> <span id="s1575">A train, a cattle train came along with all sorts of vegetables, carrots, beets, kileron (ph)(c.264), carrobi (ph)(c.264) and cabbage.</span> <span id="s1576">You name it, it was all full of vegetables, open trains.</span> <span id="s1577">So the supervisor, the commanding officer of the train, he says, each train, car tather, were allowed to send out three men to go out and pick up whatever they can and bring it into the car.</span> <span id="s1578">And what they did.</span> <span id="s1579">They brought it in.</span> <span id="s1580">Of course, wherever we go, wherever we travel, we always assign one person, you are in charge because we are animals.</span> <span id="s1581">We have to have somebody to supervise us, somebody who is able to control us.</span> <span id="s1582">So when this man brought in all these fruits, vegetables rather, he right away put a blanket around it.</span> <span id="s1583">The guard was sitting there eating carrots.</span> <span id="s1584">And everybody got his piece of share of vegetable.</span> <span id="s1585">It was delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Which guy did you pick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">We picked three out to go.</span> <span id="s1588">One of the men whom we knew he's a nice guy to talk to, you can tell, you know you get to know each other; he's the one who's reliable who's able to take control.</span> <span id="s1589">He had a little more energy, more energetic, okay?</span> <span id="s1590">And he took over everything and he divided everything accordingly.</span> <span id="s1591">So each car, how many people were in the car, most probably I would say about between 35 and 40 men in each car, okay?</span> <span id="s1592">So you divided this at least we had for the day, we had a nice lunch, vegetable.</span> <span id="s1593">We stood on the train and they allowed us to get out of the car to sit around on the car.</span> <span id="s1594">The guard was standing around to see what's happening.</span> <span id="s1595">They didn't bother.</span> <span id="s1596">Believe me, none of us had any intention to take a ride anyplace or to go anywheres.</span> <span id="s1597">There was no place to go, we had no energy to run anyway.</span> <span id="s1598">So we sat over there, it was a little group over there with water.</span> <span id="s1599">So they allowed us to go over there so we washed up a little bit and deloused ourselves.</span> <span id="s1600">we were filthy dirty.</span> <span id="s1601">Okay, plenty of that was running around on us.</span> <span id="s1602">Then we stood on that station one night and another air raid came along.</span> <span id="s1603">When that air raid came, they locked the doors and they run into the woods.</span> <span id="s1604">They left us standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">The guards left you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1607">So we said to each other.</span> <span id="s1608">G__ almighty, if you wish us to live, protect us.</span> <span id="s1609">I was the youngest, the youngest from the whole bunch of people.</span> <span id="s1610">That boy kept saying the same thing, he says G__ almighty, if you wish us to live, protect us.</span> <span id="s1611">He protected us.</span> <span id="s1612">The bombing, the falling in every direction, any where which way except our train.</span> <span id="s1613">Then there were plenty of trains with people from different camps going the same direction.</span> <span id="s1614">They were lined up on tracks as far as the eye could see.</span> <span id="s1615">The fifth day, they were able to let us go through.</span> <span id="s1616">Either they fixed the railroad tracks or whatever happened and we started to move.</span> <span id="s1617">When we started to move, we felt good.</span> <span id="s1618">Once you move, your system is different.</span> <span id="s1619">When you stand still, you feel lousy.</span> <span id="s1620">We drove in that trains for about two days and two nights and we arrived to a place, was Sudetline (ph)(c.311).</span> <span id="s1621">That's already Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1622">It was a big sign, so that you couldn't miss it.</span> <span id="s1623">We were able to look through the holes, you know, so I said to the guard, I said it myself because I was sitting right next to him, I says, why can't ;you leave the door open?</span> <span id="s1624">I says, nobody's going to run away.</span> <span id="s1625">Nein, nein.</span> <span id="s1626">He had orders to keep the door closed.</span> <span id="s1627">We could have taken him and choke him, take his rifle, hit him over the head, right?</span> <span id="s1628">Simple as ABC.</span> <span id="s1629">But who has the guts to do it?</span> <span id="s1630">You know, we had a feeling this is coming close to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1631">Because we saw so many air raids, so many planes coming around that area.</span> <span id="s1632">When he mentioned the word Dresden, then I knew it was problems over there.</span> <span id="s1633">Then Kaminitz (ph)(c.320) was next, bombing like crazy.</span> <span id="s1634">Anyway, we arrived in Sudetenland (c.322).</span> <span id="s1635">The train stopped, the Czechoslovakia border guards came and took over.</span> <span id="s1636">The Germans went out, the SS auf Wiedersehen to us.</span> <span id="s1637">Auf Wiedersehen.</span> <span id="s1638">So they went in one direction and the Czech police took over the train and we drove on the train.</span> <span id="s1639">We didn't know where we going.</span> <span id="s1640">All of a sudden, we arrive in a place.</span> <span id="s1641">We see people lounging, walking here, there.</span> <span id="s1642">You felt like G__ almighty, is this the end of the war?</span> <span id="s1643">Is this...because everybody is so free.</span> <span id="s1644">There's no factories, there's no work or anything.</span> <span id="s1645">Then I ask somebody, when they open up the door, where are we?</span> <span id="s1646">He says, das iz Theresienstadt, das is Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1647">I didn't know what the Theresienstadt, I never heard of it.</span> <span id="s1648">So the German border, the Czechs made us all get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">They had Czech police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Czech police, right.</span> <span id="s1651">They were also armed but not severely.</span> <span id="s1652">And we all got off the trains and I collapsed.</span> <span id="s1653">I collapsed, simply collapsed, I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1654">I tried to get up, fell back.</span> <span id="s1655">I tried to get up, I fell back.</span> <span id="s1656">Three times I tried to get out in the area.</span> <span id="s1657">So this one person who lived in, who was in Theresienstadt came over to me and he gave me some sugar.</span> <span id="s1658">He gave me a piece of sugar, you know the square pieces of sugar?</span> <span id="s1659">Took a piece of sugar and started to chew on it.</span> <span id="s1660">It felt so good.</span> <span id="s1661">He calls over a nurse.</span> <span id="s1662">Because the first thing they did, when they came into Theresienstadt, they took care of the two cars, where they have the bodies and they took care of the people who collapsed.</span> <span id="s1663">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1664">So he called over this nurse and somebody come over with a stretcher and they took me up to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1665">So they took me up to the hospital; it had about four floors.</span> <span id="s1666">It wasn't a hospital, it was just a place, when I looked at the hospital, I says, oh my G__, this is backed into Skarzysko Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1667">I hope it's not the same situation.</span> <span id="s1668">That's the first thing that registered in my mind.</span> <span id="s1669">So I said to the nurse, I says, where are we?</span> <span id="s1670">where am I?</span> <span id="s1671">what is happening here?</span> <span id="s1672">He says, in here, she says, you're in good hands.</span> <span id="s1673">This is Theresienstadt, the _____ (c.356) ghetto, big ghetto.</span> <span id="s1674">And in here people come and people go.</span> <span id="s1675">But I didn't know the atrocities that they had in the Theresienstadt, previous, prior because we came towards the end of the war in April.</span> <span id="s1676">Immediately a doctor came over to me, he looked at me and examined, he says malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1677">That was the answer, right?</span> <span id="s1678">_________ the essen.</span> <span id="s1679">(c.362).</span> <span id="s1680">So they gave me some soup, a little warm water to drink.</span> <span id="s1681">I was lying over there, I fell asleep from exhaustion.</span> <span id="s1682">I must have slept at least two days.</span> <span id="s1683">Because I didn't eat for two days.</span> <span id="s1684">I was lying in that hospital there and then I hear commotions going on outside.</span> <span id="s1685">I looked out through the window, I see people are marching in the street.</span> <span id="s1686">I says, what kind of a country is this?</span> <span id="s1687">what is this going on in here?</span> <span id="s1688">I am only used to see tragedy and this is people a different story altogether.</span> <span id="s1689">So I ask the nurse again who came around to check on me, she says to me, this is Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1690">It's better in here than in any other place, now, she says.</span> <span id="s1691">I says, what is the story with the war?</span> <span id="s1692">She says, ah, the war is almost finished, she says, the war is almost finished.</span> <span id="s1693">This was April 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">That's the day you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">The day I arrived to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1696">So I stayed in that hospital for one week.</span> <span id="s1697">Then I said to myself I feel a little better, I'm not going to stay around here because I kept seeing pictures of Skarzysko Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1698">I kept seeing pictures of them coming in and taking you out and put them on the trucks.</span> <span id="s1699">I said, I don't want that picture.</span> <span id="s1700">I couldn't get it out of my eyes.</span> <span id="s1701">Every time, I looked at the ceiling on the top there, I see Skarzysko Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1702">Because that's the type of environment that hospital was.</span> <span id="s1703">So I got up in the afternoon and I sneaked out.</span> <span id="s1704">I looked around for the concerns (?)</span> <span id="s1705">(c.386), the concerns that we lived in and I meet one of the boys who came from my camp.</span> <span id="s1706">I says, where are you located?</span> <span id="s1707">He says, right over there.</span> <span id="s1708">All you have to do is go to the gate over there, register yourself and you go inside.</span> <span id="s1709">So I went in there, registered myself, and they gave me a bunk to sleep on in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1710">And that's it.</span> <span id="s1711">Nobody missed me in the hospital, they didn't even know who I was.</span> <span id="s1712">They didn't take my name down, my number, nothing.</span> <span id="s1713">You're a number that's all.</span> <span id="s1714">If you're there, you're there; you're not there, you're not there.</span> <span id="s1715">So I stayed at the concern.</span> <span id="s1716">I was assigned to food, I was able to get.</span> <span id="s1717">.</span> <span id="s1718">they give you a nice bowl of soup and a piece of bread, lunchtime.</span> <span id="s1719">And I was able to sneak out, being a youngster at that time, I sneaked out, run to the kitchen and was able to pick up some scrap to get myself a little more energy.</span> <span id="s1720">But one thing I was thinking of is, don't eat too much, slowly.</span> <span id="s1721">Because your system was so strained, so dried out, you can't eat too much.</span> <span id="s1722">Can you imagine at that age, with so little education that I had, my mind was able to sustain and to think what might happen to me if I eat too much?</span> <span id="s1723">You understand?</span> <span id="s1724">You can't stretch something like that all of a sudden, got to do it slowly.</span> <span id="s1725">I have decided there and then, little by little, I ate such little bread.</span> <span id="s1726">The soup when I was eating it, it took me two hours to finish it because I took my time.</span> <span id="s1727">Then typhoid was out there, broke out.</span> <span id="s1728">Tremendous.</span> <span id="s1729">People were dying without end.</span> <span id="s1730">Every minute of the day, they were carrying people out.</span> <span id="s1731">________ ____ _____(c.415) I had it too.</span> <span id="s1732">I controlled it myself.</span> <span id="s1733">Then the good day came.</span> <span id="s1734">V-E day.</span> <span id="s1735">May 8, 11 o'clock in the morning, we hear shooting.</span> <span id="s1736">Shooting like crazy.</span> <span id="s1737">They were trying to kill us yet.</span> <span id="s1738">Can you imagine, the Russians were right outside the gates and here the Germans were shooting in with machine guns!</span> <span id="s1739">Into the Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1740">They had gas camps ["I thought they were going to gas you there."]</span> <span id="s1741">That's right but they never succeeded because the Russians came with such an impact.</span> <span id="s1742">They came in so fast that they left the Germans standing with their pants down.</span> <span id="s1743">They called them, the whole families.</span> <span id="s1744">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1745">The German army were fighting with their families together.</span> <span id="s1746">Their wives and the children were sitting in the wagon, a horse and buggy, and he had a machine gun on himself.</span> <span id="s1747">But they could not succeed what they were trying to do.</span> <span id="s1748">The Russians came in about noontime with their tanks.</span> <span id="s1749">You should have seen the joy.</span> <span id="s1750">But where are the energy, what energy?</span> <span id="s1751">I took a group of friends of mine, went into the main highway where the German army was surrendering to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1752">The Russians says to us, Vre___(c.437), children, do what you want.</span> <span id="s1753">Believe me, I didn't lay a hand on them.</span> <span id="s1754">But I took whatever they have, all their possessions, whatever they have.</span> <span id="s1755">We grabbed whatever they have.</span> <span id="s1756">What is it mostly we taking then?</span> <span id="s1757">Food!</span> <span id="s1758">Everything else we throw away.</span> <span id="s1759">We left the villages to pick it up.</span> <span id="s1760">They have beautiful clothing, underwear, shirts, pants, socks, you name it, they have it.</span> <span id="s1761">They were so loaded up to the brim with everything.</span> <span id="s1762">We didn't take nothing from them except food.</span> <span id="s1763">They have so much food in their wagons, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s1764">Let them go empty.</span> <span id="s1765">Out, out.</span> <span id="s1766">They kept begging us, they says, give me at least my tobacco.</span> <span id="s1767">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1768">Some of them grabbed sticks and brooms and they beat the living daylight of them to let them go to camp because the Russians were lined up on both sides the highways.</span> <span id="s1769">We brought back a lot of food to the camp.</span> <span id="s1770">As I said before, I held myself back.</span> <span id="s1771">I had my little corner in the bunk, where I slept below.</span> <span id="s1772">I put a little blanket around it, tied it down with a rope and left my food in there.</span> <span id="s1773">Whenever I felt myself hungry, I kept eating but I never overate myself.</span> <span id="s1774">I watched myself very carefully because I saw what happened to the others.</span> <span id="s1775">Then two days later, they formed a committee in the Theresienstadt already, among the people in the camp, and they said we have to save the youngsters.</span> <span id="s1776">And they went from barracks to barracks, from concern to concern, how old are you?</span> <span id="s1777">this way, how old are you?</span> <span id="s1778">this way, how old are you?</span> <span id="s1779">this way.</span> <span id="s1780">And they took us out by hand.</span> <span id="s1781">They took us over to a separate unit near the Russian headquarters where the Red Cross was there waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1782">And examined us, checked us out.</span> <span id="s1783">Of course, everybody had the same problem, malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1784">They gave us dry milk to drink, they gave us cereal, they gave us nutritious food.</span> <span id="s1785">Chocolate.</span> <span id="s1786">While we were there, we looked around at each other and then we started to reminiscing.</span> <span id="s1787">What happened in the camps, what happened towards the end of the camp, what happened, this and that.</span> <span id="s1788">You know, everybody had a story this big.</span> <span id="s1789">And we felt like one family, like one family.</span> <span id="s1790">You are my brother now, you are my brother now, I have nobody else.</span> <span id="s1791">They were able to scrape together 270 boys from the age of 15 to the age of 19, 20 and thirty girls who survived the war.</span> <span id="s1792">This was only in the Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1793">The girls came from different parts of Europe also.</span> <span id="s1794">One from here, one from there.</span> <span id="s1795">The boys also.</span> <span id="s1796">Very few came from the same hometown.</span> <span id="s1797">Those were all the survivors.</span> <span id="s1798">They allocated us into one area where they took very good care of us, medically, physically and mentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">This is the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">That was the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1801">They wanted to save the children.</span> <span id="s1802">The least we can do.</span> <span id="s1803">If we don't save them, he says, there's nothing to save.</span> <span id="s1804">And the Russians were very grateful to us.</span> <span id="s1805">They were so nice to us.</span> <span id="s1806">They kept giving us food.</span> <span id="s1807">We couldn't believe it because we had rumors that the Russians were so bad and everything else.</span> <span id="s1808">That's not true!</span> <span id="s1809">They were nice, they're human beings.</span> <span id="s1810">They treated people just as well as anybody else did.</span> <span id="s1811">Americans didn't come in because the Russians...that was their territory to take over.</span> <span id="s1812">They sacrificed a lot of lives to save the Theresienstadt, the Russians did.</span> <span id="s1813">["They heard there was a camp, they went..."] They knew there was an extermination area there and they were afraid something would happen.</span> <span id="s1814">["They went out of their way to get to it."]</span> <span id="s1815">So then, May, June, it was a paradise.</span> <span id="s1816">We had everything we wanted.</span> <span id="s1817">We mingled with the other people.</span> <span id="s1818">Everything was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1819">Was dancing, was happiness going on.</span> <span id="s1820">Nobody...till it hits you.</span> <span id="s1821">You know, one day it hits you.</span> <span id="s1822">You says, oh my G__, my family.</span> <span id="s1823">That was the worst part of your life.</span> <span id="s1824">Until then, your stomach was empty, you thought of food.</span> <span id="s1825">But when you filled up, you got everything, then you start thinking about what you have lost, what's missing.</span> <span id="s1826">Something is missing in your life, you don't have everything.</span> <span id="s1827">Although your friends are your brothers now and your sisters, but something else is missing.</span> <span id="s1828">Then you have to work your system...your mind has to start going around in a different way to look upon life.</span> <span id="s1829">Maybe, this is the fate that we have to accept.</span> <span id="s1830">Have to start anew.</span> <span id="s1831">Right there and then, I have decided never to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1832">Right there and then, I have decided, I don't want to see that country, I don't want to hear of it, I have no proof of it.</span> <span id="s1833">No use for it.</span> <span id="s1834">I blame the country what happened to my folks.</span> <span id="s1835">Maybe I'm wrong but that's the way I feel.</span> <span id="s1836">Then each country send a representative to the Theresienstadt to take its people home.</span> <span id="s1837">Hungarians, there were Czechs, Polaks, Italians.</span> <span id="s1838">There were Germans, there were Austrian Jews there.</span> <span id="s1839">Every country sent a trainload to take its people home.</span> <span id="s1840">Except us.</span> <span id="s1841">After they left, a committee from England arrived to Theresienstadt and had a meeting with us.</span> <span id="s1842">With us children, we have two choices.</span> <span id="s1843">Either come with us to England or you go to Russia.</span> <span id="s1844">I know you don't want to back to your country.</span> <span id="s1845">Without hesitation, I decide to go to England although I didn't know anything about England.</span> <span id="s1846">I didn't know anything about the United States.</span> <span id="s1847">Forget about that.</span> <span id="s1848">But I knew about Russia.</span> <span id="s1849">Why didn't I choose to go to Russia?</span> <span id="s1850">Instinct told me go to England.</span> <span id="s1851">Although the Russians were very nice to me, I was very friendly with them; I made a lot of friends with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1852">And so when we made the decision to go to England, he says it'll take a couple of days and you'll be all traveling.</span> <span id="s1853">Fine.</span> <span id="s1854">July, the end of July, we were told we have to go to the Russian headquarters to receive passports.</span> <span id="s1855">I still have it, right?</span> <span id="s1856">I have the passport.</span> <span id="s1857">It says... We had to go to Russian headquarters to give us passports to leave the country.</span> <span id="s1858">So one of the Russian officers came out and started talking with us.</span> <span id="s1859">He always called us Raybeeacha (ph)(c.572).</span> <span id="s1860">Raybeeacha means children.</span> <span id="s1861">And he says, I know it's your choice where you want to go.</span> <span id="s1862">We're not going to stop you but if you choose to go with us, the Russians, we will be happy to accept you.</span> <span id="s1863">But if you choose to go there, it's up to you.</span> <span id="s1864">We already made up our minds, everybody made up their minds where they going.</span> <span id="s1865">So the fateful day came in August.</span> <span id="s1866">We packed our belongings, whatever we had, not much.</span> <span id="s1867">We boarded a comfortable train on Theresienstadt and we drove with the train to Prague.</span> <span id="s1868">Prague is the capital of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1869">In Prague, we stayed with the Czech underground.</span> <span id="s1870">Remember I told you about this officers...with them, we stayed in their headquarters.</span> <span id="s1871">They fed us, they clothed us, and they gave us lodging and waited for the planes to arrive from England.</span> <span id="s1872">In the meantime, while we were waiting, the weather wasn't so pleasant so they decided to give us a grand tour of Prague.</span> <span id="s1873">The president of Prague just arrived two days ago from England.</span> <span id="s1874">He was in England during World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">The president of Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Czechoslovakia, yes.</span> <span id="s1877">Jan Masaryk, his name was Jan Masaryk.</span> <span id="s1878">So they gave us a tour with the trolley cars.</span> <span id="s1879">They boarded four trolley cards.</span> <span id="s1880">We each boarded the trains, it was enough for three hundred kids, three cars would be accommodated.</span> <span id="s1881">They took us to the circus from there.</span> <span id="s1882">Then we visited, there was one Jewish synagogue left and they made us visit that too.</span> <span id="s1883">We were very delighted, everybody was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1884">Everything was good.</span> <span id="s1885">The day was over, exhausted.</span> <span id="s1886">We were exhausted, believe me.</span> <span id="s1887">We came back, we took our sleep, ______(c.604) things were there.</span> <span id="s1888">Took us by bus... Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">We drove to the airport in Prague and we boarded a plane and we flew into England.</span> <span id="s1891">We arrived in a place in England called Carlise, that must be Scotland.</span> <span id="s1892">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Near Lockerbie?</span> <span id="s1894">(C.621) Right, right.</span> <span id="s1895">Carlise.</span> <span id="s1896">We got off the planes, we had something to eat on the plane.</span> <span id="s1897">You know, we're sitting bomber planes.</span> <span id="s1898">It wasn't very comfortable, no seats there.</span> <span id="s1899">Who cares, youngsters don't care.</span> <span id="s1900">We had some supervisors coming along but not much of them.</span> <span id="s1901">We landed, we were examined by the British security, ask you questions, they all spoke German too.</span> <span id="s1902">Because they figured that's the only language they'll be able to respond with us, in Yiddish or German.</span> <span id="s1903">We all received a glass of milk and a piece of cake.</span> <span id="s1904">Then the supervisors that we had; they put such a tremendous fear in us, knowing we were wild.</span> <span id="s1905">We were very wild, food was the main object in our life at that time.</span> <span id="s1906">So if you see food, you grab it, you know, you don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s1907">He kept saying, he says, the people in England are very particular.</span> <span id="s1908">They watch you continuously.</span> <span id="s1909">If you don't behave yourself, they kick you out of the country.</span> <span id="s1910">So please behave yourself, even if you see something that you want, don't touch.</span> <span id="s1911">So after we arrive, we're checked out, passports and everything, we boarded a plane to go to Windemere.</span> <span id="s1912">(ph)(c.634).</span> <span id="s1913">Windemere is a beautiful lake, it's a countryside.</span> <span id="s1914">.</span> <span id="s1915">it's not far much Manchester.</span> <span id="s1916">At each bus, had in the middle of the bus, a big basket of fruit.</span> <span id="s1917">Can you imagine that, a big basket of fruit?</span> <span id="s1918">You cannot touch it because they told us, don't touch anything which you see.</span> <span id="s1919">This is a test.</span> <span id="s1920">I said to myself, what in the world is all this about?</span> <span id="s1921">It's there for you to eat, not to look at, right?</span> <span id="s1922">The trip took about approximately between two and three hours from the airport to Windemere.</span> <span id="s1923">Windemere was a camp, prior to World War II, where the British children, while they were bombing London, they send the children to this camp.</span> <span id="s1924">So this camp was already well-established with all the accommodations for us.</span> <span id="s1925">So why we were riding the bus, the supervisor says, everybody can get up and take one apple.</span> <span id="s1926">The basket was empty in two seconds.</span> <span id="s1927">Each bus had a basket of fruit.</span> <span id="s1928">Each bus, there were three buses.</span> <span id="s1929">After we arrived in the camp, we were greeted in the camp by Rabbi Weiss.</span> <span id="s1930">He had a beautiful staff with him.</span> <span id="s1931">A few doctors, nurses and we went right away to the infirmary.</span> <span id="s1932">We were checked out, examined, given a blanket and assigned to a cabin.</span> <span id="s1933">Each barrack had accommodation for about 50 children.</span> <span id="s1934">Each child had his own little room, had a bed, a cabinet where you can put your clothes in, and was a piece of cake, food and juice after you went inside.</span> <span id="s1935">This was late at night already, we arrived it was about ten o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s1936">The following day, we hear the war is over in Japan.</span> <span id="s1937">The Japanese war was August 14, right?</span> <span id="s1938">The end of the war.</span> <span id="s1939">We didn't know what the joyous was all about.</span> <span id="s1940">The British knew what it was all about, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1941">I didn't know there was a war going on between the United States and ....</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">You didn't even know where Japan was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1944">Okay, never mind the United States.</span> <span id="s1945">So everybody was dancing in the streets, you know, the people in the vicinity, what was the joys?</span> <span id="s1946">We couldn't correspond to these people because we couldn't talk their language.</span> <span id="s1947">Our leaders told us that it was the end of World War with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1948">Okay, fine, no problem with that.</span> <span id="s1949">So we stayed in this camp.</span> <span id="s1950">We were checked out very thoroughly.</span> <span id="s1951">Every day, different doctors would arrive.</span> <span id="s1952">The media, of course, comes right away.</span> <span id="s1953">Then they started to teach us basics.</span> <span id="s1954">How to behave, how to pick up a fork and a knife, how to eat with a spoon, how to take a piece of bread and put a little jam or margarine on it.</span> <span id="s1955">Who knew those things?</span> <span id="s1956">I wasn't used to those things.</span> <span id="s1957">I was a child when I left home.</span> <span id="s1958">Manners, how to sit at a table and eat.</span> <span id="s1959">That took a lot of courage from our leaders to undertake--because you're dealing with youngsters, not babies.</span> <span id="s1960">These are youngsters, grown up, 15 up to 20 years of age.</span> <span id="s1961">Try to regulate these people, wasn't so easy.</span> <span id="s1962">But somehow, they succeeded, they succeeded.</span> <span id="s1963">For the first two days, was a little bit strange.</span> <span id="s1964">Camps was always a different feeling.</span> <span id="s1965">A camp was a camp.</span> <span id="s1966">Whether it's this camp or another camp, it's a camp.</span> <span id="s1967">But somehow you felt that you are among people which you can trust.</span> <span id="s1968">People who care for you, people who are willing to help you, so you have to sort of bend a little bit.</span> <span id="s1969">Be there.</span> <span id="s1970">I think most of the boys and the girls sort of acclimated themselves in the first three days.</span> <span id="s1971">So they became a little humanized.</span> <span id="s1972">Sat at the table and eat like a human being.</span> <span id="s1973">Didn't grab the food like _____.</span> <span id="s1974">Now we're given breakfast in the morning, porridge--that's the British breakfast--porridge or what's that herring they have, kipper, kipper, that's a British meal.</span> <span id="s1975">Then we have lunch, nice meal, then at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we had white bread with jam and milk.</span> <span id="s1976">That time in Britain, food was rationed.</span> <span id="s1977">They had to share the food with the children that came in, 300 of us.</span> <span id="s1978">Then a rabbi came from London and he said to us, if you know that you have any relatives anywhere in the United States or South America, give me the name and we'll let them know that you are alive.</span> <span id="s1979">So I remembered that my father had two brothers who emigrated to Argentina in the thirties.</span> <span id="s1980">Whether it was '35 or '36, I don't remember but I know they emigrated in the thirties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">From your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">From my hometown.</span> <span id="s1983">So I told this rabbi that I have two uncles live in Argentina.</span> <span id="s1984">I don't know their addresses, I don't know their names.</span> <span id="s1985">Of course, after the rabbi finishes with all these people getting information, if anyone of those children had anything, they gave information.</span> <span id="s1986">Within two months, I received a letter from my uncle in Argentina.</span> <span id="s1987">He is my father's brother and he is asking me what happened to his family.</span> <span id="s1988">What could I tell him?</span> <span id="s1989">Same thing that happened to my family, right?</span> <span id="s1990">Maybe he felt guilty, he didn't take them down there.</span> <span id="s1991">He could have taken them down to Argentina after he left there.</span> <span id="s1992">He could have taken them down.</span> <span id="s1993">So I found this uncle in Argentina but I didn't know how to ______ in the United States.</span> <span id="s1994">(c. 697) Okay?</span> <span id="s1995">So after being in Windemere, for about six months, we went through thorough checkup by doctors in hospitals, x-ray and everything.</span> <span id="s1996">They found out that a yellow blemish, in my lungs?</span> <span id="s1997">["where"], that spot, [" you didn't find out until you were here."]</span> <span id="s1998">.</span> <span id="s1999">I know, what did I have?</span> <span id="s2000">{"well, calcification, it showed.</span> <span id="s2001">He didn't find out til.</span> <span id="s2002">."]</span> <span id="s2003">No, no, no, no, I knew I had it in Theresienstadt, I mean in Windemere but I didn't mention it when I was here.</span> <span id="s2004">["Oh"] Anyway, they put me in a special diet, I don't know if the diet helped me or what, it doesn't make no difference.</span> <span id="s2005">Then they send in from each town in England, Manchester, Liverpool, London, Glasgow, all big cities that have large Jewish populations.</span> <span id="s2006">And they selected groups of kids, a group of 15, a group of 20, a group of 30, whatever the amount of people.</span> <span id="s2007">They come over to you separately and say to you, what kind of a home would you like, a kosher home?</span> <span id="s2008">you want a religious home?</span> <span id="s2009">and all these questions were asked and we was able to analyze which one would be compatible.</span> <span id="s2010">They were compatible with me, ______.</span> <span id="s2011">In my group, we were able to get together 15 young boys.</span> <span id="s2012">And this rabbi, came to this town, Manchester, picked us up and took us by train to Winchester into a home.</span> <span id="s2013">A home made for 15 boys, no girls.</span> <span id="s2014">Fifteen boys, it was orthodox,_____ and in their home, we started to recuperate.</span> <span id="s2015">Started to get to know everything, we started to learn a language, and we started to get classes.</span> <span id="s2016">Every single day we had classes.</span> <span id="s2017">Morning, started at 10 o'clock, finished 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2018">We learned the basic, English, math, history, geography' whatever you want to learn.</span> <span id="s2019">There we started to go to English schools at that age because we didn't, it didn't at any of the classes of the English we're going because we were already aged.</span> <span id="s2020">So I was able to go at night to school.</span> <span id="s2021">I picked up English in six weeks, six months, rather, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s2022">In six months, I was able to speak English.</span> <span id="s2023">I went to meetings, I listened to people talk, I read a lot of papers.</span> <span id="s2024">I bought myself an Oxford dictionary and taught myself the language I hear while I was going to school.</span> <span id="s2025">In the meantime, while we are having some lessons in our home and took care of us, we lived together as one family, 15 boys.</span> <span id="s2026">And then we had once a year, we had a reunion.</span> <span id="s2027">We all get together, we all, 300 of us who came with this transport, we met in London.</span> <span id="s2028">We had a tremendous reunion.</span> <span id="s2029">In the meantime, more youngsters were arriving to England from different parts of Europe.</span> <span id="s2030">But in our group, we stuck together.</span> <span id="s2031">We're just like one big, large family.</span> <span id="s2032">In the meantime, I received a letter from a friend of mine who happens to look for his brothers.</span> <span id="s2033">He went to search for his brothers in Europe.</span> <span id="s2034">He found out that his brothers survived and live in France.</span> <span id="s2035">So he went there and he found his two brothers.</span> <span id="s2036">And he read in the paper that in America, New York, is a committee in my hometown, looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s2037">And he responded.</span> <span id="s2038">Then this man send him another letter, telling him if you know anybody else who survived, please let us know.</span> <span id="s2039">He notified me in England.</span> <span id="s2040">He knew I went to England, he didn't want to go because he says, I'm going to look for my family.</span> <span id="s2041">You go to England, he says, I have an opportunity, I'm not going to miss it.</span> <span id="s2042">I took the opportunity for him.</span> <span id="s2043">So he sent me this letter from this man and I knew this man very well because his parents, his brothers lived nearby us, were neighbors.</span> <span id="s2044">So I wrote him a letter in Yiddish, who I was, my grandfather's name, my father's name and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2045">And told him where we lived approximately and he knew the area so he knew I'm authentic.</span> <span id="s2046">Within a month I get a letter from him, with three addresses.</span> <span id="s2047">My father's brother, my father's two sisters resided in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">And that's when you discovered that you had aunts and uncles in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Right, right, right.</span> <span id="s2050">I immediately answered this ______(c.751) wrote each a letter, telling them who I was and I send a picture of myself.</span> <span id="s2051">And immediately my uncle over here said, we bring you over to the United States.</span> <span id="s2052">Would you like to come?</span> <span id="s2053">Of course!</span> <span id="s2054">Although I could have come on my own, too, because I was a stateless person.</span> <span id="s2055">I had no country.</span> <span id="s2056">I only went to England via Israel.</span> <span id="s2057">It was a stopover like they say.</span> <span id="s2058">The committee was able to get permission from the British government to rescue these 300 children to bring them to England till they recuperate, then they'll be able to go further.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">So the intention was that you guys would be sent to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">But you never did go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">No, I didn't go.</span> <span id="s2063">I didn't go.</span> <span id="s2064">Instead, when I found my relatives over here, I was able to correspond with them and told them who I was and everything.</span> <span id="s2065">So they found it realistic.</span> <span id="s2066">It took them a long time to get me there.</span> <span id="s2067">Okay?</span> <span id="s2068">In the meantime, I went to school in England, started off from the beginning, from scratch what I left over in Poland.</span> <span id="s2069">I was actually a dummy.</span> <span id="s2070">I was an idiot.</span> <span id="s2071">I mean, how much could I have learned in five years in Polish schools?</span> <span id="s2072">I had to start over from scratch, one and one is two, 2 and 2 is four.</span> <span id="s2073">Geography, history, in reading and writing.</span> <span id="s2074">I had to learn new types of millimeters, you know there was no centimeters for me any more.</span> <span id="s2075">Was no kilometers, was miles, so all things had to be converted.</span> <span id="s2076">It was pounds or shillings and those things had to be converted too.</span> <span id="s2077">So I had to start from scratch, from ABC.</span> <span id="s2078">At my age, I was able to achieve it.</span> <span id="s2079">I thought, well, I made friends, I made a lot of friends in England, a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s2080">I was very, very happy in England.</span> <span id="s2081">People were awfully nice.</span> <span id="s2082">British people were awfully nice.</span> <span id="s2083">I can never forget, awfully nice.</span> <span id="s2084">And then after four years in England, I think it was four years, 1945, I got to England, I left 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">It was five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Five years in England, five years in England, my passport came through to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s2087">So, I say farewell to everybody, goodbye to everyone, I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s2088">It was February 9, 1950, a windy day, a cold day...</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">By plane or.</span> <span id="s2090">.</span> <span id="s2091">?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">No, by boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">So you arrived on the 9th in February in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">In New York City, yes.</span> <span id="s2095">It took me two weeks to go by boat because it was so rough.</span> <span id="s2096">The sea was really rough.</span> <span id="s2097">And of course, when I came...</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Were you seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Yes, I was seasick, yes.</span> <span id="s2100">When I arrived in New York, the committee was over here already and asked me when they came aboard the ship, would I recognize my relatives?</span> <span id="s2101">I says, I never met them, I never seen them before but I have pictures of them and they have pictures of me.</span> <span id="s2102">So she took me by hand and took me to the relatives.</span> <span id="s2103">They recognized me and I recognized them.</span> <span id="s2104">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2105">From then on, I was here.</span> <span id="s2106">My relatives welcomed me.</span> <span id="s2107">I was very happy with them.</span> <span id="s2108">A year later, I was in the United States army, can you imagine that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Of course.</span> <span id="s2111">Was the Korean War was on.</span> <span id="s2112">And every alien who came to the United States in 1950, if you were the age at that time, I was 24, I had to register for the United States Army.</span> <span id="s2113">I was drafted immediately.</span> <span id="s2114">Thank G__, I didn't go to Korea.</span> <span id="s2115">I was trained in Ft. Dennis, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s2116">I had my training also in Camp Edwards, upstate Camp Drumn (ph)(c.795) upstate New York.</span> <span id="s2117">Camp Drumn is near the Canadian border.</span> <span id="s2118">I was also in Camp Edwards in Massachusetts, that's in Cape Cod.</span> <span id="s2119">I finished my service in 1953.</span> <span id="s2120">And married her in 1951.</span> <span id="s2121">["end of '51"] End of '51.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">When you were a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">I was a soldier, yeah.</span> <span id="s2124">I had nine months to go yet in the army.</span> <span id="s2125">So since then, everything was going for me up.</span> <span id="s2126">The reason, I believe, because I have faith, I never gave it up.</span> <span id="s2127">I believed very strongly that life has to go on, you can't just push it in a side.</span> <span id="s2128">The living has to go on.</span> <span id="s2129">I cannot bring back my family as much as I keep thinking of them.</span> <span id="s2130">As little as I can start looking at it and trying to remember them, it's far away from me.</span> <span id="s2131">I can't remember them so much.</span> <span id="s2132">But that's what kept me going.</span> <span id="s2133">I am very grateful that I met my wife who has been part of my life for forty years, made my life very happy.</span> <span id="s2134">We have two children, now a grandson.</span> <span id="s2135">I'm very grateful to this country for giving me the opportunity to be an American citizen, serve faithfully in the United States army, got honorably discharged.</span> <span id="s2136">I can't complain, I'm very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">So although you were sad to leave England, are you happy here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">I found my happiness in your country.</span> <span id="s2139">Of course, I've always a person who finds relief no matter where I go.</span> <span id="s2140">If I determine that I want to make this my permanent home, I will do it.</span> <span id="s2141">I always have a strong determination, no matter what I did, I never gave up.</span> <span id="s2142">Once you give up, life is worthless.</span> <span id="s2143">Many times when I think back, when I meet my friends, I say to him, remember when we went to work in Schleeben?</span> <span id="s2144">how did we work?</span> <span id="s2145">You remember how you walked to work?</span> <span id="s2146">He says no.</span> <span id="s2147">I says, I will remind you.</span> <span id="s2148">What happened to the stick you had in your hand?</span> <span id="s2149">Took a branch, a stick off the branch from a tree.</span> <span id="s2150">He had one in his hand and I had one in my hand.</span> <span id="s2151">We walked together to the factory 'cause once I got into the factory in Schleeben, I was able to sit on a bench and let the work go through me.</span> <span id="s2152">So those things you keep remembering.</span> <span id="s2153">And you keep telling yourself, that gives you an uplift.</span> <span id="s2154">Life has to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">You never returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Never returned to Poland.</span> <span id="s2157">As I said before, in the beginning, I gave my word of honor that I shall never, never go back to this country.</span> <span id="s2158">I never pursued to find out what happened to my family.</span> <span id="s2159">The reason because my father had two brothers, he had a brother and two sisters in America.</span> <span id="s2160">Was he alive, he would have contacted them.</span> <span id="s2161">If my mother was alive, she would have done the same thing, she has some relatives in here too.</span> <span id="s2162">Therefore, I believe nobody survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">So that letter that your Polish supervisor carried to you from your father, that was the last...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">That was the last letter from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">And that was from September, 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Forty-two.</span> <span id="s2167">That was the last letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">So you think that your parents were among those who were transported in September of '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Right.</span> <span id="s2170">There was an eyewitness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">And your brother and your sister...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Went with them.</span> <span id="s2173">My father thought while I was in camp, maybe we should send my brother with them, to my camp.</span> <span id="s2174">I says what do you want to send him here for?</span> <span id="s2175">I should look at his problems, he'll look at my problems?</span> <span id="s2176">At least, when I am by myself, I eat my heart out by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">He was very young then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">One year younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Obviously, you have bad memories of growing up in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">I remember you said that you hold Poland partially responsible for what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Do you have any particular memories either when you were going to school in Poland that would cause you to ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2185">In Poland, the schools were very anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s2186">I am sorry to say that but this is the true fact.</span> <span id="s2187">When I first attended school, my first grade wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s2188">The second grade wasn't so bad, either.</span> <span id="s2189">The third grade, we were isolated in the schools.</span> <span id="s2190">We didn't have individual seats.</span> <span id="s2191">We had those long benches, we were sitting.</span> <span id="s2192">All the Jewish boys and girls had separate benches.</span> <span id="s2193">So in the back of you was sitting Gentile children, Jewish children, Gentile children, Jewish children.</span> <span id="s2194">You couldn't sit with them together.</span> <span id="s2195">You were sort of indirectly isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">So Jewish children all sat together?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">To the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Not necessarily left because the benches were from this side of the window to here.</span> <span id="s2200">So we had a long bench here, could accommodate, let's see, twenty children.</span> <span id="s2201">Okay?</span> <span id="s2202">So if you have the 18 Jewish girls, the 18 were sitting there, nobody else could be sitting with them.</span> <span id="s2203">The same thing with the Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s2204">So I have very bad memories.</span> <span id="s2205">And then when we left school, I was once hit with a rock right here on my forehead here and I went to the principal with my father, took me to the principal.</span> <span id="s2206">And my father says, look what the boy did and he pointed out to the boy.</span> <span id="s2207">Yes, Zhazeewish (ph)(c.871)...</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">You're a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">No, Zhazeewish means you're still living, so everything is okay.</span> <span id="s2210">He says, I'm sure the boy didn't mean it.</span> <span id="s2211">But these particular boys were agitating me, they were bothering me.</span> <span id="s2212">There was an isolation, definitely, an isolation among the Gentiles, Jews; the Gentiles and the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">How about your grades?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">My grades, as far as I can remember, up to the fourth grade, the grades were good.</span> <span id="s2215">In the fifth grade, my grades were not good enough because the war broke out so I couldn't continue any more.</span> <span id="s2216">I always wanted to learn, I always wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s2217">My heart was in it, the knowledge.</span> <span id="s2218">.</span> <span id="s2219">["Sometimes they marked you less because you were Jewish"].</span> <span id="s2220">Yes, that's right, they did, they did!</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Yes, that sometimes happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">They did.</span> <span id="s2223">They never give you a top-notch rating.</span> <span id="s2224">Even though you did well; I was reading so beautifully, not only--I'm a very good reader in any language when I learn.</span> <span id="s2225">Because I love to read, I love to read and write.</span> <span id="s2226">But I never got top grading from my marks.</span> <span id="s2227">So I have this feeling left in my memory because I didn't get the backing from the teachers.</span> <span id="s2228">You know, you are a child, you don't know the difference whether you are a Jew or a Gentile, you came to school to learn.</span> <span id="s2229">Why should you be isolated?</span> <span id="s2230">why should you be different than somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">None of your teachers were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">No, there was no Jewish teachers, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">How about your brother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">My brother, I was held back one year so I can have my brother with me in the same class so we could share the books.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">So your brother was in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">My brother was in the class, sitting next to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">He had the same experience as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">The same experience.</span> <span id="s2239">We all had the same experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Were there any particular experiences that, you know, he had or that you had that .</span> <span id="s2241">.</span> <span id="s2242">?</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Well,if I had an experience, my brother would always come over to the rescue.</span> <span id="s2244">He was my protector.</span> <span id="s2245">My brother was my protector.</span> <span id="s2246">A friend of mine, David Greenberg, my wife knows him, ["That's how I met him"], he was the organizer.</span> <span id="s2247">He's a little older than I am.</span> <span id="s2248">He was in the same class as I was.</span> <span id="s2249">Many times we boycotted the school because we felt that the teacher is not doing enough to let us children learn the way the other children are learning.</span> <span id="s2250">So we boycotted the school.</span> <span id="s2251">We didn't go to classes.</span> <span id="s2252">The principal came in and find out the following day says, how come didn't you didn't attend class yesterday.</span> <span id="s2253">So we told the principal, I says, look we being discriminated.</span> <span id="s2254">We jabbed in the back, you know, pushed in there and this and that.</span> <span id="s2255">When we arrive, the guy hits you in your elbow and you scribble differently.</span> <span id="s2256">I mean, who wants this here?</span> <span id="s2257">And if you're not doing anything about it, why going to school.</span> <span id="s2258">But evidently, nothing was done about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">How about your sister, was she.</span> <span id="s2260">.</span> <span id="s2261">?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">My sister was in a different category altogether.</span> <span id="s2263">She came in a later time.</span> <span id="s2264">She didn't have much of an education to begin with because the war broke out.</span> <span id="s2265">I was older than her, three or four years older.</span> <span id="s2266">So she went to maybe the third grade but she had a good Jewish education.</span> <span id="s2267">Jewish education starts at the age of three.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">At home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Right, the age of three.</span> <span id="s2270">So she had a good education.</span> <span id="s2271">But sorry to say, that I don't remember my sister too well.</span> <span id="s2272">Many times I keep saying to my wife, when I look at my daughter, I see my sister in it.</span> <span id="s2273">But not 100% because my sister and I were very, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">As a girl, though, did she have the same kind of experiences that you and your brother...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Wasn't as bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">No, wasn't as bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Did she have problems with the non-Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">No, no, she had no problems.</span> <span id="s2280">Maybe it was different for girls, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Some of your uncles and aunts emigrated to America and Argentina.</span> <span id="s2282">Did your parents ever consider leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s2284">I was wondering many times while I was here.</span> <span id="s2285">My parents had relatives here, why didn't they emigrate.</span> <span id="s2286">Why didn't they come to the United States?</span> <span id="s2287">I assume that in those days when my relatives came here, things weren't so great either.</span> <span id="s2288">So why bringing more over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">So they may have come before the quotas were introduced?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Yes, because one of my aunts came over here just buying a ticket.</span> <span id="s2291">You didn't need a passport.</span> <span id="s2292">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">It was easy before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">That's right, that's right.</span> <span id="s2295">["They were still married here in 1920"].</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">That's before the quotas, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">["My parents both were here and they went back.</span> <span id="s2298">Then we got the quotas."]</span> <span id="s2299">So by the time your parents had met and married, it was too late to come here, other than through the quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Right, right.</span> <span id="s2301">["Because even when we came in, in 1934, we had to wait five years for the quota, the Germany quota."]</span> <span id="s2302">This is a typical Hebrew school in my time.</span> <span id="s2303">This is before my time, one generation before my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Before your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Yes, one generation.</span> <span id="s2306">Notice how they lead us and the teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">How about Israel?</span> <span id="s2308">Was that an option?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">I could have gone to Israel if I wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">I mean, I'm talking now about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">To go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">No, there were no Zionists in my parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">So, there weren't many Zionists in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">No, they were very religious people content with their religion and environment, very fanatic to speak of.</span> <span id="s2316">They didn't have a goal.</span> <span id="s2317">The children of my father's generation, they already knew that life in a small town cannot be profitable.</span> <span id="s2318">They sort of moved to larger cities, joined organizations.</span> <span id="s2319">Those organizations had pioneers.</span> <span id="s2320">The pioneers had camps that prepared them for Israel, kibbutzim, communal life.</span> <span id="s2321">So they went and pursued those things.</span> <span id="s2322">A lot of them emigrated to Israel, settled in a communal life and were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Your father had nothing to do with politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">No, no, nothing with politics whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2325">He was a religious person, himself, my mother, the same way.</span> <span id="s2326">Orthodox, they believed G__ will bring you everything.</span> <span id="s2327">The Messiah will come and that's what they believed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">And although they weren't making very much money, they didn't need much?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">No, they didn't need much.</span> <span id="s2330">They were content what they had.</span> <span id="s2331">They brought up three children, we had food.</span> <span id="s2332">We weren't rich people but enough to buy us every possible, to buy us new suit, new shoes, a new shirt.</span> <span id="s2333">This was the ritual, everything single year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Were they matched or did they find each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">They found each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">So they knew each other.</span> <span id="s2337">.</span> <span id="s2338">?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">They knew each other well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Perhaps from school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Right.</span> <span id="s2342">But it's unfortunate, I didn't know about it until when I started to go to Polish schools, that my father and mother couldn't write Polish.</span> <span id="s2343">You see, everything was written, when they were figuring out numbers, the way they would figure it out in regular numbers.</span> <span id="s2344">But when it came to writing, they didn't.</span> <span id="s2345">They wrote it in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">So they could only read and write Yiddish and Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Yiddish and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2348">Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s2349">And when I came over here, I had two aunts in this country who didn't know how to read and write either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">So you would have been the bookkeeper in business.</span> <span id="s2351">.</span> <span id="s2352">?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Well, let me tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s2354">If I would have been around in Poland, I would have never stayed in put.</span> <span id="s2355">I would have taken off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">You would have taken off?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">There's no future there.</span> <span id="s2358">Was no future in a small town like that.</span> <span id="s2359">You had 150 Jewish families and 500, generally speaking, you lived through each other.</span> <span id="s2360">How can you make a living?</span> <span id="s2361">It's very rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Did you have any dreams before the war of what you were going to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">You had no idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">No, had no idea because at that age already, I knew there was a war going on in Austria and in Germany against people.</span> <span id="s2366">That put a fear here in my system.</span> <span id="s2367">I couldn't visualize what the future is going to bring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">So you thought short term?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Short term.</span> <span id="s2370">We can't go far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">And when the Germans came into your town, you weren't surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">No, I was not surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">The war was not a surprise to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">I had a fear, a tremendous fear when they came in because of the atrocities that they were doing.</span> <span id="s2375">Which in many cases, in many towns, when they came in, they shoot people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">In your town, they didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">They didn't.</span> <span id="s2378">Very fortunate, they didn't kill anybody.</span> <span id="s2379">Just rounded up the people, put them in the square.</span> <span id="s2380">Collected all the Polish prisoners of war, with the horses.</span> <span id="s2381">Can you imagine a cavalry fighting tanks, can you visualize that?</span> <span id="s2382">That's what the Polish did.</span> <span id="s2383">They fought a war with horses.</span> <span id="s2384">When they rounded them up and they were content, the Germans were content; they let everybody go back into the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">So you must have felt somewhat relieved after the first few months of the German occupation?</span> <span id="s2386">After all the stories you had heard and then they come in and nothing happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">I got acclimated.</span> <span id="s2388">Nothing happened I was acclimated to it.</span> <span id="s2389">It was sort of, I knew I have to go to work every day; which was a must.</span> <span id="s2390">You know after they came out with the new laws, had to wear a band, have to go to work each day, whether it's winter, summer, you have to go work.</span> <span id="s2391">So there, that's it.</span> <span id="s2392">So many times I covered for my father.</span> <span id="s2393">If his day came to go to work, I went for him too.</span> <span id="s2394">Every day people were assigned to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">No one was being shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Nobody's been shot.</span> <span id="s2397">You did your job.</span> <span id="s2398">As I said before, they came to town because they had a Yudenrite (ph)(c.014), a committee to demand what they want.</span> <span id="s2399">As long as those items were fulfilled to their contentment, nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">And very few German soldiers were in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">No.</span> <span id="s2402">As a matter of fact, we had a large German contingent.</span> <span id="s2403">They took over all the public schools and made their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">So you're talking about civilians, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Not civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Military.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Military?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">No school was in existence at that time.</span> <span id="s2410">They took over all the churches, took over all the synagogues.</span> <span id="s2411">Put the horses in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">So no more synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">No more synagogues, church, yes.</span> <span id="s2414">Only one church was in existence.</span> <span id="s2415">The other ones they confiscated.</span> <span id="s2416">They used the churches around for their entertainment.</span> <span id="s2417">The people are sort of content.</span> <span id="s2418">They have no choice in the matter.</span> <span id="s2419">They are in enemies' hands and they are the boss and they are the rulers.</span> <span id="s2420">You try to do the best you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">The bad period begins in '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">The bad period begins in '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">This is when all the stories that you had heard become real?</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Become reality, become reality, yes.</span> <span id="s2425">That was the worst part of it.</span> <span id="s2426">Where you lose complete sense of reality, self-sense, to be a human being.</span> <span id="s2427">Because we being exploited, being taken advantage of.</span> <span id="s2428">I was a youngster, innocent, in every respect.</span> <span id="s2429">Haven't seen life as yet.</span> <span id="s2430">Cannot continue going.</span> <span id="s2431">Life has been cut short.</span> <span id="s2432">You don't know where it's going to wind up.</span> <span id="s2433">But on the second hand, I had hope, never give up what the future might be.</span> <span id="s2434">Looking forward to make sure that the end of the war, I was alive.</span> <span id="s2435">And I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">What was the worst moment for you?</span> <span id="s2437">You had many bad moments, I'm sure, but...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">The worst part was during the holidays in the winter season.</span> <span id="s2439">When I was working in the factory, empty stomach.</span> <span id="s2440">I had nothing to eat, just drunk a lot of water.</span> <span id="s2441">When I saw other people going _____(c.051) just drinking water alone__.</span> <span id="s2442">Sort of grasping for air, I was grasping for air.</span> <span id="s2443">When you know--who knows what's going to happen?</span> <span id="s2444">That was in 1944.</span> <span id="s2445">But as long as I was working, getting something to eat, I would survive.</span> <span id="s2446">Then after the war was over, I was hoping that I would have sense enough to control my diet.</span> <span id="s2447">So I wouldn't be a ______(c.063) like the other ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">The camps that you were in, which was the worst for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Which one was the worst?</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Skarzysko Kamienna.</span> <span id="s2452">That was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Yet, it wasn't as bad as the stories you had heard about Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">That's right.</span> <span id="s2455">It wasn't as bad.</span> <span id="s2456">The only bad--the work wasn't as bad; I didn't mind the 12 hours.</span> <span id="s2457">Why am the Jew surrounded?</span> <span id="s2458">As you walk to camp, to work, or back from work, you never know where the bullet will hit you.</span> <span id="s2459">I mean a man comes out and discriminately.</span> <span id="s2460">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">The man, the hunchback?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">The hunchback and just shoots people for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Were any of the people that were with you, were they from Majdanek?</span> <span id="s2464">I know you mentioned some...</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Yes, some of them, they were born in Lotch (ph)(c.075).</span> <span id="s2466">Some of them come from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2467">They were shipped to Auschwitz or Majdanek It wasn't far away from each other.</span> <span id="s2468">And then when they needed laborers in Skarzysko Kamienna as the factories were growing, they needed more manpower.</span> <span id="s2469">They didn't have any manpower.</span> <span id="s2470">The Polaks could say I don't want to work for you, what are you going to do to me.</span> <span id="s2471">They could run away, they could hide if they wanted to.</span> <span id="s2472">So they brought these youngsters in.</span> <span id="s2473">Then when these numbers there and they have uniforms already, they already look like they're half dead to begin with... Then I found out, what they were doing in Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Were there any specific stories or individuals from Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Nobody talked too much about it.</span> <span id="s2476">Everybody has its own little problem, what they were doing in the barracks.</span> <span id="s2477">Everybody had their own dreams, food, food.</span> <span id="s2478">When you dream of food you don't dream of anything else.</span> <span id="s2479">Nobody is going to tell you a story what happened that they saw a lot of people being dressed and send them into the camp, into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2480">I don't think anybody saw it because everything was so isolated.</span> <span id="s2481">If you hear what the barracks maybe a mile away from here was the other situation going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">I have one more question.</span> <span id="s2483">When you were in hometown and you were working, shoveling snow and doing all kinds of work from '40 to '42, how were the Germans treating the Poles, that is the non-Jews?</span> <span id="s2484">Were they also being forced to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">So only the Jews were forced to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Only the Jews were forced to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">So when the Germans took over parts of the town, they just took over Jewish property, not Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">No Polish property.</span> <span id="s2490">You see, some of the--you'll find in every situation, you'll find somebody who is going to try to be a little bit friendly towards, you know.</span> <span id="s2491">There were some Polaks who were trying to be friendly to the Germans and point fingers.</span> <span id="s2492">Okay, so they can get something extra.</span> <span id="s2493">It was some of them, I don't say all of them but there were plenty of them like that.</span> <span id="s2494">Pointed their fingers so they could get something for themselves.</span> <span id="s2495">Maybe it's nature that provides it with it, but the Germans were your enemy, right?</span> <span id="s2496">To go with your country, to give ______ away and everything, no.</span> <span id="s2497">Those things, I look away already.</span> <span id="s2498">As a youngster, I looked at life in a different prospect way.</span> <span id="s2499">The courage I had was for myself is one thing, try to survive.</span> <span id="s2500">This what kept me going.</span> <span id="s2501">I kept consoling myself, every single day: It's sin o'clock now, I have to go to work.</span> <span id="s2502">The day will go by.</span> <span id="s2503">The days went by fast 'cause when you work on a machine, your mind is occupied 100%.</span> <span id="s2504">It is an automatic machine, machine doesn't work for you, you got to work for the machine.</span> <span id="s2505">The minute the machine retracted, you have to bring out the two pieces, we send two pieces back again.</span> <span id="s2506">Because I saw an incident happen.</span> <span id="s2507">____ So those were the ___ (c.153)__.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">You survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">I survived, that's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Have we forgotten anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">We covered...</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">I think I covered practically everything from A to Z.</span> <span id="s2514">As far as my memory recollects, I think I have recovered everything in all the camps that I have spent.</span> <span id="s2515">And the friends that I have in the camps, some of them were good, some of them were bad.</span> <span id="s2516">I'm not going to look for them.</span> <span id="s2517">Life is a bowl of cherries.</span> <span id="s2518">If life is good, we have a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s2519">If life is bad, we have a lot of enemies.</span> <span id="s2520">When you feel good, someone will come along and help you along.</span> <span id="s2521">When you feel lousy, you feel lousy yourself, no one will help you.</span> <span id="s2522">In those situations, in those situations.</span> <span id="s2523">Everybody had the same attitude towards life, the same feeling, hunger.</span> <span id="s2524">Hunger is a painful thing.</span> <span id="s2525">I don't wish it in my worst enemy in this world, to be hungry.</span> <span id="s2526">So painful, it is very difficult to describe.</span> <span id="s2527">Just imagine in the morning, take yourself once in the morning.</span> <span id="s2528">Get up, wash yourself up and take a walk.</span> <span id="s2529">Don't eat till about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2530">Your heart will tell you how you feel.</span> <span id="s2531">Sometimes I said to myself, let me try it.</span> <span id="s2532">I do it.</span> <span id="s2533">I get up in the morning, I don't eat anything.</span> <span id="s2534">I go for a walk.</span> <span id="s2535">I come back to my house, starts feeling pain.</span> <span id="s2536">As I said, it's very hard to describe it.</span> <span id="s2537">Everybody was in the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Not for one day, but for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">For three years and it was a lot of stealing going on.</span> <span id="s2540">A lot of them got beaten up 'cause of that.</span> <span id="s2541">If you were caught stealing, they take you inside a room over there and beat the living daylight out of you.</span> <span id="s2542">Why, you stole because you wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">I don't think you go to any of these guys, they give you stories precise.</span> <span id="s2545">Because I have it so deeply imbedded in me, every movement, every step that I make, all the work that I did for the Germans, I didn't get paid for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">No compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">No compensation.</span> <span id="s2548">["______water?"]</span> <span id="s2549">No, it's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">I think we've just finished.</span> <span id="s2551">Well, thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb, for your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">My pleasure.</span> <span id="s2553">See this is the group of youngsters who came to England.</span> <span id="s2554">There you see the supervisors and the youngsters.</span> <span id="s2555">I don't know if you're going to find me over there but I'm always in the front, with the white shirt.</span> <span id="s2556">["That's in Theresienstadt, right?"]</span> <span id="s2557">Theresienstadt, that's me.</span></p></body></html>
