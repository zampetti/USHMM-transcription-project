<p><span id="s11">1939 when the war broke out, I lived in an apartment house.</span> <span id="s12">In this apartment house lived also the mayor of the city from my hometown.</span> <span id="s13">When he saw me he says to me, "Why don't you come up to the city hall, and I will try to give you some Aryan papers, so you're not so much problem, you can travel around, so, not as a Jew, as an Aryan."</span> <span id="s14">And I talked to my father, maybe he wants it, and my father and my sister they refused completely because my brother was not home anymore.</span> <span id="s15">He ran away to Russia.</span> <span id="s16">Anyway, in a few days, I finally decided, I went over to the city hall, which was very hard because ----------- was actually the first ghetto ever made in Germany when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s17">I came over there and they gave me a passport with the name Sigmund Kamkosky, was my name, not anymore Goldberg, ----------Goldbergâ€™s, Sigmund Kamkosky.</span> <span id="s18">By having this in my pocket, I felt a little more confident, except I couldn't be in my city because everybody knew me as a Jew in this hometown.</span> <span id="s19">So I decided I'm going to leave.</span> <span id="s20">--------------- with also Aryan papers, we went into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s21">In Warsaw we find out that they organize a ---------- Underground, which we tried to join them.</span> <span id="s22">We looked around many, many times, places, and finally we came across somebody by the name, a guy by the name Charnetsky, who was connected with Underground.</span> <span id="s23">I was cowardly, I was afraid at first, and I always thought, I'm going to do something for my country and for myself.</span> <span id="s24">So I always ask him, "When you gonna give me some assignment?</span> <span id="s25">When we gonna go out and do something?"</span> <span id="s26">One day he came to me, he said, "I have for you something.</span> <span id="s27">You have to go to a city called Pananitza, not far away from Warsaw, and you have to deliver this package," which two German lugers, uh guns, and some ammunition.</span> <span id="s28">When I took this train, small train to go to Pananitza, every time somebody looked at me, I was pissing in my pants for, I was so afraid.</span> <span id="s29">Finally, they waited back in Warsaw for me before I come back, I'm going, and every stop the train made, the Germans came up on the train, and and, besides asking for papers, they robbed people, but people ----------, some people was uh smuggling in food to Warsaw, bag of food, whatever it was, they always, every time, every time I looked out the window, and I saw Germans there standing, coming on the train, I thought I'm gonna die.</span> <span id="s30">Finally I made the trip.</span> <span id="s31">When I came back, they said to me, "Okay, you got it made."</span> <span id="s32">And we waited a few days, they gave us another assignment to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s33">Being in Warsaw all this time, I could see that the Underground was not organized enough.</span> <span id="s34">When we used to go out, let's say, and we did a job, let's say, somewhere where robbed a grocery stores.</span> <span id="s35">What, those, those days they is called Spulgenia??</span> <span id="s36">We used to go, two guys got in, in German uniforms, and tried to ac, uh, to take out some food, okay?</span> <span id="s37">When the Germans find out, that it's the 10 or 15 Polish people, and they hang them, they kill them.</span> <span id="s38">So, in mine eyes, being in the Underground, every time we did something wrong, 10 or 15 innocent people died.</span> <span id="s39">This was not my cup of tea.</span> <span id="s40">I always say, "If I do something, let's do it right."</span> <span id="s41">They used to go around and ------ask people for money to help the underground.</span> <span id="s42">I didn't s--I personally didn't see any purpose in that.</span> <span id="s43">I say if you go out and fight, get some ammunition, go out, go after the Germans and try to do something.</span> <span id="s44">One day they sent me, and they said, "From now you have to go in Dobra, ---------------.</span> <span id="s45">Over there, they have some contacts, you're gonna bring back a lot of ammunition, back into Pananitza."</span> <span id="s46">Why they send us to Dobra?</span> <span id="s47">Because when Poland was attacked from the Russian side, and the Polish army left everything there so the farmers took a lot of guns and ammunition, they used to bury in there, in their places, and the Underground find out where those, some of the farmers, you know, they're patriots, and they will give us the ammunition to, to bring back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s48">So, we went there and I was, we came to a little town called Dobra.</span> <span id="s49">Dobra was maybe about 50 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s50">Nothing but Jews.</span> <span id="s51">Those people even didn't know a war was going on.</span> <span id="s52">Quiet, nice, you nice little community, except was 3 or 4 gentiles, the mayor and a policeman, and a fireman.</span> <span id="s53">That's all there was in the whole city.</span> <span id="s54">The rest was all Jews, all the houses around the market, and there were tailors and shoemakers, and they used to do business with the Polish people twice a week, was a market place, and they used to go out...I waited, we waited for the contact to come.</span> <span id="s55">You know, who is going to contact us to get the ammunition.</span> <span id="s56">But I want to bring it up how bad it was the whole, it was early in the 40s in the beginning, was, they was not organized yet.</span> <span id="s57">So finally one day, I was staying, they had what they call bars.</span> <span id="s58">The farmers used to come and on Tuesdays stay in the bars and drink vodka and do business with the Jewish people, they were lived just like brothers.</span> <span id="s59">One day a guy came over, tapped me on the shoulder, he said, "Your name is Sigmund?"</span> <span id="s60">I said, "Yeah -------."</span> <span id="s61">He say, "I have something for you , you have to take back to Pananitza."</span> <span id="s62">I said, "Oh, finally I have a contact, I'm here."</span> <span id="s63">The same night, this was on Friday, I remember exactly was on Friday, the Jewish people was praying ------------------ go to a small synagogue what they have in this little town.</span> <span id="s64">A truck came in with German soldiers, uh, Germans and Ukrainian soldiers in this town.</span> <span id="s65">And they asked the people in the town to give them, I don't know what they want from them.</span> <span id="s66">They wanted some flour and this and that and that, the first time, this little town actually saw Germans and Ukrainians come in to town.</span> <span id="s67">So this man, this farmer told us we have to leave tomorrow.</span> <span id="s68">It was winter, was in January, I remember, was winter, very cold.</span> <span id="s69">And he had a sled with one horse, and he put it three sacks, there were 3 sacks of uh, wheat.</span> <span id="s70">And in the wheat, we had the ammunition covered up.</span> <span id="s71">So, he gave us a map, how to go back to Warsaw to Pananitza.</span> <span id="s72">This little poor horse were going and during the for, in the forest, travelling around in the forest, the snow.</span> <span id="s73">Finally, we had to cross the road.</span> <span id="s74">We had to cross a highway.</span> <span id="s75">Crossing the highway, the highway did not have any snow, and the sled had armament in it, you know.</span> <span id="s76">This little horse, the horse was trying to get across, he couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s77">So finally the horse fell down, we had to lift him up, and from afar, we saw like a truck is coming.</span> <span id="s78">In those days, after, everything was dark, it's a little bitty, you know, like two eyes, you could from the far.</span> <span id="s79">I had a friend, a friend of mine, his name was, uh, was Zelig.</span> <span id="s80">He stopped, and he said, I said, "Let's go, let's leave it, everything here and go because they're gonna catch us, they're gonna, you know, gonna kill us, the Germans.</span> <span id="s81">He said, "No."</span> <span id="s82">He cutted off the sack open, took out, was a machine gun there.</span> <span id="s83">A Polish old machine gun, probably from WWI, with 2 little sticks like this, and put it in the middle in the highway.</span> <span id="s84">Put it in the (laugh) the ------------ was sitting there waiting for the trucks.</span> <span id="s85">I went down to the ditch, pulled the horse with me because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s86">He was not afraid, he said, "If I die, let's die with them together."</span> <span id="s87">He was waiting for them to come.</span> <span id="s88">All of the sudden, we looked around, I see that truck, the eyes disappeared, they turned around on another highway.</span> <span id="s89">I said, "Oh my God, thank God this happened."</span> <span id="s90">So we loaded everything back up, finally we came into Pananitza to this bakery.</span> <span id="s91">We came into the bakery, the, we took off, there too, came out 3 guys and took off the, you know, the wheat, and the guns everything, he hided us, and told us to clean us up, and they put us on the top on the oven to dry up because we're wet, and dried out.</span> <span id="s92">Well, I was sitting there in the morning.</span> <span id="s93">Excuse mine expression, I had to take a leak.</span> <span id="s94">So, I went out to the forest.</span> <span id="s95">You know, it was, I ----------------------------------forest, and I was standing across, next to a tree, and I was taking a leak.</span> <span id="s96">A guy by the name Julte, was his name, he came out, doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s97">He looked at me, he said, "Very dirty," in Polish, "You son of a bitch, you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s98">You are circumcised."</span> <span id="s99">I said, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s100">He said, "Yeah, you're circumcised.</span> <span id="s101">Show it to me."</span> <span id="s102">I said, "What's, what's the matter with you.</span> <span id="s103">Come on, go to hell."</span> <span id="s104">That, well, after I was eating breakfast, the owner of the bakery came over to me.</span> <span id="s105">He said, "Sigmund, you better take off, go to Warsaw because they already said they're gonna kill you, they find out you are a Jew."</span> <span id="s106">And I said to myself, "I'm fighting for their country.</span> <span id="s107">I tried to be a patriot.</span> <span id="s108">Not just for Poland itself, for my own life as a Jews, and here they don't want me there.</span> <span id="s109">I mean, look what I did!"</span> <span id="s110">He said, "No, you better take off."</span> <span id="s111">Matter of fact, all 3 of us, me Zelig, and David, we came into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s112">This was already 1941, I think, I don't know exactly the date.</span> <span id="s113">The Warsaw ghetto was already coming to a close already, the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s114">Then we came into Prague.</span> <span id="s115">We were in Prague, we want to go into the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s116">How can we get into the Warsaw ghetto?</span> <span id="s117">I could not get in.</span> <span id="s118">The only way I could get into the Warsaw ghetto is with a group of people who went out from the ghetto to work.</span> <span id="s119">So I can get in, in the group with people to go back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s120">Here I'm carrying a gun, my two friends carry guns, we do, it's was terrible.</span> <span id="s121">So finally, they both of them got in and I was late.</span> <span id="s122">I couldn't run after the group.</span> <span id="s123">When we came into the gate, I was the last one.</span> <span id="s124">A polish policeman, polish policeman was there with Germans???</span> <span id="s125">and inside were Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s126">Inside in the ghetto were Jewish policeman standing there.</span> <span id="s127">When they open up there I was running, they said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s128">I said, "I'm a Jew."</span> <span id="s129">Okay, why don't you back up just a little bit, and tell me how you wanted to get into the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Okay, I want to get in there to Warsaw ghetto, the only way I could get in there is with a group of people who went out to work for the Germans, they used to take uh Jewish people every day outside the ghetto to work.</span> <span id="s131">My two friends got into a group, and they got into the ghetto and I was late.</span> <span id="s132">I was the last one.</span> <span id="s133">When I came into the, to the gate, they called an iron gate, I think, yeah, that's ----------, iron gate, came there, the Polish policeman stopped me with the German out there, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s134">I said, "I'm a Jew."</span> <span id="s135">He said, "You're a Jew?</span> <span id="s136">So, if you're a Jew, what are you doing out," you know, even tell me that I could not, and so the Jewish policeman inside heard what I said, "Jew," he says to me in, in Yiddish, "Loid (run."</span> <span id="s137">So I start running, and the policeman is running after me, supposedly hitting me over the head, and he hollered to me, "Run, run, run!"</span> <span id="s138">So I ran, ran out, and he saved my life, otherwise they probably would kill me over there.</span> <span id="s139">Finally we come into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s140">It's too impossible.</span> <span id="s141">If I tell somebody, they would not believe it, hundred people all ----------, people were laying on the street, dead, covered with papers.</span> <span id="s142">The sanitary was full, they didn't even have time to pick up the dead and to bury them.</span> <span id="s143">Streets were full from hunger.</span> <span id="s144">Children were sitting on the street begging, it was terrible scene.</span> <span id="s145">I said to myself, "Oh my God, why I came in here?</span> <span id="s146">Here why, why, why do I came into the Ghetto?"</span> <span id="s147">I said, "Thank God, I felt good because I'm between my own people. "</span> <span id="s148">The outside was dangerous.</span> <span id="s149">You could not be outside.</span> <span id="s150">If you see it, for example, I give you one example.</span> <span id="s151">In Warsaw, we had a bridge to go from Prague to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s152">On the bridge you have Germans guards watching the bridge.</span> <span id="s153">When the passed on the bridge, you have to take your hat off, and say to the German "-----------."</span> <span id="s154">Means ------------, you know hi, whatever it is, --------------.</span> <span id="s155">So, I have an experience, my own experience, my own experience.</span> <span id="s156">I went to the bridge, and I took off my hat, I said, -------------.</span> <span id="s157">He calls me back, and he says to me, "Why you saying to me ----------?</span> <span id="s158">You a friend of mine?"</span> <span id="s159">Took off his gun, and he hit me so hard, I thought he gonna kill me.</span> <span id="s160">"Don't you ever say that-----," I start running.</span> <span id="s161">Came to the other end of the bridge, I saw another German.</span> <span id="s162">I said to myself, "Now I'm not going to take off my hat."</span> <span id="s163">Sure enough, I didn't take off my hat, he calls me, "Why didn't you say hello to me?</span> <span id="s164">Grisgot.</span> <span id="s165">So he hit me over the head.</span> <span id="s166">(Laughs) Working there, it was very bad.</span> <span id="s167">Working the streets of Warsaw before I got into the ghetto, the Polish people looked every, not everybody, we had nice Polish people.</span> <span id="s168">You have an element of people who are bad.</span> <span id="s169">They looked everybody in the eyes, just to recognize a Jew.</span> <span id="s170">They recognize a Jew better than the Germans because they lived among us.</span> <span id="s171">They knew us, right.</span> <span id="s172">My friend, Zelig, he had a different policy.</span> <span id="s173">He had a policy, a reverse policy.</span> <span id="s174">If anybody looked in his eyes, he went over to him and he said, "You god damn Jew, I'm going to call the Germans."</span> <span id="s175">He made him as a Jew."</span> <span id="s176">He used a reverse psychology.</span> <span id="s177">And a Polock usually, when he came, he start hollering at him, like, he ran away, he left us alone.</span> <span id="s178">So we never walked all three of us together.</span> <span id="s179">He was always the first, other one was then, and I was the last one.</span> <span id="s180">Something happened, shooting or something, I was the coward.</span> <span id="s181">I was always afraid.</span> <span id="s182">I was short, I was little, I was very afraid.</span> <span id="s183">I'm going to go back when I get into the Warsaw ghetto, and I saw there what happened, the Warsaw ghetto had a, they built some walls.</span> <span id="s184">Around the top on the walls in the streets, where you, you know, when the ghetto was closed, had some, uh glass.</span> <span id="s185">In order, we were there a few days, in order for us to get out from the ghettos, only way we could go to an apartment what had the window, high enough with the , with the brick, brick wall, what they builded okay?</span> <span id="s186">The only way to get out, you couldn't go out in early in the morning, I mean early in the morning, you couldn't go out after in the night because you couldn't walk in the night, you know, they kill you.</span> <span id="s187">So one day, we decided we're going to leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s188">So we find a place on the Prodova, on Prodova Street, there is ------------, apartment house.</span> <span id="s189">We knocked on the door, was about 4 oâ€™clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s190">The man got up, a Jewish fellow, let us in, he said, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s191">I said, "We want to jump, get out of your window."</span> <span id="s192">He said, "Please don't do that, you, my family in danger, killed."</span> <span id="s193">Anyway, didn't help, we had guns, we said, "If you want to die, you're gonna die, we're gonna do something, we have to leave."</span> <span id="s194">So, early in the morning, we open up his window and well, got on the wall, and we jumped on the other side.</span> <span id="s195">You wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s196">Soon as we jumped on the other side, all these young people were waiting outside.</span> <span id="s197">They start running after us, and they hollered, "Jews, Jews, ran out from the ghetto."</span> <span id="s198">You know, they ran after us, the Jews ran out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s199">Finally, we ran away.</span> <span id="s200">We got hided in a, in a big apartment house, and we, and we were there for a while until it got quiet on the streets, and we got out, and I said to my friends, "Listen, the underground is enough for me.</span> <span id="s201">I'm going to go back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s202">I'm going to find my father and my sister.</span> <span id="s203">I said, I don't want to be in the Polish Underground.</span> <span id="s204">I see what they did, they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s205">They hate me as a Jew, and I want to fight with them, and you want me to stay with them?"</span> <span id="s206">Then he said, "Okay, we'll find some other undergrounds, and we're going to go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s207">You want to go home, go."</span> <span id="s208">I took my gun, put in my pocket, I went down to the station.</span> <span id="s209">I had Aryan papers with me, I can travel the train.</span> <span id="s210">I came to the station.</span> <span id="s211">A German Schutzpolizi, the call them Schutzpolizi, stopped me.</span> <span id="s212">------------------, they said, "Ay, where are you going?"</span> <span id="s213">I said, "Oh, mama mia!</span> <span id="s214">This is it.</span> <span id="s215">This is my end now."</span> <span id="s216">Finally something hit me because I had this young polish people signing up to go to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s217">So, I said to them, "I'm going home to Pietkov."</span> <span id="s218">I'm going to pick up my brother, we're going to go to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s219">I hear you, you, you need some workers in Germany."</span> <span id="s220">He said, "Oh, you're a good, fine younger, fine younger," he says to me, "You're a nice boy."</span> <span id="s221">He said, "Go ahead," he let me go.</span> <span id="s222">So I came home to Pietkov.</span> <span id="s223">Took me, when I got off the train, I didn't want to walk from, from the train to go into the ghetto, uh was a long way to way to walk, and I was afraid to walk on the streets because maybe somebody will recognize me.</span> <span id="s224">Finally, I made it in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s225">Was a lot of people in the streets.</span> <span id="s226">I made it, I got into the ghetto, the ghetto, Pietkov ghetto did not have any gates, they have just a big sign.</span> <span id="s227">Everybody who walked out from here gonna be shot, everybody who walked in gonna get killed, you know big signs.</span> <span id="s228">So the streets were open.</span> <span id="s229">Finally I got it made.</span> <span id="s230">I got it into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s231">When I came to the ghetto, I couldn't find my father because the they made the ghetto smaller every time they made it, they the people had to move in different places.</span> <span id="s232">I was asking around, asking around.</span> <span id="s233">Finally, they told me where, where my parents live.</span> <span id="s234">All right.</span> <span id="s235">So there my father lived, my mother was not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s236">So I came into my house, my father was happy to see me and this and that, he had one room, my father, my sister, the other ones, another family lived there, okay.</span> <span id="s237">One evening, was two days later, I took up my gun, and I tried to clean â€˜em because you know, I was afraid, gonna get rusted.</span> <span id="s238">So I tried to clean it, and my father saw this gun, I thought he gonna kill me.</span> <span id="s239">He said, "You have to take this arms right away from my house, and you have to throw this away because if the German would catch it, you killed, all the Jews in the ghetto will die on account of you.</span> <span id="s240">I said, "Dad, they're all dead anyway.</span> <span id="s241">What is the big problem?</span> <span id="s242">What do you worry so much about it?"</span> <span id="s243">He said, "---------------get out and get out and do this," so finally, I didn't want to upset him too much because he was already afraid, he didn't walk out of the house, he was sitting in the house all day long and praying, praying to God, God will help.</span> <span id="s244">So finally I said, "Okay," I went down in the yard and I threw it away, the gun.</span> <span id="s245">I -------------------, I still had ---------.</span> <span id="s246">You know, it's amazing.</span> <span id="s247">The next day I went out to the ghetto to walk around see maybe I find somebody.</span> <span id="s248">Word got around in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s249">We figured a lot of people came in from small towns to this city.</span> <span id="s250">Word got around because I had a lot of friends, I was going to school there, people knew me.</span> <span id="s251">Now if I, -------, I was not in the ghetto for so long that they knew, somebody said that I am in the underground.</span> <span id="s252">Okay?</span> <span id="s253">Sure enough, the Jewish police arrested me.</span> <span id="s254">They arrested me and they put me in the cellar.</span> <span id="s255">In the cellar was a place what the Germans used to come every morning, take the people out and take, take put them in the forest, and shot it, you know everybody who was in the cellar.</span> <span id="s256">Had a friend of mine, was, I was going with him to school to get -------------, he was the head of the police, and if a girlfriend of mine find out that I am arrested, and she was in the cellar, she told him.</span> <span id="s257">When she told him that, he came down to the cellar, he opened up the, the you know this little room, which a lot of women with children were there, and me, myself, and "Hand me a broom."</span> <span id="s258">And he said, "Go up and sweep the corridor."</span> <span id="s259">You know to sweep it.</span> <span id="s260">So I went out there, took it, and I start sweeping.</span> <span id="s261">------------------------I swept.</span> <span id="s262">Maybe ten minutes later, the head of the Gestapo, his name was Altman, he came down to take the people out to the forest.</span> <span id="s263">So, this guy, he ask him, this uh, this Jewish policeman said, "What, what does he do here."</span> <span id="s264">He said, "they arbeite here--I'm working there."</span> <span id="s265">So here was another luck.</span> <span id="s266">I was safe from to be, from being killed.</span> <span id="s267">So when I came into the ghetto, he let me out and here is hunger, nobody had anything to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">When I was in Warsaw, before I got in the Warsaw, being outside the ghetto, coming from, from Dobrov, with, with ammunition, the uh, when I ran away from the underground, and I went lived in Prague, and ----------------------------was a big apartment house, maybe 400 people.</span> <span id="s270">When the ghetto in Warsaw was created, the gentile people who lived in Warsaw and the Jewish people had to move out from their apartment, they used to change apartment.</span> <span id="s271">People used to change.</span> <span id="s272">They had little signs on the street, if you want a room, you're in the ghetto, you contact me, and the people used to change apartments.</span> <span id="s273">So this apartment house had about 400 Jewish families all of the sudden had this 400 gentile families.</span> <span id="s274">So, we got in this apartment house, we tried to get a place where to live, so the superintendent from the apartment house, her name was Foijahovah, and his name was Foija.</span> <span id="s275">In Poland usually a man is Foija, and this, her name was Foijehovah.</span> <span id="s276">Okay this is ------------the name.</span> <span id="s277">And she let us stand, let us live with there.</span> <span id="s278">How this, it was a one big room and the room was divided, not that way, just that way in half, and the, you know, on the, you going on top there, and she gave us a place on top to live up there.</span> <span id="s279">And, when we came in there, we didn't know that, that she was running a bordello.</span> <span id="s280">She had a a whorehouse.</span> <span id="s281">Since she was the superintendant, she can open up the doors anytime somebody ring the bell to let them in and go in there.</span> <span id="s282">She was always drinking and she was always drinking and didn't talk anything but about the Jews.</span> <span id="s283">The Jews who did that, and the Jews did that, on account of the Jews, they suffered.</span> <span id="s284">My friend Zelig was sitting up there hearing all those stories, and watching those German soldiers come in with those girls, he was always holding his gun, he said, "Let me go down and kill her, kill her," I said, "Zelig, take it easy.</span> <span id="s285">We're not going to come out winners here, now just take it easy.</span> <span id="s286">Let's wait."</span> <span id="s287">She was, she was so hateful to the Jews, and the smugglers, and this was close to the railroad station, the people who used to smuggle food into the Warsaw ghetto used to come into this apartment house, sell their goods what they brought with them.</span> <span id="s288">In the morning, when they could go out, 5 o clock, they used to go back to the train, and go back home where they came from.</span> <span id="s289">90% of those people, some people used to bring eggs, some chickens , some this and that, used to be you know like a black market.</span> <span id="s290">Was there, a girl was coming there, and she was uh, sitting, she was selling eggs.</span> <span id="s291">Foijehovah, the, the, the, the mama from the Bordel, her, from the bordello, she comes over to me, she says, "Sigmund, you're a good-looking guy.</span> <span id="s292">Why don't you go out there and talk to this girl, and find out, I think she is a Jew.</span> <span id="s293">And if she's a Jew I call the Gestapo, we're going to kill her, she doesn't want to sell me eggs."</span> <span id="s294">I said, "Foijehovah, what do want (clears throat) she probably sell the eggs to somebody, she has already a customer."</span> <span id="s295">"Okay, well when you go out and tell, tell her, find out if she's a jew."</span> <span id="s296">I said, "How can I find out she's a Jew?"</span> <span id="s297">"You find out, if she doesn't want to go with you to sleep, or to the bed or something, you know she's a Jew, because our girls are all ------------, look at Zosha, look at this one look at this one."</span> <span id="s298">I said, "Oh my god, ----------what she is talking about here to me?"</span> <span id="s299">So I walked out there, we had a word in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s300">The word was called Amho.</span> <span id="s301">Amho was a password.</span> <span id="s302">Amho means one of us.</span> <span id="s303">If you want to find out if somebody's a Jew, you said the word, "Amho."</span> <span id="s304">If they answer you "Amho," then you know they're Jews.</span> <span id="s305">Okay?</span> <span id="s306">Nobody knew this word, this was created during the ---------.</span> <span id="s307">(Clears throat) And I walked out to this girl, and I talked to her, I said, "Listen, why don't you sell some eggs to Foijehovah," and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s308">In the conversation, I said the word Amho.</span> <span id="s309">And I talked to her some more, and she didn't answer.</span> <span id="s310">I said to myself, "Okay, so she's probably not Jewish."</span> <span id="s311">Then I said to her, talking some more, I said "If you bring some eggs tomorrow, at least leave one dozen eggs for Foijehovah so she's not going to bother you," and I said "Amho."</span> <span id="s312">She said, "Amho."</span> <span id="s313">(Pause) When she said the word amho to me, I said, "Please, don't come here anymore because they're going to kill you."</span> <span id="s314">And she left.</span> <span id="s315">After that, a few days there, we could not take it because I said, "Look at what they're doing around.</span> <span id="s316">What are they doing?</span> <span id="s317">They don't --------------------, Foijehovah adored us.</span> <span id="s318">She says, "You're the guys who gonna save Poland.</span> <span id="s319">You're the people who gonna do everything for us.</span> <span id="s320">Those Jews every time I find a Jew I kill him.</span> <span id="s321">How could you stay there and listen to all those stories.</span> <span id="s322">I couldn't take it, so this is the time when I went into the Warsaw, to the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s323">When I came into the Warsaw ghetto, and as I tell you before, when I jump, and the Polocks, then after that, and they ran away, and I got on the train, the German stopped me there, and I got on the train and I came home.</span> <span id="s324">When I came home, I was arrested, I told you that before, I was arrested, a Jewish police let me out.</span> <span id="s325">Now being in the ghetto now, you have to find a way how to make a living.</span> <span id="s326">Was impossible, people were dying.</span> <span id="s327">A typhus epidemic was going around.</span> <span id="s328">People were dying in the thousands.</span> <span id="s329">My father didn't want to move out of the house, he was afraid to move.</span> <span id="s330">The only way, to me, I had Aryan papers in my pocket.</span> <span id="s331">I'm the only one who can go out and bring some in food to the house.</span> <span id="s332">So, I find out not far away was a city called Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s333">The Polish people admired the city because they had there like a holy place for them, they go there took pilgrims every year.</span> <span id="s334">I find out they have some uh ------------there, you know, very important things was in the ghetto to have candles, candles was a big item.</span> <span id="s335">Because we didn't have no lights, ----------------------------- candles you could sell.</span> <span id="s336">So I used to travel in Czestochowa, and Piertkovnova, I used to bring on suitcase full of candles, used to sell in the ghetto, buy bread, and feed my brother, my, uh my father and my sister.</span> <span id="s337">We, uh all doing fine.</span> <span id="s338">One day, I came into Czestochowa, and somebody offered me to buy some salami.</span> <span id="s339">All right.</span> <span id="s340">So I bought some salami, a full suitcase of salami, about 10 or 15 sticks of long salami.</span> <span id="s341">Was very heavy, finally I got into the train in Czestochowa, and I said to myself, "Now, I'm going to go home.</span> <span id="s342">Now I made a good buy."</span> <span id="s343">Fine.</span> <span id="s344">Was sitting in the train, in the train when I opened up the compartment, you see the Polish trains are not like you see today.</span> <span id="s345">Every compartment has a door to open up out, you know, to go out.</span> <span id="s346">Some of them have you can go into another compartment.</span> <span id="s347">I came into ---------- a girl was in, a farm girl was there, a blond girl was sitting there, she had a little uh, um basket covered up with a towel.</span> <span id="s348">She was sitting right there in the train, I mean, just sitting there, and I put my suitcase on top.</span> <span id="s349">And I was sit down there too, and I ask her, her name.</span> <span id="s350">She told me her name was something, ----------I don't remember exactly, and I told her my name was Sigmund.</span> <span id="s351">"Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s352">She said "I'm going to Pietkov."</span> <span id="s353">Fine.</span> <span id="s354">We're travelling...I don't know how long, about 25 minutes, the stop, the train stopped for another station.</span> <span id="s355">The door of the compartment opens up.</span> <span id="s356">Two Germans walk in.</span> <span id="s357">Two SS men walked into the same compartment.</span> <span id="s358">Sitting there taking off the white gloves, and they start talking to themselves.</span> <span id="s359">I understood every word they're saying.</span> <span id="s360">I don't know if she understood.</span> <span id="s361">I understood every word, and said ---------one guy said to the other, they smelled the salami, the garlic they smell.</span> <span id="s362">So he, one, one German says to the other, the Poland, "----------------------."</span> <span id="s363">You know the Polish they stink from, from uh garlic and onions, the Polocks, that we are stinking.</span> <span id="s364">I I don't know nothing happened.</span> <span id="s365">He said, "--------------------," the Poles look how they're stinking, they were sitting there, he was telling -------------, was knocking in his hand, and he looked up there, and I said to myself, "Oh my God, what's going to happen?"</span> <span id="s366">At this moment, when he was looking up there, I start urinating in my pants.</span> <span id="s367">I was urinating from being afraid.</span> <span id="s368">She noticed something.</span> <span id="s369">She turns around, she said, "Sigmund, would you like to eat some lunch?"</span> <span id="s370">in Polish to me.</span> <span id="s371">I said, "Yeah, I'm hungry."</span> <span id="s372">She opened up the basket, took out a piece of salami, cutted a piece, gave it to me with a piece of bread, and she ate, start eating it.</span> <span id="s373">So one German says to the other, "See, I told you that the Polocks they stink, they smelling from salami."</span> <span id="s374">And my mind was going through, why did she do that, you know, what happened then?</span> <span id="s375">Then, next station, the, the two Germans walked out from this compartment, both of us were, you know, travelling, I came home with that salami, had been scared to death.</span> <span id="s376">I said to myself, "I'm not travelling no more, even if I have to die.</span> <span id="s377">I'm not travelling no more."</span> <span id="s378">Come to the ghetto next day, I go down to the marketplace, start to sell the stuff.</span> <span id="s379">Who you think I see on the street?</span> <span id="s380">This girl from the train.</span> <span id="s381">She was also a Jewish girl who was smuggler, she was smuggling.</span> <span id="s382">She understood what those two Germans were saying.</span> <span id="s383">And then, acce--you know, and they accept it, so after that, I was afraid to travel, because the danger was so great, not because as a smuggler, yourself, I was afraid of being capartmentured, and I was a coward, really a coward, I did a lot of things, and still I was a coward, I was so afraid to die.</span> <span id="s384">I was just hoping, I, I didn't want to do anything, so next day, a few days later, matter of fact, I said to my father, he was a brewmeister, and we used to sell, buy a lot of bottles from the glass factory.</span> <span id="s385">So, we used to deliver, before the war, sand to make the glass, okay, so he knew the Germans who owned the factory, were German people who owned the factory, glass factory.</span> <span id="s386">So he says to me, "Why don't you go down to Mr. Fogley, tell him who you are."</span> <span id="s387">A lot of Jewish people already worked in this factory, in the glass factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">After a while, we were in the in the, working in the glass factory, after a while we heard rumors that the ghetto gonna liquidated.</span> <span id="s390">They're gonna make us form a ghetto, which in this time, we already moved several times to smaller apartments, smaller apartments, you know, different places.</span> <span id="s391">One morning, and they used to take out the Jewish people by streets.</span> <span id="s392">------------- And a lot of young people, like I worked in glass factory had what they called arbeitshein, means a work permit.</span> <span id="s393">So the first day, when they start liquidating the ghetto, I'm telling you about mine, what mine experience.</span> <span id="s394">I don't how what in other places what happened the streets, mine experience, they came on the yard, in the house, the Jewish policemen, they said everybody to come down.</span> <span id="s395">Okay, with working papers, non-working papers, everybody out, come down on, on the street.</span> <span id="s396">So, of course, we all went down in the yard, was standing, the Ukrainian came in, and they looked everybody who has working papers, okay?</span> <span id="s397">So I had a working paper, my sister did not have.</span> <span id="s398">She didn't want to work.</span> <span id="s399">My father did not have, I had a working paper.</span> <span id="s400">So they told us, the working people on the side, and they're gonna take us out to the, to the factory, -------------------have to go.</span> <span id="s401">In this moment, my father knew exactly what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s402">He walked over, he spoke perfect Russian, he went over to this Ukrainian, he says to him, "Sir, can you let me talk to my son for a few minutes."</span> <span id="s403">He didn't want it, I don't know, my father gave him something, whatever might be the case, I don't know, I was all mixed up, I didn't know, I was scared, and I was, didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s404">He walked over to him, and my father walked over to me, and he says to me, "Son, I want you make me a promise."</span> <span id="s405">Before the war I used to act, and for Jewish people acting on the stage was like a disgrace for a family.</span> <span id="s406">My father says to me, "Please promise me that you're never going to be an actor, professional actor.</span> <span id="s407">He shake hands with me.</span> <span id="s408">An hand, a handshake in our tradition is very holy.</span> <span id="s409">We call it (blows nose) ------------.</span> <span id="s410">I'm sorry till today what I did, oh I was never happy for what I did.</span> <span id="s411">I was, I'm very sorry, I should not promise.</span> <span id="s412">Then he says to me, "Son, I would like for you do me one favor, you don't have to shake hands on this.</span> <span id="s413">Pick a day in the year, one day in the year, light a candle, go to the synagogue, and say kaddish.</span> <span id="s414">This was the last word my father told me.</span> <span id="s415">And by shaking hands, I'm till today, I'm sorry I never, I could have worked professionally, I never did it.</span> <span id="s416">I kept my promise all those years.</span> <span id="s417">I still keep it till today.</span> <span id="s418">After that when they were liquidated, they took us all out to this factory, and were there for 8 days until they created a small ghetto, a ghetto of 2 blocks, or 3 blocks, I don't remember exactly to be specific about it, how many blocks were there, in the Jewish section of town, and the 8 days we're there outside in the factory, we slept there, and then they took us back into the small ghetto, and everybody, were 3-4 boys got up, and 4-5 families, you know, we slept there.</span> <span id="s419">A lot of people made bunkers, and we were hiding in bunkers, you know.</span> <span id="s420">After the liquidation, a lot of them came out, and a lot of them still were hiding.</span> <span id="s421">Matter of fact, I found a girl, the apartment they gave us was double wall, and one night I heard some noises, and we opened up the walls, there was my brother and my sister were hiding in there, you know.</span> <span id="s422">Anyway, was in this small ghetto for a while, and then, I don't know how long it took, 6 months, 3 months, 4 months, it's so, for me, to be exact dates, I don't remember the dates.</span> <span id="s423">I know it was 1942.</span> <span id="s424">This I remember.</span> <span id="s425">Finally rumors came along, they're going to liquidate the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s426">They had 3 factories in Pietkov, they had Hortensia, a glass factory what make bottles and all kind of crystals, they had another factory called Kada, where they make plate glass.</span> <span id="s427">They had third factory, where they make furniture.</span> <span id="s428">--------Was a lot of Jewish people went to work for these factories, and they had places there, they lived there, they slept there, matter of fact, a lot of them, till the Russian came into Poland, I think a lot of them were safe, there was just like, Pietkov was very lucky by having those 3 places where people worked there.</span> <span id="s429">I did not want to stay in the, I could have stayed there because I knew the German, the directors from the factory, the problem came in, I was too privileged, and the Jewish police, some of them were very jealous, so I was afraid some of them might do something, and I gonna have to pay for it with my life, because was, jealousy was very bad.</span> <span id="s430">One had a little better than the other one, even with my people, still, I had to watch myself, so I went to the president of the ghetto, his name was Vorshotsky, he was a very dear friend of my fathers, and I told him, "I understand that you have tomorrow a transport going to different working camps out of the city."</span> <span id="s431">He said, "You're in there working in the Hutercar, what are you afraid of?"</span> <span id="s432">I said I want to get out of here because this policeman, Yoina Levy is his name, he died here already, he is the man, he has an eye on me, and I'm afraid he's gonna do something.</span> <span id="s433">He works with the Gestapo, and I don't want to be around.</span> <span id="s434">I want to get out.</span> <span id="s435">He said, "Okay, you have a transport tomorrow go to Scarshitsko, one goes to Brishiniv.</span> <span id="s436">Brishiniv was supposed to be a working camp, they had there, pavers, shoemakers, furniture makers, sweater makers--Germans set up factories there, and they need some professional people.</span> <span id="s437">So I signed myself up as a tailor.</span> <span id="s438">He told me to do that.</span> <span id="s439">And early in the morning, about 4 o clock, they put us all to, you know, on the plaza???</span> <span id="s440">and the Ukrainian came, tried to take us out to the train.</span> <span id="s441">Being there, a guy from the Kada, from the Glass factory, they sent a guy to looking for me because the director of the factory knew me, and I was missing at work, so he sent somebody to pick me up from the ghetto and bring me to the factory.</span> <span id="s442">I was hiding, and I got on the transport, and I came into Brishiniv, this work uh, concentra-uh, labor camp.</span> <span id="s443">Was not a concentration camp then, was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s444">You had shoemakers, men and women worked together.</span> <span id="s445">It was fairly, in the beginning was fairly good until, they, fairly good, and they gave us 3 rations a day.</span> <span id="s446">We work hard, 12 hours a shi--12 hour shift, no, 8 hour shift, I think because was three shifts working in this factory.</span> <span id="s447">And it was, it was not as bad as in the ghetto, was better than the ghetto because they fed us.</span> <span id="s448">Even with the guards, the Ukrainian all around every day, somebody else got shot or got killed, or still the people that worked they didn't get, you know, they didn't get in trouble, they didn't smuggle or they didnâ€™t do this, you know how they every time, even if you don't look straight in the eyes of a Ukrainian they kill you.</span> <span id="s449">If you look straight in his eyes or you pass by something, he just took off his gun and kill you, for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s450">For no reason whatsoever they kill you.</span> <span id="s451">Until they made a concentration camps out of it.</span> <span id="s452">They make a concentration camp out of it, became very bad, I mean this was bad.</span> <span id="s453">You had to, when they went to work, they used to lock up the shops okay?</span> <span id="s454">When you went night time to barracks, nine o clock you have to go into the barrack ---------------------.</span> <span id="s455">They used to count everybody up that went into the barrack.</span> <span id="s456">They closed the wooden barrack, in case god forbid a fire happen, everybody is dead.</span> <span id="s457">No way out, you know.</span> <span id="s458">So was very bad.</span> <span id="s459">Until, end of 1943 -----------.</span> <span id="s460">I don't know exactly but sometime in 1943, the Russian army, came, start moving in closer, whatever it was in those days.</span> <span id="s461">So they wouldn't, they say they're going to liquidate it, ---------.</span> <span id="s462">Where they gonna take us?</span> <span id="s463">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s464">Finally one day they take us all on appel --------, they count us all up.</span> <span id="s465">Ukrainian soldier with us, they take us to a train, put us on train, we travel, everybody asked, "Where we going?"</span> <span id="s466">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s467">"Where we going?"</span> <span id="s468">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s469">We're sitting in the train.</span> <span id="s470">Finally after a day, I think, a day or night, ---------------day and night travelling in the train.</span> <span id="s471">One morning the trains open up, some look at people with striped suits, I have never seen that because we didn't wear striped suits in the Breshin, we didn't wear striped suits in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s472">See strong young boys with striped suits standing around.</span> <span id="s473">Open up the cars, and told us to get out.</span> <span id="s474">We all got out, stand up in line.</span> <span id="s475">One guy, what matter of fact, later I worked in the same commando.</span> <span id="s476">This what they call, they call the Canada, nickname Canada.</span> <span id="s477">They came in, and they said to us, "You know, you're very lucky today."</span> <span id="s478">I said, "What you mean we're very lucky?"</span> <span id="s479">He said, "You're lucky Mengele is not here.</span> <span id="s480">Secondly you're lucky you came from a working camp."</span> <span id="s481">I said, "What he's talking about."</span> <span id="s482">You know, he just passed by and said it.</span> <span id="s483">I don't know what he's talking about, Mengele, Canada, who, what place is it?</span> <span id="s484">He said, " This is Birkenau."</span> <span id="s485">I never heard of Birkenau.</span> <span id="s486">I heard of Treblinka.</span> <span id="s487">I heard of Majdanek.</span> <span id="s488">I didn't hear about Birkenau.</span> <span id="s489">I heard about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s490">I didn't hear about Birkenau.</span> <span id="s491">Birkenau was...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Okay, I want you to just back up and tell me how this was Birkenau, and you hadn't heard of it, and then what you ended up doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Okay, I'm coming to it.</span> <span id="s495">I'm getting you slowly, slowly, slowly getting there.</span> <span id="s496">Okay?</span> <span id="s497">When we got off the train, they took us to Entlausung, what they call.</span> <span id="s498">Entausung is a place...</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Wait.</span> <span id="s500">Stop.</span> <span id="s501">Let's just cut for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Take 5 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">When we got off the train, they took us into the shower, what they call a Entlausung.</span> <span id="s505">When we got in there, the people who worked there, was also, they all were haftlings, you know, some were barbers, they used to shave the head, you look everybody and the hair, they saw something they used to shave.</span> <span id="s506">Well I was lucky they didn't shave my head.</span> <span id="s507">We went into a shower, we showered, and the guys that worked there, they told us, we are very lucky, everybody tells me I'm very lucky.</span> <span id="s508">What is the luck about it?</span> <span id="s509">I did not know.</span> <span id="s510">I really did not know what's going on.</span> <span id="s511">Lucky.</span> <span id="s512">So finally they hand us out clothes.</span> <span id="s513">This was, for all those problems, the suffering, with the need for so long, and everything else, just everybody starts laughing.</span> <span id="s514">A guy was tall, they gave him short pants, and a short jacket, short sleeves.</span> <span id="s515">A guy was short, they gave him a, a suit, we looked at each other and like we looked like comedians.</span> <span id="s516">We didn't get stripes, and so we get some suits they painted in the back with a -----------, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s517">Finally they took us off, they send us in what they call quarantine.</span> <span id="s518">Quarantine was before you go to working camp was a quarantine.</span> <span id="s519">I was assigned to a Block 12, and I worked in this block, the head of the block, they call them Blockeldester, there was a Polock, not a six, a Jew, a Pol, a Polish guy, his name was Franik, Frank.</span> <span id="s520">And he looked familiar to me.</span> <span id="s521">He looked at me, and he said, "Ay, Sigmund!"</span> <span id="s522">He recognized me.</span> <span id="s523">He was one of the guys what I met in Warsaw in the underground, he was capartmentured, and they sent him into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s524">He was the Blockeldester, I said, "Oh my God, I have a, a guy here," you know, which was very helpful because he gave me an extra piece of bread, an extra piece of soup.</span> <span id="s525">During the day, everybody had to stay outside, we couldn't go in, in the barracks after they count us up and the quarantine, they everybody used to, to get in with the Latrine???</span> <span id="s526">we used to stay because it was warm, you know, what everybody was standing around there.</span> <span id="s527">I had a chance, I used to go back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s528">And we had to be in the quarantine, they used to come in every day and they give numbers.</span> <span id="s529">Mine mind was, I don't want a number.</span> <span id="s530">If I have a number, I'm not going to be able to get out of here.</span> <span id="s531">I be a a goner.</span> <span id="s532">So I didn't want to get a number, I was running from barrack to barrack not to get a number.</span> <span id="s533">Every time they came in a place to give numbers, I ran away, I didn't want to get a number because I'm always hiding till the last minute.</span> <span id="s534">One evening this Frank says to me, "Sam, you better you," "Sigmund," he called me Sigmund, he knew me by the Sigmund, he didn't know I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s535">He finally find out, later I told him.</span> <span id="s536">He said, "Sigmund, if you don't have a number, you're not going to be able to go into work in the Sielager," what they call the working lager.</span> <span id="s537">They catch you without a number, you be in trouble.</span> <span id="s538">You know, this and that, crematorium.</span> <span id="s539">I said, "What's going on here?"</span> <span id="s540">He said, "Those chimneys there, you're lined up over there."</span> <span id="s541">I said, "What are you talking about.</span> <span id="s542">You're crazy."</span> <span id="s543">He said, "Yeah, you're lined up over there.</span> <span id="s544">If you, you, you, you know, this is the crematorium, they burn people here."</span> <span id="s545">I said, "You must be mad.</span> <span id="s546">I don't believe it."</span> <span id="s547">I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s548">You smell the sweetness in nighttime, you see the, the chimney, the fire come out from the chimney, and I could not believe that something like this happened.</span> <span id="s549">One day, when the appel, an appel, you know when they count up the people, every morning they used to sit there, and count up.</span> <span id="s550">One day in the middle in the day, they call us to get out of the barracks, and everybody stay in line.</span> <span id="s551">And we stood in line.</span> <span id="s552">Two or three Germans, don't remember how many, two or three, I think about 3 of them, came and one of them stayed in the front he said, "Who is from uh, Swidding?"</span> <span id="s553">Swidding means a, a brother and a sister born at the same time.</span> <span id="s554">Twins.</span> <span id="s555">"Who comes from twins?</span> <span id="s556">Step out?"</span> <span id="s557">Who does this, step out, you know, ask all those questions.</span> <span id="s558">Then all the sudden he says, "Who had an Aryan mother and a Jewish father, or a Jewish father and an Aryan mother," you know opposites.</span> <span id="s559">I was ready to step out.</span> <span id="s560">I said, well, mine is a chance, my mother comes from Germany, her name is Hannaman, maybe it'll be something good.</span> <span id="s561">I tried to step out, this Frank, the Kapo was going behind me, he hit me so hard, he pushed me back in the line.</span> <span id="s562">I said, "Frank, what are you doing?"</span> <span id="s563">He said, "Stay there you son of a bitch, don't move.</span> <span id="s564">If you move, I, I kill you myself."</span> <span id="s565">Fine.</span> <span id="s566">After they picked up a few guys, one what had an Irish mother, one, one is this, one he had twins, one come from there.</span> <span id="s567">They walked away.</span> <span id="s568">He calls me into his room, you know, the Kapos have a little room up in the front of the barrack, he calls me in there, he said, "Sigmund, you know what I'm telling you?</span> <span id="s569">You're the luckiest guy I was there right behind you because right now you'd probably be in Block 10, make experiments on you from Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s570">I said, "Who is Mengele?"</span> <span id="s571">I even didn't know who Mengele is being there already 4 weeks, and see what's going.</span> <span id="s572">I did not believe it.</span> <span id="s573">You couldn't make me believe that people are burned there every day.</span> <span id="s574">Finally one day, they took me in the lager, and they took me out from the quarantine, took me to the lager, to work in the works commando.</span> <span id="s575">They took me in Block 24.</span> <span id="s576">One side of the barrack was people who supposed to work in the railroad track, and the other side, I saw a bunch of guys, fat, strong, beautiful dress, you know, the, the striped suits are nice and clean, their shoes are you know, clean, I said to myself, "Who are those people?"</span> <span id="s577">Oh they are working.</span> <span id="s578">And I used to go out to work every day, carry those barrels, and so hard work, I thought I gonna, I gonna die.</span> <span id="s579">So I met a guy who worked in this commando.</span> <span id="s580">I ask him, "What commando is this?"</span> <span id="s581">He said, "Transport Commando."</span> <span id="s582">"What is transport commando?"</span> <span id="s583">He said, "A transport commando, people come in, we help them get off the train."</span> <span id="s584">I said, "This what all you're doing here?"</span> <span id="s585">He said, "Yeah, that's what we're doing."</span> <span id="s586">The kapo from the transport commando, his name was David, he came from the town from Lodz, and I recognized, he was sent into Auschwitz in 1942, he did something wrong in the ghetto, so they sent him to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s587">To Auschwitz/Birkenau.</span> <span id="s588">In this day, I don't know, 4 guys got in, they took him into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s589">Why and what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s590">The rumors were going around, I'm just telling what I heard.</span> <span id="s591">This I did not see.</span> <span id="s592">Because they talked, they, they talked to people from a transport.</span> <span id="s593">They wrote down their number supposedly and they sent them to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s594">How true this is, I don't know, I did not see it, so I cannot tell you how true it is.</span> <span id="s595">I heard it.</span> <span id="s596">It was going around between the boys who worked, there was 200 people worked in this commando.</span> <span id="s597">The nickname for it was, they called Canada because they said it's an abundant of food.</span> <span id="s598">I saw those guys.</span> <span id="s599">They didn't eat the rations.</span> <span id="s600">They used to give it away on this side, to us.</span> <span id="s601">I met this guy Schlemmer, he gave me his food, and he talked to me every evening, I used to ask him what he's doing, I ask him about the ovens, he said, "Yeah, it's true."</span> <span id="s602">I said, "I don't believe it."</span> <span id="s603">He told me, said, "You better believe it."</span> <span id="s604">I said, "I don't believe it."</span> <span id="s605">He said, "You better believe it."</span> <span id="s606">It was going on and on for several days.</span> <span id="s607">One day, when those guys were missing to work, they need 4 more to replace them, so he says to me, "Go over to David, ask him to take you into this commando, you know, to this work commando."</span> <span id="s608">Because I saw those guys have, they have vodka, they have salami was hanging on the -----------, they're, they're covered with, with down pillows they're sleeping on.</span> <span id="s609">They're wearing silk uh, uh shirts.</span> <span id="s610">I mean, they their boots, they're dressed, I'm mean I, I want to live like that too, you know.</span> <span id="s611">I walk over there, and I said, "David, you want to take me in this commando?"</span> <span id="s612">He said, "You son of a bitch," he took his stick, hit me over the head, and didn't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s613">I said, "David, I know you."</span> <span id="s614">He said, "Okay, you know me."</span> <span id="s615">He hit me again, he didn't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s616">The next day I talked to him again, the same story.</span> <span id="s617">Finally this guy, I went over to him, he said, "Ay, why don't you take in this guy, he's a friend of mine, take him in commando."</span> <span id="s618">He said, "Okay," come over to me, said, "You want to work in the commando?"</span> <span id="s619">"Yeah."</span> <span id="s620">"Okay."</span> <span id="s621">So he went out, he went to the Shreipster, Shreipster is the office, what they ever the Germans have, their bookkeeping was so precise, everybody with his name and his number was on a card, okay?</span> <span id="s622">The people who worked in this commando, when he came back, he said, "You want it?</span> <span id="s623">You can have it.</span> <span id="s624">You'll never see the world again."</span> <span id="s625">Because what they said, the people who work in the Zonder Commando means the people who burned the people after they were gassed, the Canada, the people who worked in the transport commando, they should never see the world because they is witness to the history, unlike us.</span> <span id="s626">And the people who worked in the, I forgot the exact name in German that they sort the clothes next to the crematorium, there are people what are sorting the clothes you know from the dead people.</span> <span id="s627">Next to us was a camp they called the Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s628">Okay?</span> <span id="s629">Well, I don't know, they say, how many thousands of gypsies were there?</span> <span id="s630">I don't know, they were there with families.</span> <span id="s631">One claims were 18,000, some people claim it was 27,000, I don't know the actual figures, I cannot make a statement about it.</span> <span id="s632">I know was a lot of families with children.</span> <span id="s633">I have seen them playing there because the barbed, you could see through the wires, through the electric wires, you could see back and forth.</span> <span id="s634">So, one day we got up in the morning, so finally he took me in the commando, and I work with Schlemmer on the side.</span> <span id="s635">The first transport I remember was a transport came from Hungary.</span> <span id="s636">A Hungarian Transport.</span> <span id="s637">He told me, "When you come out there, whatever they tell you, do.</span> <span id="s638">Don't talk to nobody.</span> <span id="s639">Don't open up your mouth.</span> <span id="s640">If anybody ask you a question, don't say nothing.</span> <span id="s641">You're dumb, deaf and dumb.</span> <span id="s642">When the Germans give the orders to open up the cars, you just open up the cars, help the people out, put them in line, get back in the cars, take out the luggage and set them up."</span> <span id="s643">Thisâ€¦ We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Now I can go have a cigarette too.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">When I went on the first transport to work, when my friend told me what to do, this what I did, and I took out everything, and I still, I could not apprehend what's going on.</span> <span id="s646">I did not, with David, he in, like, taking out the luggage, I saw a lady ask the Germans soldier what, because Germans brought the people in, not Ukrainians, Germans, SS brought in people in from, from the transport, what I have seen, maybe some other transport, somebody else brought in people.</span> <span id="s647">-----, he said to her in German, "Don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s648">You have your name on your luggage?</span> <span id="s649">Your luggage will come after, you know, will come after you."</span> <span id="s650">So, I asks, this, my friend of mine, "what in -------you talking about?"</span> <span id="s651">He said, "Don't be silly.</span> <span id="s652">Don't ask so many questions.</span> <span id="s653">Just go to work.</span> <span id="s654">Just work, do your job, don't talk nothing."</span> <span id="s655">Meanwhile, they used, what they used to do my commando, they used to loot, people used to bring everything with them because that's all they had.</span> <span id="s656">Some of them brought whiskey, some of them brought diamonds, some of them brought gold, some of them brought everything, everything that people, whatever they had, they brought with them because the German suppose told them they're going to resettle them in other places, so they brought everything with them.</span> <span id="s657">So they find some, a lot of food, in, in the cars, and now, this the reason why this commando had so much to eat, and so much everything else.</span> <span id="s658">The ----------- never came home, so this, we came home, I said home, we came back to the barracks after, you know when we cleaned up those trains, we had to clean them so thoroughly that like nobody was ever sitting in this car.</span> <span id="s659">They used to come and inspect.</span> <span id="s660">When the car was ready for another, to go back and bring another transport of people in.</span> <span id="s661">This was our job, to wash it and clean up everything in there.</span> <span id="s662">After this was, I think one transport I worked in Czechoslovakia, and then, for a few days, we didn't do nothing, so they sent us in to the, next to the crematorium, what was they call, I forgot the German name for it.</span> <span id="s663">What they used to assort the clothes.</span> <span id="s664">When I came in there, and they assigned me to a barrack, to assort men's clothes, childrenâ€™s clothes, and they told us to look in places where something hidden, diamonds, whatever take it out, they had a box for us to throw it in.</span> <span id="s665">One of my friends said, "If you find a diamond, swallow it.</span> <span id="s666">When you came home, for this, we can buy vodka, we can buy salami, whatever you find, little small, what you can swallow, swallow."</span> <span id="s667">When I was working there the same day, I said to myself, "Now, I see it's true what they're telling me.</span> <span id="s668">Why they have so much clothes?</span> <span id="s669">Must be from those people what they came in transp--you know, on this transport.</span> <span id="s670">I still couldn't apprehend this.</span> <span id="s671">I worked there, I came home very disgusted.</span> <span id="s672">I mean, back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s673">And I was sitting there crying.</span> <span id="s674">All night I was crying, and I want to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s675">I said, "I can't."</span> <span id="s676">Since I learned in --------- a lot, I said to myself, "Let me ask my god a question."</span> <span id="s677">We the Jewish people, every day of atonement, Rosh Hashanah, we're going to the synagogue, and we're praying for God when he makes his judgment on us, we s--and we say in the prayers who should die by fire, who should die by water, who should die by knife, who should die by this.</span> <span id="s678">I said, "Almighty God, tell me, all those people commit this crime, they have to be burned alive.</span> <span id="s679">Tell me, where are you?</span> <span id="s680">I'm supposed to be one of the chosen people.</span> <span id="s681">What are you doing to us."</span> <span id="s682">Should I answer.</span> <span id="s683">No answer.</span> <span id="s684">A call came, "Raus!"</span> <span id="s685">Somebody called the German.</span> <span id="s686">A kapo said a transport came.</span> <span id="s687">We went out to transport.</span> <span id="s688">We worked.</span> <span id="s689">I worked in the transport, the night commando, and the, the, the people from the Lodz ghetto, from Lichmenstadt, used to come, and they liquidate the Lodz ghetto, this was already 1944.</span> <span id="s690">I think was June or July.</span> <span id="s691">I don't remember exactly, I think it was July.</span> <span id="s692">June.</span> <span id="s693">The first Jewish transport from the ghetto came.</span> <span id="s694">In my commando where I worked, what was a man, who, he was in there from the ghetto, -----------------arrived with two children, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s695">Every day, a transport, he worked night shift, for that, he want to work every shift.</span> <span id="s696">You know, night shift worked separate, day shift worked separate.</span> <span id="s697">At nighttime a transport came in, the night shift went out.</span> <span id="s698">The daytime, the day shift went out.</span> <span id="s699">So every time a transport came in from the Lodz ghetto, he want to go to work, because he was waiting for his wife and children to come, maybe he can do something.</span> <span id="s700">One day we're going out to work.</span> <span id="s701">He worked ------------going on day shift.</span> <span id="s702">We go out to work, a transport came in from the Lodz ghetto, and the doors open up, and I see, and I open up the doors, and some uh, people I knew from Lodz, "Aye, Sigmund, you're here, what's going on here?"</span> <span id="s703">I could not say a word.</span> <span id="s704">What are you going to say?</span> <span id="s705">You don't say nothing.</span> <span id="s706">You run away like you don't hear.</span> <span id="s707">"Hey what's the matter with you?</span> <span id="s708">You don't want to talk to me ---------."</span> <span id="s709">You can't say anything.</span> <span id="s710">This man noticed his wife and children.</span> <span id="s711">He went over to Mengele.</span> <span id="s712">Mengele was standing there like this.</span> <span id="s713">Never forget this.</span> <span id="s714">And I was standing in the car, trying to sweep the car, you know, afterwards, you know people going in in front of him, he's on the back the cars already, empty, we just cleaned them then.</span> <span id="s715">I'm standing there, he goes over to Mengele, he said, "Doctor," he said, "I'm here for so long."</span> <span id="s716">He said, "My wife is a strong woman, my children.</span> <span id="s717">You know, why don't you let them go into the camp."</span> <span id="s718">So Mengele puts his hand like this, I never forget this.</span> <span id="s719">He looks at him, he said, "You love your wife so much?"</span> <span id="s720">He said, "Yeah, I love my wife and my children."</span> <span id="s721">He said, "Why don't you go with them?"</span> <span id="s722">He says, "Doctor please, they can do it," and he fell on his knees.</span> <span id="s723">And he begged him, so he hit him to push him away.</span> <span id="s724">Finally, Mengele just pointed his fingers to go to the left, his wife and his children.</span> <span id="s725">The man ran away.</span> <span id="s726">He ran into a car, and a few minutes later, I walked in the car, he was sitting in the corner, and he's crying.</span> <span id="s727">So, a friend, a friend of mine said, "Who are we to judge?</span> <span id="s728">Can I judge what he did?</span> <span id="s729">If he go with her, he wouldn't be here, if he doesn't go with her, I don't know.</span> <span id="s730">How can I judge."</span> <span id="s731">How can we judge him, what he did.</span> <span id="s732">He lets all his wife and his children go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s733">That's all.</span> <span id="s734">What can he do?</span> <span id="s735">He couldn't do nothing, and I can't be the judge.</span> <span id="s736">After the transport, I came home, I said to myself, "No," I just could not take it.</span> <span id="s737">You've seen the gas chamber, the ovens burning, after every transport, took maybe a half an hour, an hour, you could see the flames coming out, you know from the, from the ovens burning.</span> <span id="s738">And I said to myself, "I have to finish my life.</span> <span id="s739">I just cannot take it."</span> <span id="s740">I just could not take it.</span> <span id="s741">I know, I knew in my heart, I probably never come out of here alive anyway because I worked in the transport commando, I see it everything what's happening.</span> <span id="s742">I worked in the Kleibens, I've forgotten the German name for it.</span> <span id="s743">I worked in a place where I sort the clothes.</span> <span id="s744">I worked over there.</span> <span id="s745">I cannot take it.</span> <span id="s746">I have to, I have to kill myself.</span> <span id="s747">Every morning, used to get up in the morning, in uh, in Birkenau, you used to see bodies hanging on the electric wire because it was very high powered electric wire, so people used to go and just grab the wire and want to die, they died themselves.</span> <span id="s748">The back door from the barracks was going out to the wires.</span> <span id="s749">I tried to commit suicide, I said the best way for me is to catch the wire.</span> <span id="s750">So during the day, I went out and I count the steps, how many steps is to the wire, right?</span> <span id="s751">So, I know in the nighttime, I close my eyes, because after all, I'm a coward, I don't want to die.</span> <span id="s752">I just want to die and I don't want to die.</span> <span id="s753">Right?</span> <span id="s754">So I go out and I count out was 8 steps.</span> <span id="s755">1, 2, 3 , to the wires and just stretch out your hand, catch the wire, that was all over.</span> <span id="s756">Okay?</span> <span id="s757">Nighttime everybody was asleep and I get up from the barracks.</span> <span id="s758">My friend says to me, "Sam, where you going?"</span> <span id="s759">I said, "I'm going to the Latrine."</span> <span id="s760">Yeah, I'm going to, you had a big barrel there where you urinate.</span> <span id="s761">And the door from the back part was open because you have guards, they are not afraid you run away, you know.</span> <span id="s762">I pushed the door open, I go out, and I counted, I said, close my eyes, count, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, I stretched my hand, open up my eyes, the wire is maybe 3 feet away from me.</span> <span id="s763">I said, "What the hell did I do?"</span> <span id="s764">And by the way, you get scared.</span> <span id="s765">You're scared right, you want to die, you're scared maybe the guard saw you up there, he's going to shoot you right, so you run back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s766">Run back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s767">Said, what did I do wrong here.</span> <span id="s768">I counted right.</span> <span id="s769">Why the wire moved away?</span> <span id="s770">What is this?</span> <span id="s771">I said, I'm going to try it again.</span> <span id="s772">Next day in the morning, was no transport coming, they took me in to assort the clothes.</span> <span id="s773">Next to the crematorium, and next to the crematorium was the hospital.</span> <span id="s774">A friend of mine was very sick in this hospital, and somebody come, you know, the, between the hospital and the crematorium, in this camp, where they assort the clothes, they had some uh covers, like this, covered on the uh, oh on the wires so nobody can see, look through.</span> <span id="s775">Okay?</span> <span id="s776">Only thing is, you could holler at somebody.</span> <span id="s777">So somebody hollered my name, and he said to throw him over something, money or somewhat I can't find here, to throw it over to him, so maybe we can buy the German out and we can get him out from the hospital, otherwise, be on, on selection, and he gonna die, it's a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s778">So I find a military, you know a little military -----------, what the Germans eat in it, you know, the food, what you call it, how you call this, a little container.</span> <span id="s779">I put some soup in it, and I found some gold pieces, and I threw it in there, close it and throw it over, over the wire.</span> <span id="s780">A German SS saw me, he was a Czechoslovakian.</span> <span id="s781">What I did.</span> <span id="s782">He grabbed me.</span> <span id="s783">Said, "What did you threw?"</span> <span id="s784">I said, "I didn't threw nothing."</span> <span id="s785">"What did you threw there?"</span> <span id="s786">I said, "I didn't throw nothing."</span> <span id="s787">He said "You did throw something."</span> <span id="s788">I said, "No, I did not."</span> <span id="s789">He said-----------.</span> <span id="s790">So he took me into the barrack, they had a long oven in the barrack.</span> <span id="s791">You know, in middle the barrack they have an oven.</span> <span id="s792">The oven had an opening.</span> <span id="s793">---------------------- We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">-------------------, so I can go smoke a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">I remember it.</span> <span id="s796">I'll tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s797">Okay, I put some money, I put some soup in the contain, and I find some gold pieces, you know, over there, and I saw a friend of mine, had a few pieces what they find small, I throw it in there, and I throw it across the wire, the German caught me, and he says to me, "You threw something there."</span> <span id="s798">I said, "No, I did not."</span> <span id="s799">He said, "You did."</span> <span id="s800">I said, "Did not."</span> <span id="s801">So he took me into a barrack, they had a long oven in there, and there was an opening there, they put my head in a bag???</span> <span id="s802">in the oven, took my pants down, and slapped with a stick, 25 sticks.</span> <span id="s803">He said, "Did you threw something there?"</span> <span id="s804">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s805">He said, "You threw something there, no?"</span> <span id="s806">Another 25.</span> <span id="s807">After the first 10 or 15 I didn't felt anything anymore, he just beat the hell out of me.</span> <span id="s808">So finally they took me outside, was a barrel outside, put me in a barrel, and they pushed the barrel down the block to two of my prisoners, pushed the barrel back, push it back, and I was all dizzy.</span> <span id="s809">I couldn't so they took me outside, again.</span> <span id="s810">Put me back in the oven.</span> <span id="s811">Started hitting me again, I was already completely out.</span> <span id="s812">Didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s813">So I had one German, another German soldier was standing, standing there next to this guy who beat the hell out of me.</span> <span id="s814">He says, "You beat the hell out of him already so much, and he said that he didn't do it, he probably didn't do it, why don't you leave him alone."</span> <span id="s815">So he said to me, "You get out of here, you -------------."</span> <span id="s816">He said, "Get out, you dog."</span> <span id="s817">He throw me outside.</span> <span id="s818">The boys picked me up.</span> <span id="s819">They find some alcohol, they put it in a big bucket, and put me in this alcohol because I was all black in the back of me, all black.</span> <span id="s820">And finally theâ€¦finally that went back to the barracks in the evening, and they put some alcohol all at night on the, on back of me to get out the blackness, which next day, I, if a transport come in, I have to go to work.</span> <span id="s821">So next, same night, two nights later, was no transport coming in.</span> <span id="s822">And, I said to myself, "No, I have to do it again.</span> <span id="s823">I have to commit, I cannot take it, I have to do it."</span> <span id="s824">So I go out, I count the steps again, and I wasn't, there were, if you have to live, nothing going to be in the way.</span> <span id="s825">Would explain like, like luck or from God, I don't know, I cannot, have a any explanation.</span> <span id="s826">It happened to me.</span> <span id="s827">How, why it happened, it happened later in another camp too something like that.</span> <span id="s828">Next day I go out, same evening, I count the step again, it's again 8 steps.</span> <span id="s829">Okay?</span> <span id="s830">The night I go out, start walking, counted out 8, all of the sudden I fell down in a little hole, a hole was there and I fell down.</span> <span id="s831">Got up, ran back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s832">Next day, in the morning, I go up there, I say, "Look, now," I said, "What's going on there?"</span> <span id="s833">So I remembered when I was in Pietkov at home, when the typhus epidemic was going on.</span> <span id="s834">I was very sick, I had the typhus.</span> <span id="s835">I remember laying and have a lot, high fever, laying in you know, in my sleep.</span> <span id="s836">Because of my, my, my -------------------this what happened.</span> <span id="s837">I had a dream.</span> <span id="s838">Had a dream.</span> <span id="s839">I dreamt I see people, somebody calls into a, called me to a judgment or something, somebody, to a court.</span> <span id="s840">I look in the court, I see 3 people sitting in the court, and the uh one on the side was a man, what I knew, he was my teacher, was a rabbi in the city, the Rabbi Shapiro.</span> <span id="s841">The other man, sitting next in the corn, in the middle was a man with a long gray beard, uh, nose like this, was sitting.</span> <span id="s842">Next to him was another man with a ---- black beard.</span> <span id="s843">And he said to this guy, the guy in the middle said, "Why did you brought him here?"</span> <span id="s844">The witness who committed, the guy who committed this crime is not even born.</span> <span id="s845">Send him back."</span> <span id="s846">And open, and I all of the sudden in this dream I open up my eyes, I see my father had the prayer shawl on, two candles on the table burning, and he says the prayer over a dead person, my father, over me, and I open up my eyes, and I said, my father, said to my sister, "Well, he is back, he is back with us."</span> <span id="s847">He took off the shawl, and you know, and he blow out the candles, and he wipe me off from the sweat.</span> <span id="s848">I was, I was here.</span> <span id="s849">A few days later he says to me, "Why don't you go to somebody who can translate your dream."</span> <span id="s850">This man, this came back to me when I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s851">So, I went in the city to an old Jew, they call him Percival, a guy who translate dreams, okay?</span> <span id="s852">And I went to him and I told him the story, what happened, so my, when I told my father, he said, "Who was there?"</span> <span id="s853">I told him, "Rabbi Shapiro, a man with a long beard, and another one who..." You know the guy with the long beard, this is your great, great, great grandfather, he's ------------, he's a righteous man, his name is Dr. Bernard.</span> <span id="s854">Matter of fact, years later, now, I find in a book, the same picture, the way I saw it in my dream.</span> <span id="s855">I have never seen this man.</span> <span id="s856">He lived in the 17th Century.</span> <span id="s857">How could I know the man?</span> <span id="s858">And the other guy who is next to him, a guy with a black beard, my father tells me, "This is your grandfather, you're named after him."</span> <span id="s859">I said, "I have never seen my grandfather.</span> <span id="s860">I don't know how he looked like."</span> <span id="s861">So, in the moment, this came back to me.</span> <span id="s862">When I tried to do this, I said, "Oh my God, maybe this what it is.</span> <span id="s863">Maybe I have to be in this world to do something."</span> <span id="s864">Which, matter of fact, I'm here, I'm here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s865">People might not believe it, but I say, No, it happened.</span> <span id="s866">It actually happened.</span> <span id="s867">I mean, this what actually happened.</span> <span id="s868">And this is, this my story, this it happened.</span> <span id="s869">Being in Auschwitz, after that I didn't try anymore.</span> <span id="s870">I told my friend, Schlemmer, the story, he said, "Listen, I want to stick to you.</span> <span id="s871">This what you had.</span> <span id="s872">Matter of fact, you lived through the war too."</span> <span id="s873">When we were in Auschwitz, I don't know how, two little boys, maybe age of 10, got into our barracks.</span> <span id="s874">To our barracks.</span> <span id="s875">Me and my friend used to take care, took care of those two little boys.</span> <span id="s876">One guy was Herbie, he was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s877">And one guy, --------------------his name was Jo, Jo, Joseph.</span> <span id="s878">He was from Lodz.</span> <span id="s879">How they got into our barracks, I don't know.</span> <span id="s880">Every time they had a spare???</span> <span id="s881">, what they call it, everybody has to go in the barrack, and they have a selection.</span> <span id="s882">Mengele comes into the barrack, makes a selection, takes out some people.</span> <span id="s883">We used to hide those 2 boys under the bed so they couldn't find them because ---------------- didn't have no chance but to die.</span> <span id="s884">One day was a selection, and they came into our barracks to make a selection.</span> <span id="s885">Now this is another story what is, really actually, I believe in it.</span> <span id="s886">Mengele came in made a selection.</span> <span id="s887">And they take us, tell us to strip naked.</span> <span id="s888">Well, we strip naked.</span> <span id="s889">And we used to go from, around them ------------in front of Mengele.</span> <span id="s890">Okay?</span> <span id="s891">He looks you over.</span> <span id="s892">Or you have some spots or this or that.</span> <span id="s893">All of the sudden I start going, my friend tells me, "Sam, you have bad spots on your shoulder."</span> <span id="s894">Maybe from the bedbugs or something, you know, I had red spots.</span> <span id="s895">By running like this in front of him, I saw a little towel, a towel, a little rag laying there, I took the rag, just throw it over my shoulder, just like, I don't know why, I just pick it up, throw it over my shoulder.</span> <span id="s896">Came in front of Mengele, he tells me turn around, turn around, you go, said go.</span> <span id="s897">If he will notice these spots, goodbye, I'm not here.</span> <span id="s898">---------------another thing.</span> <span id="s899">So being in Auschwitz, now finally, the Russians came in close, and we decided 1944, that was 44, we decided to make an uprising in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s900">We had some people who worked in Underground.</span> <span id="s901">We had some people who used to buy guns and everything else from the German, from the German soldiers, whatever it is, they brought in some guns.</span> <span id="s902">I was not that deep involved because, I was too afraid for my life.</span> <span id="s903">I don't want to get involved because they capartmentured -----------, and they put in the bunker, they kill them, you know, I was try to stay away from it.</span> <span id="s904">I was involved in a way by donating, by doing things, by telling something, you know, all the, otherwise no.</span> <span id="s905">One day, that the Zonder Commando blew up a crematorium.</span> <span id="s906">Was an hour or two late, or an hour or two early, I don't know.</span> <span id="s907">The sirens start coming up, out, and was very foggy, all of the sudden a fog came down, and they suppose to Czechoslovakia and the Polish Underground supposed to come in, accordingly what I heard, they're supposed to come into the camp to help us out in the uprising.</span> <span id="s908">Germans came in with the dogs.</span> <span id="s909">Everybody went into the barracks.</span> <span id="s910">The crematorium, one of them was blown up, no me, no, nothing happened, I don't know how many people got shot or caught, I didn't hear I didn't know.</span> <span id="s911">Nothing happened with the uprising.</span> <span id="s912">Only crematorium what was blown up, okay?</span> <span id="s913">A few days later, we heard they're gonna, the Germans gonna stop gassing, no transports came in.</span> <span id="s914">One transport came in, yeah, one transport came in from Theresienstadt, I remember, and I open up the car, this is a little short story what I tell you.</span> <span id="s915">I don't know, I did right thing I did the wrong thing.</span> <span id="s916">When I opened up the car, I saw a young lady with 2 children by, and holding in her hand, okay?</span> <span id="s917">By her hand.</span> <span id="s918">I just couldn't see her, when she goes with those 2 children, she is dead.</span> <span id="s919">The children are dead anyway.</span> <span id="s920">Don't make any difference.</span> <span id="s921">The children gonna die.</span> <span id="s922">So, I ask her, I said, "Is this, is this your children?"</span> <span id="s923">Just like mumbling to her, "Is this your children?"</span> <span id="s924">you know, just like that.</span> <span id="s925">She said, "No, I'm the Nana."</span> <span id="s926">I said, "Give the children, is the mother here?"</span> <span id="s927">She said, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s928">"Why don't you give the children to the mother."</span> <span id="s929">I said, she said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s930">I said, "It's bad here, bad."</span> <span id="s931">That's all I said to her.</span> <span id="s932">She turns around and calls, the German guard was standing there.</span> <span id="s933">She called the German guard, and says to him in German, "This man tells me horror stories about here.</span> <span id="s934">What's going on here?"</span> <span id="s935">Oh my God.</span> <span id="s936">He starts to looking for a pencil in pocket to write down my number.</span> <span id="s937">My number is written down, that's all forget it.</span> <span id="s938">The Kapo, David, saw it what's going on.</span> <span id="s939">What's going on from afar, he came over with his stick, start knocking me over the head.</span> <span id="s940">He said, "Why don't you," in German, hollers, "Why don't you go to work, you dog, you ---------," beat the hell out of me, and I ran between the people, there was a lot of people there, I don't know about 2,000 people or 3,000 people came in this transport.</span> <span id="s941">I ran right in ...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">We have to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">What happened now?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">We just ran out.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">I'm talking that much?</span> <span id="s946">------------------- Change film to Camera Roll 8, Take 8 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">One day, a transport came in from Theresienstadt, and I went out to work on this transport.</span> <span id="s948">When they gave us the order to open up the doors, for the people to let out, I saw a young woman holding two children by her hand.</span> <span id="s949">I said to myself, "This is her children, she gonna, the children gonna die anyway, don't make no difference."</span> <span id="s950">So to save her life, I decided I'm going to tell her.</span> <span id="s951">So I asked the lady, I said, "Is these your children?"</span> <span id="s952">She said, "No, I'm the Nana."</span> <span id="s953">I said, "Is the mother here with you?"</span> <span id="s954">She said, "Yeah, the mother is here."</span> <span id="s955">"Why don't give the children to the mother."</span> <span id="s956">She said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s957">I said, "Something bad, bad, bad is gonna happen here.</span> <span id="s958">It's bad."</span> <span id="s959">Without even looking at me, she pointed out towards, call a German guard, was standing right there between the people, being very polite.</span> <span id="s960">They were so polite to people.</span> <span id="s961">"Don't worry, everything will be fine."</span> <span id="s962">You know, that's the way they used to, people asking question, they used to answer in a nice way.</span> <span id="s963">She said, "He tells me terrible stories are happening here."</span> <span id="s964">So the guy starts looking for a pencil in his big pocket what they have to write down my number.</span> <span id="s965">The Kapo saw it, David, and he came across running with his stick in his hand, he start beating me over the head, he said, "-------------------, why don't you go to work," and you know, beat the hell out of me, and then ran after me, and I ran away in the crowd, and I jumped in the car.</span> <span id="s966">And I jumped in a car, I was hiding in there, and just tried to look outside for what I see it looks like the German or the guard, or he didn't want to do, because he, I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s967">I got saved.</span> <span id="s968">Okay?</span> <span id="s969">After that, when we came home, this was the last transport, were sitting in the barracks already, maybe 2-3 weeks, nothing happening, they took us only to select the clothes.</span> <span id="s970">Make balls out of it, and they used to you know, bundles, big bundles with wiring, they used to send this to Germany.</span> <span id="s971">We used to work, that's all we used to do.</span> <span id="s972">We'd steal whatever we could in order to buy whiskey, vodka, if you wouldn't drink every day, you probably would not live, and would not be able to do what you did because this was something like taking, like narcotics people taking narcotics to make them easy, this was the only way out to work in this, in this commando.</span> <span id="s973">Well, a guy by the name Fritz, he was the Ka, he was the Kapo from the night shift.</span> <span id="s974">David was the Kapo from the day shift, which I worked.</span> <span id="s975">Okay?</span> <span id="s976">Fritz was a ------------- Jew, very religious Jew.</span> <span id="s977">He was, when we used to work in the places, when we used to assort the clothes, he used to tell us to take a lot of like women need panty hose, need brassieres, because women didn't have brassieres, and all the girls was very hard to be without brassieres and panty hose.</span> <span id="s978">Silk sock, uh stockings, and all those things, he used to tell us, pack it up, when we get home, when we come back to the barracks, next day, we're going to the woman's camp, and we're gonna give it to the women.</span> <span id="s979">You know, this what we do.</span> <span id="s980">We as Canada people could go on any camp we wanted.</span> <span id="s981">The only thing, when we walked in, there's a, excuse mine expression, when we used to go out from the camps, said where we going, said, so he ---------- it, you know, the Kapo told the guard that the, at the gate to go "We're going to the Frauenlager," to the woman's lager.</span> <span id="s982">"What are you going to do there?"</span> <span id="s983">"We're going for sex."</span> <span id="s984">Just like that.</span> <span id="s985">They said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s986">You paid them off whatever it is, you know, we went.</span> <span id="s987">-------------------------- He told us, "If I catch one of you have anything to do with a girl because you give her clothes or give her stockings, I kill you myself.</span> <span id="s988">If you do something, do it from the heart, not to get paid.</span> <span id="s989">If I catch one of you, anything, anytime, to touch any of those girls, you're killed, I kill you."</span> <span id="s990">What I want to bring up, he was such a nice person.</span> <span id="s991">He was going around every day, he was completely under alcohol influence.</span> <span id="s992">Completely.</span> <span id="s993">Otherwise he probably commit suicide himself.</span> <span id="s994">He just was very, his name was Vincent, he was an Austrian Jew.</span> <span id="s995">Other people and I??</span> <span id="s996">thought he was such a ni--I always tried to remember him, he was such a nice--my Kapo was a son of a bitch.</span> <span id="s997">Now good, he beat the hell out of me all the time, him was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s998">And he, one day, he comes in, and they didn't burn anymore people.</span> <span id="s999">I don't know, I cannot tell you because I don't know.</span> <span id="s1000">Orders supposedly came from Germany, from higher up not to burn anymore people or whatever it was, no more transports.</span> <span id="s1001">Now, we're here.</span> <span id="s1002">Some people in the Zonder are still alive.</span> <span id="s1003">You know, the ones who worked in the, in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1004">I don't know if they're still alive today or not.</span> <span id="s1005">I know my commando, the music commando, the orchestra, the girls in the orchestra, who played orchestra, the Canada, the girls in the Scheiscommando, the people who used to go around with a barrel in every camp, and take up from the latrines, and then turn it on the fields, and the people who worked assorting the clothes.</span> <span id="s1006">These were the 3 commandos left.</span> <span id="s1007">I didn't know about the Zonder, they're still alive or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1008">I know about my, our people.</span> <span id="s1009">Fritz came in one morning, he said, "Everybody out!</span> <span id="s1010">If you have some gold or something, and you know, and this, take it with you, or put it in this hat."</span> <span id="s1011">Okay?</span> <span id="s1012">Fritz said it, "You better, you better give it, if you have some," and so I gave him whatever I could, I found it, we had it in the straw, mattresses you know, hidden stuff.</span> <span id="s1013">---------- we used to steal.</span> <span id="s1014">Put it in his hat.</span> <span id="s1015">Ten minutes later, he comes uh back, running back, he said, "Everybody outside!"</span> <span id="s1016">So everybody goes outside.</span> <span id="s1017">"Stand in line!</span> <span id="s1018">March!"</span> <span id="s1019">We started to march, so I was going with Schlemmer, and I looked next to me, this little Herbie was next to me.</span> <span id="s1020">This little 10 year old boy right standing next to me, holding my hand, he's going, I said, "Where you come from?"</span> <span id="s1021">He's here.</span> <span id="s1022">Herbie.</span> <span id="s1023">(Clears throat) So we're going the march and I said to Schlemmer, I said, "If they tell us to go to the left, we're going to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1024">If they tell us to go right..." You know, I, we knew where the crematorium, "tell us to go to the right, we're going out of here."</span> <span id="s1025">When we came to the door, to the gate, and he said, "Derechtz um," going to your right.</span> <span id="s1026">We didn't walk, we ran!</span> <span id="s1027">We actually ran.</span> <span id="s1028">There was a street there they called the lagerstrasse, you know a street there that goes to the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1029">We came there, we run there, we came there was about 7 or 8 cars, I don't know exactly how many cars were there.</span> <span id="s1030">Railroad track cars standing .</span> <span id="s1031">The cars were opened, and we jumped into the cars, there were cans, like milk cans, you know, ------------milk cans with water, bread laying there, rations of bread in the car, they closed the cars, the train start moving.</span> <span id="s1032">I said, "Oh my God!</span> <span id="s1033">We're getting out of here."</span> <span id="s1034">And we got out of there.</span> <span id="s1035">Travelling back and forth, we were still did not believe that we could, were getting out of here.</span> <span id="s1036">We came out of there, and they took us to travelling two days or three days, I don't remember exactly how many days.</span> <span id="s1037">They took us to Sudeten Deutschland.</span> <span id="s1038">To Germany.</span> <span id="s1039">Or to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1040">Sudeten--when the Germans took over, took us over there.</span> <span id="s1041">A small camp.</span> <span id="s1042">We came in there and this camp was in the mountain, about 60, 60 uh, I don't know how many bags were there, about 30 or 40 small bags, and they all worked in a, in a place they used to make uh, holes for the V-2 missile, the Germans built a V-2, the V-2 whatever you call them, V-2, V-2, ----------.</span> <span id="s1043">So, we worked there for a few weeks, and I got a job in the, where they took me in because I brought some money with me, from the camp, I paid off somebody, we paid off so we got better jobs, so I worked in the, in the, became head of the tailor shop, you know, I have a little more food, you know, and the little Herbie was with me all the time.</span> <span id="s1044">He spoke Hungarian, he spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s1045">And the ----- uh guy was a German, he had his own children, he find Herbie there, I thought he find him there, he you know, it's a, it's a a working camp.</span> <span id="s1046">No, he took him into his office to clean his office.</span> <span id="s1047">So, Herbie came back cleaning his office, so every day he used to bring old butts of cigarettes, you know, butts from the cigarettes, a whole bunch, a whole packet, every day.</span> <span id="s1048">He used to steal potatoes, he used to bring me.</span> <span id="s1049">So we got this, and I used to sell the tobacco, I didn't smoke in the camp.</span> <span id="s1050">You know, everybody for a little tobacco gave you a piece of bread, you know, it was life .</span> <span id="s1051">Life, life in that.</span> <span id="s1052">Only thing was bad in this camp, the camp was very dirty.</span> <span id="s1053">The lice were that big, on the body.</span> <span id="s1054">Didn't have a place where to wash.</span> <span id="s1055">Outside was a place we washed, and well, how much can you wash, it's cold, the wintertime.</span> <span id="s1056">So we washed.</span> <span id="s1057">Okay, we washed.</span> <span id="s1058">Herbie helped me out.</span> <span id="s1059">I helped him out.</span> <span id="s1060">And every day we used to go to work.</span> <span id="s1061">One day I went to work digging ditches.</span> <span id="s1062">Okay.</span> <span id="s1063">Was digging ditches.</span> <span id="s1064">Across from me, where I was standing in this hole, everybody had his hole.</span> <span id="s1065">It was hard, winter, the, the ground was so hard you, took you how many hours to cut up a piece of ground because it was frozen.</span> <span id="s1066">We were standing there digging, digging, digging, digging.</span> <span id="s1067">Across the street was a house, and a woman was sitting in the window, was there like this looking out.</span> <span id="s1068">Just like that.</span> <span id="s1069">I worked there, I don't know how many days, 4-5 days, every day, come home, we used to wear those wooden shoes, when you used to go on the snow the wooden shoes become taller and taller and taller because the snow stick to it, and you couldn't walk, frozen legs, open wounds in the leg.</span> <span id="s1070">Nobody paid attention.</span> <span id="s1071">Lice, that big.</span> <span id="s1072">Terrible!</span> <span id="s1073">I mean, no food, hungry.</span> <span id="s1074">One day in the morning, when they brought us to work in the morning, who can remember the time, who had the time.</span> <span id="s1075">Winter cold.</span> <span id="s1076">I jumped into my place where I used to work, you know, I had my uh shovel and my pick there, I look in the side of the hole, was a cut up a little -------- was a carrot there, a potato, a spool of thread and a needle.</span> <span id="s1077">You know what a needle and thread was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1078">Gold.</span> <span id="s1079">You could sew up things.</span> <span id="s1080">You could do something with it.</span> <span id="s1081">This woman, she put it there for me.</span> <span id="s1082">Okay.</span> <span id="s1083">A carrot and a potato.</span> <span id="s1084">Oh my god.</span> <span id="s1085">It was something.</span> <span id="s1086">The same day in the afternoon, she comes out and she says to the guard, she needs somebody to help her to chop the wood for her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">You have to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Oh they have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">She show, she, uh, she told him she needs a, she needs somebody to chop her wood for her house.</span> <span id="s1092">So she has to pick one, so she picked me.</span> <span id="s1093">So she picked me out, I went over there to her house, we go, we go in the back to chop wood.</span> <span id="s1094">After the guard went out from her backyard, she called me into the house.</span> <span id="s1095">I walked into the house, she had, a tub of water, hot water.</span> <span id="s1096">She told me to strip, she put me in the hot tub of water.</span> <span id="s1097">She shaved me, my hair off, lice are that big on my body.</span> <span id="s1098">She cleaned me up, washed me up.</span> <span id="s1099">Had open wounds on my feet which I have still signs, you know, what from the freeze, open wound.</span> <span id="s1100">She put some, something, ointment some kind on my feet, bandage it for me, and told me to sit here, not to worry about the wood.</span> <span id="s1101">She fed me, gave me thing.</span> <span id="s1102">When the time comes to go back to the camp, I just walked out of there like I did my day's work, she fed me, and I went back to the camp, I came home I told Fr--the guys you know, this little Herbie, and another friend of mine how lucky I am, what happened to me here.</span> <span id="s1103">This was going on for 3 days.</span> <span id="s1104">The happiest days, I didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1105">Washed myself every day.</span> <span id="s1106">She gave, I asked her where she, she what her husband, and she told me her husband is on the Russian front, he's from German descent, and she showed me 2 children.</span> <span id="s1107">You see, those children not from my husband.</span> <span id="s1108">They came they sent me to Berlin to a studhouse, and I got pregnant there from those 2 kids.</span> <span id="s1109">She had 2 children from a studhouse in Germany.</span> <span id="s1110">From, from soldiers.</span> <span id="s1111">What she told me, is what I'm telling, what I'm telling you.</span> <span id="s1112">The German soldier, the guard came in the other day, he came in after 3 days later, I don't know what they want from her, maybe he wants some sex whatever he wants from her.</span> <span id="s1113">He got very mad, he took me out of the house, beat the hell out of me, I don't what's my fault, whatever it was there, and I got back in there, in the dump there, and I worked there another few days, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1114">Finally, when the Russians started come closer, they took us out, and they send us on a transport.</span> <span id="s1115">We walked, I don't how many days we walked.</span> <span id="s1116">Hundreds of our people died on the road because if you don't go on line, you step out of line, they kill you, they shot you.</span> <span id="s1117">So we had 4 guys, little Herbie, holding arms, and we used to walk together.</span> <span id="s1118">Didn't eat for days.</span> <span id="s1119">Some of the guards got tired themselves, so once in a while they used to tell us to stop in the forest and to lay down.</span> <span id="s1120">Just to lay down, not to get up.</span> <span id="s1121">Anybody gets up gets shot.</span> <span id="s1122">So we used to lay down in the forest, at least rest a few hours.</span> <span id="s1123">One day we came across, this was in Czechoslovakia, but I want to tell you about Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1124">Flossenburg was murder.</span> <span id="s1125">They came into Czechoslovakia, to a barn on the way, okay?</span> <span id="s1126">Big barn.</span> <span id="s1127">And they took us all into this barn, the ones that left, maybe 600 of us was left from 2,000 or whatever, everyone was dead on the road, killed.</span> <span id="s1128">Tired, hungry, you know, didn't eat for days, they used to throw ----------.</span> <span id="s1129">One day we were walking was a, on the side road, the farmers took off some uh like, it was not watermelon, it's a yellow like banana, you know a yellow fruit, was mashed up, and we saw it from far out, was laying there, so everybody starts running to this pile of food, and we fell on it, and the German was there laughing, he said, "Look at those animals."</span> <span id="s1130">We are the animals.</span> <span id="s1131">We are the animals.</span> <span id="s1132">Next day we pass by a little city marching, half dead, hardly could walk.</span> <span id="s1133">People used to, children from school used to throw stones on us, and tell us "-------------------------------."</span> <span id="s1134">We're the Jews, did it for that.</span> <span id="s1135">We are the fault.</span> <span id="s1136">We are the fault.</span> <span id="s1137">I told, I, that we are the fault for them, what's happ-what's happening to them.</span> <span id="s1138">They used to spit on us, actually spit on us.</span> <span id="s1139">Children, men, women.</span> <span id="s1140">When we came, when we went through there, we came to this barn.</span> <span id="s1141">And the garliecht???</span> <span id="s1142">I mean the the garleicht, whoever, in the, the fuehrer from the, the, the, the head of the transport, he had orders to get rid of us, one, one way or the other, Okay?</span> <span id="s1143">So we got into this big barn.</span> <span id="s1144">They supposed to put us in into the barn, and put the barn on fire, okay?</span> <span id="s1145">Since the farm belonged to a Czech, the Czech was begging this this guy, this fuehrer, not to do it, that's all he has is the barn, if he wants to kill them, kill us, let's take us out somewhere and kill us, not to kill us, okay?</span> <span id="s1146">Herbie spoke Czechoslovakian, this little boy.</span> <span id="s1147">The farmer took a liking to him, and he took him out, and he, Herbie was running between, finally the farmer begged the, the German guard to let him cook some potatoes for us, boiled potatoes, so at least we eat something because we didn't eat for days.</span> <span id="s1148">They cooked up a lot of potatoes, and Herbie was running between the barn, between the house, and the shack, goes back and forth, he could go in and out, little Herbie, I wish I could find him.</span> <span id="s1149">Herbie, so he brought me hot potatoes.</span> <span id="s1150">You know, hurry, swallow, eat, eat, eat.</span> <span id="s1151">So he gave it to me, he said, and, in the barn, in this barn was a place for pigs, was 3, 4 pigs in there, okay?</span> <span id="s1152">In this barn.</span> <span id="s1153">And was a lot of straw there, you know, this and that landing.</span> <span id="s1154">I said, "Herbie, you're not, from here, you're not going with us anymore.</span> <span id="s1155">You have to stay here." "</span> <span id="s1156">---------, I cannot leave you, I want to go with you."</span> <span id="s1157">I said, "You're not going with me."</span> <span id="s1158">I'm just telling you I had a lot of problems with this child on the road.</span> <span id="s1159">He got sick, I had to cut his finger off because the blood uh, going up his arm, you know, it's very bad.</span> <span id="s1160">So he, I said, "You're not going with me."</span> <span id="s1161">I said, "Listen Herbie, this Czechoslovakian guy, this farmer likes you.</span> <span id="s1162">And you have a chance.</span> <span id="s1163">Stay here."</span> <span id="s1164">"No, I'm not going to stay here.</span> <span id="s1165">I want to go with you," and this and that.</span> <span id="s1166">One day being in camp, he, this little child 10 years old, he asked me, "Smulo," he calls, called me Smulo.</span> <span id="s1167">He said, "Smulo, what is a Jew?</span> <span id="s1168">Why am I here?"</span> <span id="s1169">10 year old child.</span> <span id="s1170">I said to him, "Because you're circumcised, you're born Jewish."</span> <span id="s1171">He said, "I'm not circumcised," and I said, "You are.</span> <span id="s1172">You're circumcised, you're a Jew."</span> <span id="s1173">He said, "This is the reason why I'm here?</span> <span id="s1174">This is the reason why they killed my parents?"</span> <span id="s1175">Ten year old child.</span> <span id="s1176">So, the day we had to leave there, in the early in the morning, I grabbed him, and I throw him in there with the, between the pigs, and I covered him up with straw.</span> <span id="s1177">He was hollering, "Smulo, I want to go with you."</span> <span id="s1178">I said, "You're not going with me.</span> <span id="s1179">You're staying right here because I gonna kill you myself.</span> <span id="s1180">I left him there, and we walked away, and I hope he's alive.</span> <span id="s1181">I hope he's somewhere.</span> <span id="s1182">From there, when I left there, we came to a camp Flossenburg, which, it's hard for me to talk about this camp, very hard.</span> <span id="s1183">I just cannot tell you to what's going, what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1184">This camp was so bad, and you had 3 types of people there.</span> <span id="s1185">In some concentration camps, you walked in, the Kapos were people with the bad, you know this triangle, red triangle, that triangle was a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s1186">Okay?</span> <span id="s1187">A green triangle was a, a, a crime, so, if somebody was committed a crime in the concentration camp, all right?</span> <span id="s1188">A blue triangle what they was wearing, was a homosexual, okay?</span> <span id="s1189">The Jewish people had a red triangle with a J, with a yellow on top, means he's a Jew, political prisoner, all right?</span> <span id="s1190">When I came into Flossenburg, the head of the camp, the Kapos and the Blockeldester wore all blue triangles, homosexuals.</span> <span id="s1191">Was I did not know about homosexualism, all right?</span> <span id="s1192">In Europe, we didn't hear about homosexual, we talked, used to, somebody who was like this, you ---------------- in the room, whatever it is, we used to call them --------------, ---------------, something, some names.</span> <span id="s1193">I did not understand what this all about.</span> <span id="s1194">I had seen what's happening there, how they picked those boys up, those homosexuals, and I, matter of fact, they killed them.</span> <span id="s1195">A guy by the name Loport, and the, the, the blockeldester, the head of the barrack was a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s1196">When we killed him, he he gave us everybody an extra bowl of soup because we killed someone.</span> <span id="s1197">In Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1198">Flossenburg was bad, I was there only 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s1199">From there they put me on a train.</span> <span id="s1200">Now you can imagine, they put you on a train, hundred people in a car, okay, out from Flossenburg, the, on a transport.</span> <span id="s1201">Some went to Buchenwald, some went I don't know.</span> <span id="s1202">I supposed to go somewhere to a camp.</span> <span id="s1203">They take out from our camp what you don't eat for days, you don't eat for 2, 3 days, they gave you one, every evening a little bowl of soup, all day long, you are standing outside, and shivering, this was in January already, 1945 mind you.</span> <span id="s1204">What half of the country was already liberated somewhere.</span> <span id="s1205">We're still there.</span> <span id="s1206">They took us in the train.</span> <span id="s1207">It was, pulled us, and I don't know how many of us they pulled, through the, the train.</span> <span id="s1208">We got in the train.</span> <span id="s1209">In the evening, before we start, trains are moving, they open up the train, they throw in 6 loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s1210">You can imagine 6 loaves of bread for 100 people, half of whom were dead before they grabbed a piece.</span> <span id="s1211">Okay?</span> <span id="s1212">We were travelling and travelling and travelling in this train for days.</span> <span id="s1213">Finally we went, came in, I don't know how many people we were, we got in the train about 60, I think about 40 or 50 died, so what could one do with the, took the bodies, and put them against the wall, and were sitting on them, dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1214">Okay?</span> <span id="s1215">And the cars...</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Oh my god.</span> <span id="s1218">I'm going to make a whole movie with you guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Change film, camera roll 10 is up, Sync take 10 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">We stacked up the bodies on the side of the train, on the walls, we were sitting on it.</span> <span id="s1221">Finally, we came into the city of Prague.</span> <span id="s1222">Was a lot of trains on the railroad tracks, -----------, you could see German soldiers on this track, there were civilians this track, and our track was in the middle.</span> <span id="s1223">So they gave us orders to take out the bodies from each car, and put them all of the dead bodies on that, on the last car on the train, all right?</span> <span id="s1224">We ourselves were half dead.</span> <span id="s1225">Everybody was black and blue and, and weak.</span> <span id="s1226">They gave us blankets, and pack each body in a blanket and carry to the last car.</span> <span id="s1227">So, they opened up the car because smelled badly from the bodies, and, so, you know, so we took, we start carrying the bodies, little by little, you know whatever, we got 4 people, one body, throw it in the back car, come back, take another body.</span> <span id="s1228">All of the sudden, there was a bridge up there you know, the train was on top of the bridge, and people were passing by there.</span> <span id="s1229">All of the sudden a lot of people stood up there, and they start hollering in Czech, mordetza, murderers, you know, to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1230">Mordetzi, mordetzi!</span> <span id="s1231">They tried to throw stones, and throw, they threw oranges, potatoes, so we can grab it we start to grab it, the Germans hit it.</span> <span id="s1232">So the Germans was afraid something might happen here.</span> <span id="s1233">All right?</span> <span id="s1234">So forget about the dead bodies, they load the trains up, pack us again, beat the hell out of us, and train took off.</span> <span id="s1235">Took off, we came to a camp not far away from Munich, they called Middendorf.</span> <span id="s1236">I got into Middendorf.</span> <span id="s1237">Those barracks underground.</span> <span id="s1238">Okay, was like potatoes uh shacks you know.</span> <span id="s1239">The barracks was underground.</span> <span id="s1240">60 people to a barrack.</span> <span id="s1241">We had Russians there, Jews, all the kind of people in the camp.</span> <span id="s1242">Then, the stat, Middendorf was located not far away from Munich, all trains had to go through there, and the American had a ball there, the American and the English had a ball.</span> <span id="s1243">The English used to bomb us at nighttime, and the Americans used to bomb us in daytime.</span> <span id="s1244">And we had to go, every time they bomb, we had to through there, so we used to go there all the time, they took us out to repair, to repair.</span> <span id="s1245">But this was already March, 1945.</span> <span id="s1246">March 45.</span> <span id="s1247">So we used to go to that place, sometimes they blew up some trains, and all of the sudden you could find the civilian people, this was a place they used to bomb time and time again, okay?</span> <span id="s1248">In the morning, when I used to go, like to go there to work because I could find a lot of food, all right.</span> <span id="s1249">Next to the railroad station there was a civilian kitchen, all right?</span> <span id="s1250">The civilian kitchen, well, there you have Ukrainians there, Polish, I don't know, French people, what they work with the Germans, and they had their own kitchen.</span> <span id="s1251">A bomb fell in, there was a big crater from a bomb, and they used this crater for a dump, they used to throw in potatoes and this and that you know, and we used to walk every time, every time, we hear the sirens, an alarm, that airplanes are coming, we used to run and hide.</span> <span id="s1252">I used to run to this hole with 2, 3 other guys because we find a lot of food there, we had potatoes, peelings, this and that, was a good, you know, a good place to hide, the bombs were falling.</span> <span id="s1253">One day in the morning, we used to get up 4 o clock in the morning, they said, railroad commando.</span> <span id="s1254">So, everybody knew about railroad commando, it's easy, we can find food there, so everybody tried to get into railroad commando.</span> <span id="s1255">So I got in because put myself in the line, he counted up 20 people, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you know 5, 4 people.</span> <span id="s1256">I was in the last line, hits me over the head, he throws me, he tells me not to go.</span> <span id="s1257">He pushes me, the German, "-----------------," me and my friend run back, stay back in line.</span> <span id="s1258">Then other guys ----------------- finally counts up another time, beat the hell out of me again, I cannot go, so I said to my friend, "I'm not going.</span> <span id="s1259">I don't want to get killed.</span> <span id="s1260">----------------------let me go work somewhere else, --------.</span> <span id="s1261">You know, if it's predicted, if it's written up that you're going to live, you're going to live.</span> <span id="s1262">You know, the same day, some guys ---------------, the siren were blowing, a few people, 3, 3 guys got in this hole to find some food, a bomb fell in the same place and they all died.</span> <span id="s1263">Goes to show you, if I would go there, I probably wouldn't be around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Let me ask you, you started to talk at one point about the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">And you never finished what you were going to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">About the gypsies?</span> <span id="s1268">One night, one night before the transport from this Lodz ghetto came in, they clean up the camp, and they burn all the gypsies in one night, the children, the wives, and the woman, children, everybody else.</span> <span id="s1269">In one night.</span> <span id="s1270">This is the time, I ask what happened to the Gypsies because we saw them playing with the kids, you know, across the, the, the in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1271">They all gone, they all were burned in one night.</span> <span id="s1272">I don't know how many thousands of them.</span> <span id="s1273">Several thousand.</span> <span id="s1274">I don't know how many thousand.</span> <span id="s1275">There some people say 20,000, 18,000, 15 --I don't know, I don't know the exact figure.</span> <span id="s1276">I know was a lot of gypsies there.</span> <span id="s1277">And they called it the gypsy camp because the gypsies were there.</span> <span id="s1278">And we moved into this camp because the camp was cleaned up, they burned them all up, they killed them all.</span> <span id="s1279">So we moved to live in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">When you were in any of the camps, did you try to do any acts of sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">What we tried to do was impossible.</span> <span id="s1282">We did some sabotage, we worked in a camp, was there in a camp a few, not long, about 2 or 3 weeks, with the Russians, so the Russians did a lot of sabotage.</span> <span id="s1283">They used to make airplanes there.</span> <span id="s1284">So we , they used to make some holes into to put it some screws in it, so the, when he, it was marked where to make the holes.</span> <span id="s1285">The Russians used to tell us, "Don't make the hole here, make the hole here, Don't make the hole here."</span> <span id="s1286">This what we used to do as possible we could, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1287">Lot of guys got killed, a lot of Germans got killed for it, because I don't know, some of the planes never took off because was all, it was, by the end of the war, I mean, you know, I think it was January or February or something like that in in uh 45 already, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">What about spiritual or mental resistance.</span> <span id="s1289">Did that play a big role?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">It, it did play a big role.</span> <span id="s1291">Spiritually, you didnâ€™t want to give them a chance to kill you.</span> <span id="s1292">You always was thinking the moment when you're gonna liberated.</span> <span id="s1293">And they put you in a point that you could not do anything because you was always hungry.</span> <span id="s1294">You know what kind of dreams you have in camp?</span> <span id="s1295">The only dreams you have to find a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1296">That's all you were dreaming of.</span> <span id="s1297">You did, didn't think about anything else.</span> <span id="s1298">You didn't care if they used to carry the soup through the block, and you ran after it to grab a little food.</span> <span id="s1299">You didn't care if you're gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s1300">The only thing you care is have something to eat.</span> <span id="s1301">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s1302">They put you in such a state of mind that you don't think about anything else but...Then you have some religious Jews who were sitting there, ---------------- are praying to God.</span> <span id="s1303">God will help.</span> <span id="s1304">God will do this.</span> <span id="s1305">God will do that.</span> <span id="s1306">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1307">This was the life.</span> <span id="s1308">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s1309">How could you do anything if you're always hungry?</span> <span id="s1310">In the ghettoes, when you had a chance to do something, I give you an example, in the ghetto, then you had a whole generation that didn't allow you to do because there was always, always, they were always afraid to every Jew because you're gonna do something.</span> <span id="s1311">If you kill, if you kill a German, let's say we did kill a German, they took out 10 or 15 other people and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1312">You understand what they did?</span> <span id="s1313">So the Jewish people, all the generations, like my father, he said to me, "Take out the gun from the house, if you do, you're going to bring a disaster for the whole ghetto if they catch you here."</span> <span id="s1314">You understand the mentality.</span> <span id="s1315">The mentality of the people, and the closeness of the families.</span> <span id="s1316">The people were so close, big young people, some of them did leave their families, they went to Russia, they went to the Partisans, they went to the Underground, and some young people didn't want to leave their families.</span> <span id="s1317">Was a family tie.</span> <span id="s1318">And we were raised.</span> <span id="s1319">Let's say, we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1320">Give you an example liberate--how many Jewish people you find what they kill Germans after the war?</span> <span id="s1321">Well, now, if I gonna do that, I gonna be the same like them.</span> <span id="s1322">If I will kill Germans after the war, and I had a chance when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1323">Could grab a gun go around and kill every one of I see on the street.</span> <span id="s1324">So where it puts me then?</span> <span id="s1325">Puts me?</span> <span id="s1326">Puts me in the same position, right?</span> <span id="s1327">I'm a killer.</span> <span id="s1328">It's my enemy's-----, it's not my enemy anymore, and maybe I kill somebody who is innocent.</span> <span id="s1329">They didn't care, I shouldn't care?</span> <span id="s1330">I'm a human being, they're animals, I'm not.</span> <span id="s1331">I am raised this way.</span> <span id="s1332">I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1333">I am raised different.</span> <span id="s1334">I, you should not kill.</span> <span id="s1335">You should not murder.</span> <span id="s1336">We live by our rules.</span> <span id="s1337">Show me.</span> <span id="s1338">Bring me some people what they say they killed Germans after the war.</span> <span id="s1339">Jewish people were liberated from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1340">Maybe you find someone.</span> <span id="s1341">I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s1342">I have seen Russian did it.</span> <span id="s1343">Who came with me.</span> <span id="s1344">I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1345">And I had a chance.</span> <span id="s1346">They capartmentured my guard from my camp when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1347">They put him down on the side on a, on a house, and they had numbers on it.</span> <span id="s1348">An American soldier gave me his gun, he said, "Kill him."</span> <span id="s1349">I could have done it.</span> <span id="s1350">Easy.</span> <span id="s1351">I'm not a killer.</span> <span id="s1352">Can't kill.</span> <span id="s1353">Why should I?</span> <span id="s1354">If I kill, I'm just like them.</span> <span id="s1355">After that when I came out from Middendorf, they put us on a train.</span> <span id="s1356">We were travelling for a few days, and all of the sudden the train stopped, and the guard, the fuehrer from the train, the, the, the, commander from the train, he said, "You all are free."</span> <span id="s1357">Okay?</span> <span id="s1358">Told us we're free.</span> <span id="s1359">So, you're free, you're free, you walk out right?</span> <span id="s1360">So we walked out.</span> <span id="s1361">And I walked in the fields and I said to my friends who was with me all this time, I said, "Something is fishy here, we have to watch it out."</span> <span id="s1362">He said, "What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s1363">He told you you're free."</span> <span id="s1364">I said, "You want to see if we're free?"</span> <span id="s1365">I said, "Yeah, I want to see, how free are you?"</span> <span id="s1366">A German soldier is walking this way, he walked over to him, he said, "Ay, can I have a cigarette?"</span> <span id="s1367">He said, "Yeah," gave him a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1368">Gave him a light, and he was wearing the striped suit.</span> <span id="s1369">I said, "I think you're right.</span> <span id="s1370">I still don't believe it."</span> <span id="s1371">So we got in a little, we saw there a little shack, you know, outside a house, were lot of lumber in there.</span> <span id="s1372">And so we got in there.</span> <span id="s1373">I said, "Let's wait here.</span> <span id="s1374">See what's happening."</span> <span id="s1375">Sure enough, maybe a half an hour later, I saw a German ger--a German uh Luftwasa, uh fliers.</span> <span id="s1376">They were capartmenturing our people, you know, from the train, they were shooting them in the back of the head, they kill them all.</span> <span id="s1377">I saw it with my own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Were you finished with your thought there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">About, the what I saw there?</span> <span id="s1381">No.</span> <span id="s1382">This was the time before uh I was a little, all I was saw that, don't, after that, we walked out, and we start walking because we saw it what's happening, I said, "Maybe we'll go back to the train.</span> <span id="s1383">So we start walking back to, we start walking on the street.</span> <span id="s1384">Some people were standing there in front of their houses and they said, "The Americans are not far away, why don't you come in and hide."</span> <span id="s1385">So we tried to walk in, in there, so they closed the door.</span> <span id="s1386">------------------.</span> <span id="s1387">So I saw some guys, old Germans, I don't know how they call them.</span> <span id="s1388">They had a name for them, they were Shutz--some kind of police, old guys with rifles walking around.</span> <span id="s1389">And capartmenturing us, they have a, they had a trail--uh, a tractor with a trailer behind it, and they told us to go on the trailer, and I said, "Where are you taking us.</span> <span id="s1390">They told us we're free."</span> <span id="s1391">He said, "Don't worry about it, you're going to be free in Tyrol.</span> <span id="s1392">Said, Tyrol, what is this about?</span> <span id="s1393">What are you talking about we're going to be free in Tyrol.</span> <span id="s1394">They're going to take us now to Tyrol.</span> <span id="s1395">After that I find out they already had graves digged in Tyrol to kill us all.</span> <span id="s1396">Okay?</span> <span id="s1397">So we came back to the train, and a lot of people of us was already back there.</span> <span id="s1398">A lot of them even didn't want to leave the train.</span> <span id="s1399">You see a lot of them had the instinct, they said, "No, we're gonna stay here, see what happens."</span> <span id="s1400">They were standing in the train.</span> <span id="s1401">We were standing there, when we came to the train, we, I saw a machine gun standing on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1402">Here a machine gun was standing right there, and a guy, an amer, a German soldier was laying there on the ground.</span> <span id="s1403">So this guy what I was with him, Ze--uh, Walig, he says to me, he was in the army before the war he was older than me.</span> <span id="s1404">He says to me, "If they tell you to run, run zig-zag, back and forth, and the first car you see open up, you jump.</span> <span id="s1405">You hear what I said?"</span> <span id="s1406">This what he says to me.</span> <span id="s1407">Sure enough, the German gives orders, "Lauten!"</span> <span id="s1408">Run.</span> <span id="s1409">So we start running and sure enough they start shooting, the first thing you know, Walig jumped into an open car, and he grabbed me by the hair, and he what he and he pulled me in there too.</span> <span id="s1410">Okay, was already dark in the evening.</span> <span id="s1411">We got into the car, they closed the doors, and we were laying there, this train start moving.</span> <span id="s1412">They took a lot of, 15, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, was a lot of noise outside.</span> <span id="s1413">Shooting outside whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1414">So he says to me, "Can you check my body, I'm not shot."</span> <span id="s1415">I said, "Okay," I checked him, he checked me.</span> <span id="s1416">No, we're all right.</span> <span id="s1417">Okay?</span> <span id="s1418">We're fine.</span> <span id="s1419">We're alive.</span> <span id="s1420">The train start moving.</span> <span id="s1421">We move I don't know how many days.</span> <span id="s1422">Without food, they don't let us out, we urinated, and I was starting hallucinating.</span> <span id="s1423">I was, didn't see anything already, I was halluc--had my wooden shoes, and I put them under my head.</span> <span id="s1424">Shoes was something what you watch for at all times, put it under my head and I was laying like this, and Wallach, friend of mine was waking me up, he said, "Don't sleep.</span> <span id="s1425">Don't sleep.</span> <span id="s1426">You're going to die.</span> <span id="s1427">Don't sleep."</span> <span id="s1428">All of the sudden I hear a commotion, airplanes are coming.</span> <span id="s1429">Two planes, American planes, they thought maybe it's a, it's a military ship, transport, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1430">They start shooting, we lost, I don't know how many hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1431">Two hours before the liberation, an hour before the liberation, they, they shot up the train.</span> <span id="s1432">There was one railroad track, one track going, you see, so they shot it up everything.</span> <span id="s1433">And then I, you hear commotions, and I was hallucinating, I was out.</span> <span id="s1434">I was completely, I was, didn't know what's going on, I had dreams about my father, about my mother, my sister, came back to me situations from before the war when I was acting, when I was going to dances, and I have seen everything so, so loud so fine, everything was so close, and I said to him, "Let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1435">Don't bother me.</span> <span id="s1436">Let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1437">Let me sleep."</span> <span id="s1438">So, I heard noised, a guy said, "Why don't you put on the, the striped suit on the top of the car if you can.</span> <span id="s1439">So through these little openings what they had, some of them took out the striped suit and throw on the top of the car.</span> <span id="s1440">So the next time the planes made a pass, they just passed and they didn't do anything, so they knew that this is prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1441">So one guy was, my friend looked out, and he saw the Red Cross are here, they're try to open up the cars, they try to give food, Red Cross, who cared about it, I was dreaming about my home, dreaming about my girls, dreaming about dancing, dreaming about everything, I have seen everything what was going on.</span> <span id="s1442">And the tra--I was laying next to the door because he told me to -------------because I always had a little air coming, and you know, a little to breathe.</span> <span id="s1443">I was laying my own vomit, my own urine, wet, diarrhea, everything what, what can happen.</span> <span id="s1444">So laying there, they tried to open up the door, and they couldn't open up the door.</span> <span id="s1445">My door they couldn't open up.</span> <span id="s1446">Finally everybody I could hear talking, the everybody, oh they're giving soup, they're giving bread, they're giving this and here I'm laying, I wish oh I have a little water, why don't they let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1447">Just let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1448">I just don't want nothing.</span> <span id="s1449">Let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1450">Finally the door opens up.</span> <span id="s1451">And I feel somebody is picking me up by my suit as they pulled me up.</span> <span id="s1452">Okay?</span> <span id="s1453">Then come to my mind.</span> <span id="s1454">He said Tyrol.</span> <span id="s1455">Tyrol, they're going to kill me.</span> <span id="s1456">They're going to kill me, I'm not going to let them kill me.</span> <span id="s1457">You know, my, my mind.</span> <span id="s1458">I'm not going to let them kill me.</span> <span id="s1459">Now after all this time, went through so much, they're going to kill me now?</span> <span id="s1460">No way, they're not going to kill me.</span> <span id="s1461">And I grabbed this shoe, and I felt the person who picked me up, and I hit him with this wooden shoe like this, (Pause).</span> <span id="s1462">The guy start crying, and he said, "I'm not going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1463">I'm an American.</span> <span id="s1464">I came to liberate you.</span> <span id="s1465">You're free.</span> <span id="s1466">Immediately they setted up a hospital there, that American Red Cross woman, probably American, I don't know, and they put us in, they washed us up and, and they clean us up whatever they could, they, they, they didn't feed us, they said, if we're gonna eat, we're gonna die.</span> <span id="s1467">We don't can eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">I want to ask you some other questions.</span> <span id="s1469">Tell me about how your friends and your support systems helped you stay alive in all those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">The people what the, let's say we had a group of 3 or 4 people.</span> <span id="s1471">Let's say we had a group in a camp.</span> <span id="s1472">If anybody organized something, you know what I'm talking about organizing?</span> <span id="s1473">Organizing a little food.</span> <span id="s1474">Organizing, stealing something.</span> <span id="s1475">We used to share this.</span> <span id="s1476">Okay.</span> <span id="s1477">So you had 3 or 4, let's say, my group had 3 of us.</span> <span id="s1478">If you, if, if I could go out to work now in a potato commando and bring home some, and bring back to the barracks potatoes, I used to share.</span> <span id="s1479">Okay?</span> <span id="s1480">And, and we used to talk always try to support each other by telling "Don't worry about it, we're living through.</span> <span id="s1481">---------the hell with them.</span> <span id="s1482">We're going to make it.</span> <span id="s1483">We're gonna make it.</span> <span id="s1484">They're not going to kill us."</span> <span id="s1485">You know, always try, and what I used to do myself, I used to go around tell jokes, I used to go around the blocks and sing.</span> <span id="s1486">I used to sing for the boys.</span> <span id="s1487">Old songs from the home to remind them about home.</span> <span id="s1488">I used to sing, I used to sing, they used to give me a piece of bread for it, somebody give me a little sugar for it.</span> <span id="s1489">I used to go around from block to block and sing with another guy.</span> <span id="s1490">You know, just sing.</span> <span id="s1491">-------------- Perform, telling jokes, make a comedy act, just to keep people going.</span> <span id="s1492">Make them happy.</span> <span id="s1493">We used to organize theaters of the, in the evening, reading, you know, they, just to forget about the horrors what's going on.</span> <span id="s1494">And some people could take it and some people could not.</span> <span id="s1495">Some people just gave it up.</span> <span id="s1496">Majority people gave it up.</span> <span id="s1497">They couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1498">People just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1499">Like I told you in Auschwitz, people just went on the wires.</span> <span id="s1500">Couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1501">Majority took it.</span> <span id="s1502">They died or they took it.</span> <span id="s1503">The dying pains????</span> <span id="s1504">, they're dying so they took it.</span> <span id="s1505">They got killed by Kapos, they got killed by Germans, they got killed, they got crippled, but they didn't want to give up.</span> <span id="s1506">They want to live.</span> <span id="s1507">I want to live.</span> <span id="s1508">I didn't want to give up.</span> <span id="s1509">I didn't want to give them a chance to kill me.</span> <span id="s1510">No way.</span> <span id="s1511">I had always this my mind.</span> <span id="s1512">The only thing what I always used to do, watch out to be beaten up because if a Kapo caught you and beat the hell out of you, you're a dead man.</span> <span id="s1513">You break your bones, you didn't have no hos--no place how to heal it, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1514">You know what I mean, you are crippled.</span> <span id="s1515">If you are crippled, you're dead.</span> <span id="s1516">You cannot work, what they gonna do?</span> <span id="s1517">So this is the main thing what I always used to watch out.</span> <span id="s1518">Not to get beating up by Kapo.</span> <span id="s1519">Kapo.</span> <span id="s1520">When I was liberated May the, April the 29th, 1945, the Third Army, the Tenth Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Describe Mengele for me.</span> <span id="s1522">You must have seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Oh yeah, I've seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Tell me about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">He was a dark haired guy.</span> <span id="s1526">He was uh, if you see him on the street walking, Mengele, if you see Mengele on the street, and you know he's a doctor, you put your life in his hands.</span> <span id="s1527">He was so mannered, good-looking person.</span> <span id="s1528">Okay?</span> <span id="s1529">One eye what I always can remember, one eye of his was going a little bit in the side, and he was limping, like limping on one leg.</span> <span id="s1530">Not limping, he was just, I don't know, just like something, walking not normal.</span> <span id="s1531">And he was very polite with a smile on his face, always smiling to people, always said thank you, danke sein, danke sein.</span> <span id="s1532">When I saw him working, I didn't see him working him in hospital, I saw him working on the ramp when he made a selection.</span> <span id="s1533">He always had 2 guys, 3 guys, never hollering, never nervous, always polite.</span> <span id="s1534">Did his job, took off his gloves, and went, that's all.</span> <span id="s1535">And then you could see after that, you could see the black wagon.</span> <span id="s1536">I used to call it the black wagon.</span> <span id="s1537">It used to come into the crematorium, used to step on a ladder, what I could see outside the ladder, was a little opening there, and throw in the ------------, whatever it was, and this is it.</span> <span id="s1538">When you saw this guy with this ------------, you knew that people are gone.</span> <span id="s1539">In the beginning I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1540">I saw it.</span> <span id="s1541">So, every time a transport came, after the transport, I, I saw Mengele, the head of the Lichmenstadt ghetto, a guy by the name of Runkosky, he was the head of the ghetto, all right?</span> <span id="s1542">I was working a Lodz transport, people came in from the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s1543">Okay, I open up a car, and I saw them.</span> <span id="s1544">Very distinguished looking people there, and I recognize him because I found in cars before, I found money with his picture, so I knew this is Runkosky, he had his own money, you know, in the ghetto, they had their own money, and his picture was on the money.</span> <span id="s1545">So, when I cleaned cars up, I saw this pic, this man's picture, when I saw him coming out from the car, brought him out from the car, he had, I don't know how many was there, about 12 or 15 policemen, his guys, you know, with the ------------, whatever, how many, it was not a big car with a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1546">So I remember he was wearing a black hat, a round hat, and a little boy next to him, and his wife, and he went over to Mengele.</span> <span id="s1547">He went over to Mengele, he said, looked for him, he said, "Ich bin--I am the head of the Lichmenstadt ghetto.</span> <span id="s1548">My name is Runkosky," whatever he said to him, I didn't, couldn't hear what he said, I could see he saluted for him, took out some papers, he show him, he said, "Ja, ja, ja, ja," whatever he said, ja, he smiled, this and that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Tell me how he walked up to Mengele -------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">He walked over to Mengele with his wife and his child, he walked on in, he presented himself, he said who he is, he's the head of the Lichmenstadt ghetto, which I recognized, had a beard, I recognized from the money what I found in the car.</span> <span id="s1552">And he said to him, say, whatever, he said, "Fine," he ask him, this I heard, he ask Mengele, " You have any more friends here, what we'd like to go with you?"</span> <span id="s1553">And he call a truck, you know, a military truck, what you can sit in the back, a small one, I never forget that, and he told him to go on the truck, and he said,"--------------------: You have somebody else here what would you with you to go with you?"</span> <span id="s1554">And he said "Yeah."</span> <span id="s1555">So he called another of his, you know, policemen and their wives, and everybody was so happy, they go on a truck you know, a nice -----------."</span> <span id="s1556">I said, "Oh my God.</span> <span id="s1557">Look at the way they're playing their game."</span> <span id="s1558">Threw them out the truck to ---------the first crematorium, crematorium 1 or 4, I don't remember, right by the railroad side.</span> <span id="s1559">The doors, the gates of the crematorium open up and they drove in there.</span> <span id="s1560">Was --------Rumkowski, the head of the Lodz ghetto, God of 200,000 Jews, a man who, who, who make you live or die, he thought he is, he is the man.</span> <span id="s1561">See, this what happened.</span> <span id="s1562">People.</span> <span id="s1563">He thought Rumkowski, with the policemen, that came in those boots with those hats, the -------- from the ghetto, they're going to make it up big.</span> <span id="s1564">You have to go to the oven, you went to the oven, that's all.</span> <span id="s1565">If he didn't went to the oven, he was a bad policeman for example, he did some harm in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1566">In the camp some people find out about him, they kill him.</span> <span id="s1567">Because in Buchenwald, I was not there.</span> <span id="s1568">I heard from people who were there, they had their own trials, in Buchenwald, they had their own trial.</span> <span id="s1569">If you came into Buchenwald, they find out you are a policeman in a ghetto, like I know from my hometown people died there.</span> <span id="s1570">They were bad policemen.</span> <span id="s1571">They were, what do you call them, stool pigeons.</span> <span id="s1572">They used to tell the Germans where people hide something or this or that.</span> <span id="s1573">They kill them.</span> <span id="s1574">They, yeah, they told them, you have to die tomorrow, you die, that's it, there's no monkey business.</span> <span id="s1575">So what did I, what did the people accomplish by working, some of them like to work with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1576">They didn't work with them, they try, in this time, in this day, in this year, he thought he gonna save his life.</span> <span id="s1577">Okay, otherwise he probably wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1578">Whatever he did, a guy became a policeman, a guy became a Zonder, a guy became, in the ghettos I'm talking about, not, in camp you didn't have no choice.</span> <span id="s1579">This is it.</span> <span id="s1580">Back in the ghetto, people thought by doing some of those things maybe will help them and their family.</span> <span id="s1581">Maybe they will survive.</span> <span id="s1582">We already knew it bad things was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Let's talk about choices, and you had very few choices in camp, but you made some that helped you survive.</span> <span id="s1584">What about the guards and the Kapos and the Germans?</span> <span id="s1585">What kind of choices did they have?</span> <span id="s1586">Were they following orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">The Kapos, you find a German soldier what he was very nice.</span> <span id="s1588">He did maybe, like the guy who tried --------------------, he could go after me and find me, all right, he could find me, maybe he didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s1589">I came across German guards in Sudeten Deutschland, in Kalfaser, when I was in this camp.</span> <span id="s1590">You have German older people, I'm not talking about the young fellow, I'm talking about the older guards, older guys, maybe they were afraid to go to the Russian front, maybe they ----------, I don't know, I know when they came into the tailor shop, let's say he needs to put on a button for him, okay.</span> <span id="s1591">And the tailor put on a button for him.</span> <span id="s1592">He used to give him 5 or 6 cigarettes, or he used to bring a piece of bread, or he used to bring a little sugar or he used bring a piece of a butter, so you cannot judge.</span> <span id="s1593">The Ukrainian were bad, for them was nothing.</span> <span id="s1594">For them, to kill a Jew was, this is it.</span> <span id="s1595">Between the Germans, I'm not talking about SS, I'm not talking about Gestapo, you know what I'm saying, this was the elite, this was the killers.</span> <span id="s1596">I'm talking about the average German, who was a soldier, he was in the Wehrrmacht, they took him into the Wehrrmacht.</span> <span id="s1597">He is a soldier, he didn't want to kill the Jew.</span> <span id="s1598">He want to sit, he didn't, he was not interested in the Jew to kill.</span> <span id="s1599">The SS, the Gestapo, the Shutzpolizzi, the Geheinpolizzi, they're the ones, this was the elite who want to kill the Jew.</span> <span id="s1600">The average German Wehrrmacht soldier?</span> <span id="s1601">Whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1602">He was not interested, except that he was in the Nazi party, of course, they helped themselves, whatever might be the case.</span> <span id="s1603">This is mine opinion, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">How do all your experiences make you feel about humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Human people, humanity, people are still very good people.</span> <span id="s1606">Once in a while you came across some devils, people have to watch out, this is the reason maybe God let us live, to tell the world what happened, and things like this will never happen again.</span> <span id="s1607">Maybe this is the time to tell people.</span> <span id="s1608">You always have evil in the world, and human, human people, human are, hell, people are good people.</span> <span id="s1609">You cannot say everybody is bad.</span> <span id="s1610">People do a lot of bad things for different reasons, but you cannot take the whole world and say everybody is bad.</span> <span id="s1611">People are good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Now tell me about age and the selection.</span> <span id="s1613">Tell me how selections affected the families, how they affected the children, as though I don't know.</span> <span id="s1614">I don't know about the holocaust, I don't know about the transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">In camp?</span> <span id="s1616">If you walk into a camp as a mother with children, you 100% sure you going to the, to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1617">Okay?</span> <span id="s1618">If you pick, if you look at you, you're young enough, all right, with no children, you're going to the camp to work, all right.</span> <span id="s1619">If you survive there, we don't know, or you went to camp, you have a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s1620">If you're older than let's say, 50, forget it, you're a goner, no chance.</span> <span id="s1621">All right?</span> <span id="s1622">So these little children, 1 and a half million Jewish children died.</span> <span id="s1623">1 and a half million!</span> <span id="s1624">You know how many --------, how many musicians, how many engineers, how many doctors, how many physicians, how many big people died, 1500, 1 and a half million for nothing.</span> <span id="s1625">A whole generation.</span> <span id="s1626">6 million Jews alone and 20 million other people not just Jews.</span> <span id="s1627">You have 15 million other nationalities died.</span> <span id="s1628">I'm not talking from war.</span> <span id="s1629">I'm not talking about fighting.</span> <span id="s1630">I'm not talking about soldiers.</span> <span id="s1631">I'm talking about civilians, died for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1632">One was a Catholic, one was a Jew, one, one was this, whatever might be the case, got killed.</span> <span id="s1633">So you talking how I feel about humanity.</span> <span id="s1634">People are nice people.</span> <span id="s1635">You have plenty of bad people, you have people what they used to hide other people.</span> <span id="s1636">You have people who would hide people as long the people had the money.</span> <span id="s1637">If they didn't have the money, they throw them out.</span> <span id="s1638">So you have all the kinds of animals in the world.</span> <span id="s1639">To take the humanity as a whole, the people are bad, no, I cannot say that.</span> <span id="s1640">People are people, people are very nice.</span> <span id="s1641">If you treat them nice of course.</span> <span id="s1642">They treat me bad, and I will be, become an animal.</span> <span id="s1643">So?</span> <span id="s1644">I could be as bad.</span> <span id="s1645">And now today if you find people like my people, like take people what they say, "No, we're not going to allow this ever happen, we do some things what we don't want it to happen."</span> <span id="s1646">It's, listen this is our way of life, we can't, we have to protect ourselves, we cannot allow things like this ever happen again.</span> <span id="s1647">That's all there is to it.</span> <span id="s1648">This is not just for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1649">For every nationality.</span> <span id="s1650">Everybody in the world have the right to live.</span> <span id="s1651">Nobody has the right to kill, annihilate other people because they are a different religion or different race, or they look different, or they talk different.</span> <span id="s1652">Nobody has this right.</span> <span id="s1653">We all have the right to be here.</span> <span id="s1654">Heil Hitler came.</span> <span id="s1655">This is the biggest thing ever happen ------------ world exist.</span> <span id="s1656">We had pogroms, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1657">We had all the kind of Nazism in the century, ------------- in England???</span> <span id="s1658">in the ghettos, people, ghettos existed, first ghettos was in England.</span> <span id="s1659">Had big ghettos.</span> <span id="s1660">People lived in ghettos.</span> <span id="s1661">Ev-Everybody hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s1662">Oh this what he did!</span> <span id="s1663">You know how many of all the Jews they killed?</span> <span id="s1664">Nobody does what he did.</span> <span id="s1665">Nobody in the history.</span> <span id="s1666">People died.</span> <span id="s1667">Nobody did what Hitler did.</span> <span id="s1668">The Juden frager, they called, the Jewish question, what are you going to do with the Jews.</span> <span id="s1669">What are the Jews a pain in his back?</span> <span id="s1670">What is it.</span> <span id="s1671">Why, because the Jew had a beard?</span> <span id="s1672">The Jew believed in God?</span> <span id="s1673">The Jew didn't bother nobody.</span> <span id="s1674">The Jew were happy if you leave them alone, that's all.</span> <span id="s1675">It was going his way.</span> <span id="s1676">Ah, the Jew were a little smarter in Europe, he made a little bit better living maybe some of them did?</span> <span id="s1677">The majority people had hunger.</span> <span id="s1678">Was a tough life.</span> <span id="s1679">3 million Jewish people died from Poland alone.</span> <span id="s1680">Poland had 33 and a half million Jews.</span> <span id="s1681">3 million Jews died in Poland.</span> <span id="s1682">For nothing.</span> <span id="s1683">For what reason?</span> <span id="s1684">Because they're Jews?</span> <span id="s1685">Because they went, they, they were wearing their long clothes.</span> <span id="s1686">They were businessmen, people.</span> <span id="s1687">Who made the business, they made it, they didn't allow us to have land, we couldn't work in mental, in, in governmental offices.</span> <span id="s1688">Couldn't.</span> <span id="s1689">We couldn't work on the railroad, we couldn't work on the streetcar.</span> <span id="s1690">So we had to do something.</span> <span id="s1691">Right?</span> <span id="s1692">So, ---------small business people.</span> <span id="s1693">Little Pop and Mama stores, we used to tailors, we shoemakers and, and roofers, and all kind of professions to in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1694">They blame us?</span> <span id="s1695">For their mishap?</span> <span id="s1696">Why?</span> <span id="s1697">Why?</span> <span id="s1698">It's not our fault.</span> <span id="s1699">Is it my fault they don't let you work the land?</span> <span id="s1700">Because I'm a Jew, I cannot own land.</span> <span id="s1701">Some Jewish people want land.</span> <span id="s1702">How many?</span> <span id="s1703">More than a thousand.</span> <span id="s1704">How many?</span> <span id="s1705">If they own a little piece of land in the house where you lived, so what, what are they gonna do with it?</span> <span id="s1706">But to be a actually a farmer, do something, no.</span> <span id="s1707">So they blame the Jews.</span> <span id="s1708">No, but thanks.</span> <span id="s1709">Blame the Jews, the Jew is the first one to go.</span> <span id="s1710">Everybody blames the Jews because the Jews this the Jews that, a Jew doesn't look good to them so what can you do?</span> <span id="s1711">------------your face, they want to put on a new face?</span> <span id="s1712">Because you don't like my face?</span> <span id="s1713">What did I do to you?</span> <span id="s1714">What did I do to anybody?</span> <span id="s1715">I hope this is the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Yes, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">This is it?</span> <span id="s1718">How did I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">The following is 30 seconds of room tone for interview with
