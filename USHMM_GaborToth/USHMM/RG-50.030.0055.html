outskirts of Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Ralph, would you tell me about your parents and about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Well, we were an average family in Lithuania before the war and...uh...my father, mother and a brother.</span> <span id="s19">I had a brother who was 7 years older than I was.</span> <span id="s20">And my father was in the …lumber business and lived there with his father, grandfather that I know oflived in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s21">Before that I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s23">What was your childhood like growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, it was a pretty happy childhood.</span> <span id="s25">I went to eider when I was about 6 years old, then at 7 I went to Hebrew gymnasium which is a high schoot until about…until I was about 10 years old.</span> <span id="s26">And then in 1940...</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Hold it one second.</span> <span id="s28">Before we get to 1940, tell me a little bit about...uh...the friends you had, the things you did during the day as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Well, it was...it was an average life.</span> <span id="s30">We had a..</span> <span id="s31">.</span> <span id="s32">we lived in a nice town.</span> <span id="s33">Panemon was a small community.</span> <span id="s34">It consisted of one long street with a few alleys.</span> <span id="s35">And it was the gateway to which were...were summer homet3 B for the people who lived in Kovno.</span> <span id="s36">They used to come over to spend their weekends in the woods and the forests where they had built summer homes.</span> <span id="s37">Also was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used to spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war.</span> <span id="s38">And then in 1940, when the Russians took over Lithuania.</span> <span id="s39">.</span> <span id="s40">*uh...we didn't have any more Hebrew schools and we had to go to Yiddish schools and that's when we started g ~ learning Yiddish.</span> <span id="s41">I think Hebrew was outlawed or something.</span> <span id="s42">And I studied there for 1 year in a different school until the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s43">And...well...uh...we could talk a little bit...uh...about that one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Ya.</span> <span id="s45">Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s46">Well, uh my father had to leave his business because uh you couldn't be a businessman under the Russian regime, and he tried to get a job several times and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved in politics.</span> <span id="s47">And being...having been in business before the war, it was a little difficult to get a job.</span> <span id="s48">So we kind of struggled through that year, but it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s49">We made it.</span> <span id="s50">And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all Hell broke loose, so to speak.</span> <span id="s51">Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s52">It was on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s53">And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for my...for the uniforms of my basketball team.</span> <span id="s54">I was about 14years and I was...at 4:00 in the morning when I was extremely tired I went to bed.</span> <span id="s55">And at 6:00 in the morning, I was woken and told that the Germany invaded Russia and they're going to be in our town any day, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives.</span> <span id="s56">So we had a horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s57">My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our belongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my brother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side.</span> <span id="s58">And we just started toward Russia.</span> <span id="s59">Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a day or so to get to a small town.</span> <span id="s60">I believe that town was where my father was born and I think it was named…I'm not really very sure.</span> <span id="s61">And that is when the Germans met us and the border was closed, and there was no need to go any further.</span> <span id="s62">So we walked into the first abandoned home we found, probably was a Jewish home, other people who ran away, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day.</span> <span id="s63">And in the meantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the doors, vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe.</span> <span id="s64">They were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s65">So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they asked...uh...what time it was.</span> <span id="s66">One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was.</span> <span id="s67">They said, "Well, give me that watch immediately."</span> <span id="s68">And my brother kind of resisted, so when the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed my brother's watch and just handed it over real fast.</span> <span id="s69">And this was our first introduction to the German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang around.</span> <span id="s70">There was no use to stay in that little town.</span> <span id="s71">We still had our horse, our wagon and some of our belongings and we headed back home back to Panemon, through Kovno.</span> <span id="s72">On the road, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where they intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped all of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge place it was on the road.</span> <span id="s73">And they just kept us there for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s74">We...we spent a few nights there I believe outside on the ground, sky.</span> <span id="s75">It wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s76">It wasn't cold...cold.</span> <span id="s77">It was summertime.</span> <span id="s78">And no...no one knew what the future's going to bring.</span> <span id="s79">But after that I remember...I believe that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family.</span> <span id="s80">Exactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the Seventh Fort in Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Tell us about the Seventh Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Well, the Seventh port was, I believe, an army base before the war.</span> <span id="s83">It may have been some kind of a military defense area or something like that, but it was pretty green...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women.</span> <span id="s84">Uh...I remember that my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my father on my one side, and my mother and I..</span> <span id="s85">.</span> <span id="s86">they took us in another area of the Seventh Fort.</span> <span id="s87">I was 11 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s88">And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of days...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I..</span> <span id="s89">.</span> <span id="s90">I remember that right before they took us to the Ninth Fort, and the Ninth Fort was a similar place as the Seventh Fort in Lithuania, they had given them an order to some of the younger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the women's side, and I..</span> <span id="s91">.</span> <span id="s92">someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or 16 could go to the women's side and my brother tried to go over.</span> <span id="s93">I don't know, he probably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do 60.</span> <span id="s94">And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older.</span> <span id="s95">Actually, he was 18.</span> <span id="s96">And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to…to…uh...his mother.</span> <span id="s97">And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there.</span> <span id="s98">All the men were shot, but my father was not there.</span> <span id="s99">This is another long story.</span> <span id="s100">My father was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army.</span> <span id="s101">I believe when Lithuania in 1916 or something like that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the country.</span> <span id="s102">And while Lithuania was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in certain prominent Close Lithuanian life.</span> <span id="s103">They were ...and they were honored many times.</span> <span id="s104">My father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it.</span> <span id="s105">Uh...So before they told all the youngsters or after to go to another side, to the women's side, they also announced that everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers.</span> <span id="s106">Every man who was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh., soldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of there.</span> <span id="s107">And indeed, they did.</span> <span id="s108">They took them to a different place, which was called the...the Yellow Prison.</span> <span id="s109">They called it the Yellow Prison in Kovno.</span> <span id="s110">And I know that my father was there.</span> <span id="s111">So at that time my father was not shot.</span> <span id="s112">It was only my brother and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s113">Then the…and....uh...my father was...uh...in that prison I remember.</span> <span id="s114">And later on when we were released from the Ninth Fort, after being there...uh...and...uh...my father came home one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that.</span> <span id="s115">He was in prison.</span> <span id="s116">And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go to see his family.</span> <span id="s117">He said, "Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back."</span> <span id="s118">And my father came to visit us.</span> <span id="s119">He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember that.</span> <span id="s120">She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good place.</span> <span id="s121">We knew about that.</span> <span id="s122">And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also.</span> <span id="s123">They were shot.</span> <span id="s124">We heard all kinds of stories.</span> <span id="s125">Who knows why?</span> <span id="s126">But, we really don't know why.</span> <span id="s127">We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were and respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s128">Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s129">They...when the orders came, they told the Jews have to leave their towns...their towns and homes and belongings.</span> <span id="s130">Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and move to that designated area around Kovno which was called the ghetto.</span> <span id="s131">And my mother and I..</span> <span id="s132">.</span> <span id="s133">we just took the things that we had.</span> <span id="s134">Couldn't...tried to exchange our home with some Lithuanians, but I guess we just were not successful.</span> <span id="s135">Some people did.</span> <span id="s136">Some people gave up big mansions for little homes, and...uh...they moved in there, but there was not enough room for everyone so they...people who had those homes took in their families, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing.</span> <span id="s137">I and my mother, we shared a room with a neighbor of ours who...uh…was...we were close before the war and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my brother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a room that they acquired somehow from some relatives or friends in one of those houses, and they took us in and we...shared one room, the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Can you...can you go back.</span> <span id="s139">You had told me before that while your father was in prison your mother had taken his papers and tried to do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s141">Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers…and his medals.</span> <span id="s142">And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of our encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by Lithuanian soldiers.</span> <span id="s143">And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning.</span> <span id="s144">I'm sure they gave all the orders.</span> <span id="s145">They were involved.</span> <span id="s146">But I we didn't see them.</span> <span id="s147">So we felt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday.</span> <span id="s148">She always kept them on her.</span> <span id="s149">Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about…</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: You had gone ahead and you are in the ghetto now?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes, I'm in the ghetto now.</span> <span id="s152">But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should back up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in, although we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a volunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some…for the Lithuanian Army...for the Lithuanian army before the war.</span> <span id="s153">And he was friendly with some...uh...people in high command.</span> <span id="s154">And he find out where we lived there a general who was I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they sent him to Siberia.</span> <span id="s155">And...and he had left his wife and children in our town, and my father knew them.</span> <span id="s156">And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some packages over there or even lumber to heat the homes because in Lithuania most of the homes were heated by lumber, good lumber.</span> <span id="s157">And he...he was quite friendly with them and tried to help that particular year.</span> <span id="s158">And right after the Germans occupied Lithuania right before the ghetto, we were sitting in this lady's house, Mrs. Mudrick was her name, and...uh...just talking about the future in the ghetto and things like that, where we're going to move homes or whatever and I..</span> <span id="s159">.</span> <span id="s160">I looked through the window.</span> <span id="s161">It, it was about two houses away from ours in Panemon, and I looked through the window and here was the General walking with his wife and was going back to their home in the...on the…They lived...they had a home in the outskirts of Panemon.</span> <span id="s162">And I kind of felt a great feeling because I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that Yellow prison that he was in.</span> <span id="s163">And I pointed her out to my mother, "Look who's walking by here.</span> <span id="s164">Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly.</span> <span id="s165">I'm sure he knows us.</span> <span id="s166">Especially…she knows us, and maybe they can do something," my mother went out real quick.</span> <span id="s167">I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like…they didn't even know us or pretended anyway.</span> <span id="s168">And...uh...she told them who we were and they nodded and she begged them to see if they’ll…can do something about releasing my father.</span> <span id="s169">But needless to t say, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s170">That is one incident that stayed with me.</span> <span id="s171">Uh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Tell us again which ghetto you were in and how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, from what I remember it was quite simple.</span> <span id="s174">We just walked or...or took a bus or something.</span> <span id="s175">I really don't remember exactly how we got there.</span> <span id="s176">Maybe on a wagon?</span> <span id="s177">No, I cannot.</span> <span id="s178">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s179">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s180">I know that we were there in 1941, and I was11 years old with my mother and she had arranged to live in that room with Mrs. Widrick and her daughter, Rita.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: You are not in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s182">You are in Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, Kaunas and Kovno is the same thing.</span> <span id="s184">Kaunas is in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s185">Uh, well, from the beginning, I remember there was Aktions.</span> <span id="s186">They called for 500 people, and they called four thousand people to work, and they called for all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s187">And some came back, some people didn't come back, but those things did...did not affect me personally because, as I said, you know, being young, you...you don't understand a lot of things.</span> <span id="s188">I 12 know...my...my mother used to go to work every day in a brigade.</span> <span id="s189">I don't remember exactly what she was doing and, but then we tried...we tried our best to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you see any of the roundups?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Uh...Not, not exactly.</span> <span id="s192">I seen a lot of roundups.</span> <span id="s193">I seen a lot of brigades going in and out, but...uh...there weren't...I could not distinguish between the ones who went and came back and the ones who went and didn't come back.</span> <span id="s194">Uh I was a go‑for when I was about 12, 13 years old, I became a go‑for for the administration in the ghetto…running around with papers, back and forth to offices…And...uh...I thought maybe...I really don't remember what I was thinking.</span> <span id="s195">I..</span> <span id="s196">.</span> <span id="s197">I was just doing what I was told to do, After…and…and that's it.</span> <span id="s198">When I was about 14 I believe, I started to work in a..</span> <span id="s199">.</span> <span id="s200">in a clay factory where weQ 5 * 2 used to manufacture pottery, clay...out of clay.</span> <span id="s201">And that factory was run by afamily of qenerations of...of pottery makers, and they were very experienced and dida very beautiful job.;5

also trying to help out with the clay, kneading clay and so on and so t forth.</span> <span id="s208">A a very important uh part of my life happened in that factory.</span> <span id="s209">When I worked there, I'm sure that's whenX the... F st of the people know about the children's aktionSwhich was the selection of the young children whomthey...they picked out from the ghetto and took to the Ninthb ffi rt and killed them all over there.</span> <span id="s210">As...as...uh...weheard, I was...the day they hAd that selection, I was at thepottery, at the ceramic factory.</span> <span id="s211">And I guess the boss orthe leader of that factory had heard that there's ata selection...they're rounding up all the children.</span> <span id="s212">Well, hewas kind of concerned about me...uh...and he said, "Well, wegonna...since they're rounding up children we're going to;:ao put you to work and make you look important.</span> <span id="s213">So let's seeif...what we can do about it."</span> <span id="s214">I don't know...I don't knowif I understood what was happening, what our destiny was,but he all of a sudden put me next to his old uncle who wast 9 @t the best pottery maker, a real artist, and he put me rightnext to him to knead...knead the clay to prepare the clay .</span> <span id="s215">.</span> <span id="s216">for him to put on that machine and he was making the pots and vases and things likethat.</span> <span id="s217">And I remember two~3 ;6tUkrainian soldiers walked in.</span> <span id="s218">They looked around.</span> <span id="s219">They didn't see any children untilthey spotted me.</span> <span id="s220">And they walked up to me and they said, "How old are you?"</span> <span id="s221">And 1 14 believe I said, "I was about 14."</span> <span id="s222">Maybe I was 15.</span> <span id="s223">Maybe I was 14."</span> <span id="s224">And onesaid to me, "Come with us."</span> <span id="s225">Wellt Ir3 ;au didn't move that fast.</span> <span id="s226">I just kept on working, and the other one looked at me andsaid, "Aw, let him stay."</span> <span id="s227">"Oh no."</span> <span id="s228">"Let him go.</span> <span id="s229">Let him go.</span> <span id="s230">Come on.</span> <span id="s231">Come on."</span> <span id="s232">AndWz Ssthen the...the boss, Ske name i~ Nicholas, and he intervened o and said, "Well, this is a real good worker and we need him here.</span> <span id="s233">n And he said, "Okay, let's leave him here.</span> <span id="s234">wJ And the second one insisted that I stay, and they walked away and t this is how I remained that timt and uh this was an0 4 60important...uh...event, that clay factory.</span> <span id="s235">I think stayed in the clay factory untilthe evacuation to the concentration camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s236">But I think before that...beforethe clay factory, we had a very importantO<ab aktion...an="" happened.="" incident=""> <span id="s237">And that was what they called the big Aktion, thebig selection where this particular day the German commandant selected 10,000 peopleO4 4b and they were all exterminated in one day in the Ninth Kort.</span> <span id="s238">And this is quite a story.Uh...They told us to present ourselves at 6:00 in the morning at a certain place intheghetto.</span> <span id="s239">The whole...everyone...whoever would stay behind .</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">O $ tt would be shot, and naturally everybody showed up.</span> <span id="s242">They...they put everybody in thegates...and some type of Jewish police and...uh...and the leaders of the ghetto triedto keep some kind of order, so as to try to present us in Io S ;=b guess a better light, and so not to upset the Germans, you 15 know, when...when we walked in front of them.</span> <span id="s243">I remember walking up in front of the German Gestapo men with my mother 1 ox c 1t 06 s ~\1.</span> <span id="s244">and he asked my mother questions, says , "No men?"</span> <span id="s245">And my mother said, "No."</span> <span id="s246">And he says, Well, he pointed to the right.</span> <span id="s247">And as he pointed to the right, Iog 61D knew right then and there that was death.</span> <span id="s248">That was the end of us.</span> <span id="s249">And...uh...I remember we started crying and we started worrying.</span> <span id="s250">And...uh...my mother told me in the convoys, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s251">We'll be back.</span> <span id="s252">We r re not going toU D go anywhere."</span> <span id="s253">And I thought she's really out of her mind.</span> <span id="s254">And...uh.</span> <span id="s255">.</span> <span id="s256">~because that wasunheard of.</span> <span id="s257">Once they decided something, there's no coming back.</span> <span id="s258">And...uh...she toldme,#she said...we had...we had a friend...and this is another story.</span> <span id="s259">We had a friend,Lithuanian, before the war who was a German‑Jew, a refugee from Germany.</span> <span id="s260">And he usedto come over to our house and be friendly with us, with my parents.</span> <span id="s261">And he in 1940,was = out by the Russians as a O8 ; 4 olitical prisoner.</span> <span id="s262">He escaped, came back toLithuanian, and had some papers as if.</span> <span id="s263">.</span> <span id="s264">if he was some political prisoner and againstcommunism.</span> <span id="s265">And he was in ghetto.</span> <span id="s266">We knew that.o7 aO We used to see him.</span> <span id="s267">And she told me, "We're going to meet him on this side, andtogether with his papers and our papers, we're going to come back."</span> <span id="s268">My father'smedals...what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s269">"We're going to come back."</span> <span id="s270">And again, I..</span> <span id="s271">.</span> <span id="s272">Ididn't...I didn't know what to a think.</span> <span id="s273">I thought my mother had lost her sind right there.</span> <span id="s274">4;rS; oF ll \ tt~i~lL h. To find him on the wrong side since he was, poFtiswbartywas I think a single person.</span> <span id="s275">I don't think he had his familyO g a anymore.</span> <span id="s276">Well, to shorten it, they took us down about, oh, 50 yards or 100 yards ina different place after we were selected on the right side which was the wrong sideand...uh...they were waiting for more people to come and when they had a certainamount...on that side they usedot:2~ to...they took us into the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s277">And that is different...altogetherdifferent story about the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s278">Well, as we were standing there and waitingto be taken to the little ghetto, I spotted that man standingtabout 10 yards from us and said to my mother, "Here he is just like you 8aid."</span> <span id="s279">And shesays, "Run over to him and tell him to come over and stay with us."</span> <span id="s280">And I did.</span> <span id="s281">Andhe kind of worked his way to us.</span> <span id="s282">My mother asked him, "How did you get over here?</span> <span id="s283">"Well, I tried to save a lot of people,O 9'6~ children, and...and the commandant wouldn't even listen to me.</span> <span id="s284">He just put us on thewrong side and here we are."</span> <span id="s285">And he was just as scared and just as weak as I was.My motherW)S 4t«Oq Lao said, "Let's stay together.</span> <span id="s286">Wsw'ra going with UL,J~ Well, we went to the littleghetto which was empty, which was...which was exterminated before and as we camethere...uh...there...uh...10,000 people were there at night.t5,+t Ten thourand people were selected.</span> <span id="s287">And some thought that they may just separate usfrom the big ghetto and let us stay there and maybe live or do other things.</span> <span id="s288">So sone 17 people tried to get their homes and get some beds to be ableD 9 to sleep on or whatever was left from the people who were there before.</span> <span id="s289">And my mothersaid, "We're not looking for no houses.</span> <span id="s290">We are not going to look for any furniture.We don't need anything.</span> <span id="s291">We want to come back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s292">n¢: ao Because she doesntt like the situation here.</span> <span id="s293">So as she saidwe picked one house right...right by the gate.</span> <span id="s294">I remember \&gt;;«d~S ~ that we found some berrivie room and there was an oldmattress...mattress on which Mr. h was his name, Mr. R*6tu~ and I laid down and sleptand my mother sat in aqD lounge chair all night long and I thin S tt8&gt;, M# ,r Jke aOlr something.</span> <span id="s295">And everytime I woke up I could see her sitting, not sleeping at all.</span> <span id="s296">At 6:00 in the morning,5:00,Xl~O‑D 6:00 in the morning, we heard bang g r~yelling, screaming, insults, dragging people.We ran out and we saw already some...uh...rows of humanity being taken I thlnk in theXl aj) direction of the Ninth Fort which we knew...which street led to the Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s297">Andas we were in the line in front, almost by the gate, my mother decided, she said,"Well, now ttr.</span> <span id="s298">X h we're goinq to try to come back."</span> <span id="s299">She said, "Ba , give/{ 4t me your papers."</span> <span id="s300">And she took the medals and my father's .</span> <span id="s301">.</span> <span id="s302">paper and she ran up to oneLithuanian officer and told him that...pretended that Mr. Raston was her husband andsaid that he was a political prisoner, that he was a , a volunteer before the war,that he did some good things forXD Lithuania«, and would he help us in...in sending us back to i8 the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s303">Well, one...one said, "Well, don't worry wherever you'regoing you're going to be working.</span> <span id="s304">You're...you're just going to change places.</span> <span id="s305">Itwon't be/; ;UD much different."</span> <span id="s306">And she went to another one.</span> <span id="s307">Another one wouldn't even listen toher.</span> <span id="s308">The third one said I could not do anything about it, until Mr. iesCcn and I kindof gave up and told herl "Let's...let's go where everyone else goes."</span> <span id="s309">/ ; And uh she said, "One more."</span> <span id="s310">She saw she spotted thislieutenant, Lithuanian lieutenant, and she walked up to himand she kind of with her last breath tried to explain the} 3 ' 6situation.</span> <span id="s311">And he said to her, "Look, I cannot do anything about it, but...but theGerman commandant is going to come over in a few minutes and rsached...he took us andhe put us on the sidewalk, rather than in the streets.</span> <span id="s312">And he said, ~You stay here andwhen the German commandant comes, we're going to present to him these papers and seewhat he can do} 3 aU3 about it."</span> <span id="s313">And that felt very tood at that moment except that about a minute later,some soldier walked up, Lithuanian soldier, and he saw us standing on...on thesidewalk, not where everyone else was standing.</span> <span id="s314">And he had, 3: q O a club in his hand and without any question he smacked Mr. .</span> <span id="s315">.9*6ten on his ear and split his ear and...uh...my mother on her back, black and bluemarks on her back, and told us to get back in the row with all the other people.</span> <span id="s316">Atthat time # ffi that officer noticed it and he came over and he said to him, "Look, Itold them to stay here and I want them to stay here 19 and don't touch them."</span> <span id="s317">A minute later the German appeared, the Germancommandant.</span> <span id="s318">And the way it was situated was like/ 4 ag3 this.</span> <span id="s319">The gate of the small ghetto was the end of one street.</span> <span id="s320">The whole thinghappened...the way it happened was like a interception from which four or fivestreets...streets branched out.</span> <span id="s321">The German commandant wastX 4O standing in the middle of the interception.</span> <span id="s322">The gate was on one street.</span> <span id="s323">About 90degrees of that gate was the fence of the big ghetto from which we had come.</span> <span id="s324">No gate.3ust barbed wire fence with German guards and the Jewish policea ff n an the other side of it, pretending to watch what'shappening or to guard or whatever they were doing there.</span> <span id="s325">a»a Xs Probably seeing what was happening.</span> <span id="s326">knothes German was J b SLt standing there,the lieutenant ran over quickly, took the medal the papers, and walked over to theGerman commandant and he talked to hiw.</span> <span id="s327">What he said I don't know, but I heard theGerman yell, "Where are those Jews?</span> <span id="s328">Where are those Jews?"</span> <span id="s329">So he ran...he came overquickly and got us and...uh...my mother walked up to him quickly and told...ff 4O repeated her story, and he said, "Back in the ghetto."</span> <span id="s330">And we could see...before I gotto the fence, I could see the 3ewish police...there was no entrance, but the Jewishpolice16; 65r who were on the other side tore the barbed wire with their hands and their feet,tore apart...made a hole, and we just crawled back in.</span> <span id="s331">And...uh...that day 10,000people died.sUD One of the nen who vent was a cousin who we really hadn't 20 seen, but we learned afterwards that she was there.</span> <span id="s332">And...uh...this is, Iguess, how we survived that one.g q p But...uh...it just worked out exactly the same way my mother ~1,ß,~8 zr ~ predicted.</span> <span id="s333">~ .</span> <span id="s334">Probably one in a million.</span> <span id="s335">From what I understand is thatthere may have been a few othersIn C~) who hid in attics or some other places that day instead of going to the Ninth Fort,and I think when somebody told me afterwards...when the Jewish police and the firemencame i io check they found some people hidden and later got them out of there.</span> <span id="s336">Theybrought over uniforms and they dressed n a&gt;Dthem up as policemen and they just gotthem back in.</span> <span id="s337">I FaP S&gt;ftdon't think there was very many, but I know that...uh...thatAo*WenQwe came back, we were the only ones.O</span></ab></span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Where did you go?</span> <span id="s339">What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Well, we went back to our place, to our...where we lived in the ghetto and we continuedthe ghetto life and actually the Ats ktt ß e atD children's aktion and...uh...was after...after tWz nd they would go outcontinue living in the ghetto until the evacuation.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And did you see the children?</span> <span id="s342">The children aktion that you had described earlier? &gt; }</span> <span id="s343">D</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s345">And uh the ghetto kept on shrinking all the time,21 less and less people.</span> <span id="s346">And even the area was reduced and I believe in 44 when the Russian army got closer to Lithuania, X for sone reason and just evacuated us and took us to theconcentration camp.</span> <span id="s347">But before that happened...uh...peoplewere trying...trying to build some bunkers~ They werecalled bunkers, which were hiding pl*ces.</span> <span id="s348">They kind of5 C1D expected that some day when the war was over that theGermans would not leave a trace of U8.</span> <span id="s349">SO they builtbunkersX And in that ceramic factorA there was a bunker.And actually I..</span> <span id="s350">.</span> <span id="s351">I forgot to mentionXmy mother was hidden in; q that bunker in the ceramic factory.</span> <span id="s352">And...uh...from what Iunderstand Gb*Ae was later that...when they evacuated theghetto and some of the people stayed in the bunker, they;4 D just put the whole...they just put a fire to the ghetto andthey burned everything and everyone in there.</span> <span id="s353">And I don'tknow if any people survived that day.</span> <span id="s354">But I know there wassome people hidden in this bunker.</span> <span id="s355">They had it prepareda ~: r real well.</span> <span id="s356">They pretended they were building a furnace...afurnace...0 oven for the ceramic because you had to take it utsst Dv 15 iZq and burn it.</span> <span id="s357">And that was the ; fEceceee l1ve in‑the big bunker.</span> <span id="s358">AndI think I know...I think I heard that one of my aunts also was in one of those bunkers and she disappeared ffi right afterw~&gt;~</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: What was life likeAfor you in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s360">22</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Well, it all depends.</span> <span id="s362">It all depends.</span> <span id="s363">It was different for all people.</span> <span id="s364">For me7 Well,when I was working...running a ^ so around and working, it wasn't that bad.</span> <span id="s365">Matteroffact...uh...I even had a chance to play soccer in the tc~_ a l 6mb ghetto.</span> <span id="s366">I had a Pt5Bt.I had some friends.</span> <span id="s367">We formed a soccer team.</span> <span id="s368">We played there among ours Qlvesand...uh...and ...uh...as a matter of fact, I had a good friend who was the captain of our team.</span> <span id="s369">He was studying at that time...incidently, we had a..</span> <span id="s370">.</span> <span id="s371">I believe an arts school in a o .</span> <span id="s372">a O the ghetto.</span> <span id="s373">And that arts school consisted of about four or five students, one or Mwo \teachers.</span> <span id="s374">And...uh...they were0 iC OC c .1 &lt; 9 0 (o o ~ ag=wsug some veedbeSteatA training.</span> <span id="s375">And one of the friend of ~ine heard that we were studying in this arts school and IQ l qb remember waiting for me and rushing him to get out of school so we could have a little more time to play and...uh...later on this arts school played another big part in my life.</span> <span id="s376">Uh...Otherwise I really don't remember too much.</span> <span id="s377">It was&gt;;L ~nb just routine every day.</span> <span id="s378">I remember one incident when my mother went to work and she took me with...with her because she got a chance to go to home ~ in Panemon because the brigade was working there for...I don't know who...theQ; g D military or somebody.</span> <span id="s379">And I remembert we went and came to our hometown and we walked into the barracks, the military barracks which was situated behind a home across the street from our house.</span> <span id="s380">And the people across the street from ouraa +~ house were Lithuanians, very good friends of ours.</span> <span id="s381">They had 23 a restaurant and I remember walking through...uh...I think she had made...Ithink Oer mother ~w walkeda 3 crD through several times and there was a board in the fence that was loose, especially made I think for my mother to go over the board and walk through to their backyard and into their home.</span> <span id="s382">And I remember those people real well.</span> <span id="s383">Weofl v se&gt;4 M *v R» s aUL walked through there and we walked up nnd otood boforc this restaurant and I remember that lady was there, Mrs. , friends before the war.</span> <span id="s384">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s385">Andused to be our friends before the war, her sons, and even made one time at iaSi~ r;*S forme, amsttk , a very small one.</span> <span id="s386">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s387">And they poured water, used toa3 q b freeze them within an hour.</span> <span id="s388">And they were good friends of ours.</span> <span id="s389">And I remember that they kind of helped us a little bit with some food.</span> <span id="s390">I remember when my mother used to come back from that job, I remember we ate pretty good.</span> <span id="s391">This was Q a maid sharing this food.</span> <span id="s392">I remember during my during my stay in the ghetto, in the concentration camp, most of thetime I spent thinking about this food more than anythingelse.</span> <span id="s393">I don't think I wa6 that scared to die or anythingaW No else, just tried to get some food just to feel better.</span> <span id="s394">.</span> <span id="s395">That...that I remember.</span> <span id="s396">Is there anything else.</span> <span id="s397">After this...</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: You are back in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s399">What happened to you?</span> <span id="s400">24ad: 5 t</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Well.</span> <span id="s402">To me?</span> <span id="s403">Nothing that...nothing that I can rememberl XtAte cJ^V~c'ts MoRr .</span> <span id="s404">The big aktionQ I believe I ~\; J 13 was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s405">i~_S*«S, I even had my Bar Mitzvah in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s406">Yes.</span> <span id="s407">I remember that.</span> <span id="s408">We had (laughing) we had some other friends who were also German refugees who came to tSo; &amp; live in Panemon in B~ d right before the Germans occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Let's hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s410">They need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s411">j 3CX5

were no schools in the school in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s416">If there were any, I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s417">Uh...We had some friends as I said who came from...who also were German‑Jewish refugees who came to live ol ; l in Panemon and my parents became friends of theirs.</span> <span id="s418">And they were religious people, very religious people, and...uh...tbere were all the Jewish traditions and so Ol~ q O forth.</span> <span id="s419">They also made it to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s420">And I remember when I was about 12, 12 and a half, my mother...uh...said that this gentleman...I forgot his name...would teach me the Sa orah and everything that one needs to know to have a Bar o Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s421">So every day he used to come over.</span> <span id="s422">I used to go over to his place and we would study4*F1 I don't remember how long, but...uh...but by the time the day of the Bar Mitzvah came, I remember there was a house and there were25D z ; D quite a few people, 10, 20 and I remember the women being in d,~ the back and...uh...they were styihq their Saturday prayerd g ust like in the normal times, and when it came to my paronks I remember that I think I did fairly well with myuL ~&lt; ~ .</span> <span id="s423">And one thing I can remember that day, I had neverO)'457 seen my mother cry so hard and that day, it was...it was I remember it was impossible to stop her.</span> <span id="s424">Although&gt; @; a after...after the Bar Mitzvah, they had a little party.Whoever had anything brought over, and we managed to03 a 3 celebrate.</span> <span id="s425">That was one incident I remember clearly.And...uh.</span> <span id="s426">*.</span> <span id="s427">in the ghetto every day life, work and we heard, of course, all kind of incidents.</span> <span id="s428">If I were to go to very day life, there was a hanging in the ghetto that I remembero 3;%5 clearly because...uh...uh...one...they...they claimed they found in fact, one of the inmates with a revolver or a pistol trying to smuggle into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s429">&amp; And uh natura}ly the Gestapo apprehended him and uh we were ordered everyone was ordered to appear in one place.</span> <span id="s430">And the gallows were all prepared ~ They brought him back.</span> <span id="s431">I remember having seen him coming out of the = all beaten up, swollen, hardly recognizable, and I .</span> <span id="s432">.</span> <span id="s433">O remember the hanging incident.</span> <span id="s434">I was maybe 12, 13 watching through a window because...uh...they had him $4; a pistol or something.</span> <span id="s435">And I believe because of that...the # +O ghetto had to sacrifice a lot of people for him because they wanted to punish US and took some innocent people and just 26Wtg t3 did kill them Xe=roTth of that incident.</span> <span id="s436">It was not...it was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s437">You had to move from place to place.</span> <span id="s438">As they were shrinking the ghetto, we had to move from place to place.</span> <span id="s439">And...uh...tried to do the best...make the best of it.</span> <span id="s440">I am sure that there were a lot of other incidents thatt6 '2 thappened.</span> <span id="s441">I'll probably think of them later, but right now I cannot think of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: What happened then?</span> <span id="s443">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s444">90</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Well, when...when they evacuated us.</span> <span id="s446">We were

don't know.</span> <span id="s450">I don't remember how long it was.</span> <span id="s451">But I remember coming to Stutthof and uh and they separated the women from the men and...uh...kept the women in the Stuffhof camp someplace around Stutthof and the men they took to Landsberg.</span> <span id="s452">Landsberg was a..</span> <span id="s453">.</span> <span id="s454">was the first stop in t Germany.</span> <span id="s455">That was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s456">A small one I believe not far from Munich and not far from Dachau.</span> <span id="s457">And I remember being separated with my mother already and I justO G qocontinued with the trains to deeper into Germany.</span> <span id="s458">And that is the last time I heard of my mother until after the war.</span> <span id="s459">I had some people who were with her and told me that she died in the last days of the war.</span> <span id="s460">The exact details they O 5 CDnever told me, but...uh...probably for some reason probably 27 not to upset me or other things, but the exact way I don't know, but I know she...she died in the last days.</span> <span id="s461">And...uh...I came to Landsberg, and there were a lot of men, young men and older men.</span> <span id="s462">And we stayed there not too long, and they ordered all the children up to 17 years old to q O assemble and...uh...and they took us away.</span> <span id="s463">They took us away to...to Dachau.</span> <span id="s464">We were about 131 I believe, and we stayed in Dachau for 1 week and then they shipped us out to Birkenau, Auschwitz, Birkenau.</span> <span id="s465">And...uh...when we came to Birkenau....</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Tell us about that ride.Ot</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Well, the ride to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s468">We were...we were put in three wagons, three railroad wagons, train wagons, 131 of us and D we we were stopping someplace.</span> <span id="s469">The only thing I really remember from that ride is that we came to a place in a train station where some Russian prisoners were able to walkup to our train and there were some port holes in our cattleOq # 513 trains and warned U5 to see and try to...try to escape if we could because...uh...they said if you are Jewish and you are .</span> <span id="s470">.</span> <span id="s471">going to Auschwitz or Birkenau, that's where they kill them Oq » D all.</span> <span id="s472">So if you have a chance, just run away.</span> <span id="s473">And some of us couldn't .</span> <span id="s474">And it...it took quite a while to get there.</span> <span id="s475">And one incident I remember was that since we&gt;q # O were all Lithuanian children that none of us spoke Polish so 28 to try to escape was useless or we wouldn't know to talk or how to talk.</span> <span id="s476">Butin my...in my wagon, there were two boys who did speak Polish, a little or a lot I don't know.</span> <span id="s477">I knew they knew something about it.</span> <span id="s478">And they told us that a they were going to jump and escape.</span> <span id="s479">Now, we had a big dilemma because if they escaped and we knew from the ghetto I b Qd if one did anything wrong, all of us would be done.</span> <span id="s480">So we had a plan made up with them thst they...we would try to...there were two older German guards in that train, and we would try to distract them to try...there were maybe 60 q O of us or 50 of US on that train, and we would try...there was only...the was only made of about we were maybe about 5 or 10 kids involved in that.</span> <span id="s481">And...uh...we said like this, that they're going to go through that port hole, tnD try to climb down the step of the train and stay there for awhile until maybe the moment that the train slows down a little bit...I believe the train was going about maybe 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour, and when the train slow down and maybe in a brushy area where it would be softer...softer to land, they would try to jump.</span> <span id="s482">And to protect us because out of 50 kids someone had to see that they were jumping out and not to tell the Germans that would have been the end of every one of us.</span> <span id="s483">So we decided with them that they're going to jump and in about a couple of hours later, we would pretend...we would be about...and...100 miles away...l20 miles away from that area...a couple of hours later, we would pretend that we just saw the kids jump, and we would tell the German guards that here two kids have jumped out and here they are.</span> <span id="s484">They're laying right here watching us.</span> <span id="s485">And...uh...maybe that would save us and...uh...in the meantime, Seli thit w ^l; ;D, they wouldn't...they wouldn't even look for them that far away and...uh...maybe they would.</span> <span id="s486">So we did itZ; q D that way.</span> <span id="s487">We...we took four...four of us, starting talking to the Germans.</span> <span id="s488">They were kind of older and they were not from the SS.</span> <span id="s489">They were from the Wehrmacht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile.</span> <span id="s490">They would...I remember someone was talking to them about knives, about other/3 61) things.</span> <span id="s491">I don't remember the conversation.</span> <span id="s492">About we were watching the homes or the greenery while the train was going by.</span> <span id="s493">We just talked to them and kept them busy.</span> <span id="s494">And all of a sudden, like we said, about two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's telling me a?</span> <span id="s495">bao secret~ And they got excited and they asked whatts happened.</span> <span id="s496">We said, "Go look quick.</span> <span id="s497">Quick.</span> <span id="s498">Through that window, the port hole, two kids just jumped out."</span> <span id="s499">First, they didn't believe it and then they kinda looked and then3 AO they said, "Well, it took you too long.</span> <span id="s500">They were right there."</span> <span id="s501">And thirdly, they started to call the officer somehow and made some signs that we should stop the train reco+blc and to recount them because if they took them to , we/ # 6lD were missing.</span> <span id="s502">Now that took a little while.</span> <span id="s503">And they30stopped the train.</span> <span id="s504">They took us all out and they counted us three times, and two were missing.</span> <span id="s505">SO they...they asked us,Where did it happened.</span> <span id="s506">And they said, "About five minutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and we reported it, we saw it.</span> <span id="s507">"And okay, from what I understand they did call the localpolice in that town, but that may have had been 10towns...those kids were about 10 towns behind us...andthey...they were looking for them.</span> <span id="s508">What happened?</span> <span id="s509">We don'tknow.</span> <span id="s510">But from what I heard lately, I think one...ne of/4 4O them did survive.</span> <span id="s511">Someone told me a story that one kid whenthey were transported from...uh...from...uh...we were goingto Buchenwald to Birkenau jumped the train.</span> <span id="s512">One of theLithuanian kids jumped the train, and he's somewhere iny 5 ; &gt; Israel right now.</span> <span id="s513">And I'm trying to see if we can makecontact and meet him.</span> <span id="s514">And...uh...that I learned recently ayear...maybe a few months ago.</span> <span id="s515">So we then we came toAuschwitz,Birkenau.</span> <span id="s516">We were led in.</span> <span id="s517">We were kept for3 about 3 days in quarantine, and we didn't know why in abarrack with straw, not even a shower.</span> <span id="s518">Very little food.And we could see a lot of concerned inmates, old timers whoused to come in and out, in and out, talk to us, and ask usZ S q t questions.</span> <span id="s519">And we found out...out later, the reason westayed there about four days before letting us into thecamps is because this is the first transport of children whowere let into Birkenau alive.</span> <span id="s520">There were some childrenyC CnD before who came with their father or families.</span> <span id="s521">When I say 31 children, 13, 14, 15.</span> <span id="s522">And we were the first...it was late in the war andthings had started to change a little bit.</span> <span id="s523">So what happened, we don't really know.But they told us U aO later that...uh...they were very surprised and happy that wewere the first ones let in, and we were in quarantine in i a..</span> <span id="s524">.</span> <span id="s525">in a camp which was called A‑lager, A‑lager.</span> <span id="s526">WciL~ we /6 qO didn't doanything from...just looked for food.</span> <span id="s527">Try see what...uh...we could do.b...That's allwe thought about.</span> <span id="s528">There were hot days and cold days and all kinds of days.J7;6t And I remember after quarantiner they took us to a children's barrack in the...theD‑Lager, which was a working lager, working camp.</span> <span id="s529">They were a lot of kommandos,people who used to go to work every day and come back.</span> <span id="s530">And we had those appells whereyou had to get up early in the morning, stand in that place being counted day andnight, twice a day to make sure that everyone of US was there.</span> <span id="s531">And at the beginningI didn't do anything there either.</span> <span id="s532">There was notn 4 D too much work for us, I believe.</span> <span id="s533">But there was one brigade that used to...that usedto come out of this barrack.</span> <span id="s534">And they were some children whopushed...uh...some...they called q K it a roll wagon....it looked like a..</span> <span id="s535">.</span> <span id="s536">like abuggy or like a horse and buggy, without a horse and iVet collected garbage in someplaces in the camps and the crematoriums and things like that.</span> <span id="s537">That was not a bad jObcause when you u6ed to goI t aUDto some of those places and being a child or young men, you used to meet some womenand older people who used to give 32d.</span> <span id="s538">%you some_share withatheir rations or bread or whatever they v had.</span> <span id="s539">But...uh...that was hard to 4 ve into until one day, I%;~ O remember it was pouring rain, mud to your knees, and you hadto go and push that wagon.</span> <span id="s540">Well, some of the kids who wereworking there before kind of hid or didn't show up,/ 4 t6D and...uh...half way volunteering and half way being picked Igot into that job.</span> <span id="s541">And as I said before, many days thathelped me because people used to hand Fe some things, foodand things like to eat, which was the most important thing/ 5 ;O in that time.</span> <span id="s542">We stayed there not very long, maybe a fewmonths.</span> <span id="s543">The...the crematorium had quiet2 down...quietedD down from what I understand.</span> <span id="s544">They...they didn't exterminatepeople in those days as much as they did in the earlier daysuntil one day we woke up and we did see all kind of flamesgoing through those chimneys and we knew that's what's goingon.</span> <span id="s545">We knew that they were burning people over there, but» 5 that day they...someone told us...I don't know how therumors started.</span> <span id="s546">They had rounded up about 3,000gypsies...gypsies and just took them to the crematorium andjust gassed them and burned them like they did...they did»D Q O the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s547">And that was...uh...kind of scared.</span> <span id="s548">.</span> <span id="s549">.</span> <span id="s550">Needless to say, also...now it's coming back to me...uh.</span> <span id="s551">.</span> <span id="s552">Hthose A and D lagers, we were...we were...there were » ~ QO selections too.</span> <span id="s553">I almost forgot about those.</span> <span id="s554">9 e day we 4 were on the appellSplaNK where we were supposed to stand every morning and evening and thKean K0 ~n~aNt KdRb33 and he looked over.</span> <span id="s555">We...I was in a children's barrack anda 1 ;n he looked us over, and...uh...I think that was before thatGypsy incident and he looked us over.</span> <span id="s556">He asked us our ages.And...uh...I remember I think I was about 14 at that...atthat time, and ...uh...the kid next to me, he asked him hisa I aD age, and he told them 14.</span> <span id="s557">THet marked down his number.Uh...I had felt that was not a good sign, so when he walkedup to me, I told him I was 15.</span> <span id="s558">I tried to lie about a year.D He looked at me twice and just walked by me.</span> <span id="s559">Well, thatafternoon they came to pick up all the kids who[*...whosenumber they had written down.</span> <span id="s560">I never heard from them @ again g Uh Another incident, also in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s561">Sne dayWa a. n they showed up with a measuring instrument, measuring device 7 like a a square.</span> <span id="s562">And we had to walk under it.</span> <span id="s563">And Iremember you never knew whether to be tall is better or tobe short is better or to older or to be younger.</span> <span id="s564">You neveraw R O knew.</span> <span id="s565">There was a lot of deception, a lot of lies, andconfused us completely.</span> <span id="s566">And this I think, also, wasa; Q D instrumental in.</span> <span id="s567">.</span> <span id="s568">in some of us not being as resistant as weshould have been because we were completely lied to,deceived and mishandled and by the time some of us woke up, .</span> <span id="s569">.</span> <span id="s570">Q it was almost too late.</span> <span id="s571">This measuring device I remember walking through it and I barely touched that bar‑SSacross and my number was not taken that da H Some of the shorter =* ones I remember was taken.</span> <span id="s572">But you really never knew what S was the right wayX They had you confused completelyg And 34 after that...I believe after Birkenau, we went...they evacuated us or theytook us out to...uh...what they called...we went to Auschwitz for one day, and theydid...and then Auschwitz, that was the big concentration;3 %~ camp near Birkenau.</span> <span id="s573">And then they took us to which was called farm.</span> <span id="s574">And that farm wascalled _ Birkenau again.</span> <span id="s575">There were different names.</span> <span id="s576">They separated a lot of us, andI wound up in that ofaq~ y Birkenau where I was very sick.</span> <span id="s577">Had pneumonia and stayed in...there was aHungarian‑Jewish doctor took care of the little hospital.</span> <span id="s578">He had a few bedsand...uh...he took care of me with some medicines.</span> <span id="s579">I was there for quite a few X weeks I remember and just barely got better or well by the time they took us to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s580">And that was quite aa 4 q O march.</span> <span id="s581">Also I..</span> <span id="s582">.</span> <span id="s583">another incident happened.</span> <span id="s584">I forgot to tAo94(0talk about that one...in Birkenau when we got the needles.w I don't know, 5, 10 of us got the neelles and we were just a G (tlaying in whatthey call a hospital and the main doctor who took care of us was a French‑Jewishdoctor.</span> <span id="s585">He was extremely kind, understanding and tried to help us.</span> <span id="s586">Matter ;ao offact, he saved our lives there.</span> <span id="s587">I remember before .</span> <span id="s588">.</span> <span id="s589">evacuation day, we had to be sick about 21 days in order to be declared notcontagious and...uh...I think that day we ; were about 17 days in the hospital and we remember himrunning back and forth trying to doctor all kinds of peoplein charge and what we remember, he signed something or 35 declared us well enough, we were not...we were not contagious anymore.</span> <span id="s590">Itwas touch and go until he was ableX 1D to declare us not contagious and...and they were able to evacuate us with everyoneelse.</span> <span id="s591">In that of Birkenau ....(Pause) we were...we were most of us were working atW +¢r on;6 6 Z S thc tincv I don't remember.</span> <span id="s592">I didn't work at the time.</span> <span id="s593">When I was there, I was sickand I didn't do too much.aL q O And...uh...if not for that Hungarian doctor, I wouldn't have survived there either.Because I must have been well enough to make that long trip to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s594">Wewere...we were(b about 6 days I believe and 6 nights.</span> <span id="s595">We were walking for many, many, many days...formany hours and I think at night we stopped just for a little sleep a few hours.</span> <span id="s596">Andthen I think we were on trains.</span> <span id="s597">They put us on trains right before9D we got to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s598">And it was wintertime and it was open wagons and you...wegot...uh...one of my eyes was very infected and...uh...I lived with that throughBuchenwalda N qOmost of the time.</span> <span id="s599">Some days it was better, some days it was worse.</span> <span id="s600">But I don't thinkthat I had any treatment for that.</span> <span id="s601">Uh...In Buchenwald we were again in a children'sbarrack, ina S n quarantine for 66.</span> <span id="s602">They brought 66 I believe in the back of the camp.</span> <span id="s603">In that barrack,there were a lot of Hungarians, Slovakians, German, Polish Jewish children and someof us, Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s604">And...uh...we didn't do any work because we; 3 were in quarantine.</span> <span id="s605">And
