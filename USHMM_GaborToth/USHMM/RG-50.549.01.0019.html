saying your name and maybe where we’re doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Lucine Horn: My name is Lucine Horn and my real name is Estelle Rubenlee.</span> <span id="s12">My maiden name.</span> <span id="s13">I am from Lublin, Poland and presently I reside in the United States since 1950.</span> <span id="s14">And this interview is being taken at my home at 4850 Westland in Lincolnwood, Illinois.</span> <span id="s15">I offered to do this interview to tie in my video interview which I took for the Holocaust Museum which involved my whole story of the war, Holocaust up until to the days of liberation.</span> <span id="s16">This will be just a follow up to what, what happened since 1945 January when I was liberated by the Russians in a very small town in Poland, to which I was taken with my husband after the Warsaw uprising, not the Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s17">The Polish uprising which took place in 1944, in October and as Poles there was no Jews at that time anymore.</span> <span id="s18">We were taken to southwest Poland and dispersed to live with farmers.</span> <span id="s19">We were treated as refugees from Warsaw and we also were fighting for the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s20">As such the German government placed us with farmers and the farmers had to support all the people that they evacuated from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s21">Warsaw was evacuated because the frontier was on the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s22">The Russians were coming in from the East.</span> <span id="s23">The Germans were on the other part of Warsaw and they needed Warsaw to be evacuated so that there was the frontier line.</span> <span id="s24">We were taken to this very small town and placed by these farmers who had no idea about our origins and we had to pretend constantly that we are not Jews.</span> <span id="s25">That was, that went on from October 1944 until January 1945.</span> <span id="s26">I don’t remember the date but that was the time when we were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s27">The Russians came all the way through to southwest Poland and the Germans were just rapidly running away.</span> <span id="s28">The Russians liberated us and came into this little town.</span> <span id="s29">We still could not show the enthusiasm of being liberated and show any love for the Russians which we did have at that time and still do because they did liberate us from Hitler.</span> <span id="s30">But the Poles were not very happy about the Russians coming into Poland.</span> <span id="s31">And they didn’t want the Russians to come to Warsaw to begin with and that’s why they staged this horrible uprising in 1944 in September when 350,000 Poles were killed, was killed and the city was practically 40% in ruins and destroyed.</span> <span id="s32">So we still had to pretend.</span> <span id="s33">Even so we were very happy to see them.</span> <span id="s34">And we stayed around about a week until we got our thoughts together of what we going to do now and how to proceed.</span> <span id="s35">We did want to go back to our home town but it was quite far and of course the war was just happening, the war between the Germans and the Russians and there was no communications like trains or buses.</span> <span id="s36">Only that everything was in great chaos.</span> <span id="s37">But we said goodbye to the people to the farmers that we lived with and told them that we want to go back to our home town.</span> <span id="s38">And we thought, they thought that we were from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s39">So it took us maybe about ten days or two weeks to make it.</span> <span id="s40">Wasn’t such a long stretch but we were doing it mostly by the foot and maybe we found a peasant that had a horse and buggy and he took us a little bit.</span> <span id="s41">And we were trying to go back to Lublin.</span> <span id="s42">On the way we passed several towns, small and big and we saw Jews come out from hiding so we kind of felt warm towards those people because they also survived.</span> <span id="s43">It was a good sign that there was more survivors.</span> <span id="s44">Until we came back to Lublin to look for mostly to look for family and friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: If I could just ask you, you were saying as you were making your way to your home town you would see Jews coming out of hiding and you know after all you had gone through in all those years of the war, I’m wondering if you could describe a little more, do you remember how, you know how you and your husband would react when you would see that.</span> <span id="s46">And how you would feel inside.</span> <span id="s47">And would you have encounters with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, it was a very chilling experience.</span> <span id="s49">The cities were mostly desolate.</span> <span id="s50">And there weren’t too many people walking around the streets because the Germans had just passed through.</span> <span id="s51">We would come to a town where maybe there was a square.</span> <span id="s52">And on the square people would congregate.</span> <span id="s53">And somehow, we always felt who it was Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s54">These people were completely different.</span> <span id="s55">I mean living in Poland and knowing the Polish people, we knew how the Polish people behave and how they look.</span> <span id="s56">These Jewish people were like they are coming out from hiding.</span> <span id="s57">Their heads were down.</span> <span id="s58">They were sad.</span> <span id="s59">They still had the frightened look in their eyes.</span> <span id="s60">They were probably hiding someplace.</span> <span id="s61">Whether in the underground or being hidden in some kind of a shack you know.</span> <span id="s62">They did not appear like the other people do.</span> <span id="s63">And we kind of looked the same way I guess.</span> <span id="s64">And commonly we just like you know like dog to dog.</span> <span id="s65">We had something that pulled us to each other and we started to talk and it’s the word to approach somebody was Am Who.</span> <span id="s66">Am Who means in Hebrew Am is Nation and Who meant are you from the same.</span> <span id="s67">And somehow we saw these people.</span> <span id="s68">We saw quite a few of those people.</span> <span id="s69">And we just rejoiced in seeing each other, but there was the sadness of having lost everything.</span> <span id="s70">So that was more or less what happened but we didn’t stay on.</span> <span id="s71">We just kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So you didn’t talk to them very</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Well we just briefly talked to them but everybody was just engaged in searching and doing his thing and we couldn’t wait to get home.</span> <span id="s74">We had a knapsack and we were tired from walking and not sleeping and, and you know took us maybe ten days or two weeks to get to Lublin.</span> <span id="s75">Once we got to Lublin there was a Jewish organization and they were registering all the people that were coming back home.</span> <span id="s76">A lot of it was a great influx of people from Russia.</span> <span id="s77">And Russia allowed these people to come back.</span> <span id="s78">And there were some people coming out from, very few from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s79">The majority from Russia and also some that were sent to Germany for work.</span> <span id="s80">Like the able bodied, not Jewish looking, females mostly.</span> <span id="s81">Because males could always be checked out for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s82">Because of circumcision.</span> <span id="s83">So we met quite a few people, acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this Jewish committee, we found that nobody that from our families had been registered so we kind of already thought that there’s nobody there from the family.</span> <span id="s84">But nevertheless we tried to establish ourselves in Lublin because we just didn’t’ know what to do with each other.</span> <span id="s85">And people were constantly coming.</span> <span id="s86">It was like every day when we went out to a town square you could see a few people coming here and there.</span> <span id="s87">And of course being a small town, maybe somebody that you knew.</span> <span id="s88">So some friends and acquaintances came.</span> <span id="s89">And some were in more need than others.</span> <span id="s90">Some were fighting with, on the Russian front and were wounded.</span> <span id="s91">Some were in very bad shape physically so we tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s92">Also none of us had anything.</span> <span id="s93">And my husband met some family, he met sometimes, he met an uncle that our experience with him was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s94">And he tried to help us at the beginning but then he was very busy with his own life, personal life.</span> <span id="s95">I don’t want to get into it.</span> <span id="s96">So actually we were alone.</span> <span id="s97">And we just couldn’t find a place for ourselves.</span> <span id="s98">My husband wanted to go back to medical school.</span> <span id="s99">He was third year medical school and he just didn’t know where and how.</span> <span id="s100">And the climate in Lublin was very unpleasant because the Poles were not happy that some Jews survived.</span> <span id="s101">And they were making some very nasty remarks.</span> <span id="s102">And I was confronted with this tremendous Polish anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s103">Mostly because I did not appear to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s104">And if people met me on the market, or on the street car or bus they would make these remarks to me that oh they are coming back from Russia.</span> <span id="s105">Hitler didn’t kill them all.</span> <span id="s106">And in such a climate I just absolutely could not live even a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What would you do when you would hear remarks like that.</span> <span id="s108">Would you</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well let me tell you about a very particular encounter because where we lived, we lived always where the Aryans lived, we did, never lived in so called Jewish quarters.</span> <span id="s110">Cause my mother was a practicing dentist and we had a lot of Gentile patients and where we lived was almost a Gentile neighborhood.</span> <span id="s111">And in the same building where we lived was a lady that was running the laundry service.</span> <span id="s112">And she had like a cleaning store.</span> <span id="s113">And right after the, right during the war, when the ghetto was finished and we ran away from the ghetto, my mother left a lot of things with that lady.</span> <span id="s114">Silver candelabras, all kinds of art objects.</span> <span id="s115">Things that were of value.</span> <span id="s116">Thinking that if anybody survives and needs the money to sustain themselves during the war, we would just go to her and get this stuff and be able to sell it.</span> <span id="s117">I knew all about it because my mother told me where these things were.</span> <span id="s118">I knew that I have these things with that lady.</span> <span id="s119">So I tried to get some things together and we knew that we have to go to Warsaw because Warsaw is a big town and nobody knows us.</span> <span id="s120">And I have to buy some false papers and we have to just go out.</span> <span id="s121">So I went to her like in an afternoon and this woman knew me since practically I was 4 years old.</span> <span id="s122">And when she came in she says oh my god where are your parents and she started to cry.</span> <span id="s123">Where is your brother and she was crying and crying.</span> <span id="s124">And then I said to her, can I get the things that my mother left with you.</span> <span id="s125">And she said oh it’s all in the attic.</span> <span id="s126">If you come back at 2:00 I’ll have everything ready.</span> <span id="s127">Well needless to say I came back at 2:00 and the Gestapo was there waiting for me.</span> <span id="s128">Her cousin was working for the Gestapo, he was a secret agent.</span> <span id="s129">And I had a terrible, I don’t want to get into it now but I had a terrible encounter with these people.</span> <span id="s130">And practically cost my life.</span> <span id="s131">Somehow, I got out of it.</span> <span id="s132">And after the war I just couldn’t forget it.</span> <span id="s133">So when I came back to Lublin, there was you know a committee of crimes and, you could really talk about these things.</span> <span id="s134">Especially show people that were hostile in doing these things.</span> <span id="s135">And I went to, over there to first of all I showed my face to her.</span> <span id="s136">And when she saw me that I survived, I knew this woman practically almost dropped in what she saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Can you still remember it today.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, I can remember it and I can remember.</span> <span id="s139">My memory is still good.</span> <span id="s140">I can remember what she looked like and she just was very, very upset to see me.</span> <span id="s141">And I just said hello to her and I said and I remember what you did to me.</span> <span id="s142">And I left and then I went to this place which was run by Poles.</span> <span id="s143">But don’t’ forget that Poland was communist at that time.</span> <span id="s144">and it was Burjon Bespeki Vespechaestva and I talked to people there and I asked them what I can do.</span> <span id="s145">To this woman.</span> <span id="s146">Because she practically not only cost my life, but I was taking care of my little brother and my husband and they were completely helpless without me.</span> <span id="s147">And if something would happen to them I mean they could have never survived without, I was their outside contact.</span> <span id="s148">And they told me that there’s nothing they can do because I have to have witnesses and if I don’t have any witnesses I should just forget it.</span> <span id="s149">So I was very upset and then we stayed for a while in Lublin.</span> <span id="s150">And the situation was just very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Let me just ask you, what did you want to have happen at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Oh I wanted her either arrested or to have some repercussions.</span> <span id="s153">I knew for what she was doing to me, she was probably doing to others and she could have been even doing it to the Poles.</span> <span id="s154">But nothing did happen.</span> <span id="s155">And we just tried to get our life together.</span> <span id="s156">We couldn’t so because there was no money and I could not be in Lublin for too long because every stone and every home reminded me of my past.</span> <span id="s157">And reminded me of my parents and I just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s158">That was in 1945.</span> <span id="s159">I was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s160">And we decided that we were going to try to leave Lublin because there was no use of waiting for anybody.</span> <span id="s161">We registered.</span> <span id="s162">They could find us.</span> <span id="s163">And my husband found out that the university that he attended before, he had no papers, everything was lost.</span> <span id="s164">That the university’s moving from Lwow.</span> <span id="s165">Because Lwow was taken by Russia that they moved to Blievitz which is a German town.</span> <span id="s166">That Poland took over ok in the exchange for the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s167">A little bit to the west was given to Poland.</span> <span id="s168">So we decided that we going to go, try to go there and see if he can get into the university cause that was the most important thing for us.</span> <span id="s169">He we got to Blievitz and as it turned out we spent there about 3 or 4 months and it turns out that the university is not coming there, but they are going to Breslau which was a much bigger university that they took over from the Germans.</span> <span id="s170">The town and that university from Lwow with all the professors were coming back to Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And Breslau is in Germany or Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Now it’s in Poland.</span> <span id="s173">Now it’s called Breslau.</span> <span id="s174">It used to be German.</span> <span id="s175">So after living for about 3 or 4 months in Blievitz, we went to Breslau.</span> <span id="s176">And in October of that year, my husband met with some professors that knew him.</span> <span id="s177">And he was able to get in for 3rd year medical school.</span> <span id="s178">We considered ourselves very lucky.</span> <span id="s179">I tried to get a job and somehow sustain ourselves you know in order for him to continue but we knew it’s not going to be on a long time basis, because we did not want to live in Poland.</span> <span id="s180">That was just an absolute N O.</span> <span id="s181">We felt that we just cannot live in a country that hurt us so much.</span> <span id="s182">And the memories are too painful and if you want to start a new life, it has to be someplace else, not in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: There you are right after the war in this place, as you say where all these horrible things that happened and you say there were memories everywhere.</span> <span id="s184">I’m wondering it’s just so hard today to imagine being in that situation.</span> <span id="s185">I wonder if you could describe a little more what your day to day emotions were like.</span> <span id="s186">Would you say today that you were depressed or would you cry.</span> <span id="s187">Would you turn a corner and see a certain place.</span> <span id="s188">I’m just trying to figure out what that would feel like.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Well when we were in Lublin it was indescribable how painful and hard.</span> <span id="s190">Because to give you an example to add insult to injury was the fact that the Poles were so hostile.</span> <span id="s191">Would we have been embraced by the people that we knew and that we grew up with and with people that also suffered, but not to that extent.</span> <span id="s192">It would have been maybe half way bad.</span> <span id="s193">But the hostility was just so tremendous.</span> <span id="s194">My best girlfriend was pregnant 9 months.</span> <span id="s195">She came into Lublin.</span> <span id="s196">Her husband was killed on the front.</span> <span id="s197">That now this is this woman giving birth to a child.</span> <span id="s198">The first child born after the war.</span> <span id="s199">In a Catholic hospital.</span> <span id="s200">And the nurses just damned this baby.</span> <span id="s201">God damn, Hitler didn’t kill them all.</span> <span id="s202">We have to have a Jewish child now .</span> <span id="s203">It can’t be helped.</span> <span id="s204">I mean this was just unbearable.</span> <span id="s205">But after we left Lublin I knew that we had to be strong to survive.</span> <span id="s206">And the emphasis was mostly on survival and how and what to do.</span> <span id="s207">All the survivors were trying to just find a way, whether to go to the United States or emigrate or go to Israel.</span> <span id="s208">Illegally but do something for yourself because here you are already surviving the war.</span> <span id="s209">And you got nothing but your life, nothing else.</span> <span id="s210">And now it’s up to you to know which direction to take and which way.</span> <span id="s211">It’s like you’re on an island and you want to save yourself.</span> <span id="s212">It was a matter of not saving your life, as much as knowing what to do with yourself.</span> <span id="s213">And because we had this one direction that my husband wanted to finish school.</span> <span id="s214">He didn’t want to go into business.</span> <span id="s215">The easiest thing to do was to smuggle and to sell.</span> <span id="s216">Everything was still chaotic.</span> <span id="s217">So I just knew that we had to, that looking past is one thing and being hurt in it is another.</span> <span id="s218">But it’s not going to help emotionally because you see we were very young and when you’re young you’re strong.</span> <span id="s219">You take life in a different way.</span> <span id="s220">And I just knew that we had to go on, make some right decisions and push forward and we were among people who had the same goal.</span> <span id="s221">Fortunately we were surrounded by students and academic people who had the same goals and wanted the same thing out of life, rather than making money and maybe amassing some fortunes by some illegal dealings and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: It sounds like what you’re saying is the survival that the drive for survival you developed during the war, it never let up.</span> <span id="s223">You just stayed in that condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s225">Definitely.</span> <span id="s226">The power of survival even for people that were in concentration camps which I never was and even people that saw their dearest slaughtered, there is a certain think in the human nature that really wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s227">And you know and I cannot talk about it to other people, but this is what we felt.</span> <span id="s228">And I knew that I have to help my husband and I got a job.</span> <span id="s229">We got a little apartment and I got a job.</span> <span id="s230">And, in Bratswath, in Breslau and he went back to school.</span> <span id="s231">And we knew it’s only temporary but we knew that he has to wait a year just to get his papers.</span> <span id="s232">Cause once he gets all his papers that he finished 3 years medical school, maybe wherever we go, to any country, he’s got at least something to show.</span> <span id="s233">And maybe he’ll be able to continue.</span> <span id="s234">So that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s235">We were in Breslau.</span> <span id="s236">We lived there almost a year.</span> <span id="s237">He finished medical school, third year, got all the papers and then we decided out.</span> <span id="s238">This is it.</span> <span id="s239">We really have to sever all our, our relationships with Poland and just erase it from our lives and just go on.</span> <span id="s240">And we had no gall.</span> <span id="s241">We didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s242">It was very hard at the time, you know to make any, any sense was, with your plans.</span> <span id="s243">But then we joined a Zionist group which was a student group.</span> <span id="s244">There was about 25 Jewish students, Zionist oriented and we thought that maybe if we go with a group it would be easier for us to be recognized wherever we go.</span> <span id="s245">Rather than one individual person.So with a knapsack, the BreiHa was helping Israelis, were helping the Jews out of Poland in that time.</span> <span id="s246">In a semi-legal way.</span> <span id="s247">Meaning that if you went to the border, to Czechoslovakia there maybe would be trucks there waiting for you and then taking you maybe to Italy or someplace, but it was all kind of semi-legal without any guarantees and with these papers in his hand, on with a knapsack and with very little money we decided to try and we went with this group.</span> <span id="s248">And there was maybe about 25 of us.</span> <span id="s249">We got into Czechoslovakia and then from Czechoslovakia, they took us, this BreiHa, they took us to Vienna.</span> <span id="s250">Because Vienna was a big concentration of refugees and the American Joint has been sponsoring a lot of places.</span> <span id="s251">And it was like a transit place, is for people that were coming out of Poland and coming out of concentration camps, trying to go other places.</span> <span id="s252">And there was an awful lot of people at that time in Vienna.</span> <span id="s253">And Vienna was occupied by all four, but the Americans had a great hand in deciding what to do at that time.</span> <span id="s254">And as we came to Vienna, we were aided already by the Joint Distribution Committee to and they, they really encouraged us not to go any further because they said that they would like to help the students.</span> <span id="s255">And they might have a way for the Austrians to allow these peoples to study.</span> <span id="s256">Under pressure, without tuition because as a, as a part of a reparation of what happened to these people.</span> <span id="s257">And that really happened.</span> <span id="s258">The Americans helped us to get into the university, get a very small stipend from the United States.</span> <span id="s259">Not to pay tuition at the university.</span> <span id="s260">We had to, of course, qualify.</span> <span id="s261">There was all kinds of Latin examinations and everything to go through it.</span> <span id="s262">And have some papers to show.</span> <span id="s263">But it was an opportunity for my husband to continue and he fell for it right away.</span> <span id="s264">That was 1946.</span> <span id="s265">October.</span> <span id="s266">They helped us with some living quarters.</span> <span id="s267">Of course it was very crowded and we had to share rooms and things.</span> <span id="s268">But most of the people were single.</span> <span id="s269">There was only another married couple.</span> <span id="s270">And us.</span> <span id="s271">And we were helping each other.</span> <span id="s272">You know and Vienna at that time also had no food.</span> <span id="s273">Everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s274">So you got a little bit of this and a little bit of that.</span> <span id="s275">You put it all in one pot and we had some soup at night.</span> <span id="s276">We felt kind of good about it because we knew that we had a goal.</span> <span id="s277">We knew that we’re doing something for our future.</span> <span id="s278">And it wasn’t very unpleasant because the Jewish student at that time, we came with a small group.</span> <span id="s279">But there were 400 Jewish students at that time in Vienna.</span> <span id="s280">And we were all supported by the Americans through the Austrians that had to do it.</span> <span id="s281">And we were a great group of people.</span> <span id="s282">And we spent 4 years there.</span> <span id="s283">It was kind of very, very nice.</span> <span id="s284">Even though we didn’t have any money, but Vienna is a wonderful place to live.</span> <span id="s285">Even so we felt that we never forgot that they were connected with Hitler and they were anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s286">But of course at that time they didn’t’ show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So that was different than in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Different and you know our hostility primarily was to the Poles, who personally, personally were helping with the Germans.</span> <span id="s289">Personally.</span> <span id="s290">Here at least we were in a country where they allowed us to go to school.</span> <span id="s291">We had the freedom of moving.</span> <span id="s292">I could not work.</span> <span id="s293">They were very strict about people that are not Austrians, very strict.</span> <span id="s294">So illegally somebody employed me for a little bit.</span> <span id="s295">And we just had a gay student life.</span> <span id="s296">You know.</span> <span id="s297">We were young and we didn’t need much and we could go to the opera and stand you know on top there and go to a concert and never sit down.</span> <span id="s298">You know but it was a city that offered a lot to us.</span> <span id="s299">And it was a real bohemian student life that we had.</span> <span id="s300">We had a wonderful group of Jewish people and a lot of feedback you know from the Jews and from the Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s301">And that was the four years in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Is this, were you able to in comparison to the way you felt for years up to this point, were you able at all to relax a bit</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s304">Definitely.</span> <span id="s305">There were other tensions.</span> <span id="s306">You know.</span> <span id="s307">I mean first of all you didn’t’ know the language.</span> <span id="s308">I, I myself went to university because there was the easier things for me to do.</span> <span id="s309">You know and I had to, we had a lot of studying to do in the German language.</span> <span id="s310">The language was foreign to us.</span> <span id="s311">So it was impossible to study.</span> <span id="s312">You don’t know the language.</span> <span id="s313">It was very, very hard at the beginning and my husband was under a lot of pressure in medical school because they didn’t like foreigners you know.</span> <span id="s314">The medical school was gigantic and tremendous and, and they would rather not pass Jewish students and especially foreigners so we had two strikes against us you know.</span> <span id="s315">But somehow we managed.</span> <span id="s316">It was hard.</span> <span id="s317">It was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s318">My husband was under tremendous pressure.</span> <span id="s319">I really didn’t care because it wasn’t that important to me.</span> <span id="s320">I was biding my time, but for him it was very important and he was under tremendous pressure.</span> <span id="s321">Of course a lot of professors were Nazis.</span> <span id="s322">And the level at the university was very, very high at that time.</span> <span id="s323">And he had a hard time.</span> <span id="s324">I mean he had four years of hell because he really had to succeed and get that diploma.</span> <span id="s325">In the meantime, people were trying to see where they can go and what they can do.</span> <span id="s326">A lot of our students did not finish.</span> <span id="s327">Some went to France.</span> <span id="s328">Some went to Italy and illegally to Israel.</span> <span id="s329">And some just stayed out and you know tried to finish, because somehow I made contact with my family.</span> <span id="s330">Distant family in New York.</span> <span id="s331">And through pure coincidence, somebody met somebody on a train and we were talking about people in Lublin.</span> <span id="s332">And somebody mentioned cousins and to make the story short, I found out that there’s a distant relative living in New York, quite well to do.</span> <span id="s333">And having a tremendous family in Europe, being from Europe himself.</span> <span id="s334">And that if I made contact with him that he would probably be able to help us, mostly in, in securing a affidavit to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s335">So while my husband was doing all that, I made contact with these people and I told them what who I was and I told them that we are here and my husband is finishing medical school.</span> <span id="s336">And upon the direction of my uncle I call him uncle, we were advised not to do anything before he gets his diploma.</span> <span id="s337">Because it will be impossible to continue in the United States.</span> <span id="s338">He has to finish.</span> <span id="s339">We just have to stay as long as it takes for him to finish medical school.</span> <span id="s340">And that was our primary goal.</span> <span id="s341">As I said, life in Vienna was not unbearable.</span> <span id="s342">We really had, we managed to have a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s343">We wanted to have a little fun because we were in hell for so many years.</span> <span id="s344">And our youth was practically nothing.</span> <span id="s345">War broke out, I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s346">You know so we really wanted to do a little bit living and, and see what’s going on in this world.</span> <span id="s347">And that wasn’t impossible.</span> <span id="s348">We had our ways to do it.</span> <span id="s349">And finally we waited until he finished medical school and we waited to come to the United States because uncle said that he will a, give us an affidavit to be able to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: There’s one thing I’d like to ask you about which is you’re with all these other students and people who have survived you living in that kind of big barracks or dorm or whatever you want to call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: It was an old school house.</span> <span id="s352">The Germans that they gave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: I’m wondering if there was a lot of discussion and debate among you all about where to go, whether to go to Israel, whether to go to somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: It, it differs a lot.</span> <span id="s355">Some of my friends went to Paris because they had uncles in Paris and they wanted to be with their family.</span> <span id="s356">Family was a big factor.</span> <span id="s357">Whenever somebody had a family they were really flocking to be with their family.</span> <span id="s358">We didn’t’ have anybody anywhere.</span> <span id="s359">A lot of people were Zionists and they really wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s360">Going to Israel was not very simple because it was Palestine and you had to really go on an illegal, on those boats into Italy and (no sound) A lot of people were Zionists and they really wanted to go Israel.</span> <span id="s361">Going to Israel was not very simple because it was Palestine and you had to really go on an illegal on those boats into Italy and illegally but a lot of people did that.</span> <span id="s362">Some of our students, I must tell you are still living in Vienna and never left.</span> <span id="s363">They intermarried and for some reason or other, they were their studies were rather confining to the Austrians.</span> <span id="s364">For instance they had all kinds of social studies and other things where it would be very hard to apply it in a different country.</span> <span id="s365">You know.</span> <span id="s366">We were fortunate because medicine is almost similar or the same all over.</span> <span id="s367">So it was all different.</span> <span id="s368">The majority of, of our students went to Israel.</span> <span id="s369">Whoever had a chance not to go, opted probably to go someplace else.</span> <span id="s370">Some went to South America if they found sponsors.</span> <span id="s371">If they had maybe some relatives.</span> <span id="s372">Now my husband knew that when he will go to the United States he will have to repeat the whole thing and take internships and he was so worn out from this German and he really was in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s373">I mean he was very thin.</span> <span id="s374">He was physically and mentally absolutely exhausted.</span> <span id="s375">And he said to me that he doesn’t see how he can go to a country where he will have to do it all, all over again.</span> <span id="s376">With the language and everything and to get a license to practice, it was, would be very hard for him.</span> <span id="s377">On the other hand, I myself even so I had family in Israel.</span> <span id="s378">And I knew that if I go to Israel I would go home.</span> <span id="s379">But I myself was very worn out from the war.</span> <span id="s380">I couldn’t’ take the burden of being a pioneer again and Israel was at the pioneering stage at that time.</span> <span id="s381">and maybe it was selfish on my part.</span> <span id="s382">But don’t’ forget that I was 13 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s383">I was the one that had to earn the living.</span> <span id="s384">I had the one that had to go to a market and sell under pressure of being recognized.</span> <span id="s385">I was the one that had to deal with apartments and Gestapoes and food and everything else.</span> <span id="s386">I had a burden of not only to take care of myself but I had a brother who was nine year, nine years younger than I was and I had him for almost a year and a half.</span> <span id="s387">And a husband that couldn’t’ show his face on the street.</span> <span id="s388">So I was under, I had a tremendous burden, burden surviving.</span> <span id="s389">And I just couldn’t’ see myself.</span> <span id="s390">The thought of, of being shot or the thought of, of having the Arabs there doing all the things that they were doing at that time in Israel.</span> <span id="s391">There were still wars there.</span> <span id="s392">You know there was the 46 war and there was the 48 independence.</span> <span id="s393">And then there was another war.</span> <span id="s394">The thought of being in another war or, or hearing the shooting again.</span> <span id="s395">It, to me, it was just unbearable.</span> <span id="s396">I knew that I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s397">And I told my husband I would like just to come to a country to live a little bit in peace.</span> <span id="s398">I just want peace.</span> <span id="s399">If later on he wants to go to Israel, if things straighten up, fine.</span> <span id="s400">But I have to have a rest.</span> <span id="s401">I just cannot do it anymore and he understood.</span> <span id="s402">He said ok let’s try.</span> <span id="s403">We’ll see how it works out.</span> <span id="s404">We will you know we were in agreement.</span> <span id="s405">It was</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: He wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: He wanted to go to Israel because the thought of being able to practice and be a doctor right away.</span> <span id="s408">Israel, just as long as you had a diploma, you didn’t have to do anything.</span> <span id="s409">They took to the, to the hospitals there.</span> <span id="s410">You know private medicine was not there.</span> <span id="s411">I mean they never had private medicine.</span> <span id="s412">It was all socialized medicine at that time.</span> <span id="s413">But you could get a job and you would have to do things.</span> <span id="s414">And the thought of him to study another language and starting all over again it wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s415">But he gave in to, he knew that I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s416">He would have a basket case.</span> <span id="s417">As long as I was holding up it was ok.</span> <span id="s418">But I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s419">I was a child.</span> <span id="s420">And I said, I had such a burden and I needed, I needed some space.</span> <span id="s421">So he decided that we’ll come to the United States.</span> <span id="s422">And of course I had the full support of my family who really wanted us to come here.</span> <span id="s423">And my uncle sent affidavits and papers and we waited until my husband finished school.</span> <span id="s424">And we couldn’t wait because ten days later we were already trying to get on our DP status and just take off and leave.</span> <span id="s425">And when we left Vienna there was still a lot of kids that didn’t finish.</span> <span id="s426">Don’t’ forget he was one of the older students.</span> <span id="s427">So he there were kids that stayed and it took them longer to finish or even medical school longer.</span> <span id="s428">They were just starting at Vienna.</span> <span id="s429">He came in already was three years behind him so it was much easier for him.</span> <span id="s430">And we left Vienna and we took off for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: How did you come over?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well that was another story.</span> <span id="s433">You see we were DPs, displaced persons.</span> <span id="s434">And displaced persons were being shipped to the United States on army transports.</span> <span id="s435">Ours was general Bletchford.</span> <span id="s436">And general Bletchford was supposed to be a transporter for 400 soldiers.</span> <span id="s437">We were 1200 people.</span> <span id="s438">And we were going in the middle of November and we had to be taken first from Vienna to a place in Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s439">And there we waited, 3,4,5,6 weeks in a camp until these ships were bringing people over to the United States, back and forth.</span> <span id="s440">And there were maybe three or four ships but at that time there must have been 6, 7000 people waiting there in this camp.</span> <span id="s441">And of course we had to undergo a tremendous medical, physical examination because anything with a spot on your lung, right away you were ejected.</span> <span id="s442">It wasn’t like today that people coming with TB, AIDS and everything else.</span> <span id="s443">It was unbelievable what kind of medical scrutiny we had to undergo.</span> <span id="s444">In order to be able to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s445">We waited about three or four weeks in Bremer and then finally we got on this ship.</span> <span id="s446">The voyage was so bad that we almost didn’t make it because the, the ship was old and we had, we were 1200 people.</span> <span id="s447">The food was absolutely not, not even to talk about.</span> <span id="s448">And look it was for free, so I mean there was the bunk beds and everything.</span> <span id="s449">We just had to go.</span> <span id="s450">And we went to Halifax Canada.</span> <span id="s451">We had 400 people for Halifax Canada.</span> <span id="s452">So first we went, it took us about 12 days.</span> <span id="s453">First we went to Canada.</span> <span id="s454">Got off these people, that, that were for Canada and they all had papers and sponsors.</span> <span id="s455">And we had ten dollars but we had a whole big crate of medical books that my husband couldn’t’ part with.</span> <span id="s456">But became obsolete in a very short time.</span> <span id="s457">He had two microscopes that he wouldn’t part with.</span> <span id="s458">And very little personal belongings.</span> <span id="s459">I have to mention that my uncle was very generous and he tried to help us during the our stay in Vienna.</span> <span id="s460">He was very impressed with the fact that my husband wants to study.</span> <span id="s461">He felt it personally that he wants to help him, although he never met him.</span> <span id="s462">He was, my husband was the only one from the whole family that he was helping and trying to bring over here that showed any interest in, in his, in being a professional man.</span> <span id="s463">And he tried to help us as much as he could.</span> <span id="s464">He used to send us money through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s465">My aunt used to send clothes and warm coats for me or whatever they could, they really did for us.</span> <span id="s466">It wasn’t easy to send stuff over there but they were very nice and very generous.</span> <span id="s467">So that made our stay in Vienna much nicer.</span> <span id="s468">And we finally arrived at the United States.</span> <span id="s469">Well my first impression of the free world was 3:00 in the morning in Halifax in the harbor, seeing a seven or eight year old boy in the middle of the winter all bundled up selling newspapers.</span> <span id="s470">And trying to, to tie up the paper to a rope and throw the paper with the rope over to the ship.</span> <span id="s471">And then these people were, whatever people had was probably dollars because nobody was going with Austrian money.</span> <span id="s472">Then the people would in turn tie the dollar to the rope and throw it back to him.</span> <span id="s473">I never saw that before.</span> <span id="s474">I came from a well to do home and I really haven’t encountered anything like that.</span> <span id="s475">And all I knew about the free world are things are so wonderful.</span> <span id="s476">I mean the idea of in Europe at that time was actually that in America people are finding money on the street.</span> <span id="s477">You know and you were very gullible.</span> <span id="s478">The thought of that boy at 3:00 in the morning just never left me.</span> <span id="s479">And that was like 50 some years ago.</span> <span id="s480">I said does a boy that age at 3:00 in the morning has to sell newspapers like that.</span> <span id="s481">And he was very, very pushy.</span> <span id="s482">And people were dying to have a paper even so they couldn’t read it.</span> <span id="s483">You know.</span> <span id="s484">But then we arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s485">And of course my family was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s486">Also we didn’t’ know each other but we had all kinds of signs, with red carnations and things like that.</span> <span id="s487">And it was very cold in New York.</span> <span id="s488">New York was not very pretty at that time.</span> <span id="s489">It was very windy and we were just absolutely worn down.</span> <span id="s490">From this horrible, horrible trip.</span> <span id="s491">And everybody was taken to HIAS which was the Hebrew aid organization but my uncle did not want us to be there.</span> <span id="s492">Because living circumstances were kind, kind of hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Can I ask you, do you remember or do you have any first impressions or memories of when you came into New York Harbor.</span> <span id="s494">What was that like.</span> <span id="s495">What time was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes, first of all it was Thanksgiving so already on the boat we had turkey.</span> <span id="s497">And I didn’t know anything about Thanksgiving and just one good meal was fabulous.</span> <span id="s498">And they were telling us the crew on the dock, that they were telling us it’s Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s499">And that’s a holiday the Europeans don’t’ have.</span> <span id="s500">And I cherish this holiday til this very day and every time I have family for dinner we always talk about Thanksgiving because this is our anniversary of coming in.</span> <span id="s501">And, and unfortunately it was also Saturday or Sunday.</span> <span id="s502">We couldn’t get off the ship but at least it wasn’t shaking any more.</span> <span id="s503">You had to wait for the customs for Monday morning.</span> <span id="s504">There was all kinds of people with us you know.</span> <span id="s505">There were very religious people which were coming in with crates of china for holidays and china for, for meat and china for milk and china for this.</span> <span id="s506">And it was really funny when the customs opened up those crates and asked them and they really didn’t understand what was going on because china in Europe, especially good porcelain was very inexpensive and these people apparently had money and they tried to bring it all to the United States.</span> <span id="s507">I mean I didn’t’ have this problem.</span> <span id="s508">We had books and two microscopes.</span> <span id="s509">But it was very funny when these people tried to explain to the customs how they had this ritual.</span> <span id="s510">Of not eating from the same dishes you know all the time.</span> <span id="s511">And then of course it was gloomy.</span> <span id="s512">It was dark.</span> <span id="s513">But my aunt came and took us to a little hotel for which my uncle paid for.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: I’m just curious and maybe this is just me from seeing, reading about immigrants and seeing these films.</span> <span id="s515">You always have this image of the boat coming in the harbor and the Statue of Liberty appears.</span> <span id="s516">And all that.</span> <span id="s517">Did you see that.</span> <span id="s518">Do you remember that at all.</span> <span id="s519">You’re shaking your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: It was so windy that at that day when we arrived a brick fell from some big building and killed a person.</span> <span id="s521">You know.</span> <span id="s522">It was just a very gloomy unfriendly day on the 27th of November.</span> <span id="s523">And it was so mammoth to us.</span> <span id="s524">I mean New York.</span> <span id="s525">Just so mammoth.</span> <span id="s526">I’ve never.</span> <span id="s527">I lived in Vienna which is a big city but this was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s528">And of course the language barrier too.</span> <span id="s529">I took a few, knowing that I’m going to be in the United States, I already took a few courses.</span> <span id="s530">At the University.</span> <span id="s531">But that’s a differ, that’s a different English.</span> <span id="s532">Maybe in London I would feel better with it.</span> <span id="s533">And because among all these people that came off the boat I was the only one that knew a few words of English, I always had people with me, trying to go wherever I go because my uncle got us a hotel room.</span> <span id="s534">But the meals, we were supposed to go back to the HIAS 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we had to travel by bus.</span> <span id="s535">And we had to find our way from the hotel to 425 Lafayette Street which I still remember you know.</span> <span id="s536">And there was some other people that stayed in the hotel and every morning and every afternoon I would have these cohorts with me and the taxi drivers were very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s537">When I asked them which way we can walk or can we take the bus, they said no if you take a cab we’ll take you there, but they were very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s538">And while we were in the HIAS every day some American Jews tried to come in and ask us if we want to rent a room, communicating in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s539">And also because at the HIAS there were people from all over the world, Jews.</span> <span id="s540">Speaking all different kind of language.</span> <span id="s541">Well we encountered that in Vienna too.</span> <span id="s542">There were Romanian Jews and Hungarian Jews and they were Latvian Jews and Polish Jews and you know Jews just don’t’ get along very well.</span> <span id="s543">Everybody has a different culture.</span> <span id="s544">Everybody grew up in a different place.</span> <span id="s545">And there was a lot of fighting between them.</span> <span id="s546">And then all of a sudden a lot of people came with little children and the grownups had to look either for an apartment or for a job or anything.</span> <span id="s547">The children were completely lost and they needed a nanny for those children.</span> <span id="s548">So they got me to work with these children.</span> <span id="s549">Every day I would go there in the morning and have my breakfast in this mess hall.</span> <span id="s550">My husband would go to, to Park Row which was the physicians committee who was trying to find internships and residencies through the United States for these Jewish doctors, providing that a community would offer for about 2 years or so assistance, monetary assistance to these people because these people could not work.</span> <span id="s551">And some of them had families.</span> <span id="s552">So they had to find a community that wanted to support this given doctor while he is in training.</span> <span id="s553">So my husband had to go there in the morning and I was working at the HIAS with these children.</span> <span id="s554">And because I speak a few languages, I could communicate with these children.</span> <span id="s555">And for that I was compensated with $25 a week.</span> <span id="s556">Well that was already very good because with the $25 a week we could go to a movie and listen to English.</span> <span id="s557">First of all it was a great thing to go and listen what’s going on.</span> <span id="s558">We also bought a radio because we were putting in quarters into a radio at the hotel and that paid for 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s559">So we figured out well it’s an American idea you know.</span> <span id="s560">You put in a quarter and the radio plays for 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s561">We, we it took us time to figure it out but we wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s562">They told us just to listen to the spoken language.</span> <span id="s563">So finally we decided to buy a radio.</span> <span id="s564">We bought a radio for $25 and we listened to our own radio.</span> <span id="s565">So we, we made an investment but we didn’t have to put in the quarters any more.</span> <span id="s566">And we just waited.</span> <span id="s567">It was a waiting game at that time.</span> <span id="s568">Going to the hotel, coming back, getting a little bit acquainted with the area.</span> <span id="s569">And of course my aunt and uncle always had us over for dinner.</span> <span id="s570">I mean it was Friday night.</span> <span id="s571">They lived at the Riverside drive in a magnificent apartment.</span> <span id="s572">They were very wealthy people but very generous.</span> <span id="s573">They came here during the war, but they already had a lot of businesses and money in Switzerland and they had a tremendous, tremendous family in New York and they were trying to help everybody.</span> <span id="s574">And going there was like a, it was like a fairy tale world, you know.</span> <span id="s575">Because they had a magnificent apartment overlooking the river and they were traveling a lot abroad.</span> <span id="s576">He had businesses in Korea and Japan and all over.</span> <span id="s577">My aunt being a very tiny little aesthetic lady with servants and a chauffeur and, and beautiful things at home.</span> <span id="s578">Well to me it was really like, like a fairy, fairy land you know.</span> <span id="s579">And we were going there for dinner.</span> <span id="s580">And in a very subtle way she would put 20 or 30 dollars in the pocket of my coat because she wouldn’t want to humiliate me to give me the money you know, which was probably different from all the other people that came over here and maybe experienced family relations here you know.</span> <span id="s581">I just had very good, very good feeling and a very good relationship with them.</span> <span id="s582">She always asked me if I need anything.</span> <span id="s583">And I said no we really don’t need anything.</span> <span id="s584">We just have to wait.</span> <span id="s585">We have enough food.</span> <span id="s586">We just have to wait until something happens that my husband gets dispersed to someplace.</span> <span id="s587">And of course we were in a different group of people because other people didn’t’ know what to do with themselves.</span> <span id="s588">We had it a goal.</span> <span id="s589">We knew he has to get an internship and of course we wanted to stay in New York.</span> <span id="s590">Because we didn’t know there was a United States.</span> <span id="s591">We just knew that there is a New York.</span> <span id="s592">And we had a few cousins and my aunt and uncle and we wanted to be in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: So were you getting used to the city.</span> <span id="s594">It wasn’t as intimidating then or it still was.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: It was In, we were there six weeks and it was intimidating.</span> <span id="s596">It was, but you know you get a little better feeling of what’s going on and we were told that we cannot stay in New York.</span> <span id="s597">Because all everybody, all the doctors wanted to stay in New York.</span> <span id="s598">And there isn’t enough hospitals in New York.</span> <span id="s599">And we were told that we should maybe consider going to a small community which is much nicer, where the people are nicer.</span> <span id="s600">Where you can really you don’t feel so lost.</span> <span id="s601">It’s more like a family.</span> <span id="s602">Well the committees are there, the Jewish committees.</span> <span id="s603">Everybody was trying to help the refugees and the Jews had come over.</span> <span id="s604">Everybody felt a little bit guilty you know that that they were there and they survived and they weren’t punished like we were.</span> <span id="s605">So after six weeks they found a very friendly little community in Rochester New York, who was willing to accept a Jewish doctor and help him out.</span> <span id="s606">And they found a hospital that would take him in as a, as an intern.</span> <span id="s607">Cause he needed two years of internship.</span> <span id="s608">And one day we got on a train that was 1950.</span> <span id="s609">We got in a train in New York.</span> <span id="s610">We said goodbye to my aunt and uncle and on the train we came to Rochester New York.</span> <span id="s611">Well the first thing was that we couldn’t’ get off the train because there was that much snow.</span> <span id="s612">New York had, didn’t have any snow and we were just in shoes.</span> <span id="s613">We didn’t’ have any boots or anything like that.</span> <span id="s614">So that was difficult.</span> <span id="s615">We had to go out and buy a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s616">And the committee was very nice.</span> <span id="s617">They waited for us.</span> <span id="s618">And they already had a little room rented from a family that came in, in 1939 and it was a German family.</span> <span id="s619">And they were two working people.</span> <span id="s620">They had an old house.</span> <span id="s621">And they wanted to sublet a room for money.</span> <span id="s622">They needed the money.</span> <span id="s623">Then they looked for a Jewish fellow, a Jewish couple or somebody that would live with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: These people were Jewish or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s626">Yes, these people were Jewish.</span> <span id="s627">The committee, the Jewish committee tried to place us in this home.</span> <span id="s628">And when we went to live with these people, it was a marvelous relationship.</span> <span id="s629">They had one daughter.</span> <span id="s630">And to me it was like having another home because they were extremely friendly.</span> <span id="s631">Not very sophisticated people.</span> <span id="s632">But intelligent.</span> <span id="s633">He was completely uprooted.</span> <span id="s634">He had to work as a presser, pants.</span> <span id="s635">And she was sewing.</span> <span id="s636">A lot of Jewish people were doing that.</span> <span id="s637">But intelligent people.</span> <span id="s638">They sent their daughter to college and we just had a very nice two years with them in Rochester.</span> <span id="s639">Felix had to go into the hospital.</span> <span id="s640">And we were not sorry that we left New York because it was nice.</span> <span id="s641">It was really nice.</span> <span id="s642">Spring came and it was a small town.</span> <span id="s643">And very green and completely different than European cities, with the big old buildings, you know.</span> <span id="s644">Small buildings, small homes.</span> <span id="s645">Back yards, little gardens and it was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s646">And I planned to get myself a job and they said they’re going to try to place me someplace because they didn’t want to completely support us.</span> <span id="s647">At that time I think we were getting 16 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s648">I mean I don’t’ really remember exactly but we were living with these people.</span> <span id="s649">And they were very dear to us until they day they died.</span> <span id="s650">They tried of find me a job.</span> <span id="s651">Felix had a very hard time at the hospital.</span> <span id="s652">First of all he was an (extra?)</span> <span id="s653">between April and July he was an (extern?)</span> <span id="s654">.</span> <span id="s655">July the internship starts.</span> <span id="s656">It was a small hospital but a teaching hospital.</span> <span id="s657">There were 27 interns and residents there.</span> <span id="s658">And they found a lady who was German descent who was a spinster who was quite well to do and wanted to help and she taught him English.</span> <span id="s659">She would actually have him over in her house for dinner.</span> <span id="s660">And she would sit with him for an hour or two speaking German to him and teaching him English.</span> <span id="s661">Very lovely lady.</span> <span id="s662">And they tried to get me a job.</span> <span id="s663">And they found me a job at Woolworth’s where I was selling baked goods.</span> <span id="s664">And that was a six days a week job.</span> <span id="s665">I think I was making 20 some dollars a week.</span> <span id="s666">and it wasn’t a matter of my preference because they were the ones.</span> <span id="s667">It was you know what, maybe it’s a little similar of, to the situation today that people are on welfare.</span> <span id="s668">I was completely depending on them.</span> <span id="s669">I couldn’t say gee I don’t’ want that job because I had 3 years of university in Vienna and I really don’t’ like to stand there and sell fried cakes and doughnuts.</span> <span id="s670">But these people were helping me.</span> <span id="s671">That was temporary.</span> <span id="s672">They were, I couldn’t’ tell them I don’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s673">It wouldn’t’ be fair.</span> <span id="s674">So I had to take the job.</span> <span id="s675">So I took the job and it was very difficult at the beginning.</span> <span id="s676">Because I didn’t know a fried cake from a doughnut.</span> <span id="s677">I mean that was strange to me.</span> <span id="s678">And I was standing at the counter surrounded by younger girls who practically never went to high school.</span> <span id="s679">And they all knew.</span> <span id="s680">I mean they knew people came in and they wanted 3 of this and 6 of this and 5 of this.</span> <span id="s681">And somehow I didn’t’ have to write down on the box and figure out how much they owe me.</span> <span id="s682">Because we were putting the string on and they were adding 18 and 14 and 15.</span> <span id="s683">I somehow did it without having to write it down, because I added it up in my head.</span> <span id="s684">And after six months the sup, no, after that was maybe after 3 months.</span> <span id="s685">The Supervisor came up to me.</span> <span id="s686">She said I see that you’re quite smart.</span> <span id="s687">Maybe we’ll give you a little better job.</span> <span id="s688">Maybe this is not the right job for you.</span> <span id="s689">And I started to speak a little better.</span> <span id="s690">And they said you know what, we’re going to put you in the stock room.</span> <span id="s691">You’re going to make up orders.</span> <span id="s692">The orders come from downstairs and they you’re going to go to the stock room and you’re going to be in stock room.</span> <span id="s693">And you’re going to put together these orders for each station downstairs.</span> <span id="s694">And I was very grateful because I could sit, I didn’t’ have to stand six days a week, 48 hours that was kind of hard.</span> <span id="s695">And I started to work in the stock room.</span> <span id="s696">But I still was not very happy.</span> <span id="s697">And after six months, I was granted one week’s vacation paid.</span> <span id="s698">And as soon as I got my weeks’ vacation I went to the New York state employment agency.</span> <span id="s699">And I said you know what, I don’t’ speak English very well but I have, first of all I had two years of medical school cause I went to medical school.</span> <span id="s700">I said I have two years of medical school.</span> <span id="s701">I know medical terminology and my English is not that great but can you get me a job.</span> <span id="s702">So they offered me right away two jobs.</span> <span id="s703">One was telephone answering, I mean telephone company.</span> <span id="s704">Answering with the numbers and the other one is was at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield.</span> <span id="s705">And I kind of liked that because I was with a husband that was studying medicine forever and ever and ever.</span> <span id="s706">And I had to do with him the you know the lessons and everything else.</span> <span id="s707">And listen to everything so I never came back to Woolworth’s’ I just took the job at the Blue Cross Blue Shield.</span> <span id="s708">And it was entirely different feeling on the job.</span> <span id="s709">I was making $35 a week and after 3 months they would review me.</span> <span id="s710">And I was approving medical claims because I knew the terminology and there was restrictions on certain diagnoses.</span> <span id="s711">And there was certain preexisting conditions and other factors you know.</span> <span id="s712">And I liked it.</span> <span id="s713">I liked my job very much.</span> <span id="s714">I had a desk and I had a phone and I worked with very nice people.</span> <span id="s715">In a very nice office.</span> <span id="s716">And at that time we already moved out from the people there because we wanted to have our own apartment, and I was making already a little money.</span> <span id="s717">And I decided we’re going to take our own apartment because at that time $55 a month.</span> <span id="s718">It was a studio with a drop leaf table and a tiny little kitchen.</span> <span id="s719">But it was our own.</span> <span id="s720">And my husband couldn’t’ wait to get a car.</span> <span id="s721">It was very hard to be without a car because you know it’s a town and you have to get in to the hospitals.</span> <span id="s722">And weekends we couldn’t move any place you know.</span> <span id="s723">We were sitting in that little apartment.</span> <span id="s724">So he had these microscopes and he decided he says you know what I’m going to sell the microscope and buy a car.</span> <span id="s725">Which he did.</span> <span id="s726">He sold the microscope and he bought a little old Plymouth, a 47 Plymouth.</span> <span id="s727">I think it was 5 or 600 dollars.</span> <span id="s728">And he knew how to drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: How did he know how to drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well I think he drove in Europe.</span> <span id="s731">So in Blievitz he already drove.</span> <span id="s732">I mean cars was his thing you know.</span> <span id="s733">So we already had a little car and I was making enough to cover and whenever I didn’t have enough, they would pay me the difference of what I needed for very basic things.</span> <span id="s734">And he started his, his internship and he was quite happy there.</span> <span id="s735">They were very nice to him.</span> <span id="s736">And the hospital was a teaching hospital.</span> <span id="s737">He was very happy and I was working and then on s, because I only worked five days a week, on Saturday and Sunday I sold clothes.</span> <span id="s738">At the Lerner Shop and I made another $12 a week.</span> <span id="s739">And you know it kind of was beginning to work out for us a little bit.</span> <span id="s740">Um.</span> <span id="s741">I like to work for the Blue Cross and he had another year I think on that internship.</span> <span id="s742">In the meantime he tried to apply to get a license at New York State but it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s743">So the second year of his internship I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s744">And we were already married then ten years.</span> <span id="s745">And we had no money and we had nothing but I kind of said to myself you know enough is enough.</span> <span id="s746">I was already 25.</span> <span id="s747">We have to just eventually start a family.</span> <span id="s748">We didn’t’ want a family in Europe because there was no milk, there was no food.</span> <span id="s749">Everybody was starving.</span> <span id="s750">We knew we had to go across to the United States.</span> <span id="s751">We didn’t know what we’re going to come into.</span> <span id="s752">But as rough as it is you know children grow up anyways.</span> <span id="s753">You don’t’ have to have everything for them.</span> <span id="s754">So we decided we’re going to have this baby.</span> <span id="s755">And my little lady that I lived with was absolutely like a mother to me.</span> <span id="s756">I had a very hard time at the beginning and she was there with a pot of soup every single night for me.</span> <span id="s757">And she really took care of me.</span> <span id="s758">She was very, very sweet.</span> <span id="s759">At that time she didn’t work anymore.</span> <span id="s760">She’s got a big part in my heart.</span> <span id="s761">So she kind of took care of me.</span> <span id="s762">And I still worked.</span> <span id="s763">I worked up until 7 or 8 months pregnant.</span> <span id="s764">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s765">If I wasn’t feeling well they gave me a day off.</span> <span id="s766">I must say that they had a lot of respect for me.</span> <span id="s767">And I had my son and at that time I stopped working because there was no other way.</span> <span id="s768">Mothers didn’t work.</span> <span id="s769">Even if you had money or you didn’t have money, you didn’t work.</span> <span id="s770">My husband was making a total of $15 a month.</span> <span id="s771">I don’t’ know if he told you that.</span> <span id="s772">But at that time internships did not pay.</span> <span id="s773">And out of the $15 a month, he had to give them $5 for laundry and the other ten he smoked away day and night.</span> <span id="s774">So there was practically nothing on his side that he could give me.</span> <span id="s775">We had a little car and a tiny apartment</span></p> <p><span id="s776">(end file 1) (file 2 – RG-50.549.01.0019.02.02 – duration: 01:01:47) LUCINE HORN: and the other ten he smoked away.</span> <span id="s777">Day and night.</span> <span id="s778">So there was practically nothing on his side that he could give me.</span> <span id="s779">We had the little car and the tiny apartment.</span> <span id="s780">And we had a baby and as tiny as the apartment was, the baby was there you know.</span> <span id="s781">I mean there was just no other way.</span> <span id="s782">And we were quite happy.</span> <span id="s783">We got a little cat.</span> <span id="s784">And we waited for him to finish the internship.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: What did you name your child?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: My, my son is named after my brother that I lost, the brother that was with me.</span> <span id="s787">His name was Gerald, David.</span> <span id="s788">And my husband’s uncle lost a little boy by the name of Jerry so my son is Gerald David which he hates until this very day but he has to forgive me, I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s789">So</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: One other thing I’m curious about.</span> <span id="s791">There you’re in a circumstance and you know a lot of people have been in the circumstance where you’re you know you are still fairly young and you’re just getting started.</span> <span id="s792">You don’t have the biggest apartment, you don’t’ have much money.</span> <span id="s793">You have a child.</span> <span id="s794">You had all that going.</span> <span id="s795">But I’m also curious again about what it was like, how it felt to you, what went through your mind and heart given what you had come out of.</span> <span id="s796">Given the fact that you were both survivors of the holocaust and now here you are and you’re bringing this new life into the world.</span> <span id="s797">I’m curious about</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: We felt good.</span> <span id="s799">We felt</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Did you think of it in that way at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yes we felt that we’re here to stay.</span> <span id="s802">We want to raise a family.</span> <span id="s803">Sooner or later my husband is going to make it.</span> <span id="s804">It’s going to be rough at the beginning.</span> <span id="s805">It wasn’t like we thought we were doomed for life.</span> <span id="s806">I always had this future ahead of me that he is going to make it.</span> <span id="s807">And we were used to do with very little.</span> <span id="s808">That’s how I grew up.</span> <span id="s809">I grew up knowing how to cook from nothing.</span> <span id="s810">I knew to make a soup from garbage.</span> <span id="s811">That’s how I grew up.</span> <span id="s812">We didn’t have anything during the war.</span> <span id="s813">And we had to sustain ourselves.</span> <span id="s814">When there was a piece of old bread, we didn’t throw it out.</span> <span id="s815">You soaked it in milk and you made like this and you put in a little sugar and you baked it.</span> <span id="s816">In the oven.</span> <span id="s817">That’s how I grew up.</span> <span id="s818">So I guess we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: You make a cake out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yes, we were finally happy.</span> <span id="s821">We thought we arrived.</span> <span id="s822">And we liked everything about the United States.</span> <span id="s823">We really did.</span> <span id="s824">We liked the way the people were.</span> <span id="s825">We liked the way the Jewish community everywhere embraced us.</span> <span id="s826">There wasn’t a holiday in Rochester New York that we weren’t invited to doctors’ homes for dinner.</span> <span id="s827">Saturday nights they invited us.</span> <span id="s828">At the hospital they had dinners with daddies at the cafeteria.</span> <span id="s829">And the greatest thing, we lived not far away, took a buggy and the baby and in the basement it was the biggest thing to had dinner with daddy because we never saw him.</span> <span id="s830">I didn’t’ have to have washing machines and dryers.</span> <span id="s831">I lived one flight up walking.</span> <span id="s832">Tiny little apartment.</span> <span id="s833">I had to take the baby every morning with a bag of diapers, soiled diapers on the buggy.</span> <span id="s834">Walk about 4 or 5 blocks to the laundromat, put in a quarter to wash the diapers.</span> <span id="s835">But I could not spend another quarter to dry them because I could hang it outside.</span> <span id="s836">So the baby was sleeping.</span> <span id="s837">The diapers were being washed.</span> <span id="s838">I put another bag of laundry on the buggy.</span> <span id="s839">Went back home, took him in the backyard, without lines hang the diapers out.</span> <span id="s840">And that’s the way we lived.</span> <span id="s841">And we were very, very happy.</span> <span id="s842">I knew it is not forever.</span> <span id="s843">And I knew that it has to be that way.</span> <span id="s844">There’s just no other way.</span> <span id="s845">But we arrived to freedom, we arrived with people that are being good to us, that are being very encouraging to us.</span> <span id="s846">I did not have very much to do with my uncle at that time.</span> <span id="s847">Because uncle constantly asked if he can help us.</span> <span id="s848">And my husband constantly said I don’t need anything.</span> <span id="s849">Thank you.</span> <span id="s850">We don’t need more clothes right now.</span> <span id="s851">We don’t’ need fancy cars right now.</span> <span id="s852">We don’t’ need a fancy apartment right now.</span> <span id="s853">I’m going to arrive and I’m going to have it myself.</span> <span id="s854">You know I’d occasionally they’d send a, an outfit for the baby or something like that but we were proud and we felt we can make it on our own.</span> <span id="s855">There was no necessity.</span> <span id="s856">They did enough for us and we appreciated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: I’m must curious.</span> <span id="s858">Leaving aside the material side of this and how all you had to do to be inventive to take care of yourself and your child in a situation.</span> <span id="s859">In another sense a few years after the war, so many millions of people killed.</span> <span id="s860">You and your husband both lost almost all of your families.</span> <span id="s861">And now you have brought this new being into the world.</span> <span id="s862">What I’m curious about and maybe this isn’t the way you looked at it.</span> <span id="s863">I’m just curious whether you had any feelings or emotions or thoughts of like you know we are helping to in having this child you were bringing something back or you were helping to restore things or you know what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s864">And I don’t’ know.</span> <span id="s865">I wasn’t there but I’m curious wither you had any sense of</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Well to tell you the truth we were too busy struggling.</span> <span id="s867">There was no time for to philosophize.</span> <span id="s868">To give you an example of how my husband worked.</span> <span id="s869">There were three day shifts.</span> <span id="s870">He would start in the morning at 6:00 on Monday and he wouldn’t be home til Wednesday night.</span> <span id="s871">He would work all Monday, Monday night.</span> <span id="s872">All Tuesday, Tuesday night and Wednesday he would come home at 5.</span> <span id="s873">His feet were swollen from running around.</span> <span id="s874">Ok.</span> <span id="s875">I had to put his feet and soak it.</span> <span id="s876">He would have his dinner.</span> <span id="s877">He would hug the baby and go to sleep.</span> <span id="s878">And Thursday morning we would try the same sequence of three days.</span> <span id="s879">There was very little togetherness.</span> <span id="s880">There was very little feedback.</span> <span id="s881">We had no time to dwell upon anything.</span> <span id="s882">We even had no time to communicate.</span> <span id="s883">When I was pregnant and very sick.</span> <span id="s884">I had to be there alone because he was not there for me.</span> <span id="s885">Because he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s886">So on top of having financial hard times, we had a very tough life.</span> <span id="s887">He had to work 36 hours in a row.</span> <span id="s888">And I had to be the one to take care of my child.</span> <span id="s889">There was just on other way.</span> <span id="s890">There was no baby sitter.</span> <span id="s891">There was no money for it.</span> <span id="s892">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s893">And of course, not a car.</span> <span id="s894">I had to do everything, all my shopping and grocery shopping and everything on that little buggy and walk to the store and do it back and forth.</span> <span id="s895">I had nice people.</span> <span id="s896">I had nice neighbors but they weren’t really interested to do many things for me.</span> <span id="s897">So it was hard but we knew that we are in a land of freedom.</span> <span id="s898">We appreciate being here.</span> <span id="s899">Every minute of the day.</span> <span id="s900">We didn’t dwell upon going back.</span> <span id="s901">Some immigrants said oh you know what in the old country they didn’t do it like that.</span> <span id="s902">They did it this way.</span> <span id="s903">For us it was everything that we found here was a plus and a positive feeling.</span> <span id="s904">We did not think of ever going back because maybe things were different over there.</span> <span id="s905">there was no going back.</span> <span id="s906">there was only a black wall from what happened there and everything here was good and rosy.</span> <span id="s907">We took the little blanket on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s908">We went to a Delaware park and we put the blanket on the, on the grass and the baby was laying then and my husband took a camera and took pictures.</span> <span id="s909">That was our happiness.</span> <span id="s910">And we wanted to dwell on the happiness and not go back to the black years because otherwise we just mentally could never make it.</span> <span id="s911">I wanted to be a sound, psych, I mean a sound mother for my child.</span> <span id="s912">I wanted to give him some sense of values.</span> <span id="s913">I didn’t want them to have a frustrated mother who was thinking about what happened.</span> <span id="s914">What happened, happened.</span> <span id="s915">It was hell.</span> <span id="s916">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s917">It took my heart out.</span> <span id="s918">But here I am a young mother.</span> <span id="s919">I’m 25 years old.</span> <span id="s920">I have to start my life and do the best out of it.</span> <span id="s921">I cannot psychologically allow myself to do that because I have now a husband that’s struggling.</span> <span id="s922">I have a, I have a child.</span> <span id="s923">I want a family.</span> <span id="s924">I want these positive things, even for myself.</span> <span id="s925">We had a group of people there that we used to meet.</span> <span id="s926">Mother, young mothers that we were all in the same predicament.</span> <span id="s927">We were helping each other.</span> <span id="s928">One had to go to the doctor.</span> <span id="s929">The other one was babysitting.</span> <span id="s930">You know, out of necessity.</span> <span id="s931">We always found nice people around us.</span> <span id="s932">I never felt that moving from town to town was such a struggle because there was always nice people around us.</span> <span id="s933">Whether it was from the Jewish committee or was from the doctor’s or was from the resident.</span> <span id="s934">When my son was born at the hospital where my husband was interning ok.</span> <span id="s935">We had zero money.</span> <span id="s936">And we had nothing.</span> <span id="s937">The girls in the office who were all single were so thrilled that I was pregnant that they didn’t know what to do for me.</span> <span id="s938">They wanted to buy me everything.</span> <span id="s939">I said look it’s an old custom in Europe.</span> <span id="s940">You don’t buy anything, no showers.</span> <span id="s941">I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s942">I just don’t’ believe in it.</span> <span id="s943">So they took money together and as soon as the baby was born, they bought a buggy.</span> <span id="s944">They bought me a bassinette.</span> <span id="s945">They bought whatever I needed.</span> <span id="s946">When that baby was born, my husband got a little nurse from, from the nursery to come with me for a week and teach me what to do with the baby.</span> <span id="s947">There was no babies in my family.</span> <span id="s948">I never picked up a baby in my life.</span> <span id="s949">I was scared.</span> <span id="s950">That little girl would not charge me a dime.</span> <span id="s951">She would come over.</span> <span id="s952">She had a week off.</span> <span id="s953">She would stay with me and show me how to diaper and wash the baby.</span> <span id="s954">And she gave me so much confidence.</span> <span id="s955">So that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s956">And then there was another miracle that I didn’t know happens in this country.</span> <span id="s957">Everybody brought gifts to the hospital.</span> <span id="s958">There was 27 residents and interns and nurses and the window in the hospital.</span> <span id="s959">At that time you stayed a week.</span> <span id="s960">They didn’t, they didn’t throw you up, out like today.</span> <span id="s961">The window in the hospital was full of stuff.</span> <span id="s962">There was, they brought me diapers.</span> <span id="s963">They brought me little outfits.</span> <span id="s964">They brought me a little thing to take the baby home.</span> <span id="s965">It was just a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s966">I wasn’t forgotten.</span> <span id="s967">I wasn’t by myself.</span> <span id="s968">People really did care.</span> <span id="s969">By the time I came home, the baby had a lot of things already.</span> <span id="s970">And I kind of knew that you know having a baby is happiness and, and it’s going to work.</span> <span id="s971">It just absolute first.</span> <span id="s972">There were things like being hand me downs you know.</span> <span id="s973">There were people that were calling this lady that was teaching my husband.</span> <span id="s974">And asking if the Horns need anything.</span> <span id="s975">Can we send some linen to the house or can we send some other things or do they need blankets.</span> <span id="s976">These people just really because of the small town they wanted really to be helpful to us.</span> <span id="s977">And they were.</span> <span id="s978">So that’s how life was in Rochester, New York.</span> <span id="s979">And then my husband finished his internship and there was a big dilemma, what to do.</span> <span id="s980">Because he still couldn’t’ get a permit to stay in New York state and get a license and he really wanted to get a license in New York state because he already had a lot of doctors that wanted him to work with them.</span> <span id="s981">And we already knew a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s982">And he did want to get licensed from New York State and they were making all kinds of trouble for him.</span> <span id="s983">At that time there was a law that whoever finished medicine after the war in Vienna, cannot be allowed to, to take the boards.</span> <span id="s984">There was all kinds of changes and all kinds of politics going on.</span> <span id="s985">And the outcome of it was that he just couldn’t get a license to practice right away.</span> <span id="s986">So we decided that he will maybe become a house physician for a while because we needed some money desperately.</span> <span id="s987">And maybe he work on a salary to the hospital.</span> <span id="s988">And we didn’t want to do it in Rochester because we found some very dear friends in Buffalo New York which was about only 70 miles away.</span> <span id="s989">And that was a little bigger town.</span> <span id="s990">Buffalo had a million and Rochester had maybe 350,000.</span> <span id="s991">And I always liked to live in a little bigger town.</span> <span id="s992">So my husband got a job in the hospital in Buffalo New York.</span> <span id="s993">At the very not too much of a salary but at least some start.</span> <span id="s994">And we moved to Buffalo, New York to be with these friends that we knew from way back.</span> <span id="s995">And unfortunately were there for 7 years.</span> <span id="s996">We just couldn’t’ get out.</span> <span id="s997">He was working and making some money.</span> <span id="s998">And we bought a new car, because he always wanted a car on payment.</span> <span id="s999">And I never could go back to work because I had the little boy.</span> <span id="s1000">And we somehow managed.</span> <span id="s1001">It was nice.</span> <span id="s1002">We met an awful lot of dear friends.</span> <span id="s1003">And we made a life there you know.</span> <span id="s1004">He was getting a little bit more money and then he was out working nights so for the nights he was compensated extra and being a small town you really don’t need that much money.</span> <span id="s1005">You pay monthly for a telephone $5.</span> <span id="s1006">You know the expenses were much less.</span> <span id="s1007">We happened to find some wonderful people that we rented from and it was very inexpensive and she became like a, like a mother to me and like a nanny.</span> <span id="s1008">She really helped me bring up my children.</span> <span id="s1009">In the meantime I had another child, I had my daughter in Buffalo, four years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: What year was this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: That was 56.</span> <span id="s1012">He was born in 52 and that was in 56.</span> <span id="s1013">And we, we had an awful lot of fun.</span> <span id="s1014">I had a lot of nice people but we were all together, one group of people from the Holocaust, trying to raise families and trying to make a life for themselves.</span> <span id="s1015">Some were in business.</span> <span id="s1016">Some were professional.</span> <span id="s1017">They were just trying to establish a life.</span> <span id="s1018">And we were helping each other.</span> <span id="s1019">We were visiting each other.</span> <span id="s1020">We had parties together.</span> <span id="s1021">And we just had a very nice life.</span> <span id="s1022">Except my husband was still on the job and he wanted to go on his own.</span> <span id="s1023">And he tried all the time to be, be able to take the license in New York state.</span> <span id="s1024">And Albany absolutely wouldn’t’ allow him to do this.</span> <span id="s1025">After all that.</span> <span id="s1026">And that was very frustrating.</span> <span id="s1027">Because we could never achieve anything the way he was working.</span> <span id="s1028">His salary was $350 a month.</span> <span id="s1029">I mean that wasn’t enough for a family to survive.</span> <span id="s1030">And he really wanted to go out on his own.</span> <span id="s1031">Even so, some doctors, he was helping some doctors occasionally and he was helping them during vacation but it was still very, very hard.</span> <span id="s1032">And one day we were so frustrated and he kept on waiting and waiting and waiting.</span> <span id="s1033">And some doctors tried through senators and you know political influences and all stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1034">And then finally we decided that we’re going to go in person to Albany, New York and we’re going to speak to the head person over there in the education department.</span> <span id="s1035">And really talk it over with him and ask him what we should do.</span> <span id="s1036">And we did that.</span> <span id="s1037">We went, was a very nice man at that time, an older man.</span> <span id="s1038">He sat down with us and he said Dr. Horn if I have to give you a good piece of advice, leave Buffalo tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1039">There is a big United States and there is a lot of states that allow foreign trained physicians to take the boards and you can make just as good a living if you go someplace else.</span> <span id="s1040">I know it’s hard.</span> <span id="s1041">You don’t know anybody but you just have to do it.</span> <span id="s1042">If you sit and wait here you’ll never probably be able to practice in New York State.</span> <span id="s1043">We didn’t’ realize that each state had a different, that this is a matter of federalism you know.</span> <span id="s1044">It’s not like uniform for the whole country.</span> <span id="s1045">And my husband decided to take the boards in Ohio and in Illinois and in 1960 because we were three years, two years in Rochester.</span> <span id="s1046">Then we were in Buffalo New York from 53 practically to 59.</span> <span id="s1047">Well he worked as a house physician.</span> <span id="s1048">And then in 59 he came to take the boards in November.</span> <span id="s1049">To Ohio and Illinois and he passed in both places.</span> <span id="s1050">And because he really loved Chicago he decided, we decided to move.</span> <span id="s1051">And in 1960 in February.</span> <span id="s1052">My son was seven or 7 and a half; my daughter was four.</span> <span id="s1053">We moved to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: And he had been to Chicago and decided this is where he wanted</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: He only came here to take the boards, but he met some nice people.</span> <span id="s1056">He met some doctors.</span> <span id="s1057">He made some, he made some contact with people that told him they would help him to get on boards, on staff of the hospital and maybe even give him a job.</span> <span id="s1058">You know he wanted to work with somebody for a while.</span> <span id="s1059">Because moving to Chicago was a big expense, first of all.</span> <span id="s1060">And second of all he, the last six months before he took the boards he was not working because he really had to prepare for the boards.</span> <span id="s1061">It was very hard to take the boards and he could not be working and doing these things.</span> <span id="s1062">So that completely exhausted our savings.</span> <span id="s1063">And he the cost of living was ten times as much as in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1064">So he really needed a job and he came out here a few times, made some contacts and got a job with another doctor, on a salary.</span> <span id="s1065">And when we moved we got a little apartment.</span> <span id="s1066">It was on the west side in Elmwood park so that we can he can be closer to the practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: I was just curious.</span> <span id="s1068">He had been here even though it was briefly, when you moved to come out here, had you even been here at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes, I was here twice</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: OH ok</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: We loved Chicago.</span> <span id="s1072">Through some acquaintances we met an awful lot of nice people.</span> <span id="s1073">Before I was even living here.</span> <span id="s1074">We were invited to a party, we were invited to dinner and it was just very nice people that we met.</span> <span id="s1075">And we were very encouraged to move to Chicago rather than to he loved the city and so did I. And we always like to live in a big city.</span> <span id="s1076">So we decided to move and in 1960 in February we moved.</span> <span id="s1077">We had a little apartment.</span> <span id="s1078">Not far away where my husband was working.</span> <span id="s1079">He was working very hard.</span> <span id="s1080">He took all the night calls.</span> <span id="s1081">Practically ran the office for the other doctor, cause the other doctor went in for a specialty.</span> <span id="s1082">He wanted to get a specialty so for the big practice and Felix ran the practice.</span> <span id="s1083">But he wasn’t happy being with somebody because he has to do things his own way.</span> <span id="s1084">He, he understands medicine his own way.</span> <span id="s1085">His rapport with patients is very special and, and maybe a little different than this American doctor was.</span> <span id="s1086">And he was always dreaming after all these years and he was already ten years later than most other doctors.</span> <span id="s1087">He wanted to go into practice.</span> <span id="s1088">By then he was already on staff of two hospitals and he needed a little courage because he was afraid to just put up a shingle because he still had a wife and two children to support.</span> <span id="s1089">And there was no talk about me going to work.</span> <span id="s1090">That never existed in my head.</span> <span id="s1091">I would never leave my children with somebody else and go to work.</span> <span id="s1092">I mean I just wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1093">I would wait until my husband can do a better, give me a better life.</span> <span id="s1094">But I never thought of do, none of my friends every did it.</span> <span id="s1095">At that time it wasn’t even in style.</span> <span id="s1096">There was no places to leave these children.</span> <span id="s1097">There was nobody to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1098">There was no immigrant people that would take care of children at that time.</span> <span id="s1099">You just had to raise your own family and that was it.</span> <span id="s1100">And that was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: I should ask you.</span> <span id="s1102">We didn’t say your daughter was born what year and what did you name here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Oh I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1104">I just liked Linda so I named her Linda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Ok so your son got the names of relatives and then your daughter got a name that you liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yes, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1107">And at that time I didn’t’ even know that it means beautiful in Spanish.</span> <span id="s1108">Now I do.</span> <span id="s1109">And we moved here and he was working.</span> <span id="s1110">And then I kind of encouraged him to go on his own.</span> <span id="s1111">He was not happy with this other doctor.</span> <span id="s1112">And I knew it’s not going to work out for him.</span> <span id="s1113">So somehow with very humble beginnings, he started out his own practice.</span> <span id="s1114">He succeeded right away.</span> <span id="s1115">He was very well liked.</span> <span id="s1116">His manners were just fabulous.</span> <span id="s1117">People just loved him.</span> <span id="s1118">He delivered babies.</span> <span id="s1119">He was in general practice.</span> <span id="s1120">He was doing a lot of things with families and generations of families.</span> <span id="s1121">And he had a small office at the beginning and then we bought the house.</span> <span id="s1122">And we always kind of thought we have good thoughts.</span> <span id="s1123">We thought we’re going to make it and we did.</span> <span id="s1124">And I always stood behind him and always encouraged him to, to you know to do these things and take risks.</span> <span id="s1125">And he was very happy in his small office at the beginning but then there was an opportunity to buy a small building.</span> <span id="s1126">He always wanted to have his own place.</span> <span id="s1127">So we bought this building.</span> <span id="s1128">In 19, I really don’t recall.</span> <span id="s1129">86 he sold it.</span> <span id="s1130">It was 25 years old.</span> <span id="s1131">It must have been 61.</span> <span id="s1132">He bought a small building and he had ten rooms.</span> <span id="s1133">He had a very nice practice.</span> <span id="s1134">Very nicely furnished and I was raising my family.</span> <span id="s1135">And always wanted to finish college because I never finished.</span> <span id="s1136">As soon as we left Vienna there was no sense for me to, to sit around and get a degree.</span> <span id="s1137">So as soon as my children went to school full time, I went back to Rosewood University and got my masters.</span> <span id="s1138">And somehow never worked because my husband liked to take long vacations and I started to work for school system and was teaching German.</span> <span id="s1139">That was my major and it was always a conflict with vacations so I didn’t’ want to be deprived.</span> <span id="s1140">I just didn’t’ have the freedom to do what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1141">And he was making a good living so I really didn’t have to work anymore.</span> <span id="s1142">And I decided to go back to school, finish school.</span> <span id="s1143">And it wasn’t until way into his practice.</span> <span id="s1144">I always wanted to help in his practice, but he always said that it’s just not proper for a wife to help.</span> <span id="s1145">And until there was an accident in the office that his nurse broke her hip and then we couldn’t’ replace the nurse.</span> <span id="s1146">And I started to work for him.</span> <span id="s1147">And I worked for him for nine years.</span> <span id="s1148">And when he sold his office, I am working now ten years for my son.</span> <span id="s1149">So I’ve always been doing something.</span> <span id="s1150">And the experience and the privilege of being a full time mother and not having to really go out of home and stay with my children has so tremendously paid off.</span> <span id="s1151">Because my children always appreciated are just so close that we just could not be a closer family there is.</span> <span id="s1152">My children always knew that we are just orphans.</span> <span id="s1153">And that just the four of us and nobody else.</span> <span id="s1154">And they always knew that they have to be extra sensitive.</span> <span id="s1155">And that’s how wonderful with us and we felt the same thing with them.</span> <span id="s1156">Because none of us had anybody else.</span> <span id="s1157">There was not a grandma, and an uncle and an aunt and a cousin.</span> <span id="s1158">They had nobody.</span> <span id="s1159">They just had us.</span> <span id="s1160">And we just had to be there for them.</span> <span id="s1161">He, the, their father was not home.</span> <span id="s1162">My husband put in tremendous late hours.</span> <span id="s1163">Seven days a week.</span> <span id="s1164">And I knew that if I go or if I do things in the evening and get a sitter, these children are just not going to have a parent around.</span> <span id="s1165">And somehow my biggest pleasure was to be with them, until this very day.</span> <span id="s1166">It still it’s the same way.</span> <span id="s1167">We just are very happy to be with each other.</span> <span id="s1168">Even so they are grown now and they have their own families.</span> <span id="s1169">But we just have a tremendous relationship with each other.</span> <span id="s1170">And this is in a way the gratification of my life.</span> <span id="s1171">Because I always feel that if god took away my parents when I was 12, and all this horror was happening to me, maybe he repaid me in a certain gratification that I am still at that age here, sound mind.</span> <span id="s1172">And I can enjoy the fruit of my life and I can enjoy and be with children who have never moved away, who live in the same town.</span> <span id="s1173">Who are so close and that we understand each other so well.</span> <span id="s1174">And I always feel that there is maybe a certain gratification in life and this was the compensation of all the ills that I had in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Can I ask you how much did your children learn about your particular story and your husband’s and the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1176">What age did that start at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Well I would say that from the very beginning when they understood when they were maybe 12, 14 years old, when I my son was bar mitzvah, we always told them what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1178">You know they were always looking for grandparents and grandmothers and grandfathers.</span> <span id="s1179">Their friends had it and we always had to tell them what happened.</span> <span id="s1180">And we were piecemeal.</span> <span id="s1181">We were telling them.</span> <span id="s1182">For instance we used to go on vacation and I could spend two, three weeks sitting at the beach sitting next to my children.</span> <span id="s1183">Especially next to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1184">And I would tell her piecemeal stories of what happened.</span> <span id="s1185">At the beginning I didn’t want to shock them because they were you know sensitive and young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Would you wait for them to ask questions or would you bring things up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: They would ask questions but I mostly was telling them my life story.</span> <span id="s1188">I made an audiotape a little bit on my tape recorder.</span> <span id="s1189">They were asking questions and they wanted to know and we told them.</span> <span id="s1190">We felt good about telling them of what happened.</span> <span id="s1191">It wasn’t until they became all grown up and understood more and maybe because of their feelings towards us, they felt that they felt uncomfortable thinking how hurt we were.</span> <span id="s1192">They began to feel very sorry for us that we had to go through this experience.</span> <span id="s1193">And they were treating us very tenderly and very specially.</span> <span id="s1194">Like they would want to spare us the thought all these bad thoughts that we went through.</span> <span id="s1195">And it reached a point where my children had not seen the tapes that you just viewed from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1196">They each had a set in the safe because they sent us three copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: These are the interviews you did with the museum.</span> <span id="s1198">A couple years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yes, yes and they probably are going to see it after they, after we’re gone.</span> <span id="s1200">But they just cannot bring themselves to listen any more now to all these stories.</span> <span id="s1201">And I have to tell you that they didn’t go to see Schindler’s List.</span> <span id="s1202">My son saw Shoah and he’s never been the same.</span> <span id="s1203">And my daughter who cries at weddings, that’s how sensitive she is, she’s really the last person that can take it.</span> <span id="s1204">So they do know and they do read, but as far as asking questions constantly, it hurts them.</span> <span id="s1205">They’re protective of us.</span> <span id="s1206">They understand now that they are getting old.</span> <span id="s1207">They feel bad.</span> <span id="s1208">We were going like to lecture and we lectured a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1209">Lately we find that it’s much harder to talk about it, because when you get older you know, your nerves are shattered and we cry more when we tell the story.</span> <span id="s1210">We cry more when we think about it.</span> <span id="s1211">So they want to spare us this.</span> <span id="s1212">They just want us to live right now as long as we have without really going into it.</span> <span id="s1213">When I tell them that I’m going to see a movie or when I told them that I went to see Schindler’s List, I watched something on television, they get really upset because they feel it’s not for us to go through it.</span> <span id="s1214">It’s for the other people to go and watch you know.</span> <span id="s1215">They don’t want to hurt us more than we do.</span> <span id="s1216">And then this thing came up about a few months ago that maybe my brother could be alive you know so they both went absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s1217">Even the grandchildren and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1218">I had some very false hopes.</span> <span id="s1219">I don’t know if they’re false.</span> <span id="s1220">It’s possible that he is alive but we are now in the process of trying to see.</span> <span id="s1221">If, if this is really so and what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1223">I should just say for the record here that in your video testimony and then in the audio interview that I did with your husband the other day he told the story of how you lost your younger brother and he was tricked and the whole thing with the phony resort and that after the war, as far as you knew that he had not survived.</span> <span id="s1224">And that in the last month or so or in the last few months you’ve gotten some information that he may well have survived and you’re trying to possibly locate him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: And I might just not ever find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: So that that has been covered.</span> <span id="s1227">That story was talked about in other interviews.</span> <span id="s1228">I don’t know if you want to say anything about it.</span> <span id="s1229">Be my guest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I told the story in my interview about how I lost him and what happened in that time.</span> <span id="s1231">and there isn’t too much not too much has been written about this simple incident of this hotel that he was, that he went with.</span> <span id="s1232">(no sound) There isn’t too much not too much has been written about this simple incident of this hotel that he was that he went with.</span> <span id="s1233">But the Holocaust Museum was very helpful to me and they found the book at the library and they sent it to me.</span> <span id="s1234">And this book covers everything that happened at that time so it’s been documented.</span> <span id="s1235">And coincidentally yesterday I had company here.</span> <span id="s1236">And somebody saw this book laying around.</span> <span id="s1237">And they opened up the book and they found somebody that they know who survived.</span> <span id="s1238">So now I’m going to try to contact this person and see if maybe they know anything you know.</span> <span id="s1239">But it’s been a search.</span> <span id="s1240">It’s certainly gave me a little encouragement knowing that maybe even if I never find him that he might be alive.</span> <span id="s1241">And if I find him or not that’s another story.</span> <span id="s1242">But I’m happy to share all my thoughts with whoever is going to ever see it and read it and I must add that the enthusiasm and the happiness that this country has given me and I know my husband too, it’s really been my country.</span> <span id="s1243">I mean I cherish Israel and I go there very often and this is really a part of me.</span> <span id="s1244">My father was a Zionist and he was founder of a youth group in my home town.</span> <span id="s1245">He is written up in several books.</span> <span id="s1246">I grew up in a Zionist home.</span> <span id="s1247">I never thought of myself that I’m not going to live in Palestine because I really wanted to be there.</span> <span id="s1248">My father was 25 years old.</span> <span id="s1249">He went to Palestine to live there with my mother.</span> <span id="s1250">And he got very sick with malaria, and returned.</span> <span id="s1251">I still have relatives that tell me all that.</span> <span id="s1252">And I never thought of myself as not living in Israel.</span> <span id="s1253">Israel is a part of me.</span> <span id="s1254">But I have been very, very happy and I think both of us now agree that we made the right choice to come to the United States and more or less now things are very bad here too as far as safety is concerned.</span> <span id="s1255">But at least things weren’t that bad and I didn’t’ have to worry about my children being shot all the time and going into the army again.</span> <span id="s1256">And I feel that this country is my home.</span> <span id="s1257">I am very patriotic towards that country and I really, it really hurts me to see how things have been recently and how this country has gone down, and down and down and it’s not really a country I came to in the 50s and 60s.</span> <span id="s1258">The United States gave the opportunity to all my friends who really rebuilt their lives, educated their children.</span> <span id="s1259">Started out from nothing.</span> <span id="s1260">And somehow through hard work and being frugal and being thrifty and being maybe believing in God in their own way, and showing their children the values and wanting to educate their children and better themselves.</span> <span id="s1261">They have all arrived and they have all achieved.</span> <span id="s1262">This is the group of people I am with and I must say that even American people admire that very much.</span> <span id="s1263">They really admire this group of immigrants that came in, in the 1950s and really helped build this country up after the war.</span> <span id="s1264">We were part of it and we’re very proud of it, even though we didn’t’ fight for this country.</span> <span id="s1265">But we really feel and that’s why right now I am so disillusioned when I see all these ugly things that are happening here and the insecurities that children have to be brought up.</span> <span id="s1266">Even my grandchildren I mean.</span> <span id="s1267">There is no safety for them.</span> <span id="s1268">There is no security.</span> <span id="s1269">It’s just rough, it’s very rough now.</span> <span id="s1270">And we came to this country things weren’t like this.</span> <span id="s1271">We were walking around in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1272">We never locked our doors.</span> <span id="s1273">I wasn’t worried when my kids went away, when they were driving, when they were going places.</span> <span id="s1274">Now it’s just constant, constant fear.</span> <span id="s1275">And I hope that maybe it will take a couple of years or so and maybe things are going to be back to where they were before.</span> <span id="s1276">If at all possible.</span> <span id="s1277">Because it could also be a global phenomenon.</span> <span id="s1278">Maybe it’s just not the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: You mentioned to me that there had been a change in your children and that now they don’t’ want to talk about the Holocaust and they want to sort of spare you any further sorrow because of that.</span> <span id="s1280">I’m curious, when did that happen?</span> <span id="s1281">How old were they when they changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: When they became grown human beings.</span> <span id="s1283">I mean you know my son was a student and when he became a father himself he understood it more.</span> <span id="s1284">And I think with my daughter the same.</span> <span id="s1285">It evolved by them going into our shoes.</span> <span id="s1286">My daughter feels the privilege of having a mother and a father so strongly that when she thinks that I didn’t’ have it, it just breaks her heart.</span> <span id="s1287">It absolutely breaks her heart.</span> <span id="s1288">She constantly tells me look at my little girl.</span> <span id="s1289">She’s got two grandma’s and two grandpa’s.</span> <span id="s1290">And you know I didn’t have it but I know it, she understood what it meant for me being 13 years old and not to have a mother.</span> <span id="s1291">Because she herself at the age of 40 needs me every single day.</span> <span id="s1292">So they became more aware of it when they became grown human beings.</span> <span id="s1293">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1294">I don’t know if I’m expressing it well.</span> <span id="s1295">But when they became parents and when they see what’s going on, it just they understood what we went through.</span> <span id="s1296">Regardless of the fact that people were killed in gas chambers and everything else.</span> <span id="s1297">That’s the global tragedy that happened during the war to six million Jews.</span> <span id="s1298">But on a personal level they relate to our lives.</span> <span id="s1299">And that’s very painful to them and very important.</span> <span id="s1300">I don’t know if that answers your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: It does.</span> <span id="s1302">You mentioned your son saw Shoah and you said, I think the exact way you said it was he was never the same after that.</span> <span id="s1303">What happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: He just told me that he doesn’t want to see these things again.</span> <span id="s1305">He just can’t bear it.</span> <span id="s1306">He cannot bear it because his own parents were so involved in it.</span> <span id="s1307">And his own grandparents could have been laying there in the ditch.</span> <span id="s1308">He just cannot face up to and he just cannot take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: And then a movie like Schindler’s List comes out and your son wouldn’t see it, what about your daughter, did she, she wouldn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: But you saw it.</span> <span id="s1312">Did your husband see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Yes we went.</span> <span id="s1314">We saw the first week when it was in, in, I feel to a certain extent it’s my duty to go and see these things.</span> <span id="s1315">It’s my duty to go to Yad Va’shem.</span> <span id="s1316">It’s my duty, I was three times at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1317">To a certain extent in my duty but I can’t punish myself.</span> <span id="s1318">I cannot spend sleepless nights because every time I see something like that you know it works on me.</span> <span id="s1319">I don’t’ sleep for three days.</span> <span id="s1320">So at this stage of my life I can’t be punished anymore.</span> <span id="s1321">I have been punished already.</span> <span id="s1322">It’s not going to help the world and it’s not going to help the memory of my parents if I punish myself at my age right now.</span> <span id="s1323">I have done it.</span> <span id="s1324">I have lived it.</span> <span id="s1325">I experienced it.</span> <span id="s1326">I can tell about it.</span> <span id="s1327">But it gets harder and harder.</span> <span id="s1328">And I know that a lot of people can’t even talk about it anymore.</span> <span id="s1329">I was a child and I lost my parents but I have friends who lost children.</span> <span id="s1330">They lost wives.</span> <span id="s1331">And they cannot talk to their children, to their present children and family about it at all.</span> <span id="s1332">They made a wall.</span> <span id="s1333">They don’t’ want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1334">This is their past life.</span> <span id="s1335">They want their life now.</span> <span id="s1336">People react to these things in a completely different way.</span> <span id="s1337">I was a child.</span> <span id="s1338">I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1339">I was 20 some years old.</span> <span id="s1340">I could adjust to the life here.</span> <span id="s1341">I completely acclimatized myself to the life in the United States.</span> <span id="s1342">I became so absorbed with the life that I became an American.</span> <span id="s1343">And I understand when people are a certain age and the same is with experiences.</span> <span id="s1344">Some people had such experiences that they really don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1345">And they don’t want to tell their children because maybe they think that they want to spare them.</span> <span id="s1346">You know there’s all kinds of, you cannot really it’s not a uniform feeling and a uniform way to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1347">Everybody has to do it on their own level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: I know that in some families it has caused problems between parents and their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: What kind of problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Well tension.</span> <span id="s1351">The children feel a burden towards their parents that they can never really live up to.</span> <span id="s1352">There have been studies in books about this.</span> <span id="s1353">I mean some families do well.</span> <span id="s1354">Others do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1356">I have a tremendous amount of friends from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1357">I live in New York.</span> <span id="s1358">I lived in Rochester.</span> <span id="s1359">I lived in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1360">I still know about 120 families in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1361">I’m here surrounded by people from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1362">We are very social.</span> <span id="s1363">I know an awful lot of people.</span> <span id="s1364">I never encountered a family that had a problem with children.</span> <span id="s1365">If they had problems it was because of different, because of different reasons.</span> <span id="s1366">They could have personality clashes.</span> <span id="s1367">They could have been parents that maybe demanded too much from their children.</span> <span id="s1368">Their children couldn’t deliver.</span> <span id="s1369">Maybe through their lives, maybe they wanted to live their lives through their children’s lives you know.</span> <span id="s1370">There’s all kinds of different circumstances.</span> <span id="s1371">I’m not saying that everybody is living in peace.</span> <span id="s1372">But that wasn’t our case.</span> <span id="s1373">In my case I feel that my children are very normal, very well adjusted.</span> <span id="s1374">We try to give them a very solid sense of values.</span> <span id="s1375">I don’t’ think my children are absolutely affected.</span> <span id="s1376">I mean they are affected because of what we went through but their life and their relationship with the family, I don’t think has been affected at all because of the fact that they are survivors of, they are children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1377">They have never been embarrassed of us.</span> <span id="s1378">They have never been ashamed of us.</span> <span id="s1379">They have always been very proud.</span> <span id="s1380">And they put us on a certain pedestal.</span> <span id="s1381">You know like a wounded bird.</span> <span id="s1382">Because we were the ones that they have to shelter now and help us and that was always the relationship.</span> <span id="s1383">They always understood.</span> <span id="s1384">And we always had a good relationship with each other.</span> <span id="s1385">And so do my friends.</span> <span id="s1386">I mean I really don’t know of anybody, unless there’s all kinds of circumstances in families you know where parents don’t see eye to eye with the children.</span> <span id="s1387">And there’s all kinds of tension but that’s not only people from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1388">That goes on in other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: When you and your husband are leading your lives together does it come up much anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Well I have to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s1391">My husband likes to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1392">Not with me, but with other people.</span> <span id="s1393">I like to keep it to myself.</span> <span id="s1394">I would not talk about it to just anyone.</span> <span id="s1395">If I have to tell the kids at the Hillel foundation at Northwestern, I tell them.</span> <span id="s1396">If I have to talk to a group at my temple, I’ll tell them.</span> <span id="s1397">But I don’t think that every American Joe not only has a right, but they don’t’ have to know what’s going on in my, in a soul.</span> <span id="s1398">If they want to know something about the Holocaust there is books, there is movies, there is everything else.</span> <span id="s1399">I don’t’ think they even understand it.</span> <span id="s1400">I don’t think they have a way of feeling and understanding it 50 years afterwards.</span> <span id="s1401">My husband could go on a vacation and meet people at the pool.</span> <span id="s1402">And he would tell them everything.</span> <span id="s1403">I’m not that way.</span> <span id="s1404">I’m more into myself.</span> <span id="s1405">If they ask me I could tell them a few things.</span> <span id="s1406">But I would not open up my wounds and my scars and tell them everything that happened to me.</span> <span id="s1407">As far as between us well, we, we go back to it.</span> <span id="s1408">We just put memorial plaques in the temple for all our parents you know, his sister.</span> <span id="s1409">We read about it.</span> <span id="s1410">We you know are very attuned to what happens with anti-Semitism here, with people that write books about that the Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s1411">About the attitude of people here towards what happened you know.</span> <span id="s1412">We’re very attuned to that.</span> <span id="s1413">But after so many we just don’t sit and dwell about it you know.</span> <span id="s1414">I just had a reproduction made of my father’s picture and now this thing with my brother and of course we are it’s part of our life.</span> <span id="s1415">It has not been erased, by no means.</span> <span id="s1416">But it’s not part of our every day’s life.</span> <span id="s1417">You know my husband recently, he’s sensitive and now that he says you know what.</span> <span id="s1418">I would give to have a picture of my sister.</span> <span id="s1419">I am beginning to forget what she looked like.</span> <span id="s1420">You know.</span> <span id="s1421">And he told this to my kids and then my kids talked to me.</span> <span id="s1422">He says ma is there any way that you think of that we can get dad a picture of his sister.</span> <span id="s1423">And I said honey I know everything about his life.</span> <span id="s1424">And this is just impossible.</span> <span id="s1425">There is nobody in this world that I think could have a picture.</span> <span id="s1426">I have a picture of my brother.</span> <span id="s1427">He has pictures of his parents and I have pictures of my parents.</span> <span id="s1428">But he doesn’t’ have a picture of his sister and I know that he would like to.</span> <span id="s1429">And I think you know when you get older you become more sensitive to these things.</span> <span id="s1430">And I really don’t think that he should be now talking about and lecturing.</span> <span id="s1431">The few times that we lectured, that he lectured, he broke down, he really did.</span> <span id="s1432">I think our resistance is getting kind of shaky right now and I’m not surprised I heard from interviewers that when people get into the 80s even if they remember, they just don’t want to be put through that experience of talking.</span> <span id="s1433">That’s why we have to hurry and do it.</span> <span id="s1434">Because it is very painful and when you’re younger you take it better, much better than when you get older.</span> <span id="s1435">You think about the past and your life and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: You know there is this thing which has been happening off and on or more and more depending on how you look at it where there are people who maintain it didn’t’ happen or it’s been highly exaggerated, all that.</span> <span id="s1437">The people who lived through it a lot of them are no longer around and everyone is getting up in years.</span> <span id="s1438">Do you think about or worry about the time when the time comes when there are no longer survivors who are alive and whether the world will remember.</span> <span id="s1439">The world will forget.</span> <span id="s1440">Does that topic, do you think about that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: No I really don’t think about it.</span> <span id="s1442">I really don’t’ think about it because I feel that I have done everything I could.</span> <span id="s1443">I leave a legacy.</span> <span id="s1444">I told my story.</span> <span id="s1445">My children know.</span> <span id="s1446">they each have the tapes.</span> <span id="s1447">I lived through the horror and I’ll die with it.</span> <span id="s1448">And the world is rotten anyways.</span> <span id="s1449">And they’re going to try to do whatever they want to.</span> <span id="s1450">They have never been fair to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1451">They’re going to try to, there are always going to be people that are going to say it never happened.</span> <span id="s1452">There’s always going to be anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1453">Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1454">And you know genocide is happening every single day and all over the world.</span> <span id="s1455">So apparently this is the structure of people.</span> <span id="s1456">It’s dog eat dog.</span> <span id="s1457">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1458">Look at what’s happening now.</span> <span id="s1459">I mean look what happened now in beautiful Yugoslavia where I was seven years ago on a vacation.</span> <span id="s1460">And I can’t forget that country.</span> <span id="s1461">I mean people were just doing it to themselves.</span> <span id="s1462">It’s just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1463">And little me at my age with my experiences just can’t take care of that any more.</span> <span id="s1464">I leave it to the younger generation.</span> <span id="s1465">I cannot at this stage of my life worry about these things.</span> <span id="s1466">I like to be around for as long as I can.</span> <span id="s1467">I have unfortunately my children got married late.</span> <span id="s1468">They weren’t married in their 20s.</span> <span id="s1469">They were married in their 30s, maybe because they had it so good at home.</span> <span id="s1470">Or this is just the way life was for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: IT’s getting later all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: But I am very grateful that they did it and we do have now 11 for dinner for the holidays from four.</span> <span id="s1473">And I just would like to live long enough to enjoy my family now.</span> <span id="s1474">The fruit of my labor, the fruit of my life.</span> <span id="s1475">Life is sweet and good and we are having a wonderful time and we can still travel and we can still afford things and we can still enjoy each other.</span> <span id="s1476">And we are still together after 54 years.</span> <span id="s1477">So I just want a simple life right now.</span> <span id="s1478">I don’t want to I’m past the stage where I can change the world.</span> <span id="s1479">I leave it up to the younger people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: You arrived in New York on Thanksgiving and your husband mentioned this to me too the other day.</span> <span id="s1481">When you have Thanksgiving dinner your children and grandchildren all get together for Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s1482">Do you do anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Yes, we always tell them the story and we always make sure that they know that we arrived to the United States on Thanksgiving and we count the years every time we have our turkey.</span> <span id="s1484">And I make sure that I make it, not my daughter in law, not my daughter.</span> <span id="s1485">This is my personal pleasure because it has a certain meaning to me and I am just very grateful that I can do it and that I have my family around me.</span> <span id="s1486">And we support the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1487">We support all these ventures of memorizing everything and trying to remember and write about it and in our own way we feel that we just did as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1488">I cannot carry the burden of the world now any more.</span> <span id="s1489">I think I did my share.</span> <span id="s1490">I had my burden.</span> <span id="s1491">And the life now at our age is just getting up in the morning every day, being able to function, not to be a burden and to have each other.</span> <span id="s1492">And this is the philosophy of most people that are older.</span> <span id="s1493">And of course we are very much aware of what is going on and I am a very political person.</span> <span id="s1494">I am a very political person and I love politics and I love to listen to all the analysis and unfortunately I don’t get it from the media because the media is too wise for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Which way do you think is best, left or right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Oh the media is completely left.</span> <span id="s1497">I mean there is question about it.</span> <span id="s1498">I think the media should be unbiased.</span> <span id="s1499">I think that media should report and not take sides.</span> <span id="s1500">I think that is just not fair.</span> <span id="s1501">And especially to people that don’t understand things so well and just listen to what media tells them.</span> <span id="s1502">And I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1503">I just part of this life in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Something that just popped into my head that I wonder about is whether you have aversions to certain things or certain people.</span> <span id="s1505">What are your feelings towards Germany.</span> <span id="s1506">You’re here in Chicago, the tremendous number of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1507">This is also, outside of Warsaw the biggest Polish city in the world.</span> <span id="s1508">A country that you’re not a big fan of.</span> <span id="s1509">I’m wondering whether there are things you have where you don’t’ want to have anything to do with certain places or</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1511">I am a very opinionated person.</span> <span id="s1512">I have a very strong mind of my own.</span> <span id="s1513">And I was offered to go to Auschwitz and make a movie by Boston University or somebody in Boston.</span> <span id="s1514">The Holocaust Museum had them call me.</span> <span id="s1515">And the only condition was there was supposed to be a movie called Women of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1516">There were four women going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1517">They wanted to shoot on location.</span> <span id="s1518">My foot will never step on the Polish soil under any circumstances, except if I will know that my brother is there.</span> <span id="s1519">I’ll go look for him.</span> <span id="s1520">I severed all my ties with Poland.</span> <span id="s1521">I have a lot of unfortunate bad feelings, ill feelings about the people there.</span> <span id="s1522">Maybe this is not just but I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s1523">This is a place which is absolutely does not exist for me to go any more.</span> <span id="s1524">I would never travel to Germany.</span> <span id="s1525">I will never go there on vacation.</span> <span id="s1526">I tolerate the German people because I try to tell myself that the present generation, maybe now after 55 years didn’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s1527">Also according to the new book they did, but these were still their parents and grandparents and when I see a German that’s 75 years old, I could not go even near him.</span> <span id="s1528">Because I know he was a Nazi and he was killing the Jews.</span> <span id="s1529">But when I see a German that’s 25 or 30 years old I can’t feel that way because it wouldn’t’ be right.</span> <span id="s1530">When I see a Polish person 30 years old I know that his father told him to hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s1531">Because the Polish people have it in their blood.</span> <span id="s1532">They were, they did not kill or help kill the Jews but they hated the Jews from time immemorial.</span> <span id="s1533">Before the war they were beating up Jewish students.</span> <span id="s1534">Before the war in 20s and 30s they didn’t want to have the Jewish people living in Poland.</span> <span id="s1535">It dates back, way back before even Hitler existed.</span> <span id="s1536">You see.</span> <span id="s1537">So actually anti-Semitism I think in Poland goes way back before any other countries knew about it.</span> <span id="s1538">Of course, the Spanish you know during the Inquisition, we can’t talk about that.</span> <span id="s1539">That was in the 15th century.</span> <span id="s1540">But I have very strong feelings about certain groups of people.</span> <span id="s1541">I, as I said this is the way I feel about it.</span> <span id="s1542">I just can’t help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: What about if you’re just going around town and you go into one of the parts of Chicago that’s still Polish</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: I don’t like to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: You don’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: I don’t like to go no.</span> <span id="s1547">I just don’t like to go there.</span> <span id="s1548">And I also don’t like to have a cleaning lady that’s from Poland.</span> <span id="s1549">I have a very nice lady that cleans for me for 35 years.</span> <span id="s1550">She’s like part of my family.</span> <span id="s1551">I, it’ just bothers me.</span> <span id="s1552">It just bothers me.</span> <span id="s1553">Because I know how much they hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s1554">My husband doesn’t feel that way but I do.</span> <span id="s1555">He went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1556">He’s sentimental.</span> <span id="s1557">He wanted to see his school and his house and his apartment.</span> <span id="s1558">I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1559">Maybe because he was in hiding and I was exposed.</span> <span id="s1560">I was exposed every single day to people that wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s1561">Not only Germans.</span> <span id="s1562">Poles.</span> <span id="s1563">Every day.</span> <span id="s1564">When I tried to make a living.</span> <span id="s1565">These people were nice to me because they didn’t’ know and they constantly talked to me about Jews.</span> <span id="s1566">Maybe this is the reason.</span> <span id="s1567">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1568">Also my husband lived before the war 20 years in Poland.</span> <span id="s1569">I only lived 13 years there.</span> <span id="s1570">I have no ties with schools or high schools.</span> <span id="s1571">Or even Polish literature I wasn’t taught.</span> <span id="s1572">With him it was different so I just don’t’ have these sentimental feelings towards Poland.</span> <span id="s1573">It was a country I was born in and unfortunately I was growing up there and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1574">It’s all over with for me.</span> <span id="s1575">I’m American.</span> <span id="s1576">I’m Israeli, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1577">I’m proud of it and it’s just fine with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: I don’t have any more questions.</span> <span id="s1579">Is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you want to talk about or that you’d like to finish by saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Well I think I summarized everything pretty well.</span> <span id="s1581">You know to tell you the present state of affairs and my feelings.</span> <span id="s1582">And just the fact that I’m very happy and grateful for what I have and I’ve always been that way.</span> <span id="s1583">I try to instill these values in my children too.</span> <span id="s1584">And sometimes things matter more than material things.</span> <span id="s1585">Unfortunately this is a material world right now.</span> <span id="s1586">But we have always made it with very little and I grew up in a home where these values were passed on by my parents too.</span> <span id="s1587">They were two professional people.</span> <span id="s1588">I cherish their memory.</span> <span id="s1589">They taught me everything I know.</span> <span id="s1590">I maybe became a very secure person in life because I was a very secure child.</span> <span id="s1591">I was wanted.</span> <span id="s1592">I was loved.</span> <span id="s1593">I was needed.</span> <span id="s1594">I was respected and I was always brought up with parents, with two parents being there.</span> <span id="s1595">And it was my youth was just, my childhood was just so happy.</span> <span id="s1596">And they were always telling me whether I was five or six, that I am nice and that I am pretty and that I am a good girl and that that security has lived with me all my life, no matter what people would throw at my face and tell me that I’m bad, that I’m Jewish and I’m this and I’m that and genocide you know.</span> <span id="s1597">I kind of always felt this within me.</span> <span id="s1598">And I’m trying to, I tried always to give this to my children.</span> <span id="s1599">I think it’s very important.</span> <span id="s1600">Also I never was under any psychiatric or psychological care and I felt that I can do it myself, that I can overcome certain hurdles in my life by myself because I had this inner strength because my mom used to tell me that I am just a very nice little girl and very important to them and loved and that I’m going to make it if I believe in myself.</span> <span id="s1601">And I always did.</span> <span id="s1602">And I think with the spectrum of what you see what’s happening now is the breakup of the family and fatherless children and god knows what’s happening in the world.</span> <span id="s1603">You know.</span> <span id="s1604">I think that this is maybe the root of all evil.</span> <span id="s1605">That maybe people that grew up in secure homes are just going through life in a much easier way than people that are just uprooted and don’t’ know where they belong and don’t’ know whether somebody wants them or needs them.</span> <span id="s1606">Or you know or they can contribute to society or not.</span> <span id="s1607">I just always had that pleasant inner feeling that my parents instilled in me for the 12 short years that I lived with them.</span> <span id="s1608">And that really helped me all my life.</span> <span id="s1609">And I tried to pass it on to my children and maybe that helped them to be to be good people and see the world in a certain way.</span> <span id="s1610">And when I compare now for instance my daughter’s upbringing and her way of thinking and living comparing to maybe her peers, she always tells me mom whatever I know is from you.</span> <span id="s1611">I am what you taught me to be and it makes me feel good, because she’s a very nice person and so is my son.</span> <span id="s1612">And my son’s father was always, always an example to him.</span> <span id="s1613">Always.</span> <span id="s1614">And maybe that’s very important for families to be.</span> <span id="s1615">I don’t’ want to sound too philosophical but you wanted me to finish in a certain way so I just am doing that on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: thanks for taking all this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">(end)</span></p></body></html>
