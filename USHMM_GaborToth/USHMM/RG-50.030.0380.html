1996</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Good afternoon, Dr. Friedman.</span> <span id="s12">A: Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: I’d like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were born and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Well, that covers quite a bit of territory.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on March the tenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took in a cousin who was orphaned.</span> <span id="s16">So there were three boys and three girls in the family.</span> <span id="s17">I went to school locally in St. Joseph, Missouri, and of course grew up during the Depression.</span> <span id="s18">That covered quite a long era.</span> <span id="s19">We all worked.</span> <span id="s20">It was the usual paper route, selling magazines, eventually working in the drugstore and working my way through school as much as I could.</span> <span id="s21">Fortunately, we had a junior college in St. Joseph and I was able to go there for my first two years and get an Associate Arts degree.</span> <span id="s22">But after that, I ran out of money, so I was in search of jobs that would pay more.</span> <span id="s23">With that in mind, I went out to Colorado, where I had an older brother and his family, and I worked in an amusement park in Colorado – Lakeside Amusement Park.</span> <span id="s24">It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids worked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in Colorado.</span> <span id="s25">So it was very pleasant work but by the end of the summer I still didn’t have enough money to go back to school.</span> <span id="s26">So I went back home – I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back.</span> <span id="s27">I went back around Thanksgiving of 1939.</span> <span id="s28">And made enough money to enter my first year of college— of podiatry school.</span> <span id="s29">I’m almost afraid to go down that alley because it was my first profession.</span> <span id="s30">I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s31">I didn’t want to be a doctor but this was the next best thing.</span> <span id="s32">In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into medical school.</span> <span id="s33">There were Jewish quotas.</span> <span id="s34">But I did go to Chicago and I talked to the registrar and when I came home during the summer of ’39, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do, I decided to go to podiatry school.</span> <span id="s35">Well, that was in the fall of ’41, and we know what happened on December the seventh.</span> <span id="s36">During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us to remain in school as much as we could, everybody was gung ho.</span> <span id="s37">We wanted to get into the army and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s38">Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I couldn’t get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in school – at least to finish that year, which I did.</span> <span id="s39">I went back to school, but during the week of finals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did.</span> <span id="s40">I came home and went into the army.</span> <span id="s41">I went into basic training to , Texas, with the 95th Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s42">I had had ROTC in high school at that time.</span> <span id="s43">ROTC was very good because we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing.</span> <span id="s44">Although they tell you never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any close order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon.</span> <span id="s45">At the end of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. The second month, I made buck sergeant, I’m sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that’s three stripes, then staff sergeant.</span> <span id="s46">Then I was ready to go to OCS.</span> <span id="s47">I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could.</span> <span id="s48">I had a first sergeant, was regular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn’t send them into headquarters, so I didn’t get to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Did you ever talk to him about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes, yes, and the reason he didn’t put the papers in, although he’d called me, in all the promotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, “I don’t want a kike (ph) on my staff”.</span> <span id="s51">The other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the ranks.</span> <span id="s52">The reason he didn’t send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97th Infantry Division and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you think of the fact that I did all his work.</span> <span id="s53">And also, one of the officers in my company said that I was going through too fast and that OCS is very difficult.</span> <span id="s54">They were flunking out at least half of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of army, and what’s expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I’d have to spend would be to my advantage.</span> <span id="s55">And it was true.</span> <span id="s56">I did go to OCS and it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s57">I think around 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated and got their bars.</span> <span id="s58">Then we were sent to different camps.</span> <span id="s59">I finally ended up at a headquarters company at Camp Blanding, Florida, doing various jobs.</span> <span id="s60">And then went overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: When did you go overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Went overseas during the winter of ‘42-’43.</span> <span id="s63">We were stationed in Preston, Lancashire, and we crossed the channel on a Polish ship called the Sobiesky (ph) and when we got midway through the channel, there was a lot of submarine and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans, so we had to back to Southampton.</span> <span id="s64">I later read, after the war, that the ship that left Southampton the same time we did was torpedoed.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: It was. . . the dates are going to be a little difficult for me.</span> <span id="s67">Q: The general time of year?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas.</span> <span id="s69">It was the same night that Glenn Miller disappeared over the channel.</span> <span id="s70">Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war, or a lot of things that I thought about as being – if something took off, took of paramount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the channel, and how lucky that I was.</span> <span id="s71">When they said that, “you get on this ship, or you get on this ship, how many are in your complement”, I said, “Six officers and 96 men”.</span> <span id="s72">“Okay, you get on this one, you get on that one.”</span> <span id="s73">We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned back.</span> <span id="s74">The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel.</span> <span id="s75">I didn’t know this until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics.</span> <span id="s76">At any rate, we landed.</span> <span id="s77">We had to go over the side of the ship with a rope ladder and landed in landing craft and went into LeHarve(ph).</span> <span id="s78">Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren’t being shot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto dry land.</span> <span id="s79">Once, and I’m going very fast because there’s quite a bit to cover, once we got into France, we started moving very rapidly.</span> <span id="s80">In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written about Patton streaking across France and into Germany and across the Rhine, across the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph).</span> <span id="s81">Then we went to, we were in the battle of Baston, we were in Belgium, Luxembourg, and then into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: You came into about the tail end of the winter, fighting.</span> <span id="s83">A: From the beginning of winter, of ’44, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: And the Battle of the Bulge was going on.</span> <span id="s85">A: In winter of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: ’44, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And then you were at Baston in February?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Around that time.</span> <span id="s90">I once read where someone was telling an account of, it might not have been his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said “My memory has a lot of holes in it.”</span> <span id="s91">So I’m going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and tell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an opportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it.</span> <span id="s92">So there will be a time period that will have quite a spread.</span> <span id="s93">Now with the Third Army, , I hope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I know that this is the major thrust of the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: We’re in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: We’re in April.</span> <span id="s96">Our troops uncovered the concentration camp at Ordruff (ph).</span> <span id="s97">Now Ordruff (ph) was one of the satellite camps at Bookenblow (ph) near Gotha (ph) and you can’t get the full measure or the full thrust of what happens to you when you walk into a place like this and see bodies, emaciated bodies, stacked one on top of the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Back up a little bit for me.</span> <span id="s99">When you got the orders to go in and you were, how did you approach, what did the area look like, what time of day was it, can you remember those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Do you have that whole memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s103">Vividly, vividly, it was daylight.</span> <span id="s104">Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in the ovens, and we could still smell it.</span> <span id="s105">In fact, after the war was over when my mother would fix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the house.</span> <span id="s106">I couldn’t smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves.</span> <span id="s107">I’ve never bought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that’s what they were wearing – these striped pajamas, and I know what happened.</span> <span id="s108">I kept salivating.</span> <span id="s109">You know there’s, before you vomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it’s kind of a, well if you’ve ever done it, if you’ve ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there’s, you know that you’re going to throw up.</span> <span id="s110">And that’s rather indelicate, but this is what happens.</span> <span id="s111">Some of the dead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a tree with their legs covered, and dead.</span> <span id="s112">Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the camp.</span> <span id="s113">Those who were still alive, in the barracks, if you could call it a barracks, they were sort of lean-tos with straw, were so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn’t have the strength to push him off so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this pallet that had been his bed for many years.</span> <span id="s114">We did whatever we could – we did in the way of food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still moving on.</span> <span id="s115">I was still with the combat troop.</span> <span id="s116">Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my men were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first line of casualties, and would carry them back to the evac hospitals that were in the rear of the combat line.</span> <span id="s117">We did whatever we could to make them comfortable.</span> <span id="s118">I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium, and I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran smoothly, it seems.</span> <span id="s119">As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere and something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention.</span> <span id="s120">But I understand that the Burgermeister (ph) of Ordruff (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body was dismembered and he was strung up on a tree in the center of town, the civic center.</span> <span id="s121">I think this is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: You didn’t see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: But you have reason to believe . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Could you see, when you first came in, some of the people who were still alive were able to walk around and talk with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s127">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And did you talk with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Briefly, briefly.</span> <span id="s130">‘Cause we’d both cry.</span> <span id="s131">There wasn’t too much, we’d start a conversation and they would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give them.</span> <span id="s132">Then there was the language barrier.</span> <span id="s133">Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian.</span> <span id="s134">They came from the Balkan countries as well, Romania, Hungary.</span> <span id="s135">There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one thing.</span> <span id="s136">They all had one thing in common – that they were free.</span> <span id="s137">And I think, I think, wanted to get revenge.</span> <span id="s138">I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of them, of torture, of having their families taken away from them.</span> <span id="s139">And murdered in such a manner, in such a diabolical manner, that we’ve all learned about since then.</span> <span id="s140">I didn’t know all this at that time.</span> <span id="s141">I was aware . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: What did you know then?</span> <span id="s143">Did you why these people were in this camp?</span> <span id="s144">Did you know who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers.</span> <span id="s148">I knew that the majority of them were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Do you know how you knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of German.</span> <span id="s151">But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in the Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in Germany, or in Europe, we started hearing about these atrocities.</span> <span id="s152">But I didn’t have any visual evidence of it until I went into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s153">I didn’t know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they were forced there, but I didn’t know until later on when I read how they were put in vans, and put on trains and in boxcars and the methodical way that they were loaded into boxcars with the elderly going in first, pushed in.</span> <span id="s154">And then the younger ones and then the younger children and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and thrown into the boxcar to land on top of whoever was there and then the boxcar was sealed.</span> <span id="s155">If they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the boxcars.</span> <span id="s156">The boxcars came into play, when the vans that they used to gas – you know they would use vans and they would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the van and by the time they got to Treblinka, or Auschwitz. . . I didn’t know all this until much later.</span> <span id="s157">When I saw them, well, they were prisoners who hadn’t been fed who worked for the German war machine and given, not even, minimal rations.</span> <span id="s158">Not even just something to keep them going so they could keep the war machine going, and when they couldn’t any longer do that, it was off to the ovens.</span> <span id="s159">That was all I knew then.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And you saw mostly men?</span> <span id="s161">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did you see women?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t recall seeing any women then.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And did you spend some time – how big was the camp and what did you see there and what did you piece together from seeing what was at the camp?</span> <span id="s166">Did you see what work they were doing?</span> <span id="s167">Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No.</span> <span id="s169">No.</span> <span id="s170">By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared.</span> <span id="s171">They tried to kill as many as they could before they left.</span> <span id="s172">A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went on, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given all sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these camps.</span> <span id="s173">I didn’t see firsthand where they worked – they weren’t working anymore.</span> <span id="s174">They sort of spread out over the countryside because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Walking – in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought.</span> <span id="s177">Q: How long did you stay at Ordruff ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Perhaps the larger part of two days.</span> <span id="s179">Maybe a day and then left on the second day.</span> <span id="s180">But during that time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind.</span> <span id="s181">I couldn’t help but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all from Russia, and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the concentration camp, had I lived in that surrounding, in Russia.</span> <span id="s182">The entire village, I later learned, the entire village that my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I’d never met and cousins – they were entirely wiped out.</span> <span id="s183">I later learned that they were all herded into a barn and the barn was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned.</span> <span id="s184">This is in 1939 when the Germans went into Poland.</span> <span id="s185">I didn’t know that that happened.</span> <span id="s186">I just know that we stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939.</span> <span id="s187">We stopped getting mushrooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">They used to send mother – my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she made delicious mushroom and barley soup.</span> <span id="s189">That all stopped of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So even before you went in the service, you were aware of the situation for Jewish people in the eastern part . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: You knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I knew.</span> <span id="s194">I wanted to go into Germany in 1938.</span> <span id="s195">I wanted to take a bicycle tour through Germany and I had talked to a friend who had been there and he said, “Don’t go.</span> <span id="s196">It’s not the place for Jews.”</span> <span id="s197">So we knew as early, actually, as 1933, the things that were happening, the laws.</span> <span id="s198">I didn’t pay that much attention to it.</span> <span id="s199">I was 13 years old then and the prom was much more important at the time, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: But your parents were concerned and keeping in touch with relatives?</span> <span id="s201">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Were relatives coming over during the thirties?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: At the end of the thirties.</span> <span id="s204">An uncle of mine who survived, or who was able to come over, came over.</span> <span id="s205">But we didn’t talk about it a lot.</span> <span id="s206">And I found that to be true among many first generation Americans, as I was.</span> <span id="s207">We were too busy trying to Americanize our parents.</span> <span id="s208">Which was a mistake.</span> <span id="s209">What we should have been doing was talking to them and getting this beautiful, beautiful background that they had in Europe.</span> <span id="s210">I know later on when I’d take Mother for a ride in my car and we went out into the country because I came from a small town, in Missouri, and when the wheat was being harvested and the corn, she’d take it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">She’d smell the wheat and she’d say, “Oh, this is just like home.”</span> <span id="s212">It was always home.</span> <span id="s213">And oddly enough, in the many years that I’d been away from St. Joe and I’d been away to school and in the theater, I’ve been away altogether, I guess, close to 50 years, whenever I told my wife, whenever I talked about home, she always knew that it meant St. Joseph.</span> <span id="s214">It wasn’t where we were living at the time.</span> <span id="s215">That was a house.</span> <span id="s216">And we’ve lived all over the world.</span> <span id="s217">And I guess the army took me all over the world, too.</span> <span id="s218">But home, home was always St. Joe, the way Russia was always home to Mother and Dad.</span> <span id="s219">And I’m sorry I didn’t find out more about that.</span> <span id="s220">We got busy with making a living, going to school, and finding the American dream.</span> <span id="s221">I’m digressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Well, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s223">Dr. Friedman, when you spent that day and a half, more or less, in Ordruff . . . when you left, what was it that the army was able to do for those people in that short amount of time?</span> <span id="s224">Very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Not a lot.</span> <span id="s226">Just enough to keep them alive.</span> <span id="s227">It became quite a hot potato after a while, on what to do with these people.</span> <span id="s228">I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was told that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb any of the German military camps.</span> <span id="s229">Or any of the IG Farban (ph) buildings.</span> <span id="s230">Now the IG Farban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it.</span> <span id="s231">The army barracks, we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons, until they could be repatriated.</span> <span id="s232">Now it wasn’t that difficult to send the western Europeans back, who’d been slave laborers, send them back to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy – although Italy was Allied Germany for a while – they were also working in the war effort and had to be sent home.</span> <span id="s233">But we couldn’t do anything with this tremendous, tremendous horde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took ‘til the end of the war, and then some.</span> <span id="s234">And then problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Is there anything else about that day and a half in Ordruff that you remember, that you want to relay?</span> <span id="s236">Anything about the town itself, the local people in the town?</span> <span id="s237">Did you have any opportunity to interact with the local people?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I didn’t speak with any of them, but they all stood around as though . . . Q: They came – was the camp right in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s240">On the edge of town, on the edge of town.</span> <span id="s241">They acted as though, as they were surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">But I honestly believe that no matter where the camps were, the people knew.</span> <span id="s243">They knew!</span> <span id="s244">They smelled it!</span> <span id="s245">They smelled the ovens.</span> <span id="s246">They smelled the smoke that came out of the ovens.</span> <span id="s247">They didn’t think they were baking bread there.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And the camp itself was close enough to the town . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: .</span> <span id="s250">.</span> <span id="s251">that was no doubt in your mind that people must have smelled and seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Now, they might not have seen.</span> <span id="s253">They might not have been all that aware of how, how really despicable the conditions were – how horrible they were.</span> <span id="s254">But I’m sure that they knew what was going on, and didn’t care.</span> <span id="s255">Jews!</span> <span id="s256">Who cared?</span> <span id="s257">Hasn’t that always been the history?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did you, at the time, did you feel resentment towards those local people right away?</span> <span id="s259">Did that occur to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: I can’t say that I did.</span> <span id="s263">I really didn’t know enough then, and didn’t feel enough.</span> <span id="s264">But what I did feel, and I guess that’s what later led me, I’m taking all this in, probably, led me to volunteer to stay over after the war ended.</span> <span id="s265">Or to get into the work of repatriating the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s266">I thought if I could, that whatever I could do, that I would try.</span> <span id="s267">In fact, it became a problem to the United States Army before the war ended, because when the camps that were overrun, eventually all of them, knew that they would get better treatment from the United States Army, and, as we progressed, I would see hundreds, literally hundreds, thousands even, Russians walking, displaced persons walking along the street, along the highway that we were driving on to get from one town to another.</span> <span id="s268">They had to be put in camps, otherwise we couldn’t feed them, we couldn’t clothe them, we couldn’t control them.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What happened to you after you left Ordruff in April?</span> <span id="s270">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s271">Where were you on your way to?</span> <span id="s272">What was your destination then?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I am, actually my platoon was broken up shortly after that.</span> <span id="s274">And, ‘cause the war was winding down.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: You didn’t, you weren’t, that function wasn’t necessary anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No.</span> <span id="s277">No.</span> <span id="s278">I still had control of them but they were assigned to various combat troops.</span> <span id="s279">At times we were with, I forget the names of the various corps, the 12th Corps, the 22nd, the 15th, and from time to time, I would see them and sort of oversee them and see that they got their rations and see that they got their pay and see that they got their mail.</span> <span id="s280">But other than that, other than that, I, the work really for me sort of died down a bit, until, until my commanding officer asked me if I thought I would like to get involved in working with the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s281">And it wasn’t all altruistic, at the time.</span> <span id="s282">I thought if I would get involved with that, when the war ended I wouldn’t be sent to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s283">I’m being honest in saying that that was a factor, also.</span> <span id="s284">But the overriding factor, I believe, was something inside me that just wanted to help.</span> <span id="s285">You know, I’m beginning to think, and as I hear myself and as we go on with this oral history, I’m going, you’re going to hear I a lot, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: (laughter) It’s about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: It’s – you really can’t be modest about these things, can you?</span> <span id="s288">Q: No.</span> <span id="s289">It’s your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Pronouns tend to get all knocked all over the place.</span> <span id="s291">But I know of no other way I can tell you this.</span> <span id="s292">But I really, honestly and truly, wanted to do what I could to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Where were you – do you remember hearing that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I didn’t know the war was over until three days after it was over.</span> <span id="s295">And it’s in my notes here.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">We were near a camp and there were two German planes that landed near us.</span> <span id="s297">A German officer and a blonde came out of one of the planes with a case of champagne.</span> <span id="s298">And he’s the one who told us, the group that I was with, that the war had ended.</span> <span id="s299">I think it was a, I think the war ended, what May the 5th?</span> <span id="s300">This was about May the 8th.</span> <span id="s301">I wrote home and I told them that I found out that the war had ended.</span> <span id="s302">Now other things happened along the way.</span> <span id="s303">I received a promotion from second – I was a second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s304">And I received a promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant.</span> <span id="s305">Now I can along on this vein for awhile, if you wish . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: It’s up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: And then we can go back to the camps.</span> <span id="s308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: But it is germane to what has happened.</span> <span id="s310">I received a promotion, first lieutenant, and while I was in Koburg (ph), one of the camps, we were constantly being inspected.</span> <span id="s311">There was a group of officers that came in from Third Army.</span> <span id="s312">No one wanted the responsibility of running one of these camps, because by this time, there were all sorts of letters written to the paper, and all sorts of surveys being made on how the camps were run and how the Jews were being treated.</span> <span id="s313">Governor Lame (ph) and I recall reading in the Stars and Stripes that the Jews were being treated worse by the American army and by Unrah, (ph) and so on in the camps, than they were in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s314">Well, this wasn’t true, entirely, but there was some truth in it.</span> <span id="s315">They didn’t know whether to put the Jews in with all the other DPs, or, because the Jews were stateless, they were homeless then.</span> <span id="s316">They couldn’t go back home because their homes had already been taken over by the Poles, the Russians, or whatever and they were happy.</span> <span id="s317">They were happy.</span> <span id="s318">I’m getting ahead of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: No.</span> <span id="s320">We’re in the summer of 1945 when there is still a very chaotic situation in the camp – everybody’s thrown together and they haven’t been and the ones who could go home haven’t yet really gone . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No.</span> <span id="s322">But they were being . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: A sorting out period of who’s going to run these camps, how are they going to be run.</span> <span id="s324">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: You know, how are we gonna treat them.</span> <span id="s326">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Political agendas in the U.S.</span> <span id="s328">There was, President Truman commissioned a report . . . A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: .</span> <span id="s330">.</span> <span id="s331">.</span> <span id="s332">sent to his representative . . . A: It was the Harrison . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Harrison Report in the summer of ’45.</span> <span id="s334">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: That’s what you’re describing, is that summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Right.</span> <span id="s337">Now when you go into the Holocaust Museum, here, the first photo that you see is Ordruff, my camp, the one that I went into.</span> <span id="s338">It’s a huge blowup on the wall – that’s the first thing that you see.</span> <span id="s339">And you see Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton looking at these corpses about 11 days after we were there.</span> <span id="s340">I think, I think the date on that photograph is about the 16th, something like that, and we went in around April the 4th or 5th.</span> <span id="s341">Patton, there’s an article written by his aide-de-camp, and it’s in one of the books that’s in the library here, wrote that Patton became so ill when he saw this that he had to around one of the barracks and vomit.</span> <span id="s342">Patton.</span> <span id="s343">April, May, June, July, August, September – there’s quite an article about Patton and the DPs in the same magazine where Patton went into a camp, which camp was it?</span> <span id="s344">It was an all-Jewish camp.</span> <span id="s345">And he went in and he said, “The filthy Jews were worse than animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">They defecate on the floors and they urinate in corners and it the Feast of Yom Kippur, the Feast of Yom Kippur, and they made a room into a synagogue and there’s a man, a priest they call a rabbi.</span> <span id="s347">He had some paper rolled around a pole that’s called the Talmud but we know it’s the Torah.</span> <span id="s348">And the rabbi looked like King Henry the Eighth, with a filthy hat and fur on it.</span> <span id="s349">The prayers were in such gibberish that no one understood what they were – what anyone was saying.</span> <span id="s350">The stench of all these filthy bodies was such that when I left, I couldn’t enjoy my dinner.”</span> <span id="s351">Tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you ever have occasion to meet Patton?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I saw him.</span> <span id="s354">I saw him in his jeep on the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head.</span> <span id="s355">I didn’t meet him.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Little second lieutenants don’t meet, well, I shouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s357">I’m sure that the private he slapped in the hospital and told him that he was malingering and should get back to the front – he had a nice meeting with Patton.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Did you have . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: See, I didn’t know all this until . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you have these feelings about Patton at the time?</span> <span id="s361">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Patton was my god.</span> <span id="s364">Look what he did for us.</span> <span id="s365">They called it the Red Ball Express.</span> <span id="s366">We went through France, through Germany.</span> <span id="s367">We went through because we overwhelmed them with personnel and material.</span> <span id="s368">Not because of Patton’s genius, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s369">Am I being a traitor?</span> <span id="s370">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s371">You might want to cut this out.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Where did, where are we, in the summer of ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And you have been promoted.</span> <span id="s375">A: To first lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: To first lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: But I still had my men, but also, I’m sort of working my way into working in the DP camps, with the knowledge of my commanding officer.</span> <span id="s378">He had received orders to send whoever he could to a school that would train us for these camps.</span> <span id="s379">Now the school was run by army officers who had already been in a camp and knew some of the problems.</span> <span id="s380">I think, I think the school lasted all of ten days, if that long.</span> <span id="s381">And I was ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Time to .</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: The first camp that I went into, then I was, I was put on temporary duty, then I was relieved of all my duties . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Separated from your platoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: . . . with my platoon.</span> <span id="s386">And I was relieved of all my duties with the company and put on temporary duty with the G-5 section of the Third Army which is the military government section.</span> <span id="s387">And the first camp that I went to was in Bamburg(ph), Germany.</span> <span id="s388">I brought a map, incidentally, perhaps later on, we can go through it.</span> <span id="s389">And I received the best training that anybody could ever have, in this camp.</span> <span id="s390">The way the camps were set up, we used, we had Unrah (ph) personnel.</span> <span id="s391">We had German personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Civilian.</span> <span id="s394">And army.</span> <span id="s395">We had, now understand, in order to run all these places, we had to have people who were knowledgeable about the gasworks, about the waterworks, about the electrical companies – and who knew these things?</span> <span id="s396">Germans.</span> <span id="s397">Nazis.</span> <span id="s398">If they weren’t members of the Nazi Party, they didn’t hold these positions, so we had to use them.</span> <span id="s399">Course Patton was later accused of playing footsie with all of them, but to some extent he had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">One thing leads to another, doesn’t it?</span> <span id="s401">They all had to fill out what they called a Fraggoboggen (ph) – are you familiar with the questionnaire that the Nazis had to fill out?</span> <span id="s402">Well, it tells about their history in the Nazi Party and of course all of them said that they didn’t, or many of them had a supplement to it, which I have here, and I’m going to leave with the Archives – a supplement to the Fraggoboggen (ph) that this one man filled out.</span> <span id="s403">“I was never a member of the Nazi Party.”</span> <span id="s404">That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s405">“I was never involved in any of the atrocities.”</span> <span id="s406">They all were.</span> <span id="s407">They all were – if they weren’t actively involved in it, they were guilty because they were there and allowed it to start as far back as 1933 and did nothing.</span> <span id="s408">Or when they started coming after the Germans who disagreed.</span> <span id="s409">And the Catholics who disagreed, after they got through with the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals.</span> <span id="s410">That’s when people started taking note.</span> <span id="s411">Maybe there’s a juggernaut that we can’t stop – that we’re going to need help.</span> <span id="s412">Now I’m in a camp, and the camps were run as cities.</span> <span id="s413">They had their own administration.</span> <span id="s414">We had an entire Polish army complement in camp.</span> <span id="s415">I have it right here – the badges that they wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: In Bamburg (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: In Bamburg (ph).</span> <span id="s418">And later in Koburg, (ph) also.</span> <span id="s419">And the camp – we were constantly being inspected because, we were being inspected by all the, by major generals, and colonels, because everybody was coming down on them, from President Truman on down.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Action, they wanted . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: They wanted, they wanted what’s going on in these camps.</span> <span id="s422">So they’d come in.</span> <span id="s423">Now, at one time, by being on temporary – this is just a little story.</span> <span id="s424">By being on temporary duty and away from my original company, I wasn’t able to draw any rations – any of my rations from my company – like cigarettes.</span> <span id="s425">We were able to get liquor, too, incidentally.</span> <span id="s426">Heavens knows we needed a little schnapps once in a while.</span> <span id="s427">Cigarettes, liquor and candy.</span> <span id="s428">And when I tried to get it from my company, they said we didn’t draw any rations for you because, PX rations, I guess they called it, because you’re not assigned to us.</span> <span id="s429">You’re away on temporary duty.</span> <span id="s430">And when I tried to get it from the army headquarters, they said, you’re not on our roster, you’re only here on temporary duty.</span> <span id="s431">So on one of the times that, on one of the times that my camp was being inspected, when the officers got through, there were about eight of them, and I have the listing here of all of them.</span> <span id="s432">The general just happened to mention, “You deserve a lot of credit for the work that you’ve done here.”</span> <span id="s433">And I said, “I deserve a rest.”</span> <span id="s434">And the rest of the officers – I guess their chin dropped between their knees because you just don’t talk that way, .</span> <span id="s435">Very G.I. And he said, “Oh, what would you like to do?”</span> <span id="s436">And you know, I was very young then, and very flip.</span> <span id="s437">I said, “I think I’d like to go to the Riviera for ten days or so.”</span> <span id="s438">He said, “Oh, how soon could you be ready?”</span> <span id="s439">“How soon could you get a man here to replace me?”</span> <span id="s440">He said, “Can you be in Munich at 5:00 or 9:00 in the morning or whatever?</span> <span id="s441">We’ll fly you to the Riviera.”</span> <span id="s442">“Certainly I can be there.”</span> <span id="s443">So before going, we had a camp barber – and the reason I’m telling you this is because one story begets another story – and he was cutting my hair, I had hair then.</span> <span id="s444">He was a Frenchman and I told him, I said, “Now I want you to do a good job because I’m going to the Riviera.</span> <span id="s445">I’m going to stay at the Hotel Carlton.</span> <span id="s446">I go to Nice and to Monte Carlo while I’m there.”</span> <span id="s447">He said, “My family lives in Cannes.</span> <span id="s448">I haven’t seen them in eight years – I haven’t written to them and there’s no way that they could write to me.</span> <span id="s449">Would you call on them?”</span> <span id="s450">I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s451">He gave me their address of where they lived.</span> <span id="s452">They lived up above Cannes – Gros(ph)?</span> <span id="s453">Well, and one day I took a cab and went up there and I met his family and I invited his sister, a little 16-year-old sister to come back to the hotel with me to have dinner.</span> <span id="s454">Well, the Hotel Carlton, this is where they have the Cannes Film Festival, as you know, and everything is very, very elegant there.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">There’s a waiter behind each chair.</span> <span id="s456">The little girl was sitting there, I don’t she’s ever, I don’t what she’s ever had in the way of food, or the way it was served, but I want you to know it was quite elegant.</span> <span id="s457">And she brought a little bottle of perfume for me as a gift for letting her family know that her brother was still alive.</span> <span id="s458">That little bottle of perfume is the only thing that I have left.</span> <span id="s459">When I came back to the states and we staged at Camp Philip Morris – you know they named the staging camps in France after cigarettes – I had a musette (ph) full of souvenirs – perfume, lighters.</span> <span id="s460">I had a bottle of, I had a fifth of Three Feathers, which is bourbon liquor that my dad had given me two years before.</span> <span id="s461">He said, he wanted, he said, “Yasilah, (ph) I want you to give this to your colonel so he won’t send you overseas.”</span> <span id="s462">And I thought to my, I told my commanding officer, I said, “My dad wants me to give you this so you won’t send me overseas.”</span> <span id="s463">We both had a good laugh.</span> <span id="s464">I thought if we landed safely, I’d break open the bottle.</span> <span id="s465">Every celebration that we had, I was going to use that bottle that my dad gave me.</span> <span id="s466">I never did.</span> <span id="s467">I never did because there was always liquor available.</span> <span id="s468">And this became kind of an icon, kind of a talisman.</span> <span id="s469">I thought as long as I had that, nothing’s going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s470">Because it somehow, it’s somehow sacred.</span> <span id="s471">When I had this in my musette (ph) bag, with that little bottle of perfume, along with perfume for all the women in my family, Chanel, and Flue de Racai (ph), and all the Caron and I had lace from Belgium that I had picked up and saved to take home as souvenirs.</span> <span id="s472">Everything was stolen out of my stateroom but that little bottle of perfume.</span> <span id="s473">And, the bottle of bourbon.</span> <span id="s474">And my dad and I had the first two drinks out of that bottle.</span> <span id="s475">Well, I came back from the Riviera and kept working and for a while, we went, I was sent to Veeldflecken (ph).</span> <span id="s476">Now Veeldflecken (ph) was taken over by an Unrah (ph) team and we were already old hands at this.</span> <span id="s477">I only spent two weeks there, about two weeks, and a member of the Unrah (ph) team was Kathleen Hulm (ph) who later wrote “A Nun’s Story”, that was made into a movie with Audrey Hepburn.</span> <span id="s478">And I met her and I have a copy of her book.</span> <span id="s479">I had a copy of her book but it’s now in the archives, here in the museum.</span> <span id="s480">It’s out of print and it’s a wonderful, wonderful account of how a displaced person camp is run, and how it should be run.</span> <span id="s481">All the trials, all the vicissitudes, all the problems, all the glory and all the good feelings that you have when you see a job well done.</span> <span id="s482">I came back to Bamburg (ph) and by this time there was quite an attrition among the officers and enlisted men who were going back to the States.</span> <span id="s483">They’d earned enough points to be sent back and I was put in, they had spread us out over several camps and I was sent to Koburg (ph) and that’s where I had my greatest glory if there is such a thing.</span> <span id="s484">And I’ll tell you what happened at Koburg (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s486">Let’s take a break and then we’ll come back to Koburg (ph).</span> <span id="s487">Good.</span> <span id="s488">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: We’re gonna start with now, in the fall of 1945.</span> <span id="s491">You come back from the Riviera and you have been assigned to Koburg (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Right.</span> <span id="s493">It was quite a coup, actually, I was the only officer in the camp.</span> <span id="s494">I was the second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s495">I had six enlisted men who were gems.</span> <span id="s496">They had been in DP camps, they had worked in DP camps, and we were the only American army personnel in the camp.</span> <span id="s497">The camp, however, held between 11,000 and 15,000 eastern Europeans, mostly Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: They were there when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: They were there when I got there.</span> <span id="s500">They’d been collecting them.</span> <span id="s501">See, nothing travels faster than a rumor in the army, or in a situation like this.</span> <span id="s502">When they told the people, the people who’d been slave laborers that they could get billeting and rations and so on, under the American auspices, under the American army auspices, have a place to sleep, have a place to eat, until they could be repatriated, but, on the other hand, many of them were already, had already been repatriated and had come back.</span> <span id="s503">Because they had been fooled by Stalin.</span> <span id="s504">Stalin even sent special troops into the area to sort of prepare the people for coming home by telling them that you’re going to come home, you’re going to be with your families, you’re going to be on your farms, you’re going to be in your villages, and life is going to be like it was before.</span> <span id="s505">It didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s506">Once the boxcars were sealed, I don’t think they were really sealed in the manner that the boxcars were sealed, that’s probably not a good word.</span> <span id="s507">Once they were closed and they started the long trek to the East, when they got there, stories came back that they weren’t even allowed to go into their own villages.</span> <span id="s508">That they went on to various goulag in Siberia and spent so much time because Stalin, Stalin sent his own son to one of them, who’d been in Germany as a slave laborer.</span> <span id="s509">He said they should have chosen death rather than work for the German war machine.</span> <span id="s510">That fought against Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Were you present for any of these – what were they called, repatriation . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: . . .transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s514">Many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Those happened at Koburg (ph).</span> <span id="s516">People were organized to be sent back to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: We would organize, we would send them to a railhead at Lichtenfelds (ph) which was about 15 kilometers from Koburg (ph), Koburg (ph).</span> <span id="s518">That was the railhead.</span> <span id="s519">We would put them on trucks and the trucks, incidentally, belonged to the 11th Panzer (ph) Division.</span> <span id="s520">They were SS troops, run by Major McLean (ph), and this is a walking stick that he later carved and gave to me.</span> <span id="s521">Here it says, Coatsing (ph), that was their headquarters, May the 5th, 11th Panzer (ph) Division, 1945.</span> <span id="s522">Although it’s a Scottish name, he was quite German.</span> <span id="s523">He had a complement of 175 vehicles, German vehicles.</span> <span id="s524">Some of them were halftracks, some were regular trucks, some were similar to our jeeps, and some were what you might call pleasure cars, for officers, perhaps an Opal, or one of the other small German car, Volkswagen.</span> <span id="s525">And we would load them onto these trucks.</span> <span id="s526">We gave them five days ration for the long trek back to Russia or Poland, to their villages.</span> <span id="s527">We saw that they were well clothed, we saw that families went together, quite unlike the transports that went to Treblinka and Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Were these people eager to go?</span> <span id="s529">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Willing to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: In the beginning.</span> <span id="s532">And then we had to force them to get on the trucks.</span> <span id="s533">Q: How many of these . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: 1500 a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: It seemed to go on forever.</span> <span id="s537">But it was around, I guess this lasted, this lasted until about March of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: So, six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Five or six months.</span> <span id="s540">Q: Daily?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Almost daily.</span> <span id="s542">The constant—we took a census of the camp from time to time.</span> <span id="s543">It wasn’t a daily census – maybe every week, every two weeks and found that the constant number was always between 13,000 and 15,000 people.</span> <span id="s544">But there were around 1500 a day that left for the railhead and around 1500 a day that came in from other camps, from the German countryside, people who’d continued to work, under the German – not as slave laborers.</span> <span id="s545">But some of them stayed in Germany who heard about what was going on after they were being repatriated.</span> <span id="s546">Some of the them wanted to stay in Germany and work on the German economy.</span> <span id="s547">That didn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s548">They started coming into camps where they could get rations, from the American Army, from Unrah(ph), from Quakers, from – there were many organizations that would send boxes of food in.</span> <span id="s549">Dry milk, dried eggs, whatever.</span> <span id="s550">And this was, this was the almost, you’d almost count on 1500 going out every day or two and we have of course, we have photos of all that.</span> <span id="s551">They send – and they decorated the trucks with boughs.</span> <span id="s552">It looked like Arbor Day.</span> <span id="s553">They put all sorts of tree branches on the trucks.</span> <span id="s554">Then they had huge photos of Stalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange points, at Lichtenfelds (ph) to see that everything was run properly, that they got on these trains.</span> <span id="s555">Later on, to our shame, our halftracks drove up and guns were mounted on the halftracks, and they were forced to get on the trains to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: When did that change happen?</span> <span id="s557">Was it – do you remember an incident where suddenly you knew that things were different or was it gradual?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Actually, it was gradual.</span> <span id="s559">And then it got to the point where I didn’t always go to the railheads.</span> <span id="s560">I went there very seldom after it started running.</span> <span id="s561">To Lichtenfelds (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: But in the beginning, you would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: In the beginnings, I would go.</span> <span id="s564">On some of the trains there . . . Q: But you felt the people were genuinely . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Happy.</span> <span id="s566">Happy, singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: And later, when you say that the Americans had to force these people.</span> <span id="s568">What was the nature of that coercion?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Maybe a little subterfuge.</span> <span id="s570">A little tell the story about how nice it was going to be after they got there, that they were going to their own villages, using the same line that the Russians used.</span> <span id="s571">And the Russians were there to back us up, to help us with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: But you knew that wasn’t true?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: It slowly dawned on all of us.</span> <span id="s574">It’s in all the books now – our disgraceful forced repatriation.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">But we couldn’t do anything else – they couldn’t live with us for -- in the camps forever.</span> <span id="s576">They couldn’t live on the German economy forever.</span> <span id="s577">Even the Germans were having – I didn’t sympathize with them that much, only as one human being to another – but they were having a difficult time.</span> <span id="s578">As a matter of fact, those who saved Jewish children started turning them over to the American army so that we would make different billets and different camps for them.</span> <span id="s579">And I think I showed you earlier, in the chronology of what happened during the war, that the Joint Distribution Committee and they were a tremendous during the war, a tremendous help.</span> <span id="s580">They saved my life many times.</span> <span id="s581">Gathered up orphans from Buchenwald, in the Buchenwald area and sent them to France.</span> <span id="s582">I received orders from Third Army headquarters to form an orphanage for Jewish children who’d been turned back by the Germans who had saved them during the war and were turning them back to the army to be fed and clothed by army personnel.</span> <span id="s583">And there was a sanitarium, the Strooth (ph) Sanitarium.</span> <span id="s584">I don’t think I’ve mentioned that name in years.</span> <span id="s585">But now I know, that was the name of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">The Strooth (ph) Sanitarium near Onzbock (ph).</span> <span id="s587">And I was to get 40 orphans to billet there and my main adversary was an American officer who received orders about the same time that I did for the orphans, he received orders to find billets for returning German prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s588">And I had to put up a big fight to get this Strooth (ph) Sanitarium for my orphans.</span> <span id="s589">And instead of getting 40, over 200 came in.</span> <span id="s590">And while I’m on the story, the Joint Distribution Committee had teachers, or they had people who – they were preparing these orphans for Israel, like the Opon (ph) and they taught them Hebrew, they were teaching them folk dancing.</span> <span id="s591">And it was a wonderful, wonderful camp and wonderful experience for them.</span> <span id="s592">And one day, one -- a little girl from the camp came into my office and gave me that block of wood that’s now in the archives at the museum.</span> <span id="s593">She had carved what looked like the Fleur de Lee (ph) that the Girl Scouts – apparently they were basing their training perhaps on what they do with the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s594">And she gave this to me and I saved it all these years, 50 years, until I came here in the end of June to turn over a lot of my artifacts and that’s one of the things that I gave to the museum.</span> <span id="s595">I later heard from her, from Israel, it was Palestine then, telling me how happy she was.</span> <span id="s596">I haven’t been able to find that letter.</span> <span id="s597">I saved all the letters that I received.</span> <span id="s598">My dear, dear sisters saved all the letters that I wrote for four years in the army and I have a journal for almost every day because I wrote quite a bit and I had a little high school girl working in my home the past month or so before school started and she was putting the letters into polyurethane sleeves and so far she’s used 1200 sleeves.</span> <span id="s599">It doesn’t mean I wrote 1200 letters.</span> <span id="s600">This is just the year of 1945 and beginning of ’46 before I came home.</span> <span id="s601">But several of my letters were five and six pages long.</span> <span id="s602">But I’m so happy to have this all, all four years preserved.</span> <span id="s603">And also letters that I got from different people – I’m doing the same thing with them.</span> <span id="s604">But I haven’t found her letter.</span> <span id="s605">I haven’t found her letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Let’s go to spring of ’46 and these repatriation transports are coming to an end you said more or less in March?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Of that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And they were getting less pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Well, not only were they coming to an end, but the army involvement was becoming less and less and they were being turned over to Unrah (ph).</span> <span id="s612">The camps were being run by Unrah (ph).</span> <span id="s613">Now before that time, I had to suffer through another inspection that turned out to be quite a coup for me.</span> <span id="s614">Major General Robertson, commanding general of the 15th Corps, I believe it was, came into my camp, with Major General Richardson.</span> <span id="s615">And he, too, was very complimentary and then he left.</span> <span id="s616">He sent back a letter of commendation which I have here.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Yes.</span> <span id="s618">15th Corps.</span> <span id="s619">Major General Robertson.</span> <span id="s620">“I wish to take this opportunity to commend you for the excellent work you’ve done at Koburg (ph) Displaced Persons Camp.</span> <span id="s621">My recent inspection revealed that your earnest efforts and ingenius use of all available facilities have solved many seemingly hopeless problems.</span> <span id="s622">A fine organization and administration of the camp reflects the highest credit upon you and your accomplishments.”</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Let’s talk about those – ingeniuses that he’s referring to.</span> <span id="s624">Why does it take ingeniuses to run a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Well . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: What was the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Well, I’ll give you one example.</span> <span id="s628">We had to find enough coal and enough wood to heat the cauldrons that made the food.</span> <span id="s629">The main food was soups, different soups.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: You were feeding 11,000 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: 11,000 people a day.</span> <span id="s632">We had to cut down entire forests, to get wood to burn in the kitchens.</span> <span id="s633">Q: You’d just go out in the nearby countryside . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: We’d go out, well, that’s where the German – the German battalion that worked with me – they were very good at ferreting out these places.</span> <span id="s635">It so happened that one of them belonged to a baroness.</span> <span id="s636">She came into my camp and begged me not to touch her trees.</span> <span id="s637">We had to.</span> <span id="s638">We had to.</span> <span id="s639">It was in our area and we needed, we needed the wood.</span> <span id="s640">Before – now, do you know that Germany was divided into four parts after the war?</span> <span id="s641">The American Occupied Zone of Germany, the British, French and Russian Occupied Zone.</span> <span id="s642">During the early days of the Russian occupation of Germany, which was just north of us, I found out that there was a warehouse that had the leather pants that the SS troop, the motorcycle troops wore.</span> <span id="s643">And there were hundreds of thousands of those leather pants.</span> <span id="s644">So Germans, well, many Europeans love rubber stamps.</span> <span id="s645">If something has a rubber stamp on it, it must be authentic.</span> <span id="s646">So I had a bunch of rubber stamps made up, in Koburg (ph), in one of the offices that made them and it said, “Please give bearer, whatever, the above merchandise,” and stamped it military government, Unites States Military Government.</span> <span id="s647">I’ve forgotten now what I put on it.</span> <span id="s648">But I sent these German trucks up to Soldenburg (ph), which was just beyond the American Occupied Zone of Germany and into the Russian Occupied Zone.</span> <span id="s649">And they loaded those trucks up with all the leather pants.</span> <span id="s650">Now the reason I did that is because in my zone, my area, there was a shoe factory.</span> <span id="s651">They didn’t have any uppers, but they had all the Airsots (ph) leathers, Airsots (ph) soles.</span> <span id="s652">And we were buying these things, we were buying equipment from the German – or articles of clothing from the Germans for the DPs and for the slave laborers.</span> <span id="s653">We were able, with one pair of leather pants, we were able to make six pairs of shoes.</span> <span id="s654">Now I wanted to bring one pair home, as a souvenir, but I thought if I bring a pair of shoes home, that means somebody’s going to have to without shoes, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s655">Oh, oh, do I think of that, when I see the shoes in the museum.</span> <span id="s656">That’s what I think about – what we did so that they’d have shoes.</span> <span id="s657">DPs.</span> <span id="s658">And what they did, and what they did when they took the shoes off -- the Jews before going in the undressing rooms -- before going into the crematoria.</span> <span id="s659">So worried that our men wouldn’t have shoes and they were so worried that they couldn’t take ‘em off fast enough.</span> <span id="s660">They’re in the bin, aren’t they – in the museum.</span> <span id="s661">That’s what I think about.</span> <span id="s662">Well, I received a letter of commendation from another major.</span> <span id="s663">I won’t read it – it’s on record, thanking me for this ingenuity.</span> <span id="s664">But you do things.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t know where it comes from.</span> <span id="s666">You – I set up a theater.</span> <span id="s667">You have pictures of that.</span> <span id="s668">They had their own entertainment.</span> <span id="s669">We had a hospital – we had a wonderful hospital.</span> <span id="s670">I also had Polish army personnel attached to my camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s672">How did they happen to be here?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: They had been slave laborers but they had been taken as prisoners.</span> <span id="s674">But they were army officers.</span> <span id="s675">They were Polish army officers and the Polish army in exile in London decreed that they work in these camps to help repatriate the Poles.</span> <span id="s676">And if I can put my hand on it right away, maybe I won’t take the time now, but they wore patches that said Polish Army Displaced Person, Third Army, Number Ten.</span> <span id="s677">That was my camp.</span> <span id="s678">DPTA10 – that was the name of my camp.</span> <span id="s679">Oh, what a badge of honor that was – for them.</span> <span id="s680">It gave them the run of the camp.</span> <span id="s681">They had wonderful uniforms to wear – it was kind of a mixed uniform – American officer uniform and Polish officer uniforms.</span> <span id="s682">But they wore their berets with the Polish emblem on it and this nice emblem wasn’t like the yellow Star of David the Jews had to wear, in disgrace.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: What was the – what were living conditions like for people at Koburg (ph)?</span> <span id="s684">There were big former German army barracks where people were housed?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: They were housed in the barracks . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Can you describe the living situation?</span> <span id="s687">Were families together?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s689">Yes.</span> <span id="s690">Not only were families together, but sometimes when they got their potato rations, they made vodka.</span> <span id="s691">And every once in a while, we had to raid the camp, when we knew that there were stills, and people told us, because, actually, it was – it had become poisonous, a lot of the vodka that they made.</span> <span id="s692">I don’t know what they mixed it with.</span> <span id="s693">They mixed it with alcohol that you put in cars and there were some horrible scenes.</span> <span id="s694">But they lived, I assure you, they lived much better than they had ever lived up until that time under the German rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: They had three meals a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: They had three meals a day.</span> <span id="s697">Not only did they have three meals a day but we had a nutritionist attached to the camp.</span> <span id="s698">Two nutritionists – we had an American nutritionist and one on the Unrah (ph) team.</span> <span id="s699">There was a schedule, there was a roster – so many calories for adults, so many calories for children at a certain age, so many calories for youngsters, those who got skim milk, those got regular milk with cream.</span> <span id="s700">Incidentally, Strooth (ph) Sanitarium, for the orphans, was near Striker’s Farm.</span> <span id="s701">Striker, who was the number one Jew-Baiter (ph) of Germany – I saw him – I went to the Nuremburg war trials one day.</span> <span id="s702">We were able to get eggs and butter and milk from his farm.</span> <span id="s703">His farm functioned during the entire war – it never stopped producing.</span> <span id="s704">At first it bothered me and then I thought why should it bother me?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">We’re getting all this good stuff from him.</span> <span id="s706">Incidentally, we got fresh vegetables and butter and fresh meat from the German economy.</span> <span id="s707">We had demands, we had regular requisitions that we gave the military, the German military command, in each city, and they had to supply so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: And they did.</span> <span id="s710">And they cried plenty.</span> <span id="s711">I have letters here, telling us that it’s getting more and more difficult to supply us with what, with what we’re requesting.</span> <span id="s712">Well, we cut it down.</span> <span id="s713">We compromised.</span> <span id="s714">But we weren’t .</span> <span id="s715">We were a little more humane.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So some of the supplies were coming from the army. . . A: Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And some you would work through the local German military authorities and they would supply . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: The German, actually, the German civilian.</span> <span id="s719">It was called, had the name here, called the German Food Commission, I believe.</span> <span id="s720">And they had set up this commission to supply fresh food for the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And what kind of – vegetables grown locally?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s723">Whatever they could get – beans, corn, lentils which of course is a form of beans.</span> <span id="s724">Q: And some fresh meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Fresh meat.</span> <span id="s726">I rather think some of the nice meat we got was horse meat.</span> <span id="s727">But as long as, as long, and I’ve eaten it.</span> <span id="s728">As long as I didn’t know what it was, it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s729">And it was supplemented by different charity organizations that would send food in.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: So you were constantly balancing what you had in your warehouse with how many people were around and how many were expected . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: But you never really knew from month to month how many people you were going to have?</span> <span id="s733">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: But somehow it worked out, somehow it worked out.</span> <span id="s736">There were times, there were times when I felt like I was in a pressure cooker and I had to let off some steam.</span> <span id="s737">And there was a very, you couldn’t call it a mountain, ‘course Bavaria is beautiful and there’s all sorts of mountains around in the area, but a couple of times I had to get in my jeep and drive up to the highest point and get out and scream.</span> <span id="s738">Just scream.</span> <span id="s739">To know what?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Just because you felt so much pressure, so tense?</span> <span id="s741">Can you describe some of – specific reasons why you would feel tense?</span> <span id="s742">Was it negotiating with people that was difficult for you – what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Well, it was getting orders that camp was going to be inspected and trying to get everybody to work, to see that things were clean.</span> <span id="s744">And inspect the kitchens, to see, we didn’t want typhus to break out.</span> <span id="s745">We didn’t want any of the, any contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s746">We didn’t, we kept fighting, we kept fighting food sources.</span> <span id="s747">That was the main thing.</span> <span id="s748">And whenever a shipment came in, right into the camp, people knew about it.</span> <span id="s749">Especially, if they came, if they were things that came, not from the army or from the German economy but things that came in from some of the other support groups.</span> <span id="s750">I keep saying Quakers because they were really very predominant in this but there were other – I’m trying to think of some of the other civilian groups in the United States that sent food over.</span> <span id="s751">But when those, when those shipments came in, they would gather around the truck and almost act like, I don’t like to use the word animals, but it, everybody wanted to get in front.</span> <span id="s752">“Throw me a box of this.</span> <span id="s753">Throw this to me.</span> <span id="s754">I want this.</span> <span id="s755">Throw it.</span> <span id="s756">I’m here.</span> <span id="s757">Throw it to me.</span> <span id="s758">Ah, here, I need this.</span> <span id="s759">My child needs this.”</span> <span id="s760">“Here’s some dry milk.</span> <span id="s761">Here’s some Hersheys, some Hersheys candy bars.</span> <span id="s762">Cigarettes.”</span> <span id="s763">These are the things that were prized and that’s what I had my nightmares over after I got home, many, many months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Those scenes of people trying to get things . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: I’d wake up and look at the end of the bed and I’d see these people coming over it, over my knees, and screaming for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Did you get satisfaction at the time, that you were able to help them, or did it always feel like you couldn’t do enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s768">There were a lot of perks, believe me.</span> <span id="s769">I was amply repaid.</span> <span id="s770">And not just, it was, it was a very good feeling to know that you’re helping these people.</span> <span id="s771">Because of, because of the, because of the commendation that I got, from Major General Robertson, I was able to, he promoted me to captain.</span> <span id="s772">A major general can do that – they call it a battlefield promotion.</span> <span id="s773">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s774">I went in as a private and thought, gee, I’d like to come out as a captain.</span> <span id="s775">That seemed like – I didn’t want anything more.</span> <span id="s776">And it did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">And then because of Major General Robertson, because of this letter of commendation, it entitled me to the army commendation medal, which I have.</span> <span id="s778">And I thought I brought it in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Did, in your camp, did you have, I know you had a flow in and out of people from different places but what was the situation in Koburg (ph) in, let’s say the first six months or so, for Jewish DPs?</span> <span id="s780">Did you have a lot of Jewish people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes, but before I go into that . . . Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: In sending the western Europeans home, and I’ll come back to that, in sending the western Europeans home, we had a French team attached to the camp and it was called the MMLA, Mission Militaire Liaison (ph) Administratif.</span> <span id="s783">We had three French officers, men, and one female officer.</span> <span id="s784">The female officer was Russian, of Russian origin, but had lived in France many years.</span> <span id="s785">And they helped us repatriate the western Europeans.</span> <span id="s786">And they were tremendous help.</span> <span id="s787">One was a doctor, two of them, two of them were doctors.</span> <span id="s788">One wore a signet ring – it didn’t mean anything to me at the time, and I’ll tell you what happened much later on, but he was a Bourbon (ph), he was of the Bourbon (ph) royalty.</span> <span id="s789">French Bourbon (ph).</span> <span id="s790">And the most helpful was the woman because I had all these eastern Europeans, too, as well as the western Europeans.</span> <span id="s791">And they wanted to stay, they worked very hard and it was an opportunity for them to learn English, from us, and we learned as much French as we could from them.</span> <span id="s792">Now, you asked me, about the camp that I was coming back to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: I asked you about Jews.</span> <span id="s794">A: The Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Up until that time, up until that time, there were Jews, but they came in as DPs.</span> <span id="s797">This was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s798">They came into camp and when I knew who they were, and they had their own way of, of, of being in their own group.</span> <span id="s799">And when they realized that this camp was really a repatriation camp, a camp that was sending people back east, when they realized they couldn’t go back, then they wanted to get to Jewish camps.</span> <span id="s800">And who took them to the Jewish camps?</span> <span id="s801">What irony.</span> <span id="s802">My German major from the Panzer (ph) Division in his trucks.</span> <span id="s803">Loaded them up – and he knew.</span> <span id="s804">And I knew that he knew.</span> <span id="s805">But they got very good treatment and they went to camps in southern Bavaria.</span> <span id="s806">There was Ogsburg (ph), there was a camp in Ogsburg (ph), there was a camp at Strowbing (ph), there was a camp, there was one they called the Funk Casairn (ph).</span> <span id="s807">Casairn (ph) means camp.</span> <span id="s808">I knew that that was a Jewish camp and he and his men had orders to take the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So after what period of time – do you remember when that was, in the winter of ’45, maybe, that soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Early ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Early ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Beginning, beginning in winter of ’45 and early ’46.</span> <span id="s813">Now, when, when Unrah (ph) started taking over the camps, I was transferred.</span> <span id="s814">I’m trying to think if there was anything more I wanted to tell you about Koburg, except that it was running rather smoothly, although people started trickling back and telling their countrymen that they weren’t allowed to go home, that they were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s815">So that meant that more came in and that we would have to continue to take care of them.</span> <span id="s816">On Bastille Day in camp, one of the French officers almost blew up the camp celebrating Bastille Day.</span> <span id="s817">Jacques Jencam (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s818">And when he left, he told me if I ever got to Paris to be sure and look him up, which I later did, but that’s, I’ll go into that.</span> <span id="s819">Now, I, when the work was running smoothly in the camps, and, as I said, they had their own hospitals, they had their own entertainment.</span> <span id="s820">We were invited to many of the affairs that they had in camp, as guests of honor, and I went.</span> <span id="s821">I danced to many a oom- pah-pah band and Polish, and the polka.</span> <span id="s822">I liked to dance.</span> <span id="s823">Then I was transferred to Onzbock (ph) which was outside of Nuremburg.</span> <span id="s824">And I was put in charge of several DP camps and also the exchange point at Hoapf, (ph) Germany, and we have that on the map.</span> <span id="s825">Now the reason it was called an exchange point is because, apparently, and I believe it was at the Yalta Conference, we, that is the four major powers, said that we would repatriate the Germans, also, who had been displaced because of war.</span> <span id="s826">German for German, who had been displaced prior to September the 1st, 1936.</span> <span id="s827">And they all, and they came from Russian zone into the American zone through Hoapf (ph), Germany.</span> <span id="s828">And I was in charge of that exchange point.</span> <span id="s829">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s830">And it was through this exchange point, the Jews came in.</span> <span id="s831">They also had gone back to Poland, or wherever.</span> <span id="s832">And they thought that they, well they did, they knew their homes were already occupied, their farms had been occupied, and they were being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">The progroms had started.</span> <span id="s834">A little anecdote.</span> <span id="s835">When the Allies got onto the government of Poland, after the war, immediately after the war, and started chastising them for starting these anti-Semitic picadilloes again, this one telegram that they got, or communicae that they got, said, “I don’t understand how you can be so unhappy with us.</span> <span id="s836">We’ve only burned one synagogue since last August.”</span> <span id="s837">This is what was happening.</span> <span id="s838">Lodz (ph), Lodz (ph), the city of Lodz (ph), that had 200,000 Jews before the war, two of them came back.</span> <span id="s839">The Lodz (ph) Uprising.</span> <span id="s840">When they were subdued, they were all taken out, but 40 of them hid in the, in various cellars, underground sewers.</span> <span id="s841">This is why they either didn’t go, or went and came back.</span> <span id="s842">Poles wanted to kill them.</span> <span id="s843">They didn’t want to give up their homes.</span> <span id="s844">They didn’t want to give up their farms.</span> <span id="s845">I’m not talking about the Poles that came to American during the mass migration in 1906 and 1909.</span> <span id="s846">They came for the same reason my folks came – to get away from religious persecution and to have a better life for their children.</span> <span id="s847">There was a Polish family that took care of all of us in Saint, little St. Joseph, Missouri.</span> <span id="s848">They were like brothers and sisters to my father and mother because they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s849">My folks did too -- Russian Polish.</span> <span id="s850">These are people that had been so indoctrinated with the hatred who had helped, I think they showed the Nazis a few things, and so did the Estonians and Lithuanians and the Latvians.</span> <span id="s851">They came out smelling like a rose, too, after the war.</span> <span id="s852">To make Patton say, when he talked about the dirty, filthy Jews, he said, “They’re nothing like the Estonians.”</span> <span id="s853">Well, how could they be?</span> <span id="s854">Where was the soap?</span> <span id="s855">Where were the water levels in the billets that they were in?</span> <span id="s856">There wasn’t any water, there wasn’t any running water!</span> <span id="s857">How could they use the latrines or the toilets?</span> <span id="s858">He didn’t think about that.</span> <span id="s859">And it was against his Anglo-Saxon sensitivities to put them in German homes.</span> <span id="s860">You can’t displace Germans!</span> <span id="s861">For the Jews?</span> <span id="s862">“I can’t do that,” he said.</span> <span id="s863">I’m digressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Let’s talk about Hoapf (ph).</span> <span id="s865">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: How did you organize that?</span> <span id="s867">It sounds like a big job.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: It was a big job.</span> <span id="s869">It was a big job and I didn’t do it alone.</span> <span id="s870">We had security troops there stationed . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Can you remind me, give me a little time frame here?</span> <span id="s872">Do you remember roughly when you went to that assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: March.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Were we talking March?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: March.</span> <span id="s876">We’re talking about March, ’46.</span> <span id="s877">Q: Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: February, March.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: We had security patrols around there and we had, we had people, offices set up and they all had papers.</span> <span id="s881">They all had the, they all had the papers.</span> <span id="s882">Everyone had papers . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Everyone . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Germans had papers, the Jews coming across had their papers.</span> <span id="s885">I don’t think that they were the correct papers, I know that they weren’t.</span> <span id="s886">I know that they were false papers but they were coming in as German nationals.</span> <span id="s887">And they had been doing that for months.</span> <span id="s888">I know at least that I’d helped about 900 come through.</span> <span id="s889">And this one time, I might as well get onto this story, because it happened.</span> <span id="s890">There were 125 caught coming, Jews, coming across the border with, at Hoapf (ph).</span> <span id="s891">They had the security patrol pick them up and he called in Onzbock (ph), and wanted to know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s892">I said, “Put them all in jail at Hoapf (ph).”</span> <span id="s893">Now this is in Mittenwald (ph).</span> <span id="s894">Mittenwald (ph) is the county and Hoapf (ph) is the main city.</span> <span id="s895">The Joint Distribution Committee was working out of the jail and they were handling all the Jews, many of the Jews that were coming through.</span> <span id="s896">Now there’s a lot that enters into this.</span> <span id="s897">The extreme efficiency of the Germans.</span> <span id="s898">By now the trains were running, by now the electricity was on, all the gas, water and that wasn’t too long after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Less than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Less than a year.</span> <span id="s901">And the people that were supposed to be doing all this were still back in the military government schools at the University, the University of Michigan, Harvard or Yale – the Ivy League schools.</span> <span id="s902">They were learning German, they were learning Polish, they were learning Russian, they were learning French, so that they’d know how to handle the DPs when they got to Europe.</span> <span id="s903">They got there after it was all over.</span> <span id="s904">But it worked.</span> <span id="s905">And now this was an officer – this was a captain, the security officer and he wanted to know what to do with their papers.</span> <span id="s906">I said, “Send them to me by courier,” and incidentally, among my pictures that I gave Bob Kesting (ph), just yesterday, I have a picture of the courier.</span> <span id="s907">And it got to me, in Onzbock (ph), to my billet, at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel, about three in the morning, and I burned them.</span> <span id="s908">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s909">It just seemed to be the thing to do.</span> <span id="s910">You have evidence of some transgression – you get rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: And – meaning you knew these were false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: It really didn’t matter – about burning them because I knew that they could make new papers.</span> <span id="s913">It amounted to just the same as the paper – but I didn’t want to have any of the evidence because of what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s914">I knew I would have to account for it.</span> <span id="s915">By morning, by morning, they were all out of jail.</span> <span id="s916">The guards had been bribed with money, with drinks, with liquor and the Jews were on trains, again going to Jewish DP camps in the American Occupied Zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s917">The story doesn’t end there with me.</span> <span id="s918">I was called into the office—my commanding officer’s office – who was a colonel.</span> <span id="s919">And I shan’t tell you his name.</span> <span id="s920">I’ve never mentioned his name.</span> <span id="s921">He was regular army.</span> <span id="s922">He had appropriated the finest chalet in Onzbock, for his family.</span> <span id="s923">They were coming over.</span> <span id="s924">After all, this was a war of occupation.</span> <span id="s925">He had appropriated one of Hitler’s specially built Mercedes-Benz bullet-proof touring cars for his own.</span> <span id="s926">And he called me in because the security officer at Hoapf (ph) told him what had happened.</span> <span id="s927">He said, “What do you know about this?”</span> <span id="s928">I said “Well, I know that 125 Jews, approximately, 125 Jews tried to come across the border last night and I told the captain to put them all in jail.”</span> <span id="s929">He said “Well, they’re all gone now.</span> <span id="s930">Where do you think they are?”</span> <span id="s931">And I said “Well, I think they’re all very happily ensconced in Jewish DP camps in Bavaria, in southern Germany.”</span> <span id="s932">He said, “You know, this is conduct unbecoming an American officer and I’m going to have to court-martial you.”</span> <span id="s933">Well.</span> <span id="s934">“We, I’ll send for someone from the Judge Advocate Division, Third Army headquarters to come up and take a deposition.</span> <span id="s935">Meanwhile, you’re under arrest of quarters at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel.”</span> <span id="s936">I found this the other night.</span> <span id="s937">I knew something would happen – I wouldn’t be able to put my hands on these things.</span> <span id="s938">Nevertheless, that’s where we were billeted.</span> <span id="s939">It was a little embarrassing to go from his office, with two MPs, one on each side of me and put me under arrest of quarters in my hotel room.</span> <span id="s940">And I could only leave to go to eat, also, under guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">He, I saw him afterwards, before the, it would have been the attorney from the judge advocate, judge advocate’s office, whatever, to come up and take a deposition prior to a court martial – I saw him.</span> <span id="s942">My colonel.</span> <span id="s943">And I said, “Colonel” – now I want you to know that I was just a kid, according to what I am now, I was just a kid, but you grow up very fast in the army.</span> <span id="s944">I said, “I don’t know what’s going to happen to me if you court martial me.</span> <span id="s945">I’m sure I’ll be breaking rocks at Fort Leavenworth.</span> <span id="s946">But you’re going to be right beside me.”</span> <span id="s947">He said, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s948">I said, “I’ll just have to tell them how you allowed all your men to go into my DP camps, your officers gave them furloughs and leaves to go into my DP camps and shack up with the women in the camp.</span> <span id="s949">You gave them extra rations.</span> <span id="s950">You drew army rations that you shouldn’t have so that they could have a wonderful time sleeping with my women in the camps!”</span> <span id="s951">They were so bold and so blazen about this that they walked around in their uniforms.</span> <span id="s952">They didn’t even bother to get into civilian clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: And that was forbidden, that they should go . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s955">Yes.</span> <span id="s956">Couldn’t fraternize with them at all.</span> <span id="s957">There were all sorts of directives.</span> <span id="s958">We had a little pamphlet that Bradley put out.</span> <span id="s959">It’s in the archives – I gave it to them.</span> <span id="s960">“So I’ll have to tell them that.”</span> <span id="s961">And he thought for a moment.</span> <span id="s962">I said, “You know, you can delegate command in the army, as a colonel, you can tell me, as a captain, what to do, but the responsibility is still your responsibility.</span> <span id="s963">And all this happened under your nose.”</span> <span id="s964">What’s 125 Jews?</span> <span id="s965">There were close to a thousand.</span> <span id="s966">This had been going on for months.</span> <span id="s967">And it worked.</span> <span id="s968">It didn’t mean anything to him.</span> <span id="s969">The lives of 125 Jews, or even a thousand, compared to what he was going to have after his family came over.</span> <span id="s970">This fine chalet in Onzbock (ph) where they could go skiing at Garmish (ph), Garmish Pardonkershem (ph).</span> <span id="s971">Where they could go into Nuremburg, where the Passion Play already started.</span> <span id="s972">And over Amergal (ph), they could have that.</span> <span id="s973">Oh, I don’t know how he ended up.</span> <span id="s974">Probably, may be, maybe made general one day, who knows?</span> <span id="s975">I was, but . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: We’re about to run out of time.</span> <span id="s977">Let’s pick up on the next reel.</span> <span id="s978">A: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Dr. Friedman, you were telling us, in the last tape about your having allowed these 125 Jews to come through Hoapf (ph), which means that you understood the underground organization that had been created in Europe to move Jews from east to west and eventually down to the Mediterranean – their passage to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Right.</span> <span id="s984">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Explain how you became aware of this and how do you witness its function?</span> <span id="s986">A: That’s very good.</span> <span id="s987">Sometime in the summer of ’45, perhaps around June . . . Q: ’45?</span> <span id="s988">Right after the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s990">Yes.</span> <span id="s991">A group of Palestinian officers, now we must remember it wasn’t called Israel then, they were Jewish officers who had fought with the Palestinian brigade in North Africa.</span> <span id="s992">And they had permission from Third Army headquarters and they had their papers with them and they had a roster of families and names with them.</span> <span id="s993">And you have a picture of that in your archives.</span> <span id="s994">And I’m so proud of them.</span> <span id="s995">I’m standing right in the middle of them.</span> <span id="s996">I just wanted to be with them because of what they were doing.</span> <span id="s997">They were trying to find, ostensibly, they were trying to find, survivors of the relatives of members of the Palestinian Brigade.</span> <span id="s998">Well, this is true, they were, and they did find as many as they could.</span> <span id="s999">But, it was to be a cover for the Jewish Underground.</span> <span id="s1000">And what they were trying to do was to get the sympathies of the American Jewish officers, mostly American Jewish officers, although a very dear friend of mine that I worked with who is non-Jewish helped a lot.</span> <span id="s1001">And therein lies another story but, and when they realized that I would do all that I could to help out, they, they were satisfied and pleased.</span> <span id="s1002">And I think, I think if, if the museum would blow up this photo that I had, that there might be some faces on there that are easily recognizable because I’m sure that they later became leaders in the state of Israel or in, again, with repatriation of, of Jewish DPs, Jewish slave laborers.</span> <span id="s1003">And I think we might find among them some who had really dedicated the rest of their lives to this type of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: And how, how did the, this sort of, you say ostensibly they were looking for relatives, how did the sort of surreptitious become communicated to you?</span> <span id="s1005">Did they take you aside and tell you?</span> <span id="s1006">Or was it all reading between the lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No, no, I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I was told, yes.</span> <span id="s1010">I was told when they found out that – I had actually been sending, I’d been sending Jews.</span> <span id="s1011">They knew and I told them that I was sending them with the German battalion to various camps and so it wasn’t, it really wasn’t all that new for me to do.</span> <span id="s1012">All it meant was that they knew that they could come into my camp, you know, with an open heart, and freely, and without fear of being spied upon and told to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: We should say for the record, that at the time, this migration was an illegal migration because it was not, people were not being allowed to go into Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: They had closed it immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1017">The White Paper, the Offer Declaration, the, the many sad stories of barely getting to the shores and not being allowed to land.</span> <span id="s1018">Incidentally, they were not only coming from Italy, they were coming from Greece, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Those ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: And once then, so you met these soldiers in the summer of ’45?</span> <span id="s1022">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And it was clear to you immediately that there was this continent-wide organization?</span> <span id="s1024">A: In Bavaria, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: And you, did you have contact with them – those specific soldiers, subsequently?</span> <span id="s1026">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Or other . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: No, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1029">I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: And did they identify themselves as an organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1032">They had, they had legitimate papers that were given to them by the military government of the Third Army.</span> <span id="s1033">They’d come up, the papers were dated and had the letterheads – were from the Third Army Headquarters at Bod Toles (ph) which was south of Munich and it was very legitimate.</span> <span id="s1034">The legitimate part was that they were looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s1035">The other part was that they were also looking for people who were sympathetic towards getting the Jews into camps, helping them get into camps.</span> <span id="s1036">But, God bless the Jews, they sort of organized themselves and knew where they wanted to go, and knew how to get there.</span> <span id="s1037">They just, they just couldn’t have, didn’t want any interference.</span> <span id="s1038">There was still, you see when the war ended, there was such a, there was such a, a, thrust by the Germans, the young Germans, to poison the minds of the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1039">Now these were soldiers who had never fought in any of the wars, they were fresh from the States and they came in and they saw all the dirty DPs and they saw the dirty French and they saw the dirty Poles, and they saw the dirty this and the dirty that, and the nice clean efficient Germans.</span> <span id="s1040">Well, of course they were.</span> <span id="s1041">All the soap went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1042">“Course they might have been washing themselves with one of their ancestors, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1043">We know how some of the soap was made.</span> <span id="s1044">In fact, I have a ship, or had one, that had the Nina, one of Columbus’s vessels, a copy of it, and the sails were made out of human skin.</span> <span id="s1045">And I wanted to bring it back and put it in one of the museums in St. Joe.</span> <span id="s1046">And I did bring it back, but it’s disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So what you’re saying is that the G.I.s were strongly prejudiced against Jewish people . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: . . . after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1050">Yes.</span> <span id="s1051">Not all.</span> <span id="s1052">Not all but this was just another little murder.</span> <span id="s1053">This was another little battle that we had to contend with.</span> <span id="s1054">They didn’t have to draw, they didn’t have to draw KP anymore.</span> <span id="s1055">The Germans did that, the Germans peeled the potatoes, the Germans did the cooking for the army.</span> <span id="s1056">They didn’t have to draw extensive guard duty.</span> <span id="s1057">You know, there was no more, you know there was no more fear of being invaded, of having your, your command post taken over by Germans or any kind of invading army.</span> <span id="s1058">Was no longer in existence.</span> <span id="s1059">All they had to do was sleep with the German girls and drink the champagne and schnapps.</span> <span id="s1060">It was a great life!</span> <span id="s1061">We didn’t want these dirty people to interfere with it.</span> <span id="s1062">Get rid of ‘em.</span> <span id="s1063">Put ‘em in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: And that was the overwhelming sentiment, you think, of the average G.I.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I really do.</span> <span id="s1066">Maybe I’m very cynical about it, maybe I’m overemphasizing it, but I saw it right after the war ended.</span> <span id="s1067">Perhaps with all the directives that were sent out and that little booklet that every soldier had to have, that Omar Bradley – you have it, they have it at the museum.</span> <span id="s1068">I gave it to them.</span> <span id="s1069">Perhaps with that, if they complied with what he asked them to, things might have been better afterwards.</span> <span id="s1070">But they were seeing the world through Uncle Sam and having a ball.</span> <span id="s1071">They knew nothing about what went before.</span> <span id="s1072">If they had read about it, or if they were told about it, it didn’t have the force or the power or the – it didn’t affect them the way it did the soldiers who were right there and really knew what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: By that you mean – what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: They didn’t go into the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Most of the G.I.s never did.</span> <span id="s1076">So they didn’t really understand . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: . . . what these people, or who these people were and what they’d been through.</span> <span id="s1079">Didn’t – Eisenhower seems was very adamant about getting the word out . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: . . . about what had happened in these camps.</span> <span id="s1082">He invited journalists to come immediately . . . A: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: . . . camera crews came right away.</span> <span id="s1084">He brought in civilians from and he and other officers insisted that civilian, that German civilians be brought to see what had happened.</span> <span id="s1085">So he, he seemed to be making – there seemed to be some effort being made to let the world know . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: . . . what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1089">And Truman followed suit.</span> <span id="s1090">Truman did the same thing after he went after because Roosevelt died during this time, ’45 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: . . . and Truman wanted separate camps set up for Jews if the – go into the German homes, had no qualms about it.</span> <span id="s1093">Didn’t bother them to go into the Jewish homes and kick everybody out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: But you are, I think saying, that part of the reason for the surreptitious nature of this effort to get Jews out was resistance by American military personnel, as well as the law prohibiting Jews from migrating to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well, you know, everybody was torn during those times.</span> <span id="s1096">If you wanted to obey directives, if you knew that they couldn’t land in Palestine, then you tried to do – I’m talking about regular army – you thought why, why would I put them in camps?</span> <span id="s1097">Or why, why would I try to get them down to Italy so that they could get on ships for Israel ‘cause they’re not going to take them anyway?</span> <span id="s1098">They won’t take them – they started taking them in Brazil, incidentally.</span> <span id="s1099">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s1100">We didn’t take them until much later but that’s a whole other story.</span> <span id="s1101">Again, it was very chaotic, even at that time, as to what to do.</span> <span id="s1102">Most important thing was to see that they were well fed and clothed and had some degree of contentment and family because they, and, in some way, and some way that they could really reckon with their tremendous loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And the people that were coming from east to west, among them the 125 that you have already described – who were they, mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: They were mostly Jews who had gone back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1105">Q: And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: And found, they were either being killed, or they killed, some of them.</span> <span id="s1107">There’s records, there’s, there’s documentation of some who did this.</span> <span id="s1108">Couldn’t get back into their homes.</span> <span id="s1109">Look, it had been how many years since they’d been gone?</span> <span id="s1110">If we go back to ’33 and now, well not so much in Poland, we’ll go to ’39 and here it’s ’45, ’46 – people’d been living in their homes for five years and tilling the soil, their farms, milking their cows and had a degree of prosperity that they had never known before.</span> <span id="s1111">The Russians, the Poles, who had taken over, mostly Poland, Lithuania, had taken over the Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s1112">They didn’t want them back and they knew that if they stayed they would, in all probability, be killed because the progroms were starting again.</span> <span id="s1113">Those were the ones who were coming back and they didn’t want to stay in the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s1114">They knew that they would get better treatment in the American zone.</span> <span id="s1115">And by coming into the American zone, they could get closer, and closer, and closer to either the United States or Israel.</span> <span id="s1116">Those were the two main places that they wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Do you have any sense of how many people, Jewish people, you may have helped come through Hoapf (ph) other – was it those 125 or were there more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Yes, there were more.</span> <span id="s1119">There were more.</span> <span id="s1120">I . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Were they coming in all the time, every day for a period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: No.</span> <span id="s1123">No.</span> <span id="s1124">No.</span> <span id="s1125">No.</span> <span id="s1126">I estimate, at one time, that as closely as I could remember, that there must have been around 900, close to 900 to a thousand who had come through there.</span> <span id="s1127">I know because that’s the figure that I threw at my commanding officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: And they were in small groups?</span> <span id="s1129">And always sort of a similar situation with papers . . . A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: . . . that had been supplied to them by . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Either themselves, their own little group, their own little group leader, the Joint Distribution Committee, with the ubiquitous rubber stamp.</span> <span id="s1132">That rubber stamp had to be on everything – didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s1133">Well, it did mean something.</span> <span id="s1134">It meant that the, that the illegal papers were legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Lots of times there were guards that were bribed . . . A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Were you ever involved in that kind of thing?</span> <span id="s1137">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: It would have been done on the other side of the border?</span> <span id="s1139">A: And then when they came across to get on trains . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: So yours was a position to accept or deny.</span> <span id="s1141">You weren’t actually, you were not sort of part of their. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Migration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: . . . bureaucracy in a sense.</span> <span id="s1144">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: But you had the – you could make the decision to let them in or not let them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yeah, but I had to be very careful, you see.</span> <span id="s1147">I had, I had, above all, I was an American army officer.</span> <span id="s1148">I was in charge of the other Displaced Person Camps in the area, as well as this exchange point so I had to sort of walk</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: You were highly visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1151">Kind of a thin line.</span> <span id="s1152">I really couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1153">I couldn’t go to Hoapf (ph) and oversee this transfer unless . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Because that would be obvious, sort of participating . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Yeah, I could, yes, I could oversee the German transfer.</span> <span id="s1156">But it was carried along as the same time as the Jews were coming across.</span> <span id="s1157">So it was best just to let it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And some of them then, I guess, would come into the camps that you were overseeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: That, not from Hoapf (ph), not so much, no.</span> <span id="s1160">By that time, they were going into Jewish camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: And none of those were among your ten?</span> <span id="s1162">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Did you ever have a chance to meet up with any of these groups of people at any . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: . . . any of these thousand people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: No.</span> <span id="s1167">Only the one, no.</span> <span id="s1168">None of those.</span> <span id="s1169">But of course those who came through my camp at Koburg (ph), I knew when they were coming through and I knew when they were going out with the, in the trucks and they got special care – food, clothing.</span> <span id="s1170">Years later, well let’s go back to where, if you like, where I was almost court-martialed.</span> <span id="s1171">Is that alright?</span> <span id="s1172">Anyway, I was put under arrest of quarters in Onzbock (ph).</span> <span id="s1173">In the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel.</span> <span id="s1174">And as I said before, I told the colonel that you can’t, that the responsibility was all his and it was under his command.</span> <span id="s1175">Now and he had all his family coming over, they were all ready to come over for the duration, however long that was going to be.</span> <span id="s1176">And the next day, there were orders that came from Third Army Headquarters sending me home.</span> <span id="s1177">That’s among the orders that you have.</span> <span id="s1178">Now they would send divisions home, they would send battalions home, and my orders came through, one person, Captain Joe Friedman, report to Camp Philip Morris.</span> <span id="s1179">And I was escorted by the two military government, by the two MPs, to the train.</span> <span id="s1180">We went by car to Frankfurt – we got on the train there for Paris.</span> <span id="s1181">Now Jacques Jangcam (ph), who had the Bourbon (ph) signet ring, or crest, told me that if I ever got to Paris, to call him.</span> <span id="s1182">Well, we had to change trains, either from the Guardinore (ph), or whatever.</span> <span id="s1183">I don’t remember because, because it’s been 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1184">But I took a chance and I called him.</span> <span id="s1185">Had his phone number in my little book when I knew I was going through Paris and I called him and he asked me – and he was home!</span> <span id="s1186">And he asked me where I was and I told him I was at the train station.</span> <span id="s1187">And I told him what the circumstances were – that were two MPs guarding me – but at the time they were looking at magazines and French postcards in the train station.</span> <span id="s1188">And he said, “I know that train station.”</span> <span id="s1189">He said, “I’ll be over there.</span> <span id="s1190">You stay in the phone booth and pretend that you’re talking to me.</span> <span id="s1191">I’ll be over there in about ten minutes and when you see me in the doorway, you come out of the telephone booth and come right to where I am and we’ll get in my car and I’ll take you home – to my, to my home.”</span> <span id="s1192">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1193">I don’t think anything happened to the MPs, because they were all so happy to get rid of me.</span> <span id="s1194">I’m sure that when he went back, when they went back to Onzbock (ph), and told the colonel what had happened, he probably felt that it would be fine if I was arrested for being AWOL, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1195">But, what actually happened was that Jacques took me to his home.</span> <span id="s1196">And his home happened to be a floor through apartments, apartment in the Trockadeero (ph) Section of Paris.</span> <span id="s1197">And you could see the Eiffel Tower from their home, their apartment.</span> <span id="s1198">And it was the type of apartment that the elevator opened up into their, well as long as it’s French I’d better say foyer, but it opened up into their foyer.</span> <span id="s1199">And I, his grandmother lived with them, and I received her, I was given her suite of rooms while I was there, which consisted of a sitting room, a bedroom and a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1200">And I was served breakfast in bed.</span> <span id="s1201">In fact, I had to wait until the maid got out, left the room so I could get out of bed and put the tray on the dresser so I could have breakfast comfortably.</span> <span id="s1202">I found out what the signet ring was: their dining room – they had tapestries all over the, all over the apartment and they were these tapestries that depicted all the wars that the Bourbons (ph) had fought in from whenever to wherever.</span> <span id="s1203">And he was the descendant of the kings and it didn’t mean anything to him except that he had this signet ring that he wore.</span> <span id="s1204">And it was also in needlepoint on the back of all the chairs in the dining room.</span> <span id="s1205">And Jacques had a sister who showed me around Paris.</span> <span id="s1206">We went to the Louvre – we did all the typical tourist things and I was there for about four days.</span> <span id="s1207">I was very anxious – I was a little afraid that something might happen and I did leave after, I think it was four or five days.</span> <span id="s1208">But I’d been to the Leedo (ph) and the Moulon (ph) Rouge and the Casino de Paris and to the Napoleon’s tomb and the famous cemetery – well, whatever.</span> <span id="s1209">I’ll think of it.</span> <span id="s1210">And I got to Camp Philip Morris.</span> <span id="s1211">I could have stayed in Paris for a month!</span> <span id="s1212">When I reported there, they said, “Well, you’ll go out on the next available ship, boat.”</span> <span id="s1213">Washtub is what it was.</span> <span id="s1214">It was a victory ship.</span> <span id="s1215">I crossed in the Amsterdam, the SS something Amsterdam which was a huge luxury vessel.</span> <span id="s1216">Took us four and a half days to cross – took me ten days to get back, and it was during that time and I was in a stateroom with other officers, and that’s when all my things were stolen.</span> <span id="s1217">With the exception of that one bottle of perfume and the fifth of Three Feathers.</span> <span id="s1218">That was a very popular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad.</span> <span id="s1219">Then, I came home and I had a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s1220">I was being separated from the service at Jefferson Barracks and I sort of broached on this subject when we were talking before, but the first person I saw was a friend of mine that I grew up with in St. Joe and he was playing cards in the officers’ recreation room.</span> <span id="s1221">And I ran up to him and I said, “Paul!”</span> <span id="s1222">You know, I was so happy to be home!</span> <span id="s1223">I said, “I’m going to be in St. Joe!</span> <span id="s1224">They’re shipping me out tomorrow!</span> <span id="s1225">Is there anything you want me to tell your folks – I’ll call them!”</span> <span id="s1226">And he said, “Eh, I see them every weekend.”</span> <span id="s1227">He had spent the entire war in Jefferson Barracks.</span> <span id="s1228">I guess he did something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Something that was necessary to the war effort.</span> <span id="s1230">But it hit me, really, how .</span> <span id="s1231">Four years I’ve been in this man’s army.</span> <span id="s1232">Finally got home.</span> <span id="s1233">I’d been home before on furloughs and on leaves during the time that I was in the States.</span> <span id="s1234">My army career was sort of evenly divided.</span> <span id="s1235">I, I spent two years in the States and two years in Europe.</span> <span id="s1236">Then I was ordered to report to the parade grounds at Jefferson Barracks before being separated from the service.</span> <span id="s1237">And I was wearing my captain, my captain’s bars and I thought oh-oh, my AWOL caught up with me.</span> <span id="s1238">Here it comes, the saber, you know, cutting all these things off.</span> <span id="s1239">But instead, that’s when I was given the army, the commendation medal, that beautiful commendation medal, because in my records it had this letter from Major General Robertson which entitled me to the -- and the orders in my file.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: But no mention of the AWOL . . . A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: . . . and the threat of the court-martial.</span> <span id="s1242">A: Nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1243">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: So what, what was it like then, to be a civilian, suddenly.</span> <span id="s1245">You mentioned it was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Very difficult.</span> <span id="s1247">Very difficult.</span> <span id="s1248">I, in the army you always wait for someone to tell you what to do.</span> <span id="s1249">It doesn’t matter whether you’re a private and the corporal tells you to pick up cigarette butts or clean the latrine, or your platoon leader, your captain tells you to shape up these men – go on bivouac, maneuvers.</span> <span id="s1250">There’s always someone above you to tell you what to do and I was waiting for someone to tell me what to do.</span> <span id="s1251">I had this brother and sister living out in Colorado and I went to visit them.</span> <span id="s1252">And I spent almost the entire summer there – went to the mountains, breathing some nice fresh air and just relaxing.</span> <span id="s1253">And slowly, the time was coming to go, when I would have to go back to school – if I wanted to finish school.</span> <span id="s1254">And I was really very reluctant to go and I think that this same thing followed me, this same feeling followed me until I gave up practice until I gave up my practice and left St. Joseph to seek my career – another career in the theater.</span> <span id="s1255">I had the typical midlife crisis.</span> <span id="s1256">I did go back to school because I thought let me finish one thing that I started.</span> <span id="s1257">Let me at least do that.</span> <span id="s1258">But I was very unhappy when I went back.</span> <span id="s1259">Many men, many of the students in my class were much younger.</span> <span id="s1260">They had just come out of high school or you know, they’d gotten a B.A. in college and had gone on to podiatry school.</span> <span id="s1261">And quite a few were married and I was kind of an old man at 26.</span> <span id="s1262">And an angry old man because the world had passed me by.</span> <span id="s1263">And I’d lost four years.</span> <span id="s1264">I really hadn’t.</span> <span id="s1265">It was the most formative four years that I could have had to prepare me for what came later and that was just – that was life.</span> <span id="s1266">I went back to school and I came back to St.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Joseph to practice.</span> <span id="s1268">My first year back at school, though, was the hardest and I knew that I would need help.</span> <span id="s1269">And the Veterans Administration had a counseling service at the University of Chicago and I was able to go there, on Saturdays, every week for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s1270">And I had a very intense and intensive meeting with a very, very good psychologist, analyst, therapist, counselor that finally culminated in taking various tests.</span> <span id="s1271">And I did.</span> <span id="s1272">I took, but I tried, I tried as objective as I could with these tests and they grade you, you know, on the curve.</span> <span id="s1273">Like, say in law, maybe four people will be better than you are if you follow that field but 95 won’t be as good as you.</span> <span id="s1274">And, as I said, I tried to be as objective as I could in taking the tests but the results were that I would probably be best in personnel management, law and then medicine.</span> <span id="s1275">Medicine, of course, I’d had two years of pre-med prior to going into podiatry school.</span> <span id="s1276">So, I’m sure that that showed up in the exams.</span> <span id="s1277">And I came back and I practiced and I had a very lucrative practice for 14 years and then I had the typical midlife crisis.</span> <span id="s1278">And I see, gee, and I kept thinking about life back in the DP camps and how tenuous it is and how it just could hang by a thin thread.</span> <span id="s1279">And you’re here today and tomorrow the whole thing could be wiped out.</span> <span id="s1280">So live each day and, that’s not knew with me, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">But live it the way you want to live it.</span> <span id="s1282">And live it the way it’ll give you the most pleasure, not the most remuneration.</span> <span id="s1283">But just that’ll make you a good man and I picked the most difficult profession in the world.</span> <span id="s1284">And I left St. Joe and joined a melodrama troupe in Colorado, on the western slope.</span> <span id="s1285">They called it the Kerosene (ph) Circuit.</span> <span id="s1286">And I played Aspen, Glenwood Springs, Leadville, Durango, Steamboat Springs – did it an entire summer.</span> <span id="s1287">And I was 42 years old then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: As an actor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: As an actor in a melodrama.</span> <span id="s1290">And I was fat and bald at that time, too.</span> <span id="s1291">But at the end of the season I went to New York and David Merrick, who was a very well-known producer at the time, wasn’t waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1292">There was no red carpet, and I knew that if I wanted to do theater, I’d have to study and, at least the glossary of the theater.</span> <span id="s1293">Even the terms: stage right, stage left, although in civic theater, I did quite a bit of it.</span> <span id="s1294">Except we say now, “You go on that side of the stage,” when you’re saying it and “you go on the other side of the stage.”</span> <span id="s1295">But, nevertheless, I did well.</span> <span id="s1296">I started doing the soaps and I started doing, I did a couple of Broadway shows.</span> <span id="s1297">I did several off-Broadway shows.</span> <span id="s1298">I toured in industrials, I did commercials and I met my dear, dear lovely wife.</span> <span id="s1299">She was a gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Now, I’d like to ask you, if I could, if, you’ve mentioned that your father was an Orthodox Jew, and that he was observant, and that your parents both came to this country from a small town . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: But that you as a young man were interested in being an American, in being Americanized.</span> <span id="s1303">When you came back from your tour in Europe, and having had the experiences that you did, and seeing what had happened to the Jewish people in Europe and what could have happened to your, to you, had you been there – how did that affect your relationship with your parents and your family?</span> <span id="s1304">Did it?</span> <span id="s1305">And your sense of yourself as a Jew?</span> <span id="s1306">Did those things change gradually or at all?</span> <span id="s1307">After your experience with, in the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Well, a lot of things entered into it.</span> <span id="s1309">Yes they did.</span> <span id="s1310">To begin with, I’ll just give you a short history of my father.</span> <span id="s1311">My father came over in the great wave of immigration, 1906.</span> <span id="s1312">He was married, already, and had a child – my oldest brother, who will be 87 in November, next month.</span> <span id="s1313">And he started peddling.</span> <span id="s1314">It’s the typical American story of the Jews who came over and put a pack on their back which he did, and sold needles and notions and dry goods – whatever he could carry – until he made enough money to buy a horse so that he could carry more things over into Kansas from St. Joseph, Missouri.</span> <span id="s1315">It’s on the border between the, right on the border between Kansas and Missouri.</span> <span id="s1316">Made enough money then to buy a wagon so he could carry more goods.</span> <span id="s1317">Then made enough money to bring Mother over and my brother and his sister.</span> <span id="s1318">I’m giving you all this background because of what has happened.</span> <span id="s1319">When he had his family over, when he had Mother, he didn’t want to go peddling anymore.</span> <span id="s1320">He wanted to establish, to take root somewhere – in St. Joe.</span> <span id="s1321">So he opened up a feed store.</span> <span id="s1322">After all, there were no, there were very few cars.</span> <span id="s1323">I once read what, what really has happened in my lifetime in the way of automobiles and radio and television and airplanes and all the computers.</span> <span id="s1324">This has all happened, gee, in this century – not even the entire century, beginning, I remember listening to the radio on the little battery.</span> <span id="s1325">What’d they call – my brother made it.</span> <span id="s1326">We would listen, we had earphones and I’d listen on one and he’d listen on the other.</span> <span id="s1327">But then, we had the last, after the feed store and when there weren’t too many more horses, Dad opened up a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1328">In 1919, and to this day, my brother-in-law has that store.</span> <span id="s1329">He and my oldest sister took over the store when I came home from, when my brother-in-law came home from the army.</span> <span id="s1330">Incidentally, my brother-in-law and I were both in the same unit, until we were separated and I went into all this other work and he stayed with the 95th Infantry Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">And every once in a while, if he has two beers, he’ll let you know how he took Metts (ph) – and, and he did.</span> <span id="s1332">Wonderful, wonderful man but I just lost my sister a few months before my wife died.</span> <span id="s1333">These letters that she saved . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Your sister . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Now.</span> <span id="s1336">When I came home, there were a number of things that happened.</span> <span id="s1337">Oh, but I grew up in a very Orthodox family but I was younger.</span> <span id="s1338">Now my brother, after his Bar-Mitzvah, he did the tfillin (ph), I guess until he got, until after he got married and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1339">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1340">I went to Hebrew school and I studied.</span> <span id="s1341">I can read Hebrew today.</span> <span id="s1342">I don’t know everything – I can’t interpret it, but I can read it.</span> <span id="s1343">And I was bar-mitzvahed, but that was it.</span> <span id="s1344">I was too busy, afterwards.</span> <span id="s1345">I, I followed two sisters who were National Honor Society, and Quill and Scroll and all the honors in school and when they heard my name, they said, “Oh, you’re Lil’s brother and you’re Bess’s brother.”</span> <span id="s1346">There’s the two sisters between my oldest brother and myself.</span> <span id="s1347">“Oh!”</span> <span id="s1348">And they expected me to do everything that they did.</span> <span id="s1349">And I, during the Depression I worked – worked at the drugstore.</span> <span id="s1350">And I was just busy – busy keeping myself going.</span> <span id="s1351">It was rather selfish, I presume, but it was difficult being Jewish in a small town.</span> <span id="s1352">Not as difficult as it is now.</span> <span id="s1353">We only have about 200 souls in St. Joseph.</span> <span id="s1354">Before the war, there were around 4500.</span> <span id="s1355">We didn’t become assimilated.</span> <span id="s1356">We had our own synagogue, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">We had our own fraternity, sorority – we had our own groups that we socialized with.</span> <span id="s1358">Little by little, course we couldn’t go to the St. Joseph Country Club, which is a joke that I had on them much later on when I received Alumnus of the Year from my college and the dinner was held at the St. Joseph Country Club.</span> <span id="s1359">There were many times when I refused to go there – they couldn’t allow Jews as members, they certainly didn’t want us there when we were receiving any kind of honors.</span> <span id="s1360">It’s all changed now, however.</span> <span id="s1361">But I wasn’t as, I really wasn’t as observant as my dad.</span> <span id="s1362">I went to the synagogue on holidays with him and when my mother passed away I said Koddish (ph) when I could, as many times as I could.</span> <span id="s1363">Also, I came home, there were times that I received, there was a time when I received a letter from home saying that mother was recuperating before I received a letter saying what was wrong.</span> <span id="s1364">Mother’d had, had gone to Mayo Clinic for a mastectomy in 19, 1945.</span> <span id="s1365">And she’d lived to 1954 when it had metastasized.</span> <span id="s1366">So all this took place.</span> <span id="s1367">You asked me if I was as observant a Jew.</span> <span id="s1368">I, I thought God had forsaken my people.</span> <span id="s1369">I really did.</span> <span id="s1370">I was very angry with Him.</span> <span id="s1371">How could you let this happen?</span> <span id="s1372">So I was going to get even.</span> <span id="s1373">I just wouldn’t do anything that He wanted me to do.</span> <span id="s1374">What were the prayers?</span> <span id="s1375">So, they were hollow.</span> <span id="s1376">Why would He listen to mine when He didn’t listen to their cries.</span> <span id="s1377">I heard them.</span> <span id="s1378">I don’t think I really know to this day and that was reinforced because He took my wife away.</span> <span id="s1379">He, she, the spirit, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1380">But I do know this.</span> <span id="s1381">Though it didn’t happen to me, those who did believe, and today, those who believe with all their heart and those who believe the way my dad did, had a much easier time of it.</span> <span id="s1382">For some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: You spent the last 50 years angry?</span> <span id="s1384">About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: I never spoke about it – I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1386">I’ve probably talked more now in these few hours than I have my whole lifetime, since then.</span> <span id="s1387">Oh, there was a time in Los Angeles, when I was living there, that one of the high school teachers was rewriting history.</span> <span id="s1388">And he said that this really didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1389">He was teaching his classes that all these emaciated bodies were coming from Central Casting.</span> <span id="s1390">And, course we hear these stories over and over again.</span> <span id="s1391">And my optometrist, at the time, was a survivor – an emigre, and he was telling me about this.</span> <span id="s1392">And I told him my involvement in the DP camps and he asked me if I would work.</span> <span id="s1393">They were going to set up a round robin with survivors and liberators, such as myself, in a church, actually.</span> <span id="s1394">And it was, I think it was on Wilshire Boulevard, on Pico Boulevard.</span> <span id="s1395">There was a church that had classrooms and we were going to have a round robin about, well I have all the papers – we were going to take turns and tell our story over and over and over again.</span> <span id="s1396">And the classrooms that were bussed in would be in this class and then they would do – they would go, each one of them, in time, would hear the story of about six of us.</span> <span id="s1397">And incidentally, the Fonz was one of them – Henry Winkler.</span> <span id="s1398">I think that that was the main attraction for a lot of these kids that came in because, you know, Happy Days was running on the crest of television waves.</span> <span id="s1399">And I got involved, then, and that’s, that was the change of name.</span> <span id="s1400">I think you, I was using Joe Frederick at the time because when I went into the theater, you couldn’t have a very ethnic- sounding name if you wanted to work.</span> <span id="s1401">In fact, the first man that interviewed me for a job said that he looked at his calendar and when he saw Joe Friedman, he said, he thought to himself, he said, “Eh, another accountant?</span> <span id="s1402">Another insurance salesman?</span> <span id="s1403">I have plenty of insurance and I have my own accountant.</span> <span id="s1404">I don’t need anybody like that.”</span> <span id="s1405">And he told me this when I went in.</span> <span id="s1406">He was the director of Love of Life and Secret Storm – these were soaps that were going on at that time, in New York.</span> <span id="s1407">And I wanted to work.</span> <span id="s1408">He says, “You’ll never work under the name of Joe Friedman.”</span> <span id="s1409">Well, I wanted to keep the same initials.</span> <span id="s1410">And also, a strange thing happened before I left St. Joe.</span> <span id="s1411">One of my patients called me Frederick, by accident.</span> <span id="s1412">She called me Dr. Frederick and I thought, gee, what a nice sounding name and it’s the same initial.</span> <span id="s1413">But I didn’t have to worry about that because there was a dancer in the Equity, one of the actors’ union, who was Joe Friedman, and it didn’t matter to him – he was a dancer.</span> <span id="s1414">And so I couldn’t use my name, anyway.</span> <span id="s1415">‘Cause you can’t use the same name in the union.</span> <span id="s1416">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1417">So it became Joe Frederick.</span> <span id="s1418">And that’s how it was when I did this round robin.</span> <span id="s1419">And as a result of that, we were honored at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles when they were, as liberators – there were several and there all pictures here, and I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale.</span> <span id="s1420">And I’m very proud of that.</span> <span id="s1421">The only other time, in Los Angeles that I spoke of it and, again, I keep referring to the pictures that I have and I left it with the museum – the Ludz (ph) survivors have a very strong club in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1422">A very affluent club and they do wonderful work with the survivors.</span> <span id="s1423">And they called the Federation in Los Angeles and asked for entertainers for a fundraiser that they were going to have and I was sent to go to this Beverly Hills mansion and entertain.</span> <span id="s1424">I have a little act that I do – I was in Fiddler on the Roof for three years – I did close to 3,000 performances.</span> <span id="s1425">I was in Las Vegas for four months with it.</span> <span id="s1426">So I sing, and I, and I do Al Jolson.</span> <span id="s1427">I used to go down on my knee, but then when I couldn’t get up one time, I stopped that.</span> <span id="s1428">At any rate, this Shobby Shoptie (ph) who’s a terrorist from, he’s one of the leading exponents of, an Israeli on terrorism.</span> <span id="s1429">He was the main speaker and I was the entertainment.</span> <span id="s1430">And I felt because of the occasion, and because they were all Ludz (ph) people from the, from the ghetto, that I would tell them a little bit about my experience.</span> <span id="s1431">And I started talking and a lady came up and she threw her arms around me and she said, “You saved my life.</span> <span id="s1432">I know who you are.</span> <span id="s1433">I was in your camp.”</span> <span id="s1434">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1435">We both had a good cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">She was in my camp.</span> <span id="s1437">She was on a truck from Koburg (ph) going down to, it was the Funk Casairn (ph) – she told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Shall we take a break?</span> <span id="s1439">We’ll pick it up.</span> <span id="s1440">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade, who came into my camp, around the end of June.</span> <span id="s1443">They had a list of members of the Palestinian Brigade who fought in North Africa and ostensibly they wanted to see if there were still relatives of members of the Brigade that were alive and living in the Displaced Person Camps and they had legitimate orders from Third Army Headquarters at Bogtoles (ph) to come into the camps and when they came into mine, I was very happy to see them.</span> <span id="s1444">And, underneath it all, they were looking for the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out informing the links between various camps for Jewish DPs, who were coming out of the Russian Occupied Zone of Germany into the American Occupied Zone for a number of reasons that we’ve already talked about.</span> <span id="s1445">So that they could go down to Italy and get on ships for Israel.</span> <span id="s1446">This is an aerial view of Koburg (ph).</span> <span id="s1447">Now Koburg (ph) was a tremendous German army camp.</span> <span id="s1448">As you can see, all the barracks were built out of brick to last forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Unlike our camps, we built out camps out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right after the war.</span> <span id="s1450">But Germany had theirs to go on forever.</span> <span id="s1451">Fortunately, we had these because we knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these camps after the war ended.</span> <span id="s1452">So they did serve a great purpose for us.</span> <span id="s1453">This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that were immeasurable help in Koburg (ph) for me and they’re sort of a polygog of nationalities.</span> <span id="s1454">The head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty.</span> <span id="s1455">He was related to the royals of Belgium.</span> <span id="s1456">And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian.</span> <span id="s1457">And she was married to an official of Macy’s in New York and felt that during the time that they escaped from Russia, people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team – spoke excellent Russian.</span> <span id="s1458">In fact, she spoke about five different languages.</span> <span id="s1459">The other members – there were two doctors, two nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire camp, a nutritionist for the hospital, a nurse and chauffeurs.</span> <span id="s1460">And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them.</span> <span id="s1461">This is a typical truck that, carrying the displaced persons from Koburg (ph) to Lichtenfelds (ph) which is a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned what their fate held in store after they got to Russia or to Poland.</span> <span id="s1462">But nevertheless, they decorated the trucks with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their leaders.</span> <span id="s1463">I don’t know where those pictures came from – they just appeared out of nowhere and were on the trucks.</span> <span id="s1464">And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent families back together, quite unlike other trucks that carried out people to crematoria.</span> <span id="s1465">This is a photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a checkpoint.</span> <span id="s1466">They were there to see that things were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian directives.</span> <span id="s1467">At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our American officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed between the two.</span> <span id="s1468">We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us.</span> <span id="s1469">And between the two forces we got quite a bit done.</span> <span id="s1470">Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in my Mercedes.</span> <span id="s1471">That was a 1936 Mercedes convertible, I think they called it a cabrolay (ph).</span> <span id="s1472">And I got it quite legitimately – we paid for it – the Germans couldn’t use a lot of their vehicles because they couldn’t get gasoline for it.</span> <span id="s1473">In order for me to be able to draw gasoline and to have it serviced at the motor pool, I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the army emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the hood of the car.</span> <span id="s1474">So there you have it, I’m, if the authorities find out at this late date, I’ll probably have to go to jail.</span> <span id="s1475">This obviously is a wedding that was held in Bamburg (ph).</span> <span id="s1476">I was in Koburg (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to Bamburg (ph), because they were people that I had worked with when I was in the camp at Bamburg (ph).</span> <span id="s1477">The groom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name is Hettie.</span> <span id="s1478">I don’t know her last name but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright.</span> <span id="s1479">Her matron of honor was also from the, from one of the Baltic countries.</span> <span id="s1480">And then, I’m, you can see part of my head behind her.</span> <span id="s1481">We were all in the wedding party and it was nice.</span> <span id="s1482">It was nice to know that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life could take place under these most extreme circumstances.</span> <span id="s1483">As a footnote to this, many, many years later, I visited Hettie and Bob in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1484">They had both gone back to college and were very, very happy.</span> <span id="s1485">A happily married couple.</span> <span id="s1486">This was an entertainment hall that we had in camp.</span> <span id="s1487">They had their own musicians.</span> <span id="s1488">They did requisition musical instruments and I have a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions – they all played accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph).</span> <span id="s1489">I really thought that before it was all over with, I’d be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka.</span> <span id="s1490">One of the other, or both.</span> <span id="s1491">But, I enjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that we were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other necessities of life such as eating, clothing and a roof over their heads.</span> <span id="s1492">This was a bonus for them.</span> <span id="s1493">Here I am again.</span> <span id="s1494">Periodically, of course, I inspected the camp and would see to it that they had enough in the warehouses.</span> <span id="s1495">We were always, always after enough wood so that we could heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the camps.</span> <span id="s1496">We would cut down entire forests in order to get enough wood and here’s an example of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">As we spoke of this before, the camp was run the same way an entire city would be run.</span> <span id="s1498">And this is the hospital of the camp.</span> <span id="s1499">Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the doctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical, members in the medical corps of the American army.</span> <span id="s1500">And they received wonderful treatment.</span> <span id="s1501">Whatever they requisitioned for the hospitals we were able to get.</span> <span id="s1502">We would either get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical supplies but whatever had to be done was done.</span> <span id="s1503">Well this is a Polish doctor.</span> <span id="s1504">He was a very fine man.</span> <span id="s1505">I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the hospital and of course many of the times when he came into my office to request medical supplies.</span> <span id="s1506">But he was dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he couldn’t do under the German thumb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Do you recall his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: No I don’t.</span> <span id="s1509">No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1510">I probably have it somewhere, on a requisition.</span> <span id="s1511">I’d have to go through the papers.</span> <span id="s1512">I’m certain that there’s a name on the requisitions.</span> <span id="s1513">I have, I have a whole list of all the Polish personnel and also I have the emblem that they wore on their jackets that I’m gong to give to the museum.</span> <span id="s1514">This is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1515">This gentleman had been a collaborationist.</span> <span id="s1516">Not in the sense that he collaborated with the Germans, although he might have, but we do know that whatever organization took over the various DP camps, if he had been a member of the camp, he was able to ingratiate himself into the hierarchy of the camp to the extent where he was able to get supplies and whatever the camps needed.</span> <span id="s1517">But he would also service himself by doing this.</span> <span id="s1518">He probably worked the black market in cigarettes, in candy, in clothing, in liquor and the DPs knew about him.</span> <span id="s1519">When I became commander of the camp in Koburg (ph), he started this same thing with me.</span> <span id="s1520">And I was quite ignorant of what had gone before, and very innocent and he brought a beautiful dagger that he gave to me that he had sort of confiscated, I guess, himself and had belonged at one time to the Forestmeister of the Black Forest, near TreeAir (ph), Germany.</span> <span id="s1521">I still have that dagger but this gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this souvenir, he was murdered by other members of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
