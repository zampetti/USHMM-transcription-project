about your childhood.</span> <span id="s52">So first tell me what your father did for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: It’s very hard for me to actually translate it.</span> <span id="s54">He had a transportation business, and in those days I guess people were importing many goods, and the goods were going to different destinations.</span> <span id="s55">So he was transporting the good from different countries, sometimes even from China, and from western countries, to different destinations.</span> <span id="s56">And he was in charge of warehousing them, so he had a warehouse, and he was char -- in charge of transport, and he had the -- actually, he didn’t own them, but he -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: [indecipherable] no, he -- he rented horses and carriages and so on.</span> <span id="s59">We didn’t have trucks, yet, in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You didn’t have trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I mean, well there must have been trucks, but my father didn’t use trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So he owned this business?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: He owned his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes, it was his business, and it was located initially in -- on the Place Halicki, I s -- think the number five, yes.</span> <span id="s66">And it was a wonderful location because every time there were parades, you could go on balcony and right in front of you, you could see all the -- the best -- you had the best view of parades coming through, military parades, you know, on holidays, such May third.</span> <span id="s67">In Poland it’s a very great holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And what is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: It’s on --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: -- what is that holiday, May third, in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I think May third is independence.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s74">A -- a -- Constitution day.</span> <span id="s75">I don’t even know if I recall correctly.</span> <span id="s76">I hope I -- I recall correctly, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How do you remember your father when you were a kid?</span> <span id="s78">What kind of a person was he, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Well, my father, I -- I remember him first always as a very impeccably dressed.</span> <span id="s80">He -- his shirts were s -- spic-and-span, his ties was tied properly.</span> <span id="s81">He had wonderful suits, always well pressed.</span> <span id="s82">And he -- oo -- in the fashion of the day, he wore a ca -- cane.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: That’s what the gentlemen wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: A hat, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: And a hat, too, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: I mean, of course a hat.</span> <span id="s89">But I don’t know, I re -- re -- when I look at him I see him without a hat, but definitely a hat.</span> <span id="s90">If you went out, he had to have a hat, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Did you eat lunch and dinner together?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s93">It was splendid.</span> <span id="s94">It was a wonderful thing to remember.</span> <span id="s95">My father would come for lunch, at about 1:30, and so would I from school.</span> <span id="s96">And the table was set in the dining room, and usually very nicely set.</span> <span id="s97">It was linen, and linen napkins, and a -- and s -- and sterling silver, because my mother loved to use it every day, and beautiful Czechoslovakian china.</span> <span id="s98">And -- and we had a maid, so my moth -- the maid would bring [indecipherable] and my mother would -- there was a tureen, usually.</span> <span id="s99">The big meal was at noon -- not at noon, at 1:30 actually.</span> <span id="s100">So we had several -- several dishes.</span> <span id="s101">And so the first usually was appetizers, and I didn’t eat those.</span> <span id="s102">And then we had soup, and the maid would bring in the tureen, and my mother would pour -- it was very s -- pouring the soup, it was very civilized, yeah.</span> <span id="s103">And -- but one thing happened during the meal, my father used to read.</span> <span id="s104">So we didn’t talk, we just read.</span> <span id="s105">So he could read his paper, and I could read my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So everybody around the table would read?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Just most of a -- more or less, right.</span> <span id="s108">Because when I was little my mother used to read to me to encourage me to eat, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Encourage you to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Eat, right.</span> <span id="s111">And -- I didn’t want to eat, so my mother would read to me, and then I would eat, you see?</span> <span id="s112">I’m sorry, I was a spoiled brat, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: You were spoiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s115">I was an only child and not only an only child in my family, but in all extended family, there were no other small children, so I was very doted upon, if I may say so, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: By everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Now, I would gather that your mother did not work?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, no, of course not.</span> <span id="s120">In those days ladies did not work.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well, my mother is very sweet, if I can say.</span> <span id="s125">She was a very kind person.</span> <span id="s126">She -- she always told me to think of other people before I think of myself.</span> <span id="s127">Well -- and she was very kind, and she wouldn’t kill a fly.</span> <span id="s128">Really, literally, she wouldn’t kill a fly.</span> <span id="s129">She would open a window and let the fly go free.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: You were very close to her, weren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, I was her confidant, and her only child, and I was the apple of her eye.</span> <span id="s132">And I never e -- imagined I could live without her [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s133">Yeah.</span> <span id="s134">Such is fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Did you -- did you spend a lot of time with your mother and your father, or more time with your mother as you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: More -- more time with my mother, because my father had -- had to go to work.</span> <span id="s137">Actually, after lunch he would take a siesta.</span> <span id="s138">Everybody took a siesta, little nap.</span> <span id="s139">And that was very nice memory also.</span> <span id="s140">He would lie down on the couch with his paper, which was called “Moment” in English and “Chwila” in Polish.</span> <span id="s141">And it was very good Polish paper.</span> <span id="s142">Polish Jewish paper, was very good paper.</span> <span id="s143">And I cou -- had to lie down too, my mother want me -- wanted me to take a nap, but I wouldn’t, so I would read, and my mother would prepare -- either she would prepare or we would go shopping to buy sweets.</span> <span id="s144">And I could lie down with my book and my sweets, my chocolate, or my -- or the dates, or whatever.</span> <span id="s145">Whatever there was on the menu, and that was very nice, very pleasant kind of memory, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Did you spend some time with your father alone?</span> <span id="s147">Did he -- did he talk with --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Initially, as a child, I did.</span> <span id="s149">My father was not necessar -- he was -- he was kind of critical, you know.</span> <span id="s150">He -- I -- a -- a -- I -- when I finally learned how to read I read so much and he felt that I didn’t read the right stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, y -- I -- I read right stuff, and I read the wrong stuff, I guess.</span> <span id="s153">You know, like all the young people do, right?</span> <span id="s154">Well anyway, I read a lot, too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What’s the wrong stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: The wrong stuff would be some kind of romances, or whatever, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s158">You weren’t -- it wasn’t serious enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yeah, but I -- you know, I a -- I wrote -- I read serious too.</span> <span id="s160">I read Pascal at age 13, showed I was serious.</span> <span id="s161">And zit -- oh, as a child, I inherited a library.</span> <span id="s162">I really -- there was a library for me from my uncle, my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s163">And he kept the books for me, so when I was born I inherited hundred children’s books.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">So I had those children’s books and the books were onert because they were being housed in a china cabinet.</span> <span id="s167">There was a china cabinet and that was meant for my books.</span> <span id="s168">So I had books, yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: That’s very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: It was -- it was very special, right.</span> <span id="s171">So anyway -- so -- so I read a lot, I guess.</span> <span id="s172">And I was an only child, I had nobody to play with, so what else was there to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: When you went to school, didn’t you have playmates at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Well, even before I went to school, my mother decided that I couldn’t be brought up without children’s influence, so she hired, actually, a little girl -- a little Jewish girl who would come to me to do -- who would come to visit us, and I would play with her and we would -- sometimes she would bring her sister.</span> <span id="s175">And we would play cards, oh we played cards forever and ever.</span> <span id="s176">And my mi -- my -- but I knew that she paid for it so I kind of felt I -- you know, I had mi-mixed feelings about this.</span> <span id="s177">But later on she -- we became friends and we stayed friends until I went to high school.</span> <span id="s178">Well no, until I went to school, because that was be-before I --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Before you went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: What did that feel like, that -- I mean that your mother would pay somebody to do that --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, it felt bizarre, I would say.</span> <span id="s183">It still feels bizarre.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: But on the other hand, when I look at it, I see my mother was a very modern thinking woman.</span> <span id="s186">She decided a child needs to have a playmate, and it wasn’t healthy for me to be surrounded forever with a bunch of adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: And that’s why she -- she wanted me to have companionship.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: So there were no children even in the neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: There were children in the neighborhood, but I was not allowed to play in the street.</span> <span id="s191">I could not play in the street, and I could not play in the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Only in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Only in the house, because there could have been some negative influences, whatever they were, because there were all kinds of street children, you know.</span> <span id="s194">I never played out -- outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: So you didn’t play sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, my mother was so happy.</span> <span id="s197">I wasn’t -- I wasn’t very good in s -- well, not that I wasn’t for -- my own mother discourage it, actually.</span> <span id="s198">She was -- she was -- and we had no river, and -- because our river was buried underground.</span> <span id="s199">The river was called Peltew.</span> <span id="s200">And it was buried underground, my mother wasn’t very happy about that.</span> <span id="s201">So I didn’t swim, right.</span> <span id="s202">And the next thing is that I never went how to ride a bicycle, so I didn’t know how to ride it.</span> <span id="s203">I think my mother was very concerned about my safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did you -- when you went to school, did -- was there, wa -- as they do in the United States have gym classes, or a play time so you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Oh yeah, yes, oh definitely, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s210">We had recreation times.</span> <span id="s211">That was all girl’s school, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Because those times the schools were segregated.</span> <span id="s214">As a matter of fact there were -- was on one side was a girl’s school, on the other side was a boy’s school, but we never met during recreation.</span> <span id="s215">The recreation time was at different times.</span> <span id="s216">And yeah, we had gym classes, and we had the religion classes.</span> <span id="s217">Catholic girls went to -- went to be taught by a priest, and we had the religious teacher, we had the man who taught us religion, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s218">I was very bad student, I have to confess, yeah.</span> <span id="s219">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Was this a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: That was a public school --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: -- absolutely, yeah.</span> <span id="s224">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So did you feel comfortable going to a school wi -- being with all these kids, when you had been with so few children?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh yeah, I didn’t feel uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s227">Once I learned how to read I became the best student, and I was very well liked.</span> <span id="s228">But don’t -- you mustn’t forget, it was a Catholic school -- i-it wasn’t Catholic, actually, it was a public school, but since the country was Catholic, then there were, of course, images of -- religious images on the wall.</span> <span id="s229">And -- and there was -- you felt you were not pop -- you were a minority right from the beginning.</span> <span id="s230">There was -- yeah.</span> <span id="s231">I remember, I had one -- well, there was the -- the issue came up -- I don’t know if you are interested in that at all, but the issue came up of killing Christ, and the Jews killed Christ.</span> <span id="s232">And I was in second grade, and I had the temerity to get up and say, “But I thought the Romans killed Christ.”</span> <span id="s233">And the teacher said absolutely not.</span> <span id="s234">And I went back to my father, and I told him she said that, and he scolded me too.</span> <span id="s235">She scolded me, he scolded me.</span> <span id="s236">You know, because I shouldn’t have spoken up, right?</span> <span id="s237">But on the same -- by the same token, I was very well treated by the teachers.</span> <span id="s238">I remember I had a favorite teacher and she -- I think I must have been one of her favorite students, too.</span> <span id="s239">When -- and a time came when we had to join the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s240">And since it was again, a religious group, we Jewish gir -- children could not participate in that.</span> <span id="s241">So she -- she kind of felt bad about me, and once she said, “Wouldn’t you -- wouldn’t you rather be Catholic?”</span> <span id="s242">That was a heavy question, you know, and I didn’t want to offend her because I really liked and respected her.</span> <span id="s243">And it took me a long time to answer, and I remember that, I remember and I -- the row I stood in, and I looked at the -- I looked like this at the window in those ton -- to the left of me, and I stood there for quite awhile, and I said -- I said, “I want to be what God made me.”</span> <span id="s244">And she accepted that, and she didn’t question me after that at all, ever.</span> <span id="s245">And it was -- yeah.</span> <span id="s246">I -- i -- i -- yeah, I ha -- I -- I told her the truth, I guess.</span> <span id="s247">I t --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s249">Now let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s250">In the second grade you knew enough about the Christian religion to know that the Romans had killed Jesus?</span> <span id="s251">Or di --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Well, I didn’t know -- Christian religions does not accept the fact that the Roman -- that they just -- at that time, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s253">Those times was different world --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: -- and in Poland, in ec -- so in those times that was -- that was the belief.</span> <span id="s256">And I knew about it because I -- I was concerned about it before.</span> <span id="s257">I developed a friendship with a Catholic girl.</span> <span id="s258">That girl was Jadzia.</span> <span id="s259">And we discussed in very often the catechism, because she studied the catechis.</span> <span id="s260">And she told me that first, so I went to my father, and I asked him.</span> <span id="s261">And -- and my father said this -- you know, I -- as far I know, i -- Romans crucified Christ.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s263">I see.</span> <span id="s264">So did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: -- did you go back and tell your little friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I -- I might have, but I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I -- w-we were very open with one another.</span> <span id="s270">For one thing she could never read the books that were indexed, because many books like Dumas, Alexander Dumas, those were indexed books.</span> <span id="s271">And I read them freely, I mean later on, in -- in -- in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: -- grammar school I read them.</span> <span id="s274">So, you know, there were “Three Musketeers,” and there was everything that came after, and “La Reine Margot,” and all -- and the story of -- of Saint -- of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, and all that.</span> <span id="s275">I -- you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: It’s i -- in -- in -- those were fiction books, but there was a lot of history in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: So we discussed them.</span> <span id="s280">And there were other books by Sabatini that dealt with popes.</span> <span id="s281">There was Alexander Borga and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s282">So we -- we discussed that.</span> <span id="s283">We were good friends, but we were still good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: We never fought over religion or anything.</span> <span id="s286">We just accepted one another as we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So did you feel anti-Semitism, or just feel as a minority?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Well, i-it was -- the air was imbued with anti-Semitism, because we were a minority, and the other minority was the Ukrainians, and they were not liked either, but the times have been changing.</span> <span id="s289">In 19 -- there was the Treaty of Versailles, and according to the Treaty of Versailles, all the minorities have to be -- you had to have rights.</span> <span id="s290">I don’t know if equal rights, but rights, pr-privileges.</span> <span id="s291">And that was not always maintained.</span> <span id="s292">And it actually was completely curtailed in 1934, or 1935.</span> <span id="s293">Anyway, it changed completely with the death of Marshal Pilsudski, who -- who was kind of protecting the -- the -- I mean, he was kind of protecting Jewish interests in -- not Jewish interests, but the Jews in general, I think.</span> <span id="s294">It -- it -- actually, he wanted to live more up to this treaty, and -- that was instituted by Wilson, if I recall my history correctly.</span> <span id="s295">So -- so the minori -- the minor -- ra -- the -- a-a-as the time went on, the fascistic propaganda became overwhelming, and there were instituted -- there were pogroms, and there were -- what should I say?</span> <span id="s296">Sabo -- not sabotages, but boycotts of Jewish -- of Jewish businesses and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: You’re talking now about before 1939, before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Oh, that’s before ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: [indecipherable] context.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: -- at beginning 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: ’34 - ’35, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Now did th -- did the depression affect your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Goodness, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: It did?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh terribly.</span> <span id="s307">My father was in horrendous financial pro -- I mean, he had a horrendous financial problems.</span> <span id="s308">Number one, if he had some money in dollars, he lost half of it, because the dollar, until the fall of Wall Street, the dollar was 10 zlotys.</span> <span id="s309">And when the crash happened, he land -- lost the hat.</span> <span id="s310">The value of dollar wer -- went down to five.</span> <span id="s311">So if he had any holdings in dollars, that was the end.</span> <span id="s312">And he -- he had the ongoing financial problems, which actually contributed to the fact that by the time the Nazi’s came, we were completely depleted financially already.</span> <span id="s313">So depleted -- even the Russians when they came, yeah.</span> <span id="s314">And during the Russians, because when the Russians came, it was -- only my father worked at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s316">So how did that affect you in the household, as you were four years old at the time of the depression, but then though the next years --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, it is -- is slowly -- well, it did -- it didn’t happen right away, I think, you know, depression didn’t happen right away, took a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: So by the time 19 -- I-I think it did -- by us it was also gradual.</span> <span id="s320">So -- but we still maintain a certain level of living, i-in spite of it.</span> <span id="s321">So my father w-was getting further in debt.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: We still went on vacation every year to -- to a spa, you know?</span> <span id="s324">That was the fashion, that’s what you did, no matter what, right?</span> <span id="s325">And so we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: And it’s expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: And it was expensive, and it was -- yeah, but we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: You were -- w-where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: So we -- we had sever -- I -- I remember, in the beginning we went very close by, and this is because they had this special kind of bath there, and the -- the mud bath, for my father.</span> <span id="s330">He had arthritis, so he felt the -- it was called Lubien Wielki, and it was a very interesting spa.</span> <span id="s331">I was four years old when I remember that.</span> <span id="s332">And -- and they had a little park, a la parks in Vienna, and -- only miniscule, miniscule, very small, mini-park.</span> <span id="s333">And then they would import operetta singers, and -- and they -- they -- and they would -- they had special pavilions, and they would sing all their famous operettas by Strauss, or by Laihag, or by co -- Kohlman.</span> <span id="s334">Oh I -- I don’t recall exactly the name, yeah.</span> <span id="s335">No, not Kohlman.</span> <span id="s336">There’s another name starting with a K. I don’t -- I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s337">Anyway, so there -- I had very fond memories in that place, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: That was nice for kids, were there other kids there?</span> <span id="s339">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: There probably were, but I was always with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: They ke -- I remember one time I went to the park in the morning with the maid, and -- and my mother didn’t know what I -- where I was, so when I came back, I got my beating, my one and only beating.</span> <span id="s343">My mother slapped me.</span> <span id="s344">Yeah, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s345">For being independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And how -- you were four years old there?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Four years old.</span> <span id="s348">I remember that.</span> <span id="s349">That’s -- that was the only time.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Never -- never after.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And did the maid stay with you, independent of this loss of money, or did -- at one point did she go?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Well, I -- th -- there was -- th-the maid stayed until s -- maybe ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s358">Yeah, in spite of the loss of money, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Were you a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: We were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s363">But there we -- I knew, apparently, who I was.</span> <span id="s364">But up to six years I had a Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s366">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And then what happened at six years?</span> <span id="s368">A: They decide I was too old for a Christmas tree, apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: You were too old?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: So that was -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: So that was the end of it, no more Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: -- so then there was nothing, there was no religious celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh no, no, there was, too.</span> <span id="s375">Now -- I can’t say.</span> <span id="s376">We cele -- celebrated Passover.</span> <span id="s377">I -- when I said we were non-religious, I meant we were non-Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: All right.</span> <span id="s380">So not -- not religious.</span> <span id="s381">We respected all the holidays.</span> <span id="s382">In other words we had the -- I never -- I tried to eat only matzoh on Passover -- during Passover, right?</span> <span id="s383">My mother religiously lit candles every Friday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: That was a present she got from her mother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: With the promise that she would light the candles, and she did.</span> <span id="s388">Every Friday until the last Friday before the round up of August 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Oh, all the way through --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: -- until the August 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s395">Cause my mother always kept her promises.</span> <span id="s396">She was -- I told you, she was very kind person, and she was very honorable.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Did you go to synagogue also?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: You know, women didn’t go to synagogue much.</span> <span id="s401">My mother took me to the synagogue because I remember my father couldn’t fast all day on Yom Kippur, so she -- my mother would take me to the synagogue to make the offering of candles, because she couldn’t fast.</span> <span id="s402">And -- yeah, it -- i-it’s ironic, because we fasted plenty afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Years.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Right.</span> <span id="s405">And then I remember going one to the famous synagogue of that was cours -- called the Rose synagogue, but just one time.</span> <span id="s406">And -- and then, of course, the -- it was completely destroyed by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: When you say you knew who you were, you knew that you had been born Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah, I knew who I was because remember -- ah, of course you don’t remember, sorry.</span> <span id="s409">When I was -- when we had to -- when I went to school, on the first day, they made us line up, the Jewish girls in one -- in one -- what would you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: A row?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: One row, and in one -- and the Catholics girls in the -- in the other.</span> <span id="s412">So I knew th -- apparently I wasn’t hundred percent sure then, it was at the age of seven, I wa -- I wasn’t hundred percent sure then, but I -- I joined the right row.</span> <span id="s413">So my -- I -- I had my identity, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did you feel religious?</span> <span id="s415">Did you feel like --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I didn’t feel religious, but I had the -- I had the need for God.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Even at a young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Very young age.</span> <span id="s419">Very young age, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: And do you know what that need was about?</span> <span id="s421">Did you pray, did you talk to God?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes, I guess I did, and -- because I remember I was even -- I was very scared to go to the bedroom.</span> <span id="s423">I shared the bedroom with my parents at that time.</span> <span id="s424">And of course it was so dark.</span> <span id="s425">When they put me to sleep it was dark and there was no light.</span> <span id="s426">So I was practicing, and I said -- and I couldn’t go in the room all by myself, it was so dark.</span> <span id="s427">So I said, I -- I do it for God.</span> <span id="s428">And that’s how I went to the dark room.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And so you felt safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Not that I felt safer, no, no, not that -- I didn’t fa -- I go in there for to -- a couple seconds.</span> <span id="s431">And -- but I did it -- to make myself do it, I had to make a sacrifice to God.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s433">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I-I hope I am not telling too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: No, it’s very interesting to hear how you put this all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, as a child, the -- I’m not responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s438">Did you enjoy the holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I -- I did, more or less.</span> <span id="s440">Yes, with a little -- they not special, e -- I don’t know, we didn’t have company or anything, so I -- I don’t recall, as a company s -- thing.</span> <span id="s441">I -- I -- I have no recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Now, I know you were very interested in books, and you were a very good student.</span> <span id="s445">Were there other --</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I was only very good student in hi -- in grammar school, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: After that sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Once I got into high school I had -- I had my demons.</span> <span id="s449">And one of them was my math teacher.</span> <span id="s450">It so happened she was my mother’s math teacher previously, so -- and my mother said, “Oh, I just hoping you don’t get her.”</span> <span id="s451">And I did.</span> <span id="s452">So I was scared of her out -- out of my wits.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And math was difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: And one -- math became difficult, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Right.</span> <span id="s459">But I liked the other subjects.</span> <span id="s460">I was good in other subjects, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Oh, like Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: In French I was pretty bad in the beginning, but then my aunt, who spoke French, tutored me, so I became good in French, and in English -- in -- not in English, but in Polish I was pretty good.</span> <span id="s465">What else did we have?</span> <span id="s466">In history I was really good.</span> <span id="s467">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s470">I tutored the other students.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s473">We had a very bad teacher for that, too, but she was not bad for me because I knew my history inside out.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s475">Before -- we have to stop the tape, but before we stop the tape, what’s your first name of your father and the first name of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: My mother’s name was Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Maria?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And my father’s name was Moritz.</span> <span id="s481">In Polish would be Maurycy, and in Yiddish it was Moshe.</span> <span id="s482">And I mentioned that my mother’s name in Yiddish must have been Miriam.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Okay, we’re going to have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Okay, all right.</span> <span id="s487">I -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s490">I wanted to ask you a couple of more questions before we get to the war, and the uncomfortable parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Let’s talk a little bit more about these vacations that you took.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well, one time my father won a stay in a fancy spa in a place called Iwonicze, and -- for a whole month.</span> <span id="s494">So we all went there, my mother and I, and probably cost my father much more than he anticipated, e-even with his winnings.</span> <span id="s495">And over there, I -- we made an acquaintance of a very nice family.</span> <span id="s496">Most of the people in this particular spa were Jewish, but this family was not.</span> <span id="s497">And it consisted of, I think, mother, and -- and a son.</span> <span id="s498">And the so -- i-if I was 11, he was probably 13.</span> <span id="s499">He -- and we usually walked together, and my -- the parents walked in the back, and we walked in the front, and we talked, and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s500">And one day -- and it was Sunday, I went out o-on the porch, and th-that young boy was there, and I had my new dress on.</span> <span id="s501">So he asked me, “Are you ready for church?”</span> <span id="s502">And I said, “No, I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s503">And that was the end of our acquaintance.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Right.</span> <span id="s506">That was the end of our acquaintance.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Is that shocking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s509">It was not shocking me because it was to be anticipated.</span> <span id="s510">Shortly before that, maybe day before, I -- I felt it coming, because he referred to our -- our place with a play on words, and I don’t know if I can translate it.</span> <span id="s511">This was like a pension, pensionne in French, pensionne, or a hotel.</span> <span id="s512">In Polish it’s called pensjonat.</span> <span id="s513">So he made a -- a pretty good, witty play on words by saying it was peysonat.</span> <span id="s514">A payess means the curls that the Orthodox Jews wear.</span> <span id="s515">And when -- I didn’t say anything when he said that, I didn’t -- I didn’t comment on it at all, but maybe two days after this inc -- incident happened, and that was -- and that’s why I kind of anticipated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s517">And what was the play on words?</span> <span id="s518">In -- in Polish -- payasot?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: You see -- you see, what he meant by -- pensjonat is the word that describes the place where we were staying.</span> <span id="s520">And peysonat is a word that has no sense except of the sense of the -- of the payess.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Th-the place where the Jews stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Jews, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: But it was derogatory of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: -- in -- in its meaning.</span> <span id="s527">But this was the -- this was the climate of the times.</span> <span id="s528">And that was 1935, probably.</span> <span id="s529">Yeah, I had to be maybe -- I was -- I was -- no, maybe 1936.</span> <span id="s530">I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: So its a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: A little later, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Now, one place where you went, you learned to love plants a lot.</span> <span id="s534">What was -- was that this first place that you described?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah, that was the first place where I describe that, because the -- the owner of the hut that my mother rented -- I say hut because it was a peasant’s hut, and -- which was very comfortable, by the way.</span> <span id="s536">We had a wonderful garden, and -- and th-the alley leading to the garden was planted with dahlias, but the huge dahlias, the tall dahlias, so they were, of course, all taller than I am, and they were full of flowers, and the flowers were every color of -- you can imagine.</span> <span id="s537">Black, and mixed colors, and red and white.</span> <span id="s538">One flower could have been red and white, the other could have been pink and yellow and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s539">Maybe not pink and yellow, but pink and white, a-and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s540">They were just magnificent.</span> <span id="s541">So I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And the name of this spa?</span> <span id="s543">Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: In the -- it was called Lubien Wielki, and it had a separate park where the baths were, and where you get your -- where you went to take your waters.</span> <span id="s545">And also where you attended the concerts in the evenings.</span> <span id="s546">Was very, very civilized, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Now usually when you went on vacation, it wasn’t for a month, the way you were at the spas --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: -- it was for two months, usually.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s553">Initially you went for vacation and -- for two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Right.</span> <span id="s556">You -- you rented a place, and then you stayed there, and you could a - eat in different -- not restaurants, but establishments.</span> <span id="s557">Yeah, usually it was two months.</span> <span id="s558">We even went in 1938, but we went just for one month, because that was -- the writing was on the wall already, and -- right.</span> <span id="s559">I-It -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: And did your father stay with you for the two weeks, or he went back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No, no, my father never stayed with us.</span> <span id="s562">He always came maybe for a week or two, that was the most.</span> <span id="s563">We stayed all -- all summer, right.</span> <span id="s564">That was a big production, right.</span> <span id="s565">Every year we went by train, a -- a -- a carriage would come to the house, ho -- horse and carriage, take all our valises.</span> <span id="s566">And sometimes beddings, too, I -- I -- depended, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s567">I -- in the beginning, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s568">Later on, it was less and less, yes.</span> <span id="s569">That was the lifestyle, even for the poor pe -- we weren’t poor, but -- because we lived above our means, but that’s -- that was the lifestyle.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Was that true for the rest of your family?</span> <span id="s571">Extended family?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: That was certainly true for my immediate fami -- yeah, it was certainly true for my grandmother’s family, yes.</span> <span id="s573">My grandmother’s family in Lwów.</span> <span id="s574">Certainly not for my grandmother in Przemysl, because my grandmother in Przemysl lived in dire penury, because she lost her husband very young, and I think her daughter, who got married, also lost her husband very young.</span> <span id="s575">So they -- she was left with the progeny of I don’t know how many daughters, and the granddaughters.</span> <span id="s576">And -- and the -- they -- they eked out a very precarious living.</span> <span id="s577">I think they had a bakery and it was very hard to maintain.</span> <span id="s578">And my father send them money, and so did the family out of America, because she -- my grandmother in Przemysl had three children in America.</span> <span id="s579">She had three -- two daughters, and one son in New York, and two daughters -- no, three daughters in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: And my father pay -- send my grandmother 25 zlotys every month, as long as he -- he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So this was your father’s mother in Przemysl?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: That was my father’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: She came only twice to visit us.</span> <span id="s586">I remember I think twice, or maybe just once.</span> <span id="s587">One time I remember she came with her grandchildren, who were slightly older than I am, and they were very beautiful.</span> <span id="s588">I used to look at them, and I admired them.</span> <span id="s589">And they had such beautiful complexions, and -- and they -- they looked completely different from me.</span> <span id="s590">They had dark hair, dark straight hair, cut more or less like I have it now.</span> <span id="s591">And they had those pretty faces, regular features.</span> <span id="s592">They were beautiful, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Why do you think that there was such a distance that you didn’t -- you didn’t see them, and your -- did your father go and visit them, that when [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I -- I -- he might have, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So you don’t know what went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: No.</span> <span id="s599">I never -- I never went there, yeah.</span> <span id="s600">I have no idea, I never questioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Seems odd that -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: It might seem odd today, but those days I never questioned it.</span> <span id="s603">I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Cause Przemysl wasn’t that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Well, i-it -- y -- I guess it wasn’t, but we didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: -- we never visited.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So it was your mother’s mother who was in Lwów with -- with the grandf -- the grandmother and grandfather was --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah, yeah, my mother was the oldest of three siblings.</span> <span id="s610">She had a younger sister, extremely gifted, and a younger brother, who was of course the apple of the eye of my grandmother, because he was a boy.</span> <span id="s611">And my father wanted to have a boy, too, because of course, in those days you wanted to have somebody to say Kaddish.</span> <span id="s612">In those days, and today too, I guess.</span> <span id="s613">And not necessarily only je -- only Jewish families, in all families you want a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s615">But your parents didn’t have another child.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No.</span> <span id="s619">I guess my mother decided that it was too hard.</span> <span id="s620">I -- I don’t know what is the reason, I would speculate.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Maybe one was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Oh, ye -- one was enough.</span> <span id="s625">I think it’s because she was the oldest child, and she had the responsibility of taking care of the -- her youngest brother, who was very naughty, and she had to run after him, and I guess she didn’t want to do that any more.</span> <span id="s626">No, she didn’t want to do it for me.</span> <span id="s627">Let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I mean, that I should have a sibling to compete with --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: -- my status in my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Was your father older than your mother by some years?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Much older.</span> <span id="s634">14 years older.</span> <span id="s635">I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: 14 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yeah, by 14 years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: So that’s pretty big difference --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: That was.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: -- in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yeah, I -- I said that I -- and -- and -- and I said he never played with me because he was so much older, but that -- that really didn’t have anything to do with it, because my grandfather used to play with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yeah, he used to play with me, put me on -- well, actually, my father, when I was little, he would play with me too, and then I got too big, so he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s645">Now, is it your mother’s sister who converted to Catholicism --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: -- before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Do you know -- do you know anything about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, it was hushed -- hush-hush.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s653">I think she con -- I don’t know why she converted.</span> <span id="s654">Number one, she was extremely depressed because she went through a divorce.</span> <span id="s655">Number two, she couldn’t get a job, and she had to be independent because -- she couldn’t get a job because the Jews were not allowed to -- to teach, and they could not work in government establishment -- establishments.</span> <span id="s656">So she couldn’t work for any -- she had to work privately, and it’s very har -- it was extremely hard to work -- to get a job in a private institution.</span> <span id="s657">I don’t know if there were any private institutions, except if it were for a business.</span> <span id="s658">And she was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s659">She was a lawyer, she was very accomplished, very good looking, very elegant.</span> <span id="s660">She appeared in society pages.</span> <span id="s661">She did get married, but she got married to somebody who was -- I can’t understand how in the world that happened, but it did happen, he was a censor for the city of -- of Lwów.</span> <span id="s662">And censor had a very important function, because they censored, actually, the press, and -- and so on -- many other things.</span> <span id="s663">So apparently he work in a -- you know, in a government establishment.</span> <span id="s664">I don’t know how long, maybe he got fired to -- after the ’35 or ’36, I -- and I think this is at the time I think she divorced him shortly before the war started.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t know exactly what year, I’m just guessing when it comes to the year. ’</span> <span id="s666">37, maybe?</span> <span id="s667">Thirty si -- eight?</span> <span id="s668">And it was a tragic divorce, and she had the very influential friends, Catholic friends, so it was -- whom she spend a lot of time.</span> <span id="s669">Chances are they influenced her too, and she wanted -- or -- or maybe I -- I don’t know, I -- there was rumors she might have fallen in love with somebody who was not Jewish, and she wanted to -- she wanted to connect with him, and he under -- but it -- it didn’t happen anyway, but she also felt that she wanted to do it because she felt solace in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: In the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: In the church.</span> <span id="s672">She -- one time she -- she told me that the churches are always open, and you can go and find this -- consolation there.</span> <span id="s673">If you see, you can find consolation the synagogue too, but I guess she didn’t know enough to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And was she then able to work, because she had converted?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: She got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: As a lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I -- may --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: You’re not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: I don’t remember -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s686">But she did get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Did your grandmother convert as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: My moth -- I found out that my grandmother converted after the war, or -- because she wanted to be buried near her son.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: And -- and they -- and since he stayed in Poland, and married a Polish woman, he would be buried in Catholic cemetery.</span> <span id="s691">He also converted.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: That’s what I was going to say.</span> <span id="s693">So he also converted?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: He also converted, about the same time, and -- as my --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Your aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s698">And did you know about this when you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I think I knew about that, yes.</span> <span id="s700">I knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Was it a scandal in the family, or was it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: If it were a scandal we were not -- we didn’t know -- I -- I think by that time the contact with the other members of the family was severed for financial reasons.</span> <span id="s703">It was severed before, the financial something or other.</span> <span id="s704">Unfortunately my mother very much missed her cousins, she loved them.</span> <span id="s705">But it happened at the higher level, in other words, it happened a-at the generational level of the grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: They split from --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: From the other fellows.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s710">Because that was another family.</span> <span id="s711">My grandmother had two sisters.</span> <span id="s712">And one of the sisters had four children.</span> <span id="s713">And my mother was very much, very friendly with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Right.</span> <span id="s716">But when the grandfather broke up with the rest of them, then the family had to follow.</span> <span id="s717">So that was very sad, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Now, as you’re growing up, you are eight years old when the Nazis take over in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: No, no, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: 1920 -- ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: -- no, no, no.</span> <span id="s722">Oh, when they -- yes, yes, right, yeah, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Right, okay.</span> <span id="s724">So, at some point, between eight years old, ’33 and ’39, are you he -- before the ger --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Are you hearing about what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s728">Not only that, not only that, I think in 1913 my mother had -- had a very dear friend who lived in Germany with her mother, and she came to visit us.</span> <span id="s729">She went -- she came to Poland in, I think, 1938.</span> <span id="s730">I think she came to Poland, chances are she came to Poland after the Kristallnacht, Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s731">And -- and -- and I-I remember being in the bedroom, and I remember they’re talking in the dining room, shushing one to the other, a-a-and it -- and it was so scary, I can’t tell you how scary it was.</span> <span id="s732">Whatever -- a-and -- and the -- what was even scarier than -- after all the horror which she described to my mother, whatever it was I didn’t hear, I just felt the -- the tension of it.</span> <span id="s733">She -- she went back.</span> <span id="s734">She went back cause she didn’t want to leave her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Not that she could have been saved, because the -- Hitler would have caught up with her.</span> <span id="s737">But with us, he caught up in ’41, because in ’39 we had the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: So when this woman left, did you talk to your mother and say, you know, what’s going on, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Well, I could ask, but my mother -- my mother would never tell me horror stories.</span> <span id="s740">She would never tell me anything to -- to scare me, or to -- to do anything.</span> <span id="s741">She -- she tried to make everything beautiful for me.</span> <span id="s742">So -- the parent -- the parents talked about it, I’m sure, but i-i -- it -- d -- you can just feel that -- the fe -- I was cre -- it’s cre -- you know, sometimes you’re more scared when you don’t know, right?</span> <span id="s743">So I remember being very, very fearful at that time, yes.</span> <span id="s744">It -- it was like a horror that we’re standing here, and you never -- and you didn’t know when it would come and o -- take over, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Do you start hearing more things explicitly as you get a little bit older, as it gets closer to 1939, or is it still a blur?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: What happens in the -- I -- i -- we don’t know exactly what’s happening in Germany, and we don’t know anything that happens Soviet Union because that door is co -- completely locked up and the keys are thrown away.</span> <span id="s747">But i-in Poland itself, we have enough problems to cope, because there are -- there are rumors of pogroms and they are not publicized, so you don’t know exactly, it’s strictly rumors.</span> <span id="s748">There are so-called -- there’s numerous clauses at the university, meaning that you -- the Jews cannot -- only -- only very limited amounts of Jews can enter universities.</span> <span id="s749">If they already have the privilege of attending the universities, there are so-called ghetto benches at the universities where they have to sit separately at the end of the bench, and some students rebel against it, and they are being fought.</span> <span id="s750">And I recently read something I didn’t even know, in a book that also relates what happened in Lwów, that they had razor blades attached to the -- to the canes, and they would cut up people’s faces, in demonstrations, and there were many demon -- student demonstrations.</span> <span id="s751">And they used to be called Endecy, plural for what -- that organiza -- organization [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s752">And we knew about it, all along.</span> <span id="s753">That was all known, but life went on, you know?</span> <span id="s754">Nobody was killing us, you know?</span> <span id="s755">Times were bad, but then you get used to bad times.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Did things happen to you in your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Nothing happened at my school.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: As a matter of fact, I was accepted to a very exclusive, private -- not private, public high school.</span> <span id="s760">The public high school was more exclusive than private.</span> <span id="s761">And they would not admit Jews there, very rarely.</span> <span id="s762">And since my mother went to that high school before, and so did my aunt, they went and they asked if I could be admitted.</span> <span id="s763">And -- and I was admitted, but I wasn’t the only one, because in that year they admitted five Jewish girls, including me, for a class of 150.</span> <span id="s764">And it was f -- a special privilege, this -- th -- usually they would not admit them.</span> <span id="s765">What -- what was so special about that school?</span> <span id="s766">Very high level ins -- of instruction, and lower fees.</span> <span id="s767">Cause if you went into a private school, the -- the schools were not public there.</span> <span id="s768">So there were only, I think two -- two high schools, actually.</span> <span id="s769">I -- I -- I knew -- I know of one public high school in Lwów, and -- for girls, there are ya -- are many for boys, but not for girls.</span> <span id="s770">For girls there is only one, right?</span> <span id="s771">And I had the confirmation of it, because at the -- our reunion -- reunion at the 10th anniversary of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, I met a woman from Lwów, and when I told her about my high school, she said, “Aaahh.”</span> <span id="s772">She knew what that was.</span> <span id="s773">So I had -- I felt very confirmed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: And what year was that when you were going to go into that high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I wa -- I thi -- just one year, 1939.</span> <span id="s776">To -- 1938 to 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: So you were only there for one year?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: For one year in the Polish, and then that school -- then the Soviets came, and that coo -- school remained the only Polish school in the city.</span> <span id="s779">In other words, where they taught the subjects in Polish.</span> <span id="s780">All the other schools were can -- had -- transforming to Russian speaking schools.</span> <span id="s781">So this was the only school, and it became -- it was no longer segregated and they admitted boys, so we had boy and girl -- boys and girls, but it was taught in Polish, except that we had two hours of Russian every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Two.</span> <span id="s783">So what was that like when the Russians ca -- I mean, now you know it’s -- there’s a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s785">So how’d it all start?</span> <span id="s786">I remember that by that time my grandmother lived in another apartment, and my mother being a very good daughter, and the war starting, she didn’t want to leave her mother alone, so she moved us all to her ga -- to be together, to her mother’s apartment.</span> <span id="s787">And that apartment was near a botanic garden, in the very nice area.</span> <span id="s788">And -- and I remember I locked myself up in one little bedroom, very -- the f -- last bedroom, and I was reading “Gone With the Wind.”</span> <span id="s789">And since I was reading about Rhett Butler and Scarlett O’Hara, I for -- all -- forgot all about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: But there was a war going on in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: There was a war going on, but I was in -- I was ra -- I was in the s -- see a -- I was at -- living the war in between the States, yeah.</span> <span id="s792">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Was that a very popular book in Europe?</span> <span id="s794">In Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Oh yes, it just came out, it was extremely popular --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: And how, ow -- of course, how could it not have been?</span> <span id="s798">I -- I read in Polish because was already translated.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s800">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yeah, but you see, what happened was, it wasn’t a war.</span> <span id="s802">It was a war, and it wasn’t a war.</span> <span id="s803">Germans invaded Poland, so -- and then the Soviets invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s804">And there was a Ribbentrop-Molotov non-aggression pact.</span> <span id="s805">So the Poles had to surrender, and they had to s-surrender to the Soviets, and to -- to the Germans, and they stood -- the two armies stood in front of Lwów and we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s806">That’s how I locked myself up.</span> <span id="s807">I was a queen of escape, you know, even in those days.</span> <span id="s808">I -- I -- I -- this was -- I read to escape, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Lwów was right close to the border --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Right -- right --</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: -- right -- right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: -- on the bor --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: -- almost, no Przemysl was on the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: See, the Germans overran Przemysl.</span> <span id="s817">Przemysl was divided by the San River, as you know, right?</span> <span id="s818">So, on one side the Soviets took, had [indecipherable] and the other side were the Germans, and the Jews were in between, and they were absolutely massacred there, right.</span> <span id="s819">Yeah, first when they first came, and then the second time, right, was -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: So, when did you come out of your room [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: When I came out of the room, we knew that the ser -- the war was over, and the Soviets were taking over s -- s -- so it took me a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: See, it took a -- it took a very short time.</span> <span id="s824">I mean, it was couple of days, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Were you nervous about the Soviets taking over?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Well, we didn’t know what do -- they -- to expect, but it’s not that we were happy about the Soviets.</span> <span id="s827">We were happy because the Germans didn’t took over -- didn’t take over, because that would have been the end right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And that you felt at the time, that this was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: So that time, it was a -- a respite, but we weren’t happy at all because my father had the business, he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s830">And there was article 11 or something, protocol 11, article 11, all the business people had to be taken -- exiled, a-and maybe out of Lwów or into si -- Siberia.</span> <span id="s831">And many were, right?</span> <span id="s832">So -- so my father right away gave up hi -- the warehouses and whatever he had there, a-and he stopped being a businessman.</span> <span id="s833">So that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: And so what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: He got a job as a ga -- accountant, and he worked for 400 rubles, which is okay, but since my mother still didn’t work, it was not enough, and we -- at the end e -- I mean, we were starving, actually.</span> <span id="s836">We had no -- we had no income.</span> <span id="s837">It was very bad, yeah.</span> <span id="s838">And I wa -- and then I was an adolescent and I was a hungry adolescent, and I came down with s-scarlet fever that I contacted in -- in a public -- public medical service, public clinic, because now th -- under the Soviets, all the medical services were free.</span> <span id="s839">But I got contaminated directly with scarlet fever, so I had a bad case of scarlet fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: And how -- how old were you -- this was 1939, or 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: This is 19 -- end of 1940, right.</span> <span id="s842">E-e-end of 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: You remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: -- or maybe I wa -- ’40 -- beginning of 1941, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: So yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: You -- you remember being sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Oh, I remember it very well, I wa -- almost died.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yeah, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s851">I remember being in a hospital, I remember the doctors coming in, and I remember my mother visiting me after six weeks or so, and when she looked at me she got scared because my -- I was as skinny as they come.</span> <span id="s852">My mother was skinnier too, maybe skinnier than I was.</span> <span id="s853">She lost fi -- tw -- 20 kilos, which means 40 pounds, at the time I was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yeah, yeah, because she was so scared that she might lose me, I was very dangerously ill.</span> <span id="s856">So, but that served us well, when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s857">We used it.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: All right, we -- why don’t we stop the tape, and we’ll start right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: All right, we’re going to come back to the scarlet fever story and the Germans, and how that saved you, but I want to go back a little bit, because there’s a part of the conversion story that you didn’t tell us before, mainly about your grandfather.</span> <span id="s863">Can you --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Oh, right.</span> <span id="s865">Well, i-it happened, I think, 1937 maybe, when my bos -- my aunt and my uncle were very desperate, without a job.</span> <span id="s866">Especially my aunt, because sh -- as I said, she went through a divorce that was very painful.</span> <span id="s867">And so my grandfather remembered that he had a friend closely connected to Marshal Pi -- Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s868">And so he went to see him and -- in Warsaw, and to ask him if he could help f -- to find the -- the job for both of them, for my aunt and my uncle.</span> <span id="s869">And he told my grandfather that he could not because they were not -- they were Jewish, and there was no way he could do it.</span> <span id="s870">Should they convert, that would be possible.</span> <span id="s871">And -- and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s872">But as far as my aunt was concerned, she was very desperate, and she -- and she was -- and she could have been on the verge of suicide because I think maybe with her romantic disenchantments, as well as because she couldn’t be independent.</span> <span id="s873">So she converted, and she stayed converted.</span> <span id="s874">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s875">And -- but they both got jobs.</span> <span id="s876">I know my uncle didn’t get a job in Lwów, but he got a job in another town in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: So do you think your grandfather converted because --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: My grandfather never converted.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Did -- didn’t convert.</span> <span id="s880">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Grandfather never converted.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: -- the uncle converted in order to get a job, you think.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: I-I have a feeling that that could have been the reason, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s884">But he was so assimilated that it -- it -- I don’t think it made much difference for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: You -- they were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s887">They never spoke anything but Polish in their household, even in the older generation li -- level.</span> <span id="s888">My father spoke Yiddish, but my mother did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: And she didn’t -- I don’t think she knew how.</span> <span id="s891">So I -- so in her household, apparently they didn’t speak yi -- I don’t know if my grandmother spoke Yiddish or not, but she never spoke it.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: So one difference one can see in Poland, in terms of the anti-Semitism is that it wasn’t really racial.</span> <span id="s893">Because if a Jew converted, they were considered to be Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes, you might say that, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: You might say that, but -- but because in terms of -- of conversion and getting job, that was one thing, but you were always who you were, no matter what.</span> <span id="s897">If people knew you as a Jew, you stayed a Jew.</span> <span id="s898">Mendelsohn with his cross on his grave is still a Jew to all Germans, so was [indecipherable] and he -- even though he converted.</span> <span id="s899">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So it was the same in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s902">Except if they didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s903">If they didn’t know it, it just as with that boy, he didn’t know I was Jewish, I was a -- we could have been the best of friends.</span> <span id="s904">But once he knew it, it was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Right.</span> <span id="s907">That’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Now, one more question, because when we took the break you told me something about your mother that I didn’t know, that she had gone to conservatory, but hadn’t finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Right, she went to conservatory and she went, and she studied education in -- in the university, but she dropped out, and I -- I think she dropped out to -- in order to help th -- her parents make the ends meet, which could never happen anyway.</span> <span id="s910">But she wanted to lower her own burden on them.</span> <span id="s911">And then I think that the marriage of my parents was arranged.</span> <span id="s912">I didn’t know it, but it was probably a matchmaking kind of deal.</span> <span id="s913">In other words, they were -- it was a shidach, if you know the word shidach.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: So did your parents get along, do you think, as far as you --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Well, the thing is that I never knew that.</span> <span id="s918">I never knew that, that the marriage was arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: I knew then -- a-as a matter of fact, I couldn’t understand how come my mother married my father, because he was much older than she was.</span> <span id="s921">And then she told me that in-initially she was dating a -- a -- a dental student, and -- but in order to marry the dental student, she had to have a dowry, because dental students need a dowry to establish themselves, and there was no dowry.</span> <span id="s922">Not that kind of a dowry.</span> <span id="s923">There was a dowry, had to be a dowry, but not that kind of a dowry.</span> <span id="s924">So my mo- mother didn’t marry him.</span> <span id="s925">I think she liked him, she took me as a patient to him one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yeah, and I liked him too, he was -- he was cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: So did your mother talk to you about the marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: She never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Never, never.</span> <span id="s932">I found that out by accident from the letters that I have read, maybe -- maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, I don’t remember, that were written to my aunt.</span> <span id="s933">She died recently, I don’t know when she died, I -- I ca -- I have no notion of time passing.</span> <span id="s934">And in those letters my father describes a situation in which he was to marry somebody else.</span> <span id="s935">And he was very fond of that other person, but something came up, and he broke the engagement.</span> <span id="s936">He broke the engagement.</span> <span id="s937">Somebody offended him.</span> <span id="s938">And shortly after that, he married my mother.</span> <span id="s939">So I say, how in the world did he marry my mother?</span> <span id="s940">So I -- I’m guessing that it was a shidach.</span> <span id="s941">I mean s -- a situation in which the ma -- marriage is arranged, pre-arranged, right.</span> <span id="s942">So those are these family stories, each family has it’s secrets.</span> <span id="s943">But I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s944">I didn’t know it until just now.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Really, just recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I mean in America, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s948">Do you remember your mother singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Oh, of course.</span> <span id="s950">I was brought up on all the operas.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s953">My mother sang “Madama Butterfly,” and she sang “La Traviata,” and she sang the “Rosenkavalier,” and she sang everything you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: So she really had a cultivated voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Oh, she had a magnificent lyric soprano voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s958">As a matter of fact, she used to like to tell me how as she once sang by open window and a gentleman asked her if she is a-an opera singer, and she was so flattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Did you go to concerts, as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I went a -- yes, I went to the operas.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: And I didn’t have to go to my mother [indecipherable] my aunt had the recitals in their -- her apartment, she sang a -- what did she sing?</span> <span id="s963">Schubert, I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: So your aunt, her sister, played piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Oh, my mother played piano too.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Oh, your mother played piano, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Oh sure, of course she played piano.</span> <span id="s968">If you would sing, you have to play piano.</span> <span id="s969">But she played mostly from hearing, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: By ear.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: By ear, yes, she played by ear but she read notes too, I mean, if she wanted, she read notes.</span> <span id="s972">And -- and my aunt sang well.</span> <span id="s973">I remember sitting at one of her recitals.</span> <span id="s974">They opened the -- all the rooms, like that.</span> <span id="s975">And -- and s --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: That must have been exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: And she sat in the room when there was light coming from the balcony, and that was very exciting, yes.</span> <span id="s978">I was very proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Could you -- can you sing?</span> <span id="s980">Did you get a voice?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: They were waiting for me to s -- to -- to ma-mature, and to sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s986">It didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s987">No, I ha -- well, number one, I had the mezzo voice, I didn’t have a soprano, I was not a soprano.</span> <span id="s988">But I -- I could carry a tune pretty well.</span> <span id="s989">Not any more.</span> <span id="s990">Excuse me, I need to drink the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s992">Well, that’s an interesting sidelight.</span> <span id="s993">Okay, let’s go to your scarlet fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: How does the scarlet fever --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: -- protect you when the Nazis come?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: You know, when Nazis came, they also had the carte blanche to go to -- to Jewish houses and do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s999">Take out what they wanted, do what they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: So what my mother did -- I don’t know if maybe it was my idea -- is -- probably had to be my mother’s idea, and the -- what did she do, she -- she put a sign on the bedroom door, sharla -- sharla fe -- feber.</span> <span id="s1002">Sharla feber.</span> <span id="s1003">Meaning scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s1004">So whoever want the -- if the soldiers came in and saw that sign, they ran.</span> <span id="s1005">You know, Germans were pretty sanitary people, they didn’t want to get involved in.</span> <span id="s1006">Sometimes it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1007">One time it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1008">A guy came in, he was inebriated, I have to say, and as he was inebriated, he decided he wants to -- he wants to sit at the table and have cup of tea.</span> <span id="s1009">So, he just -- you know, we had to do what he says, there was no such thing as say no except one time my father did say no, which was absolutely heroic.</span> <span id="s1010">And so he -- he sat with the table, he had his tea.</span> <span id="s1011">And I was -- as I was recovering from s-scarlet fever, I lost all my hair.</span> <span id="s1012">Yes, I di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: -- I lost hair, completely.</span> <span id="s1015">And -- not completely, but almost completely.</span> <span id="s1016">But as it -- the hair grew in, and -- and I -- previously I had the straight hair, that hair grew in curly.</span> <span id="s1017">So I was pretty cute, and I was pretty young.</span> <span id="s1018">And I couldn’t speak German, so I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s1019">But my parents, of course, talked German.</span> <span id="s1020">I -- I don’t know what they had -- he had to say, I don’t -- I don’t remember I understood.</span> <span id="s1021">And what happened was he s -- he sat for quite some time, he drank his tea, and he asked for soap.</span> <span id="s1022">So my mother gave him some soap, wif -- we had soap, and he -- then he left.</span> <span id="s1023">And he said, “You can be proud of your daughter,” to them.</span> <span id="s1024">I don’t know what he had in mind.</span> <span id="s1025">As I said he was drunk, so -- so that’s an episode.</span> <span id="s1026">In that episode, tha -- after that episode, we decided we -- we -- and as the time went on, it wasn’t good to be sick for a Jew, because sick Jews were dead Jews, sooner or later.</span> <span id="s1027">So we -- we did not use the sign any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Do you remember when the Germans came into Lwów --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Oh, sure I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: -- in June?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: I remember, I was standing in the balcony watching them come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: That was -- that was -- I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1034">It was very, very, very scary.</span> <span id="s1035">And they marched in in a column, and it -- I -- if I recall cor -- if I recall correctly, Gródecka has cobblestones, too.</span> <span id="s1036">So they marched on the cobblestones, and you could hear them march in boots, marching boots, yes.</span> <span id="s1037">And I was -- and that balcony was my favorite spot, because I used to read on that balcony.</span> <span id="s1038">You know, there was a space for a chaise lounge, and you could lie down and get suntan and do everything, and -- and we -- that’s what I used to do, and -- and that’s what I did that particular day.</span> <span id="s1039">On a [indecipherable] I think it was on the 20 -- I don’t know what date, it was a -- the end of June, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Because the war started on the 23rd of June of ’41, and I think that’s when it was when they marched in, or shortly after, because Lwów was very close.</span> <span id="s1042">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: And you were living on Gródecka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: We were not on Gródecka, off Gródecka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Were off Gródecka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Off Gródecka.</span> <span id="s1047">It was a small street, so you could see from the balcony as they marched on Gródecka, could see Gródecka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: What were you afraid of, do you think?</span> <span id="s1049">When you say you were afraid when you saw them, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Y-You -- what you were afraid of, you were afraid of what you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1051">You knew they had concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1052">There was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s1053">Of course, we didn’t know that there was much worse than that.</span> <span id="s1054">That we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1055">Nobody knew then.</span> <span id="s1056">Nine -- although we knew more, I think because after all, 1941, there -- they were already in Poland, and in Warsaw, and in the western part -- part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1057">However, I don’t think there was that much communication because of the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1058">And the other thing, we were so preoccupied with our s -- penury, we were poor, we really, you know, when I got sick and my grandmother came to -- to see -- to visit me, and she went -- she was there all day and she wanted to eat something, she went to the -- to the cupboard and there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s1059">She realized that we had no food.</span> <span id="s1060">And I -- and the -- and she didn’t know that we ha -- apparently my mother was always good at giving, but never on taking, because she didn’t know my mother didn’t have food to -- with her family.</span> <span id="s1061">A-And they did, because in that family, my grandfather worked, my aunt worked, and my uncle worked under the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1064">So I’d -- so after I -- when I was getting better, all my mother was feeding me was farina.</span> <span id="s1065">I was getting fat on farina, which were very good, and my mother served it with butter, it was great.</span> <span id="s1066">Right.</span> <span id="s1067">That’s what I was eating most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: That first month was very difficult when the Germans came in because there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: -- pogroms right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yeah, and I had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Right [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: But I want to finish that other part --</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: -- about the scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s1078">So -- and I was recuperating from scarlet fever, I wasn’t allowed to go out or anything, God forbid, and -- and the -- that June 23rd, which was Sunday, I was -- that was my first day out, supposed to have been, and I was going to go to the pool, and meet all my cous -- high school friends.</span> <span id="s1079">And lo and behold, the Germans stopped it.</span> <span id="s1080">On that day, the Germans started the invasion.</span> <span id="s1081">So that was the end of everyth -- not every -- well, that was an end of everything, actually.</span> <span id="s1082">Right.</span> <span id="s1083">So could you rephrase your question [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Well, what I was going -- there was no fighting in Lwów, they just came in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: There wa -- there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: -- or was there fight --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: -- there was no fight -- there was very little fighting.</span> <span id="s1088">I think there was some bombing maybe, of the airport, but the -- the -- the -- the Russians withdrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Uh-huh, very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Russians withdrew very quickly.</span> <span id="s1091">And some people went with them.</span> <span id="s1092">Some people went with them, but golly, we wouldn’t -- how could we?</span> <span id="s1093">I mean -- right.</span> <span id="s1094">My mother was very attached to her mother, but that wouldn’t apply in that case anyway.</span> <span id="s1095">But my father before the war offered my mother, maybe you should go and join his family in America.</span> <span id="s1096">And my mother and I witnessed that.</span> <span id="s1097">My mother said, “And how could I leave my mother?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1099">Not how could I leave you, but how could I leave my mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1101">And how could I leave my mother.</span> <span id="s1102">And so that was the end of that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1103">And -- and my father and my mother had very good relations except for the financial things, because my mother always wanted to help her family, a-and -- and -- and my father yielded to this, and did, to his own ruin.</span> <span id="s1104">And that was -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: So he gave mother to -- money, rather --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: No, he didn’t give any money, but she tried to help the family.</span> <span id="s1107">He hired people from -- from my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s1108">He purchased debt ridden realty to alleviate the debts, and it turned out that they were so indebted that the -- the -- that he didn’t even know the debts were -- that were -- were on that property, right.</span> <span id="s1109">He was -- yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s1110">It was a ver -- horrendous, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: But by the time the Germans come, your father doesn’t have a business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: No, by the time the Russians come he already ha -- there’s no business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: But there is also no income, because the 400 rubles for a family is not enough.</span> <span id="s1117">And my mother never worked, so sh -- I guess she didn’t know how to -- how to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Now does your father stand up to the Germans very quickly?</span> <span id="s1119">Is there a scene?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yes, right, oh my father’s di -- well, I -- I told you that the Jewish apartments were free for all, any time.</span> <span id="s1121">And so one time we had two S.S.’s barge in, and they didn’t care too much about other things, but they wanted to -- to have my father -- there was a daybed, horsehair filled daybed that they liked, so they pointed to it and told my father [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s1122">He -- they started it with a Z-form, you know, Z-form is a form of -- form in German.</span> <span id="s1123">And my father said [speaks German].</span> <span id="s1124">And he was short, you know, my father.</span> <span id="s1125">A-And he stood [indecipherable] like this, and he pointed at the picture on the wall.</span> <span id="s1126">And he said [speaks German].</span> <span id="s1127">So what does the officer do?</span> <span id="s1128">He grabs him by a neck and he says yes, truk -- no, how did he say it, he didn’t use the Z-form any more, he said [speaks German].</span> <span id="s1129">So my father -- so, what happens, and -- and he starts to pulling out, he holds him like this and starts to pull out his revolver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: The German is pulling out his revolver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Revolver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: So what does my mother do -- and I have to describe what these two officers look like.</span> <span id="s1134">I -- I had a young eye, you know, I was a teenager, and they looked very handsome.</span> <span id="s1135">They were tall, and blonde.</span> <span id="s1136">They had [indecipherable] hanging down here.</span> <span id="s1137">They had those blue green uniforms in be -- and scary, scary S.S.’s on that black background, right on here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Right here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: -- around the neck.</span> <span id="s1140">And -- but my mother goes in the back, you can imagine scene, he holds my father by the throat, and my mother goes in back of him and pulls his tunic as he’s taking the revolver out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: She pulls the tunic of the German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1143">So the German d-doesn’t know what’s happening, he’s turning around, there’s my mother.</span> <span id="s1144">So I -- I -- he gets furious, and then I look at him, I look at him with all the hate that I could muster, I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s1145">So -- so he sees me with that hatred in my eyes, and he has to take out his hands, so he slaps me, and I ro -- and he throws me into the corner, you know.</span> <span id="s1146">But, in the meantime, somehow, the guy, other, comes to him and they -- and they leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: All right, go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1148">Now translate what’s being said between the German and your father and your father to the German.</span> <span id="s1149">What is it he says?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Well, he says to my father, bring this down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: And my father says, “I’m not going to bring it down, I’m an Austrian officer, and I’m not going to bring it down.”</span> <span id="s1153">And he points to the picture on the wall, telling that he’s not going to bring it down, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1154">Because he’s an officer.</span> <span id="s1155">So the other guy gets mad, that here’s a [speaks German] I don’t know how the [indecipherable] cursed Jews.</span> <span id="s1156">Perflukten means probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Cursed j --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Cursed -- cursed Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: I think.</span> <span id="s1161">I-I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Like a damn Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Damn Jew, damn Jew is better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1166">So a-an -- h -- so he changes the form of address, he doesn’t -- h-he -- he uses do, means you know, the difference between thou and you, I guess.</span> <span id="s1167">And in English that’s the -- th-the difference, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So then he orders him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: He orders him to take it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: And my father insists that he’s not going to take it down, because he is an Austrian officer.</span> <span id="s1172">And at that time, he’s ch -- he starts taking -- you know, they all have this tendency, do that thing.</span> <span id="s1173">They -- they can grab you, I -- I guess.</span> <span id="s1174">Anyway, so my father didn’t bring it down, they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Now your mother is doing something that’s very peculiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: So she’s holding him --</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Pulling him away --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: -- I mean, of course.</span> <span id="s1181">She -- she pulls away because h -- she ge -- young -- whatever it is, it was an instantaneous reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: But you can imagine the courage of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: No, I can’t because I also -- you’re very lucky that you weren’t all shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Right, right, right, right, because they were S.S. -- S.S.’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: But do you remember when these guys left?</span> <span id="s1187">You -- were you three sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: I -- I -- I was very sho -- yeah, I was very much in shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: I would imagine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: I was very much in shock, yeah.</span> <span id="s1191">A-and -- and they must have had other considerations, but in that com -- that will come from other -- from other [indecipherable] stories, so I don’t want to -- you know, they did it -- this was illegal what they were doing, in a way.</span> <span id="s1192">They -- they could do it, and yet th -- you know, I don’t know how legal it was for them to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Officially -- officially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: So they have do it carefully.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: So maybe they didn’t want to leave c-cadavers behind them.</span> <span id="s1199">I have no idea, I just -- they just -- at that time I was so drained, I -- they just left, that’s it, and they -- my father didn’t take it down, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: So now what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: So I don’t know where we are.</span> <span id="s1202">Are we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: We’re in June, we’re still in June</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: In June, the Soviets ca-came in, so the life started under the Soviets, so I went back to school, and it was like a school that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: You mean the Germans came in, so you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Oh, now we talking about Germans, or the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: I thought we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Oh, we still ba --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Aren’t we still in Germany?</span> <span id="s1210">I mean, the Germans have taken over, they came in in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: All right, so now, okay, all right.</span> <span id="s1212">You see, I have to be brought to all that.</span> <span id="s1213">So -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Is there something about the Soviets you want to say that you didn’t say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: No, no, I -- not that I remember, really.</span> <span id="s1216">No, because it was a go -- I -- I remember very dreary life under the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Dreary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Very dreary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: But not dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Not dangerous, no.</span> <span id="s1221">Oh, well, in a way it was somewhat dangerous, because you had to -- I remember th-the -- having an understanding with my girlfriends that if anybody ever stopped us, we would have a tale to tell, and it should be the same tel -- tal -- tale.</span> <span id="s1222">Cause we, of course, we were talking against the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1225">And I had to learn the Constitution, and I had a very bad grade, I couldn’t learn the Constitution.</span> <span id="s1226">Constitution was a one -- a very -- Soviet Constitution is a wonderful piece of -- document.</span> <span id="s1227">It gives you all the rights you can imagine, right.</span> <span id="s1228">But you don’t have, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Now why was it dreary, or dull?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Well, for one thing it -- I -- it was dreary for many reasons.</span> <span id="s1231">For economic reasons, because there was no money, for food even.</span> <span id="s1232">And for other reason, because I was an adolescent and that was a -- hard to be a [indecipherable] it would have been hard anyway, probably, anywhere.</span> <span id="s1233">But it was a -- you see, it’s -- how did I -- how did I put it?</span> <span id="s1234">I put it’s hard to be an adolescent, it’s even harder to be a hungry adolescent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Do -- do you remember a lot of refugees coming into Lwów during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Oh yes, our family did.</span> <span id="s1239">My grandfather’s family came.</span> <span id="s1240">And they were -- shortly after, they were deported.</span> <span id="s1241">They were deport to Siberia, which saved their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: How did they get deported?</span> <span id="s1244">Because life for refugees, it was very difficult, because it was difficult for other people too, many other people, and as a refugee they didn’t have a -- apartments, and so on and so forth, so it’s even harder for them.</span> <span id="s1245">And so there was a -- I don’t know how to describe it -- the Soviet ran a survey, and they asked people what they are going to do after the war.</span> <span id="s1246">Would they go back to their homes in the previous location, or would they want to stay under the benevolent Soviet rule?</span> <span id="s1247">That wasn’t in the paper, I’m adding it up.</span> <span id="s1248">A-And so, most people, a lot of people, many people, thousands of people signed up they want to go back to their apartments and recover their possessions.</span> <span id="s1249">All these people within, I think, 24 hours, were deported.</span> <span id="s1250">And -- but th-the Soviets didn’t intend to save them, they intended to punish them.</span> <span id="s1251">But eventually that was the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Because they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Most of these people came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Came back, right.</span> <span id="s1255">So when the Germans take over, and it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: The Germans didn’t take a -- start to -- they give carte blanche to the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: And the Ukrainians barge into people’s houses, or even catch them on the street, and take them to the prisons -- prisons.</span> <span id="s1259">And I was most familiar with the prisons that was across the street from my father’s office.</span> <span id="s1260">Except my father wasn’t there any more, because the office was surrendered as the Soviets came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: So -- so they ri -- ri -- th-they would beat them up, or they made them dig graves for the o -- I don’t know, they make -- made them dig graves for the people that the Soviets killed, or they made them dig up the graves -- the -- the shallow graves that the Soviets buried their people in there.</span> <span id="s1263">You know, whoever that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1265">And what was the name of the prison that was near your father’s work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Oh, th -- th -- they di -- that was the -- I think that -- that was a nickname, was Brygidki, but that was a nickname, there was probably an official name, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: And did you know also that the Ukrainians were massacring Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Of cour -- that -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s1270">Yes, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: They did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1272">At that time it was the mob.</span> <span id="s1273">And don’t -- and of course the Germans incited this, they incited the mob, they gave them their right.</span> <span id="s1274">I don’t know exactly if the Petliura Days happened right after they came, or they came and they happened at the end of the month.</span> <span id="s1275">But Petliura was the man who was assassinated by a Jewish boy, 1926, actually, because they killed his parents in the pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: He killed -- he was a notorious leader, anti-Semitic leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Petliura occurs in jan -- July 25th, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: I -- I know, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: -- that’s -- but they had the -- they had riots right the first two days --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Before, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: -- maybe under another name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1286">And they -- the others were repeated again, but I -- I can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Did you ever see violence?</span> <span id="s1288">A: I did not see -- well, I did see violence, but not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Not at that -- that’s what I’m wondering, at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: No, not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: I mu -- I -- I didn’t leave the house, period.</span> <span id="s1293">Once the Germans came in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: You stayed in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: See, you remember I was an adolescent who wa -- who was kept in the house because of sickness, now [indecipherable] adolescent kept in the house because of danger.</span> <span id="s1296">So, I didn’t -- I -- for months, first few months I didn’t come out at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: But I was studying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: You were studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1301">I had to do something, right?</span> <span id="s1302">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1303">I have to tell you about studying, how I came to study what I was studying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Okay, we’re going to have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: And w -- and we’ll do it next -- for the next time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Studying, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Janine, I wanted to go back just for a minute because at lunch you mentioned cats, that you had had cats through most of your childhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: -- including when you were in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: It wasn’t in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: It was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: It was before we went to the ghetto, in the ghetto we had no -- I don’t know there was space or food for animals, I didn’t see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: But I -- we had them in our apartment, and I don’t know how we got that little cat, but we did.</span> <span id="s1319">And even though my fa -- my father initially objected to my spending too much time with cats, di -- didn’t have nothing against that little cat.</span> <span id="s1320">It was a very poor little thing, and it -- it barely lived, it was so little.</span> <span id="s1321">And what happened was one night -- and it was, I think a Friday night before Monday round-up, when this cat got enta -- I think overnight, got entangled in bed linens and we found him dead in the morning.</span> <span id="s1322">And for us it was a bad omen.</span> <span id="s1323">And not only that we were sorry for the little cat because he was so helpless, but it was like a metaphor for our own future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1326">So it was -- you know, was kind of, very sad, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Now you said that when the Germans came in, your parents or your -- your mother in particular wouldn’t let you go out of the house, so you were studying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: And how did I -- well, I studied from the books I already had, first.</span> <span id="s1331">And by happy circumstance, we shared a -- we shared a bathroom with another family, on th -- the -- on -- outside of the apartment itself.</span> <span id="s1332">And in those days we had no toilet paper, so what we used was newspaper, mostly.</span> <span id="s1333">And one day, while in the washroom, I saw pages from books.</span> <span id="s1334">And -- and they -- it looked like very interesting books.</span> <span id="s1335">So I went to my neighbor and I told her that I provide her with all the newspapers I can if she gives me the books.</span> <span id="s1336">And I ended up with 20 volume world history and a magnificent edition of Schiller, complete works of Schiller, illustrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1339">And I spend the time I had just starting the world history, that’s why I’m so good in history, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: So you can thank the Germans for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Well, I wouldn’t thank the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: No, for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: -- not for this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: -- not for this, not for anything else.</span> <span id="s1346">I would be very pleased learning history on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1349">And so -- and I did, and I -- I studied French from the books I had, but I didn’t have any books, so I didn’t learn much French.</span> <span id="s1350">Cause I had the -- I remember I -- I had two volume, from the two volume some kind of a romance novel I only had one.</span> <span id="s1351">So -- and I think his name was Edgar Feuillet, Feuillet, he was very popular at a certain time.</span> <span id="s1352">Very popular -- popular author.</span> <span id="s1353">Ra -- light fiction, of course.</span> <span id="s1354">And -- but I loved Schiller was magnificent.</span> <span id="s1355">Everything was in Polish, of course.</span> <span id="s1356">And -- and I -- I can list you all the plays that I read, and “Joan of Arc” and “Fiesco of Genoa,” I think.</span> <span id="s1357">I don’t know, maybe it has another title.</span> <span id="s1358">And “The Robbers,” the most famous, I think.</span> <span id="s1359">A-And with all kinds of quotations that are world famous.</span> <span id="s1360">And I loved it, so I -- that -- well, I loved that -- that -- I can say that the -- the -- the -- the round-ups raged outside, and I was reading Schiller.</span> <span id="s1361">And my mother -- and one day I -- and I was very, very -- I -- I showed my discontent and I was telling my mother, “How can I ever go to university if I can’t go even to high school?”</span> <span id="s1362">And my mother looked at me as if I were from another planet.</span> <span id="s1363">And I probably knew I was from another planet, but I did it anyway, I -- I studied.</span> <span id="s1364">I studied, I spend a whole day doing all -- studying, reading mostly.</span> <span id="s1365">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1366">And what happened i -- in the meantime my father had a job, he went to his job in construction.</span> <span id="s1367">He had the same job from the beginning and he was the one who was provided with the Ausweiss.</span> <span id="s1368">Ausweiss, which is the certificate -- work certificate.</span> <span id="s1369">As you know significance work certificates in those days.</span> <span id="s1370">And he worked in constructions.</span> <span id="s1371">I don’t think he was a -- a builder himself, but he apparently supervised the -- whatever there was, or did them.</span> <span id="s1372">Maybe he did the payroll for the Polish worker -- workers.</span> <span id="s1373">He might have worked then as a payroll person.</span> <span id="s1374">But he -- his title was Bau Secretaire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Bau Secretaire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Bau meaning building.</span> <span id="s1377">Secretaire - secretary.</span> <span id="s1378">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: And he had that job from when the Germans came, or this was the same job that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: No, no, I think it was -- I have no idea actually -- I wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: -- I -- I never ask that question myself.</span> <span id="s1383">I think it must have been another job.</span> <span id="s1384">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1385">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1386">But it was far away and of course, Jews could not -- s-soon after the Germans came in, there -- there were no schools, there were no rights to use public transportation.</span> <span id="s1387">We had to wear an armband, which had to be wide.</span> <span id="s1388">And -- wide, pretty wide, yes.</span> <span id="s1389">With the blue Magen Davidz on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: And did you wear it on your right sleeve or your left sleeve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: On the right sleeve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: On the right sleeve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Right, on the right sleeve, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: But when they came in, when you had to put that on, it was summer.</span> <span id="s1395">So did you have to wear it if your arms were bare?</span> <span id="s1396">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: They didn’t care how they wear -- how you were wearing, you had to wear them, so you wore probably shorter sleeves, and you didn’t wear a -- but you had to wear them, if you didn’t wear them, or -- and you were caught, then -- they -- you -- that was a death penalty right there, or they beat you to death or whatever they would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: So you didn’t sew it on, you simply put it on for each of -- piece of clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Well, it -- i-it -- whatever it was, depending on the nature of the -- the -- of the clo -- clothes you were wearing, or type of garment you were wearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: And where did you get them from, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: No.</span> <span id="s1402">I -- I remember that they were covered with plastic, some of them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: That the fabric was covered with plastic and that was made more sewed, and they could have a snap.</span> <span id="s1405">They were not all fr -- made from fabric.</span> <span id="s1406">They were made from fabric, but the fabric -- excuse me -- was protected.</span> <span id="s1407">Fabric was protected with plastic.</span> <span id="s1408">That’s what I remember, yes.</span> <span id="s1409">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1410">And that -- you know this th -- this -- th-this time, I mean, in the beginning, it was when my cousin was taken and -- and beaten so horrible.</span> <span id="s1411">But he -- he survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Dr. Hertzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: He was a lawyer, but he had a de -- a -- you know, he study, he had post-doctorate studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: And where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: We were living the same apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s1420">At that time.</span> <span id="s1421">In that time, that was right after the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: A few months after.</span> <span id="s1424">And we kept living in the same apartment until such time when they told us that everybody has to move to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1425">And whoever -- yeah, in that time we were seeking other means of staying.</span> <span id="s1426">And this is at that time that my grandfather more or less was killed.</span> <span id="s1427">Because what happened was that the younger people had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1428">And with the ordinance of everybody going to the ghetto, somebody had to go and arrange for an apartment.</span> <span id="s1429">No -- you could not arrange for an apartment, there was no such thing as apartment.</span> <span id="s1430">You can arrange for a place to sleep, because the ghetto was made small.</span> <span id="s1431">And -- and that was very difficult because you had to buy your place from -- to sleep from somebody who was there already.</span> <span id="s1432">From the people who occupied the place.</span> <span id="s1433">You could buy it either from the Poles, or -- who had apartments in the ghetto still, or from the Jews who owned the apartments, and you could rent, sublet, some other place.</span> <span id="s1434">And we had no money, because w-we did a foolish thing.</span> <span id="s1435">If we had some gold, either we didn’t sell at the right time or we had to give it away when they asked for the con -- th-the Germans asked for the contributions.</span> <span id="s1436">And we had to surrender all the fur coats, or e-everything.</span> <span id="s1437">You could not own furs, you can own -- you cannot own the radios.</span> <span id="s1438">And that was in the first months, I think.</span> <span id="s1439">And I remember we had a very nice and friendly Pole, we sold the radio to him.</span> <span id="s1440">And he was very nice and friendly guy.</span> <span id="s1441">And it was shortly after Pearl Harbor, because we hear -- I remember hearing Pearl Harbor announcements on the radio.</span> <span id="s1442">And oh, we were so happy, not because the Pearl Harbor was bombed, but because the Americans were -- entered the war and if they entered the war they will win and we will survive and we’ll live.</span> <span id="s1443">That’s what we thought.</span> <span id="s1444">I remember even the place I stood at to -- to listen to the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: I was in front of the Venetian mirror and the radio was kitty corner from me, and I was there, and we were so amazed and then we came closer to the radio to hear it again and again, right.</span> <span id="s1447">A-An -- and then this guy came, and -- and he was telling us -- and a -- I must have -- he must have been very careful to tell us what he told us, he said we should get out.</span> <span id="s1448">We should do something to get out, because he witnessed the place where he saw a field covered with armbands.</span> <span id="s1449">And he didn’t say he -- he witnessed a killing field, he just said he witnessed seeing the armbands, and let us fill in the rest.</span> <span id="s1450">And well, the thing is, we believed him, and we didn’t want to believe him.</span> <span id="s1451">I think in bottom of our hearts we knew what he was saying, but we had no place to go and in order to go somewhere you had to have means.</span> <span id="s1452">You couldn’t just go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: You couldn’t get out of town.</span> <span id="s1455">The only way you could do is to get papers and live under another name.</span> <span id="s1456">That was the only thing you could do.</span> <span id="s1457">I-I -- I don’t think we contemplated that yet, it was too early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Were you st -- were you in the room when he came in and said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: You -- so you heard him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: I heard him.</span> <span id="s1464">I heard say that.</span> <span id="s1465">And then I er -- I told him, I -- I ask my mother, “Did you hear what he said?”</span> <span id="s1466">And my mother said, “Oh, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1467">That’s not true.”</span> <span id="s1468">See, my mother was being my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Did you still believe him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Oh, I did.</span> <span id="s1471">We all did.</span> <span id="s1472">I’m sure we did.</span> <span id="s1473">But we -- you know, what’s the use of believing?</span> <span id="s1474">Should we commit suicide right there and then?</span> <span id="s1475">What could we do?</span> <span id="s1476">I mean there was no -- there was no exit.</span> <span id="s1477">There just was no exit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: And the only way we did what we did, we used passive resistance all the way through.</span> <span id="s1480">Trying to survive and that was a passive resistance.</span> <span id="s1481">They wanted us dead, and we -- we by -- and we tried to catch onto a straw, and we did, I mean, as long as we could, we did.</span> <span id="s1482">That’s it, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: And when your father was working in -- somehow in connection with this renovation of apartments --</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: -- do you have any id -- you don’t have no idea how he got this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Well, I -- I do know.</span> <span id="s1487">Maybe he got the job through his previous job, because he probably was doing a similar job when he was doing payroll a-accounting.</span> <span id="s1488">I -- I’m just speculating on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: A-And not only that, he got -- he got me a job on that construction to work for -- I worked on construction, so I could have some papers.</span> <span id="s1491">So I would go to work, and I would mix cement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1494">I -- I -- I did different things.</span> <span id="s1495">I mixed cement.</span> <span id="s1496">I worked in officer’s quarters after they did renovation and we had to scrub the floors and do the windows.</span> <span id="s1497">And I -- I had a teammate with whom I worked, a very nice girl.</span> <span id="s1498">And I -- we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s1499">And -- and then we heard that -- y-you know, I’m skipping in time, but this is her story.</span> <span id="s1500">And her -- and I really liked her, and she has big, brown eyes and -- and two braids, brown, thick braids.</span> <span id="s1501">And a very fresh face, sh -- it was rosy cheeks.</span> <span id="s1502">And -- and I remember us sitting in this apartment on the window sill, a-and a -- and we were talking about the -- about the rumors of the -- about the rumors of the August round-up.</span> <span id="s1503">And -- and I told her that she needs to hide.</span> <span id="s1504">That’s the only way we could -- we can survive is by hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Because our papers were not good enough.</span> <span id="s1507">There was a time where he -- or whoever was in charge, invalidated all the certificates.</span> <span id="s1508">And you had to have certificates signed by certain agencies like Gestapo, or S.S., or God knows what else, or special Wehrmacht di -- divisions.</span> <span id="s1509">I have no -- I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s1510">A-And we didn’t have that, we had just, you know, local kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1511">So, I nas -- and she ask me, “Where would I hide?”</span> <span id="s1512">And I said, “I don’t know, but you have to.”</span> <span id="s1513">A-And you know, I didn’t know where I’m going to hide either, I-I had no idea, but it was in my head that unless you hide there’s no -- there is no saving yourself.</span> <span id="s1514">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1515">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1516">I don’t know what happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: I don’t have no idea what happened to her because after the August round-up we -- we no longer could be where we were, and we had to go to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: You’re talking about August ’42 round-up, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: That was August ’42.</span> <span id="s1523">Until then, then my father -- my grandfather went to look for a place, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1525">And he was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: -- and -- and he was -- I don’t know wa -- no, he wasn’t shot, I don’t know what happened to tho -- you know they -- this was -- this was so cunningly devised, because they knew that the young people wouldn’t go to look for apartments, they had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1527">So they knew the older people would go, so they left -- they closed all the entrances, wherever they were, and that -- and left that Peltewna Street entrance, and they caught everybody one by one.</span> <span id="s1528">And later on the rumors were that -- that they shot them, that they -- the rumors were that they saw naked people on the trucks, and there was a bad day, I -- I don’t know what it was -- it was -- I think it was cold -- cold days, it wa -- it -- it could have been either in the fall -- in November something, November ’41, maybe, or spring ’42.</span> <span id="s1529">Probably November ’41.</span> <span id="s1530">And -- and so it was very cold, and -- and then they said they gassed them with the carbon monoxide in the trucks, or they took them somewhere where they shot them on the hills.</span> <span id="s1531">They used to call na -- na piaski.</span> <span id="s1532">Piaski meaning sands.</span> <span id="s1533">On the sands, na piaski.</span> <span id="s1534">They killed them o-on the sands.</span> <span id="s1535">And voila, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1536">And -- and -- and then my father -- grandfather never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: And when did you hear about what people thought happened there, or what people saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Right after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Right afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Right after that, right after that, right, right.</span> <span id="s1541">Shortly after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: So that must have been very depressing for the family [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Well, it -- it was -- you couldn’t e -- the problem is you couldn’t even mourn because you had to be concerned well -- to do with -- you know, with yourself.</span> <span id="s1544">And this is when my mother went -- decided -- we decided that the -- the special permits allowed you to stay in your apartment.</span> <span id="s1545">So my mother went to the Stadthauptman’s office, the -- right to the den of the lion.</span> <span id="s1546">And wi -- she put her nice dress on, dark blue with polka dots.</span> <span id="s1547">I think she put a very nice hair from the good old days, and she had the box of chocolates.</span> <span id="s1548">And she offered -- I think my f -- my father gave her the instructions, and she probably knew from -- maybe he even got acquainted with the Stadthauptman, maybe Stadthauptman would come and supervise the -- you know, a ca -- a -- would come and supervise whatever they were doing, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1549">And -- and so my mother went, and she ask for a -- for permit.</span> <span id="s1550">I don’t know if she -- she to -- must have talked directly to him, whoever he was.</span> <span id="s1551">There are names for him, but I don’t remember what they are.</span> <span id="s1552">I mean, because there were two Stadthauptmans, so I don’t know which one it was.</span> <span id="s1553">And -- and he gave her a permit, just like that.</span> <span id="s1554">And the permit was a piece of paper, German, that you could put on your door, that gave you permission to stay, that nobody has business to -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1555">That they oh -- whoever it is that lives in the apartment has a right to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: To be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: To be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: And Stadthauptman means what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: I -- Stadthauptman, or stadt means city, and hauptman means captain.</span> <span id="s1560">Now, y -- captain of the city, you can translate it.</span> <span id="s1561">I -- I would say it’s equivalency of the mayor, you know, but -- but the mayor -- occupational kind of military -- he was in -- he was a military person, he was a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1563">So was your father living where he was working, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: My father would come and go.</span> <span id="s1565">He would come to stay in the house, and sometimes he would stay on the construction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: And during the round-ups, he would st -- if he knew about the round-ups, he would stay on the construction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: So your mother is getting a permit so the two of you are not touched, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Well, no, not just two of us, my father, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: And so that is</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: My father lives in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1572">He’s does the -- he did -- didn’t move out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: He -- he lives in the apartment, sometimes he -- he would stay overnight.</span> <span id="s1575">You know, it was easier for him if it was a -- let’s say if he worked in a -- in an apartment house, maybe he could sleep over there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1576">I don’t remember that any more, right.</span> <span id="s1577">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: But you’re s -- you’re still in the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: You sa -- we still in the same place.</span> <span id="s1580">An-and we are -- and my mother renewed it twice, and the third time she couldn’t renew it.</span> <span id="s1581">But she was so desperate, I -- and that -- the -- the secretary told her, there is one way that you could still stay.</span> <span id="s1582">If it -- if our apartment is re -- now, what is it, sequestered?</span> <span id="s1583">Taken over by -- sequestered by the army, or the army or anybody, y-you know, of German officialdom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: And if somebody’s stationed in ou-our apartment, we can stay too.</span> <span id="s1586">And so my mother didn’t know what to do, I think she went back to my father to ask what to do, and they said they would put some civil civilian workers.</span> <span id="s1587">German -- German civilian, but they would stip -- still had the uniform, the dark blue uniforms.</span> <span id="s1588">And they worked on the railroads.</span> <span id="s1589">And -- and they took one room, and stayed there maybe couple months because it was before the round-up again.</span> <span id="s1590">And just before the round-up, maybe a week before, I don’t know how long before, she said they have -- they are -- they’re shipped to the eastern front.</span> <span id="s1591">And that’s -- and they packed up the bags and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: So that means you lost the permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Yeah, we lost the permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1597">I-Is it true that in 1941, at some point you had a tutor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1599">Oh, that was so wonderful.</span> <span id="s1600">I -- I -- I was very eager to -- to learn, and my girlfriend had a -- my girlfriend formers teacher -- former teacher, was giving lessons, and -- but she was in the -- close to the ghetto, but not in the ghetto proper, just -- I think close to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1601">And she said she would tutor me.</span> <span id="s1602">And I go, I would go there -- for three months I had her.</span> <span id="s1603">And I -- I loved it, because she was very, very educated, and she taught me English, she taught me German and she taught me French.</span> <span id="s1604">She -- she was linguist.</span> <span id="s1605">And I study -- I studied all the three languages.</span> <span id="s1606">Whatever -- I didn’t learn much, but whatever I -- you know, three months, you can -- but I couldn’t pay her, so I didn’t pay her, and she taught me anyway, without -- you know, this is -- tells you how good the people were.</span> <span id="s1607">You know, she -- she said that’s okay, I’ll teach you.</span> <span id="s1608">And then there was another -- there was a -- I th -- another round-up, you know?</span> <span id="s1609">And I don’t know what we did for that round-up, maybe I was -- went to work, and it -- it -- it -- it didn’t penetrate to our area.</span> <span id="s1610">Don’t forget we were not in the ghetto proper, so -- so we didn’t -- anyway, so -- so I -- I -- I -- we -- I d -- we couldn’t go anywhere, so I didn’t go anywhere during that time.</span> <span id="s1611">Eith -- either a -- maybe I didn’t even go to work.</span> <span id="s1612">But it was not a long round-up, it was kind of -- it was a shorter round-up.</span> <span id="s1613">And by the time -- and then I went there, and my mother was so happy, because my mother provided me with a bag of farina, traded for some linen, either napkins, or bookcase -- pillowcases.</span> <span id="s1614">And I went there, and she was not there any more.</span> <span id="s1615">She was taken in that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: In that round-up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: In that -- that round-up.</span> <span id="s1618">See, you’re -- but I think that she was a heroine of -- of resistance, because we were trying to, in spite of all the terrible times we were trying to misstate it -- maintain a -- a -- a -- a -- a livi -- a -- a -- some kind of normalcy, so we wouldn’t be so desperate.</span> <span id="s1619">So this is what we did now, but then -- and then they took her.</span> <span id="s1620">And whoever they took at that ti -- whoever -- yeah -- whomever -- whomev -- whomever they took, they -- I think by then they transported to Belzec, right, and we know about Belzec.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1622">So she would have been killed immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: She would have been -- if they took her there, she would have been killed immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Unless they took her for a -- the -- the -- for selection they used to take them to Janowska camp, which was a horrid, horrid experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: So -- so that was a little devastating for you, I guess, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: I -- I -- yeah, of course, I mean, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1628">Was terrible.</span> <span id="s1629">It still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: I can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Yeah, it still is, yeah.</span> <span id="s1632">Yeah, but you know, she -- and I -- what is so terrible is I don’t remember her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: I don’t remember even her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Can you see her in your head, what she looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: I can’t even see what I er -- I can’t see her.</span> <span id="s1637">Vaguely outline, no I can’t see her.</span> <span id="s1638">But I -- I just remember how -- how generous she was, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Her spirit of generosity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Do you remember her apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Well, I -- I -- it was not much of an apartment, it probably was a room, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1643">No, I don’t re -- I remember just studying, that’s -- that I could study, yeah.</span> <span id="s1644">And I was so -- I was really -- that time, and it was at -- if you can have a happy time in the ghetto, yeah, you know, that was the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: But now you weren’t -- were you in the ghetto when [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Well, when I went to her I was in the ghetto, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1647">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Oh really, I see, so she was actually in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: I think she was probably in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1650">You know, I don’t know, the ghetto got constantly changed in borders, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: You know, they may -- they -- they fo -- they would take people and then they would make it smaller.</span> <span id="s1653">And they were changing -- you know, we didn’t know which is the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1654">Today you were in the ghetto and you bought an apartment, you think that you’re in the ghetto, and the next day the ghetto gets small and you have to move in.</span> <span id="s1655">And -- and you lost the money that you invested in this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Well, you may not remember, but if she actually was in the ghetto, how would you be able to go in and then come out again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Because the ghetto was open --</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: -- at that time.</span> <span id="s1660">The ghetto did not get closed until 19 -- until September, I don’t know which September seven, ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1662">And this -- we’re still in 1941, so she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Yeah, she was probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: -- I see, s -- so when it’s o -- cu -- because I’m not sure that people necessarily understand.</span> <span id="s1665">When it’s open, what does that actually mean, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: That mean that you can walk in and walk out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: There are no -- there’s not guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Well they -- there were also always -- I don’t know if there were guards, but you can walk in and walk out, right.</span> <span id="s1669">No guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Without a pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Yeah, the guy -- the people can -- you know, ghetto was al -- always the ga -- the ghetto area was always the target of all kinds of activities for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1672">Because they would go in, they had accumulated a Jewish population, and they could do what they pleased.</span> <span id="s1673">And -- and do, you know, they could take them out of their apartments, they could capture them on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: They could not do that in the areas that were mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1678">So that was a little different.</span> <span id="s1679">But I -- at that time -- you see, when there were no round-ups, people would try to live normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: They -- they in between -- see you could -- yeah, every time you -- they wanted contribution, the people said okay, we’ll give you the contribution, will you leave us alone?</span> <span id="s1682">The people hoped.</span> <span id="s1683">We always hoped, you hope until the end.</span> <span id="s1684">Even when the b -- the bullets raging are aimed at you, you still hope that something is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: That’s how it happens, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: We’re going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Oh great.</span> <span id="s1691">That’s good, I can blow my n -- End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: I’m -- I’m tempted to call you Janka, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Yeah, that’s nice, if you want to, that -- that sounds good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Ho -- how were you eating, what were you eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: You know what?</span> <span id="s1697">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1698">I don’t know what we were eating, I don’t know how we got our food.</span> <span id="s1699">I -- but we ate very little, and we were hungry forever.</span> <span id="s1700">What we were doing is sometimes the peasants would come to the door, and I guess my mother had a -- a treasure of linens and she would bargain [indecipherable] away for a piece of -- chunk of cheese, or a chunk of bread, or a piece of something.</span> <span id="s1701">And sometimes my father would bring something from where he was.</span> <span id="s1702">And that’s how we lived.</span> <span id="s1703">We -- or we would sell something, but the problem is we were not smart enough.</span> <span id="s1704">I don’t know, my father should have been smart enough, but we -- we didn’t -- we should have sold our furniture first, but we didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1705">Instead, we sold everything else.</span> <span id="s1706">If we had some gold that we didn’t give away, then we sold that first.</span> <span id="s1707">And this is something you don’t sell, this is something you sew into the lining of your clothes, right?</span> <span id="s1708">But we didn’t do that, and -- unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1709">And our neighbor, from across th-the -- the neighbor who provided me with the books, they left their apartment empty, but I don’t know what happened to them, really, because when we came back they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s1710">And I -- you know, and we came back to -- to our apartment after the round-up of August ’42, they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s1711">And they had a little baby, they just -- she -- the woman just gave birth to a little baby boy who was circumcised in the -- and I was scared stiff because those -- the -- we heard rumors about this particular August round-up, that -- how they -- what they were doing to little children.</span> <span id="s1712">So, as I was mounting the stairs, and the stairs were rounded up to our apartment, I was looking on the wall to see if I -- somebody did something, you know, to somebody and there would be traces of blood, or I-I didn’t even want to look, actually, but that’s -- that’s what I was fru -- that I was afraid that they were taken, I -- I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1713">They might have, or they might have escaped.</span> <span id="s1714">If they had means, they could have bought a -- some hiding place in some -- some Pole or Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1715">But they were never guaranteed to last.</span> <span id="s1716">But -- so I don’t know what happened to them either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: How about sanitary conditions?</span> <span id="s1718">Did you have running water in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yeah, we had the running water.</span> <span id="s1720">We -- we had running water in the place we lived, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Not cold and hot, of course, but running water, yeah.</span> <span id="s1723">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Just cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Cold water, right.</span> <span id="s1726">And there was gas, and I remember one time I cooked noodles for my father, and I didn’t know how to cook at all, so I -- I left them in the water, and they got very soggy.</span> <span id="s1727">And my father [indecipherable] which was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: And did you bring the food to him, at the place of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Yeah, I know, he told me -- no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: No</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: -- that was at home, my mother wasn’t there, I guess.</span> <span id="s1732">I don’t know where she was, but this is one my memory with my father, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: And the toilet is outside the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: And the toilet [indecipherable] is on the -- outside the apartment, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Now, do you think that you had some conditions that were somewhat better than in the ghetto, that they wouldn’t have had running water in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: No, in the ghetto -- not necessarily, and they would have running water in the ghetto, probably.</span> <span id="s1737">Some apartments in the ghetto were in homes, were very deluxe.</span> <span id="s1738">My mother was very unhappy with her apartment before the war.</span> <span id="s1739">She was supposed to have gotten the nice apartment, in the same building, as part of her dowry, she never da -- did, you know.</span> <span id="s1740">And so she was kept wi -- up with promises, and that never materialized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: And that was one of the many sources of her, you know, dissatisfaction and unhappiness.</span> <span id="s1743">But she was always a devoted daughter, that didn’t ever change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1745">And where is your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: My grandmother is dead now.</span> <span id="s1747">She was an old woman, so she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: She died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: In 1970’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: No, no, no, no, I don’t mean that.</span> <span id="s1751">I meant now, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Oh, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: I [indecipherable] ask where is she -- where was she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Oh yes, my grandmother, I didn’t know -- at that time, what happened was there was one round-up, and -- and -- and my mother -- I think my grandmother, I don’t know where she was, but she faced -- she was actually caught.</span> <span id="s1755">I don’t know exactly where she was caught -- where is she -- was caught near our building, but she was caught.</span> <span id="s1756">And my mother -- grandmother was a very beautiful woman, very stately woman, tall and straight as a ramrod, she was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1757">She had a wonderful presence.</span> <span id="s1758">Wer -- her head was up and high she had the white hair, and she had a beautiful face.</span> <span id="s1759">And apparently -- and I heard that story from my uncle recently, when we were in Poland.</span> <span id="s1760">I -- I didn’t hear -- I didn’t know it somehow, I don’t know how bu -- I didn’t know it, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1761">It happened so that they -- she was caught and she was told to go into -- mount into the truck.</span> <span id="s1762">And so she asked th-the man if he would kindly help her.</span> <span id="s1763">And he let her go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: He let her go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: He let her go.</span> <span id="s1766">He must have been a Ukrainian, or -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1767">And he let her go, right.</span> <span id="s1768">And then, when my aunt heard that, I think she got my grandmother out, and took her to where she placed my uncle.</span> <span id="s1769">My uncle never wore an armband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Now this is the unc --</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: And neither did my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: They never wore armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: And these are the two that had converted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: But the Germans didn’t realize, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Well, there were the Germans, yeah, the Poles didn’t realize it, it’s -- the Germans didn’t know who was who.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: You know, they -- unless a Jew had payess and a very prominent nose, or -- or -- or special garb, they wouldn’t know who were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: But the other people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: So your uncle is out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: So my uncle -- my -- I -- you know, I -- my time descriptions, I don’t know exactly why that happened, but my aunt arranged for my uncle to work in a little God-forsaken town that’s not even on the map, not a town, a little village.</span> <span id="s1784">And to work as -- either in a mill -- I think he worked in a mill, as a mi-mill supervisor.</span> <span id="s1785">And she arrange it through her acquaintance with a count who owned the local -- he owned before the war, the local -- not the local, but the villages there.</span> <span id="s1786">They were -- you know, they were part of his estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: So, what he owned was that mill, before the war, and the brewery, there was a brewery.</span> <span id="s1789">But the Germans let him manage that.</span> <span id="s1790">Of course, that wou -- became a part of the German occupational forces, and they let him manage it.</span> <span id="s1791">So he hired my uncle to manage them all.</span> <span id="s1792">So my uncle lived there, and he lived in the little village, Ponikwa it’s called, and -- and he had the little apartment that you obtained from local Protestant, or Ukrainian Protestants.</span> <span id="s1793">Not Protestants, it was something else, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Is it Jehovah’s Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Something like that.</span> <span id="s1796">I don’t know if they were Jehovah’s Witnesses, but they might have been, right, right.</span> <span id="s1797">Or maybe not Jehovah’s Witness, whatever there was at the time, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1798">And so he -- and there was a hut again.</span> <span id="s1799">And the hut -- some of the huts didn’t have real floors, they had clay floors.</span> <span id="s1800">So I’m describing this from the times I ended up being there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: But that time I didn’t even know he was there, because you know, we didn’t know what the other people were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: We just didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: But your aunt brought your grandmother to the same village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: So my -- ye-yeah.</span> <span id="s1807">I think my -- we finally sublet-ed, so we must have -- I don’t remember how it happened, but she did take her, and -- and this count, by the way, even transported my uncle -- I didn’t know -- to Ponikwa and he transported my grandmother, but not me.</span> <span id="s1808">We had another trip.</span> <span id="s1809">My aunt [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: But you didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: No, I didn’t know any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: -- that they were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: Did yo -- were you all aware of where your aunt was in Lwów?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: We didn’t know where she lived, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1820">She lived somewhere and no, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1821">Maybe my mother knew, but I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: So you were not seeing each other ee -- wh -- even when you were living in the area inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: No, no, no, we -- I don’t know if my mother met my aunt in between.</span> <span id="s1824">Maybe she did, maybe she didn’t, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: Uh-huh, you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Do y -- when you think about this, when the Germans come in ’41, through ’41, and then ’42, can you feel as if everything is getting tighter and more and more difficult, is there a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Absolutely, I mean it was like a net, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Like in a net you c-catch fish in a net, and you pull the string, and -- and it closes up on you, that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1832">What wer -- what were you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: What I was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: You’re a teenager at this time, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Yeah, I don’t know what I was like.</span> <span id="s1836">I -- I gave examples, so I was like different things in different times, I imagine.</span> <span id="s1837">You know, at that time I remember being a teenager and walking in cement, whatever it was, i-in the construction place.</span> <span id="s1838">And then, after I was -- I wash out -- I washed up, a-a-and I put my clothes on, a-and my foreman looked at me, he said, “Are you the same person?”</span> <span id="s1839">A-An-And I was still a teenager, and then I -- maybe I should be ashamed of it, but I remember I her -- I yearned for a white jacket, because that was what the girls were wearing.</span> <span id="s1840">Can you imagine this, in all this times?</span> <span id="s1841">Well anyway, I-I confess --</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: You mean that the -- you mean the Gentile girls were wearing white --</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: No, no, even Jewish girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Even -- everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: -- some Jewish girls, too, I -- I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Were wearing white jackets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: -- white jackets, was summertime.</span> <span id="s1848">That was -- must have been summer of ’41, it was shortly after they came.</span> <span id="s1849">So maybe wasn’t that tight yet.</span> <span id="s1850">So, you know what my mother did?</span> <span id="s1851">My mother had a local seamstress, and she took my father’s slacks, my father had a beautiful white slacks, and didn’t look like he would be wearing them again, so my mother had them made into a jacket for me, and I had a white jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: That’s very special, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1854">But it -- it’s just tell you that in middle of -- of horror --</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: -- there are things like that.</span> <span id="s1857">And I imagine if -- I was not the only one things like that were happening to.</span> <span id="s1858">Our problems, where we were so -- we were deprived, so we had to catch onto little things, wi -- do the things we could do that were feasible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1860">I understand that you liked to sleep a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Right, I d -- han -- yaha -- wa -- I -- you know, I liked to sleep when I could sleep, but when we ended up in the real ghetto we couldn’t sleep, because sometimes we had to move from place to place to place to place, and there was no time to sleep.</span> <span id="s1862">And by then we were covered a little with the lice, and I -- you remember my mother de-licing me, if you can call it that, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Delous -- you mean, picking --</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Di -- yeah -- I -- yeah, right, delousing, right, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: How was she doing it?</span> <span id="s1866">She was picking up the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Yes, actually, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Did she have lice also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Did you delouse her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Just her ya -- for you, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1876">I was in [indecipherable] well, I didn’t do other things either, but I didn’t tell you how we went to the ghetto yet, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: No, ar -- no, we’re not even there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: We’re not there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1883">So, in due course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: There’s a period when your -- your mother and you may also ha -- heard rumors that the -- in August of ’42 that there was going to be a huge round-up, which ended up actually being about 50,000 Jews, I think, that were rounded up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Well, at that time I give you the rumors of that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: 60,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: That was the rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: That’s the ghetto rumors, that’s what we heard in ghetto, after they -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1890">It’s not the numbers that they are quoting now, but that time it was 60,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Whatever is true we ne -- we never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: So when your mother thought this might happen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: -- she tried to get you to be hiding with Mrs. Kwiatkowska --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: That -- there are different things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: First, what the first thing that happened was actually, yeah -- I don’t know whose idea it was, might have been my idea.</span> <span id="s1901">Cause my mother initially was thinking about the maid.</span> <span id="s1902">She had a maid once, and -- and she loved her very much, and the maid loved my mother.</span> <span id="s1903">And she was thinking maybe the maid could do something.</span> <span id="s1904">But the maid, in order to -- you know, we had to have money to pay.</span> <span id="s1905">You can’t ask anybody take me in and -- and not pay.</span> <span id="s1906">And so I thought maybe Mrs. K would do that, and she happened to be cler -- close by, and the maid was not.</span> <span id="s1907">She was -- I don’t know where she was.</span> <span id="s1908">She was out of town, she was not even in the city.</span> <span id="s1909">And -- and we did hear the rumors maybe several days before.</span> <span id="s1910">Because number one, they -- they couldn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s1911">They invalidated the -- the -- at that time again, they invalidated certain passes, certain certificates.</span> <span id="s1912">And -- and what else they did, they surrounded the city.</span> <span id="s1913">All the exits of the city was Ukrainian police, and -- and German police, maybe even with Wehrmacht for what I know, because they need a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1914">So you couldn’t get out of the city, there was no way you could get out of the city.</span> <span id="s1915">So I thought maybe I could do -- we didn’t know how long it’s going to last, and -- you know?</span> <span id="s1916">So my mother had happened to have 75 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1917">So I said, “Maybe we go to Mrs. K, and maybe for a couple days I -- I can stay with her.”</span> <span id="s1918">And my mother did, a-and -- and she said yes.</span> <span id="s1919">But what happened was -- an -- and my mother said she’s going to hide under the apartment.</span> <span id="s1920">Our -- not our apartment, but maybe in the basement of our building.</span> <span id="s1921">And she did, actually, and somebody saw her.</span> <span id="s1922">But I think the person who saw her was my milk brother, I don’t know there is such a definition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Milk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Brother, tha -- this is a -- a literal translation from Polish, and what it means is that his mother nursed me.</span> <span id="s1925">She was my nanny.</span> <span id="s1926">I -- how would you call it in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: A wet nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: A wet -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1931">No, no.</span> <span id="s1932">Wet nurse?</span> <span id="s1933">Yeah, well -- but what is -- was he to me?</span> <span id="s1934">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Now that I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1937">Okay.</span> <span id="s1938">So she saw him, and I guess he didn’t turn her in.</span> <span id="s1939">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1940">I’m doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1943">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: So Mrs. K is Mrs. Kwiatkowska, right, who is the mother of your very close friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1947">Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: And so what happens is that she says yes, and my mother gives her all the money she has, and she happens to have 75 zlotys, 25 per day.</span> <span id="s1949">And that was adequate.</span> <span id="s1950">Ye -- Mrs. -- her name was Janina also, she -- she was v -- also very poor.</span> <span id="s1951">She sent her children out because she felt they could eat better in the countryside, and she alone stayed in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1952">So for her, the -- the money was good, that would give her some food to eat.</span> <span id="s1953">And she fed me very well, I really ate at her place, was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1954">She gave me a wonderful soup, and other things, too, I don’t even wo -- I remember the soup very well.</span> <span id="s1955">But what happened is after two days my mother didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1956">And so she became alarmed, because she couldn’t get stuck with a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s1957">I mean, what would she do if -- I mean, another arm -- mouth to feed, what would she do?</span> <span id="s1958">So she said -- I -- I said, “My mother,” I told her, “my mother went -- said she’s going to hide in her apartment building, in the basement.”</span> <span id="s1959">And so she went there to look for her, my mother wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1960">So she -- now -- now she got really scared, what happened?</span> <span id="s1961">So I said, “You know, the other chance is that he -- she might be in construction.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: On a construction site, where my father was.</span> <span id="s1964">And so she went there, and she found my mother, and at that time she transported me there, not -- not officially, but unofficially.</span> <span id="s1965">We took public transportation, minus the armband, and she gave me one of these certificates that you saw, I don’t know which one.</span> <span id="s1966">I don’t know which one actually, was first that I got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: So that you have papers that would say that you’re Polish, and Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1969">And then -- and the -- and the -- she found me -- we found my mother, and I wanted to give back the papers.</span> <span id="s1970">And she says, “You da -- don -- you can keep it.</span> <span id="s1971">And if somebody stops you with them, or discovers you, you say you found them in a book.”</span> <span id="s1972">It was her words.</span> <span id="s1973">You know?</span> <span id="s1974">She was a very kind person.</span> <span id="s1975">A-And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Did you look Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Well, a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: In some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Well, I was blonde.</span> <span id="s1980">I had straight hair.</span> <span id="s1981">I could -- I could have had braids, and I did have braids if I wanted to have braids.</span> <span id="s1982">And what else -- and I had green eyes.</span> <span id="s1983">So I was -- and I spoke Polish too well, as a matter of fact, right.</span> <span id="s1984">So I was a good --</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: You could pass easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: -- I -- I could pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: I don’t know if my mother could pass as well.</span> <span id="s1989">My mother was an auburn -- she wasn’t a redhead, but she was auburn.</span> <span id="s1990">She didn’t look particularly Jewish, and her Polish was superb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1992">Well, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1993">You said that after you had scarlet fever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: -- and you had lost your hair --</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: -- and it came back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Curly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: -- curly.</span> <span id="s2000">Was it now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: But then -- but then straightened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: It did straighten out, so it became more --</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Yeah, right, unfortunately --</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: -- I wanted to have it curly --</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: -- looked very cute.</span> <span id="s2008">But I have no pictures to prove it, because all pictures of that time, we destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Yeah, we destroyed on purpose because we didn’t -- I didn’t want to be caught with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: So now what happens?</span> <span id="s2012">You go -- you’re now with your mother and your father in this construction --</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Not with my father, my father’s on a different -- was a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: So where was she?</span> <span id="s2015">Where was -- where did she find your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: She -- she found my mother in the villa of super -- of -- not superintendent, but the Stadthauptman, the city commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: In his villa?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: In his villa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: What was she doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: She was hiding there.</span> <span id="s2021">It was unfinished.</span> <span id="s2022">It was under construction, but it was like an unfinished and unfinished.</span> <span id="s2023">Nobody worked there.</span> <span id="s2024">It was left unfinished to -- maybe for other teams to come finish it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: But nobody was there.</span> <span id="s2027">My father told her to -- to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Oh, your father said to go there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: -- because he thought it would be safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Because he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s2034">So th -- here’s this beautiful villa, and I don’t know where we sleep, I don’t know what we eat.</span> <span id="s2035">But I remembered the orchard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: And I sit in the orchard, and I read all day.</span> <span id="s2038">And I look at the beautiful butterflies, and -- and the flowers, and the ap -- apples.</span> <span id="s2039">I think I eat the apples that are not yet ripe, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: And you’re not afraid to be outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s2042">I was sitting in the yar -- in the orchard.</span> <span id="s2043">I remember sitting in the orchard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Do you know how many days you were there?</span> <span id="s2045">Do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: I think there -- the -- the Aktion, or the -- the round-up lasted for two weeks, but we didn’t get there until later, because I was few days here and there, so we didn’t get there until later.</span> <span id="s2047">So it was maybe 10 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: In that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: In that place.</span> <span id="s2050">And one time they came, the Stadthauptman came to look at his villa, and we were there.</span> <span id="s2051">And we were there -- as a matter of fact there was no place to hide because the closets were open.</span> <span id="s2052">They were kind of closets that were open, they weren’t finished yet, so it was like -- like this, you see?</span> <span id="s2053">I don’t know if you can see.</span> <span id="s2054">And we were against the wall here.</span> <span id="s2055">But here, this area was open.</span> <span id="s2056">They came to the room, and they came with dogs, and with children.</span> <span id="s2057">An -- an -- and I remembered the si -- remembering -- I -- I -- I sit -- I talk about it as my body is turning into a prayer against that wall, and I hold my mother’s hand.</span> <span id="s2058">And that’s how we stood as long as they were there.</span> <span id="s2059">But they didn’t see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: They didn’t see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: They didn’t see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: So they didn’t come all the way into the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: No, they just came in the front door, the dogs and all, and nobody --</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: And the dogs didn’t smell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: No.</span> <span id="s2066">If they did, they didn’t come to -- or maybe the dogs stayed outside.</span> <span id="s2067">I mean, we heard the dogs barking, but maybe they didn’t bring them to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2070">And the -- and then they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: And then they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: And they left, right.</span> <span id="s2073">Yeah, well.</span> <span id="s2074">Well, that wasn’t the end of that either.</span> <span id="s2075">So -- so we stay there, and we stay there.</span> <span id="s2076">I think somebody would come and bring us some food, I don’t know, maybe my father’s worker -- one of my father’s workers, but I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s2077">I -- I’m just speculating somebody had to bring us some food, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Right, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: -- how did we live, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: So I think somebody -- and -- and I think somebody might have told us that this is over, and that we can go home.</span> <span id="s2082">And -- and then we went home.</span> <span id="s2083">And as we went home, we were stopped.</span> <span id="s2084">And by that time I had my armband.</span> <span id="s2085">I don’t know how it happened exactly, but either I took my armband off, or I had it on and my mother covered my arm.</span> <span id="s2086">As -- and we were stopped by certain -- by -- later on we found out he was the Stadthauptman’s driver, who spoke Polish too, but he addressed us in German, of course, because my mother had her armband.</span> <span id="s2087">A-And since her armband was open, and mine is covered by her arm, because we are just -- we held on to each other, you know, for -- for -- for -- yeah, for life, actually.</span> <span id="s2088">And -- and so he -- and he asked me if I was Jewish, and I don’t know why, maybe I think before we might have said -- been thinking that maybe I should -- I should -- I -- I should get papers and go and pretend not to be Jewish, and I told him I was not.</span> <span id="s2089">And then he detached me from my mother, and he saw the arm badge.</span> <span id="s2090">And he again f -- instead of talking y-y-you know, he started talking to -- I think he started initially speaking Polish, and then, when he saw that I was Jewish, he grabbed me and started to speak German to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: And he grabbed you by the neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Yeah, and he said ha -- he -- and he accused me of lying.</span> <span id="s2093">Well, I don’t know which language any more, but he -- they -- a language that I understood.</span> <span id="s2094">And, “H -- how dare you lying to me,” he said.</span> <span id="s2095">And -- and again, he grabbed me by his -- by the throat, you know, just like they usually do, right?</span> <span id="s2096">Anyway -- and I -- somehow I lose all my fear.</span> <span id="s2097">And I looked at him, and I said, “You know, look at the -- look at the nature.</span> <span id="s2098">Look how b -- the trees are green, look how the sky is blue.</span> <span id="s2099">I am 16 years old.</span> <span id="s2100">I want to live.”</span> <span id="s2101">And really, I ma -- he must have heard me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Cause he took --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Because he let me -- he let us go.</span> <span id="s2104">He just let us go, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: And you -- you weren’t crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: No, I wasn’t crying.</span> <span id="s2107">God forbid, I was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s2108">It was like I threw the fear down in my feet.</span> <span id="s2109">I was completely composed.</span> <span id="s2110">I -- I said it like if you know you have a play, and you rehearsed for a play.</span> <span id="s2111">And I must have rehearsed it sitting in that garden there, and -- and brooding about being 16 years old and having to die.</span> <span id="s2112">You know, and I told him, and he heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: How do you account for that?</span> <span id="s2114">Since it was a frightening time, and certainly that was a frightening situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: How do I account for that?</span> <span id="s2116">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2117">The grace of God, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2118">Or -- or something, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Did you shake afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: I did.</span> <span id="s2121">I think I did, yes, I had a -- I -- I -- I was completely drained.</span> <span id="s2122">I was completely spent.</span> <span id="s2123">Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s2124">Completely, completely spent.</span> <span id="s2125">But not too long, cause we didn’t have time for that.</span> <span id="s2126">Well, anyway, but he -- he -- he heard me, and he let us go, and -- and my mother was very proud of me because she -- you know, I -- I told him the truth, I -- you see, I told him re -- no, I was trying to convince him that I would lie, why wouldn’t I lie?</span> <span id="s2127">I want to -- I’m 16 years old, I want to live.</span> <span id="s2128">Why you -- the lying is not unnatural in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2129">And he heard it.</span> <span id="s2130">And it was a beautiful day.</span> <span id="s2131">It was a beautiful day, and -- and it was in August, so you can imagine, yeah.</span> <span id="s2132">No, that -- that was the tragedy of it, too, right.</span> <span id="s2133">Because we wanted -- we wanted the skies to -- to roar, just like in King Lear, the skies were roaring.</span> <span id="s2134">But no, not one day of rain, right.</span> <span id="s2135">That’s how it happened, I na -- yeah, and that’s how they took so many people.</span> <span id="s2136">And then they took my cousin -- my cousins, my mother’s first cousin, and her husband, and who else from my family.</span> <span id="s2137">And that -- yeah, from my immediate family, that’s who they took.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: We’re going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2145">It -- it appears that you’re outside living in that place for about a couple of weeks, and then you have to go to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2146">Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: And we have -- first we go to our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: And that’s when we discovered that our apartment’s locked up, and there are two suitcases out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Two suitcases outside?</span> <span id="s2151">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2152">And -- and I still wa -- ha -- de -- am debating with myself, did my mother pack them before we left, or did the people pack them who took our apartment.</span> <span id="s2153">But I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2154">I think my mother must have packed them, and they decided in the goodness of their hearts to put it out.</span> <span id="s2155">But -- and we -- they could do it, because they have everything el -- they had everything else.</span> <span id="s2156">They had four -- two, three bedroom ap -- three up -- no, not three bedroom, but three room apartment with all the furniture, with all the -- whatever linens that were left, with everything.</span> <span id="s2157">Completely -- with books, with jewelry, some left jewelry that my mother had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: And your china?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Well, th -- the -- and the china of course, and the sterling silver, right.</span> <span id="s2160">Everything was left.</span> <span id="s2161">And my ga -- and my aunt was so angry that my mother didn’t give her the stand -- sterling silver to keep.</span> <span id="s2162">But my mother thought she had the idea that she might want to sell it.</span> <span id="s2163">And she didn’t have a chance to, and so the sterling silver went to whoever possessed our apartment.</span> <span id="s2164">The same guy who wanted to have it from the beginning.</span> <span id="s2165">He just was biding his time.</span> <span id="s2166">He knew sooner or later he would get.</span> <span id="s2167">But he was the first on the list, so he got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: And there was a list that the -- that the Germans created --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Well, a -- you know, once there was somebody on the list, and then that was it.</span> <span id="s2170">I -- unless there was somebody who was more entitled.</span> <span id="s2171">If he’s -- you -- was Ukrainian, the only other person might have wanted was the German, but the German wouldn’t want it because this was not the German area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: The German area was separate from all areas, and this is -- was an area where nobody could be, and that’s when the guy caught us.</span> <span id="s2174">My mother was trying to explain to me that my f -- him, that her husband works there.</span> <span id="s2175">But I don’t know what possessed me, I -- I -- I did lie to him about something, because he ac -- he accused me of lying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: Oh, and you asked me h-how come I did that.</span> <span id="s2178">I think I did that, now that I think of it, is because I felt that I was falsely accused.</span> <span id="s2179">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Of lying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Of lying.</span> <span id="s2182">And -- and -- and why wouldn’t -- not falsely accused, but I was legitimate in lying if I wanted to lie, was perfectly justifiable for me to lie, cause I was protecting my life.</span> <span id="s2183">And he heard it, and he probably agreed with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Or you somehow disarmed him, and he didn’t know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: I guess.</span> <span id="s2186">Could be, could be, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: So you come to the apartment, and there are two pieces of luggage --</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: -- sitting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2191">So what do we do, we take the luggage down, and I look at the walls to see if anybody got massacred in the place.</span> <span id="s2192">And -- and then we were down, and I -- don’t ask me how are we with those suitcases, we end up in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2193">And by then it’s September, and it’s Jewish holidays, high holidays.</span> <span id="s2194">And -- because they like to arrange things to celebrate Jewish holidays, and that was their way of celebration.</span> <span id="s2195">So -- so we’re -- but the -- we have no place to be, so we stay outside.</span> <span id="s2196">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: You mean in the street of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: In there was like a square.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: And there’s a bunch of, lot of, hundreds of people, we are not the only ones.</span> <span id="s2201">There are hundreds of people there.</span> <span id="s2202">So we s -- make a camp around our suitcases, and that’s where we are.</span> <span id="s2203">And -- and lo and behold, we meet one of my mother’s cousins, but not the cousins that I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s2204">Our family had a poorest -- poorer branch yet.</span> <span id="s2205">And the poorer -- the poor branch of our family was also my mother’s first cousins.</span> <span id="s2206">There were -- to start from the beginning, there -- my grandmother had two sisters.</span> <span id="s2207">One sister’s name was Regina, and she had those sons, one of whom -- she had two sons, one of whom was a -- a lawyer, one was a doctor, and two daughters.</span> <span id="s2208">And one of the daughters worked for my father.</span> <span id="s2209">And the other sister, her name was Sallah, and she had two daughters.</span> <span id="s2210">One daughter’s name was Irena -- no, sorry, Irene.</span> <span id="s2211">Or in Polish Evanna.</span> <span id="s2212">And the others -- the daughter’s name was Mina.</span> <span id="s2213">When the girls were very young, her husband, who was a teacher, died.</span> <span id="s2214">And she had -- she was a single mother with two daughters.</span> <span id="s2215">And the mothers in those days didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2216">So she didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2217">I don’t know how she lived.</span> <span id="s2218">By the time I remembered knowing her, her daughter were all -- daughters were already grown up.</span> <span id="s2219">She saw -- she send them to voke -- to a vocational school, and they became accomplished sis -- seamstresses and hand-embroiderers, and knitters, a-and in order to have a -- she send them there in order for them to have a vocation, to be able to earn a living.</span> <span id="s2220">And they lived with st -- their mother, and she lived in a poor area, and her hou -- and she lived in an apartment also didn’t have a floor.</span> <span id="s2221">But I used to love to go there because they had the wonderful handiw -- handworks, and I still remember they made beautiful little dolls for me.</span> <span id="s2222">And Mina was especially talented, and she made a doll [indecipherable] whose -- sh-she was dressed a la ma -- Marie Antoinette, in a magnificent satin dress.</span> <span id="s2223">A green satin dress with very -- with nicely fitted bodice, and with a beautiful p -- how shall I say, wig, perruque, and it was just magnificent, and a -- I always cherished that.</span> <span id="s2224">And I -- one day I f -- in -- in America, not long ago, I found myself buying a Dalton -- Royal Dalton girl in a -- in a green dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: [indecipherable] and I didn’t know how I did it, but -- until afterwards, right.</span> <span id="s2227">And so -- and -- and so I used to love to vre -- to go there, and they would let me roam in their drawers, and I would find treasures there, and my mother used to bring some money, too, for her.</span> <span id="s2228">And -- and one day there was happy news, Irene got married.</span> <span id="s2229">And she got married and she had a boy, and that was before the war.</span> <span id="s2230">And now, at the war, the boy was, I think, seven years old initially, and then he was older as the time went on.</span> <span id="s2231">And the -- the -- her husband went to war with the Poles.</span> <span id="s2232">He went -- he was in Polish army, and he never came back.</span> <span id="s2233">So she never knew what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2234">And so they were left together again.</span> <span id="s2235">The -- the mother died, I guess, she got older and she died.</span> <span id="s2236">And then -- now there were two -- two sisters, and we met them, with their girlfriend in the -- in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2237">We met them actually on that square.</span> <span id="s2238">What happened was that the sister-in-law of Irena was there too.</span> <span id="s2239">And I even stole two lima beans from her pot, because the people were cooking soup on the, you know, little pots.</span> <span id="s2240">And I was so hungry, and I saw those two lima beans, and -- you know, before they were cooked, I kind of snuck them out.</span> <span id="s2241">And what happened was -- and I th -- I forever re -- I felt guilty about it, because once the soup was cooked, she offered to each of us a plate of soup, right.</span> <span id="s2242">And so we lived there, on the square, sleeping in a square, until one day we slept on our suitcases, and we woke up the next day without them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2244">So now you really have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Yeah, except one little suitcase.</span> <span id="s2246">There is one little suitcase that’s left.</span> <span id="s2247">And -- but -- a-and the good thing is that we found my cousins, and there was a wonderful feeling, to -- you know, you cannot imagine somebody is alive.</span> <span id="s2248">Because when you so concerned you don’t even know who’s alive and who’s dead, cause the other people are dying elsewhere, and you don’t know what happened to them, for a long time, maybe never.</span> <span id="s2249">You -- you can never find out.</span> <span id="s2250">Well, so here they are.</span> <span id="s2251">And my girlfriend -- and my cousin Irene has a apartment.</span> <span id="s2252">And the apartment is in the area of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2253">So we all go there to that apartment.</span> <span id="s2254">I don’t know, I don’t see my father there.</span> <span id="s2255">He must have been staying somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2256">I -- I don’t see my father there.</span> <span id="s2257">And as we move into the apartment, a very short time after, it’s on the corner of the street, Harriman and Lokietek.</span> <span id="s2258">And it -- it faces headquarters, either of Jewish Council or the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s2259">And all of a sudden, wi -- through the window, facing it, just directly facing it, I see the S.S. loading some young Jews, pushing, and hitting, and beating, and -- Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s2260">And especially one.</span> <span id="s2261">And this Jewish policeman looks like the -- the -- his executioner.</span> <span id="s2262">He’s al -- also blonde, and he looks just like him, except he has a Jewish uniform on him.</span> <span id="s2263">And they take him somewhere, we don’t know where.</span> <span id="s2264">And they -- later on, of course, the rumors c-circulate very fast.</span> <span id="s2265">They hang him.</span> <span id="s2266">At that time -- I don’t know how true that is, but at that time the rumor said that they had to hang each other on the balconies, which are rear balconies of the buildings.</span> <span id="s2267">And it was just around the corner from where we were.</span> <span id="s2268">And so I -- we didn’t see it happen, we didn’t see it happen, and my mother didn’t take me to look afterwards, because they left them hanging for a long time.</span> <span id="s2269">And they didn’t all hang them on good ropes.</span> <span id="s2270">They hang them on thin ropes, so the ropes will break, and the people would come down and be bloody and made to go again to be rehanged.</span> <span id="s2271">And there was -- and last one of them was Dr. Landsberg, and he was the head of the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s2272">And there’s a controversy about what he did or didn’t do.</span> <span id="s2273">But at this moment -- and I’m -- I’m quoting the rumors of the ghetto at that time, that they wanted to hang him, and they hanged him on a -- on this thin rope.</span> <span id="s2274">So he was one of those who ca -- came down, and he claimed the international law that allows for mercy if somebody’s rope breaks.</span> <span id="s2275">But they only laughed at that, and -- and he -- I don’t know if he had to hang himself, or somebody hanged him.</span> <span id="s2276">I don’t know if they hanged him, or if he had to hang himself.</span> <span id="s2277">And tha -- and there were 11 people who died that way.</span> <span id="s2278">And they were left to hang and the -- the mob would come and -- and tease and -- for everybody see, but my mother -- that’s why I’m sorry, I should have gone and seen, too, then I would have been a witness.</span> <span id="s2279">But I was witness of the rest, but not of the act itself.</span> <span id="s2280">But I’m quoting the rumors of the time, not -- not whatever was given out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: So your mother went and saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: I -- she might have, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: But you’re not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: I -- I’m not sure, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: And you didn’t e -- you didn’t see them hanging at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: My mother didn’t want me to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: So, how many of you were in this apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: There were just three of us, that was a normal apartment, but we didn’t stay long, because the -- the ghetto was made completely small, and you had to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Wait a minute, is -- where is Juno and his -- his mother, the ba -- the boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Oh -- oh, she’s -- he’s with us.</span> <span id="s2295">We are together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: He’s with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Now we are t -- all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: There was -- in our party now is Mina.</span> <span id="s2300">Now, Mina has a kidney disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">A: And once a week at least, my wer-- ts -- he’s not my uncle, he’s her first cousin, and my mother’s first cousin, and I call him uncle because he was my mother’s age, or even older than my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: So he would come, he -- and he worked in that Janowska camp.</span> <span id="s2305">See, in the beginning Janowska camp was not as bad as it turned out to be later.</span> <span id="s2306">In the beginning people -- some people w-went to work there, and some -- they cou -- they have a job, and they have certificates, and they can -- a-and they can have good -- good certificates of -- you know, that would help them live, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: And my uncle was one of them.</span> <span id="s2309">And -- but then it turned out into a terrible thing, but he had the right to leave the -- he could leave the camp, and he would come to get her, and -- wherever she was, and he would give her shots to remove the water, I guess.</span> <span id="s2310">A-And -- and he would do it on regular basis.</span> <span id="s2311">He always found us, I don’t know how, but he did.</span> <span id="s2312">And the ghetto got smaller, so we had to go to another, different place.</span> <span id="s2313">And then -- from then on we went to places where -- in different places, we -- we were in different places all the time, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: So was it every few weeks you have to move, or even more often?</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: I -- yeah, I -- I think -- I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s2316">I think there was one place we stayed longer.</span> <span id="s2317">But first we went to a place, and right away they told us there’s a round-up, going to be.</span> <span id="s2318">And the place had a hiding -- hiding -- there was a hiding place, and there’s a ha -- the hiding place was again, it was like a false attic, and they would put us there, and an armoire, and some kind of pay -- piece of furniture in front of it, and a lot of people went in there, because it was a -- a pretty big place.</span> <span id="s2319">And so my mother went, we all went in there.</span> <span id="s2320">An -- our group, and the little boy, and there was a woman with a child, that was probably drugged, because it didn’t cry.</span> <span id="s2321">But somebody must have known about the hiding place, and there was a man with -- an older Jew with a beard, and -- you know.</span> <span id="s2322">And well, it didn’t take long, somebody knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s2323">We -- we were there for awhile, for a few hours I think, and as -- and then all of a sudden we heard noise, and they all -- opened the door, and we were discovered by Jewish police.</span> <span id="s2324">So they took the old man first.</span> <span id="s2325">They took my -- they tried to take my mother, but my mother resisted and they didn’t take her, they didn’t insist.</span> <span id="s2326">My mother, who had a beautiful auburn hair turned gray in no time, and so she looked older than her age.</span> <span id="s2327">And th-th -- they kind of real -- now they -- they didn’t insist at all, and I saw -- I don’t know if I saw it before or after, it had to be after we were discovered already.</span> <span id="s2328">And so they took some people, and some people th -- they -- they left us, our group, wh-whole group, and maybe even some other people, I don’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s2329">And they told us to wait because they didn’t have transportation.</span> <span id="s2330">So we were sitting there waiting, and -- through the window, and it was like a -- there was a ki -- must have been a nice apartment because it was a large window, and it was framing a landscape of snow on the -- on the ground and on the trees.</span> <span id="s2331">And I saw a Jew in a kapota, you know, this -- thi -- this garb, medieval garb, long garb, and the payess, and the black hat.</span> <span id="s2332">And the -- and a policeman roughing him up a little and taking him.</span> <span id="s2333">A-And the -- and there was no conviction in what the policeman did.</span> <span id="s2334">He didn’t do it, you could see he -- he didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s2335">And there was no resistance on the part of the man.</span> <span id="s2336">He was -- he was -- I guess reconciled to his fate.</span> <span id="s2337">And -- and he took him.</span> <span id="s2338">And he took him wherever he took him, I didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s2339">And we were waiting for long, long time, at least three hours, and I was again doing my brooding, and that time was thinking of French Revolution.</span> <span id="s2340">And I was thinking what it was like for the aristocrats.</span> <span id="s2341">I’m sorry, but that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s2342">I was thinking of French Revolution and aristocrats losing their heads, and place de la Concorde and place de Liberté or whatever it was called then, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2343">And -- and then I said, there is a difference.</span> <span id="s2344">And the difference is that before they killed them, they announced their name, and their rank, and their place in life, and everybody knew who they were.</span> <span id="s2345">And I said, if we die, nobody will know our name, the time of our death, nobody will know that we lived.</span> <span id="s2346">So not only our -- we -- we will meet death, but our life is going to be eliminated, we didn’t live.</span> <span id="s2347">And -- and I said that was a pretty nasty [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2348">I’m sure I se -- I -- I -- I shared that with my mother, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s2349">I don’t know what she said, she probably thought I was crazy.</span> <span id="s2350">Well, I was crazy, in a way.</span> <span id="s2351">Anyway, but then what happened is by the time six o’clock came, they came, the Jewish policeman came and they said the contingent was full.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: So you could go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: So we could go.</span> <span id="s2354">You know, and a -- that’s -- this is the role of p -- Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s2355">And you know, when they first started, I -- I feel sorry for them.</span> <span id="s2356">Th -- there’s a lot of talk about their brutality, but I didn’t encounter it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: And I didn’t encounter it because I know that had there been no Jewish policeman, Ukrainians, or Germans, there would be transportation.</span> <span id="s2359">They would find ways of taking us, no matter what.</span> <span id="s2360">But because it was Jewish policemen, they stopped.</span> <span id="s2361">So in a way -- but at the same time, you cannot forget the people who went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2363">Cause somebody went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Somebody went.</span> <span id="s2365">Somebody went.</span> <span id="s2366">And that was very, very -- that -- then -- then -- then it connected with guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: Well, because why me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: Oh my -- why you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2371">And -- and that -- so it -- that -- so we wa -- left this place.</span> <span id="s2372">Again the ghetto was made smaller, they took people, so you had to move somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2373">So the next place I remember, I don’t know if it was exactly the next place.</span> <span id="s2374">But the next place I remember was a hot -- in a worse neighborhood of Lwów.</span> <span id="s2375">That was a hot -- that was really what I missed.</span> <span id="s2376">There was no roads in from the [indecipherable] there was dirt, and th-the hut had I don’t know what kind of roof, no roof, was some kind of a -- what kind of roof do you use if you don’t use a roof?</span> <span id="s2377">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2378">A straw roof or something like that?</span> <span id="s2379">I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s2380">And it was a huge room, one room, and several famil -- families who are there.</span> <span id="s2381">So I remember Mina, always in bed because she’s sick.</span> <span id="s2382">And forever making her things, knitting, knitting, knitting.</span> <span id="s2383">And actually they were -- I think they were earning our money.</span> <span id="s2384">I -- they were supporting us maybe, in a way.</span> <span id="s2385">I remember that the girlfriend of I-Irene’s is there, but I don’t remember her name, so that’s why I can’t refer to her by name.</span> <span id="s2386">And -- and I think she’s mad.</span> <span id="s2387">She’s mad because my mother doesn’t let me go and -- and get food on the Aryan side, because I have Aryan looks, I mean non-Jewish looks, and why don’t I go and a -- why don’t I go and -- and do that?</span> <span id="s2388">And Irene explains to her, because Irene is a very sweet person and very understanding, she says, “You know, she wasn’t brought up that way,” she says.</span> <span id="s2389">So you know, I’m an observer now, so I’m telling you what I observed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: And -- and so I don’t do anything, I just -- I’m a parasite, but not for long.</span> <span id="s2392">My father gets me a job, and this is a great job.</span> <span id="s2393">What do I do?</span> <span id="s2394">I scrub the floors again, but I -- I am on a not Jewish team, I am on a Gentile team, and I get paid money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: I get paid money.</span> <span id="s2397">And I don’t remember this story very well, but I think that one d -- but as long as they don’t know, the -- the Polish women, that I get the same money they do, but one day I’m so greedy for the money that I don’t wait, and I take -- I -- I get the money the same time they do.</span> <span id="s2398">And I think that was it, but for three months it was glorious.</span> <span id="s2399">For three months, I think, I worked there.</span> <span id="s2400">And -- and I -- we ate, we really ate.</span> <span id="s2401">We ate lot of grain, and the grain is not good for your stomach, so it caused all kinds of problems.</span> <span id="s2402">But, you know, grain is good but not good, yo-you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s2403">So -- well, anyway, I -- I don’t want to get gory details.</span> <span id="s2404">So I would go and like the work was very hard, but I do it, and -- but one time I catch -- I took the money in presence of the women, and shortly after I got fired, because I was taking the place of a Gentile woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: And they knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Oh, they knew I Jewish, I had an armband on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Uh-huh, you were wearing the armband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2409">So I got fired, and that was the end.</span> <span id="s2410">But before that happened, or maybe shortly after that happened, there was another ra -- a round-up.</span> <span id="s2411">And here we were in that place, with lot of families, and there’s not -- and they had -- they invited one of the people in the round-up invited the -- to their shelter.</span> <span id="s2412">And the shelter was built under the road.</span> <span id="s2413">Oh yeah, but to keep the chronology straight, by that time, shortly before, my father gets taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: To the Janowska camp.</span> <span id="s2416">Before we go into the shelter, my father is taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">Q: The -- is it the second time that you’re hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">A: Before we ga -- we -- yeah, the second time we are hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: My father gets taken to the camp, right.</span> <span id="s2421">And -- and he gets taken again, going through the Peltewna Street, and he had a bag of potatoes on his back.</span> <span id="s2422">And -- I mean, and they take him.</span> <span id="s2423">And my uncle -- my uncle, my cousin tells us that, that he is in the camp.</span> <span id="s2424">But in the beginning my father was a magnificent calligrapher, he had a beautiful handwriting.</span> <span id="s2425">And I still have examples of his handwriting, and they all letters, it -- it -- it looks like the, you know, professional calligrapher.</span> <span id="s2426">And he becomes a sign painter in the camp.</span> <span id="s2427">And -- and this is a skilled job, so he’s not treated -- but my father is in his 50’s, and he -- and he has arthritis everywh -- I mean, by then he probably forgot about his arthritis, you know, somehow.</span> <span id="s2428">Mind over matter, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2429">So my father is in the camp, and now they are -- have the round-up and we have to go into a shelter.</span> <span id="s2430">But while he’s in the camp, my mother’s managing to -- to send him something.</span> <span id="s2431">And you can send people because there are other people who -- who have exit rights, so they -- the food is being brought in -- into the camp.</span> <span id="s2432">And -- so every day when we can give him piece of bread -- I know how we get it, my -- my mother gets it.</span> <span id="s2433">And -- and -- or -- or half a -- I remember th -- th -- this one I wer -- half a jar of soup.</span> <span id="s2434">Small jar like that, half of it.</span> <span id="s2435">A-And s -- and so, but we have to go into the shelter.</span> <span id="s2436">And the shelter is built underneath, and -- and this very tight.</span> <span id="s2437">And -- and there a place for seven people, and everybody sits next to the other, and there -- the one seat sits on the board on a pail and this is your bathroom.</span> <span id="s2438">And -- and we sit there, I think, for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: We’re going to have to change the tape, so hold that part of the story and we’ll do that, we’ll start right with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: All right, when we ended the last tape you were describing hiding with those seven people on those benches.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2446">So we had to stay there two -- I remember two weeks, because it’s for two weeks that we didn’t send Father anything.</span> <span id="s2447">An-An -- and I was very concerned about this, because I knew that if we don’t send him anything, he may not survive.</span> <span id="s2448">And -- and so -- and I had that dream, in which my uncle comes and tells me that Uncle Emil, or cousin Emil will tell me that he’s dead.</span> <span id="s2449">And -- and so, after this -- the -- the -- this round-up is over, we can come out, I tell that -- when it happened, when I dream about it, I tell it to my mother, and my mother’s starting to reassure me it’s only a dream.</span> <span id="s2450">Well, it really happened.</span> <span id="s2451">And not right away, we didn’t know right -- right away.</span> <span id="s2452">And in sequence, I remember one more hiding place.</span> <span id="s2453">That hiding place apparently was very safe, because nobody bothered us at all.</span> <span id="s2454">I mean, nobody knocked, nobody denounced, nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s2455">But then we had to -- again, the ghetto was made smaller, and we had to go into another apartment.</span> <span id="s2456">And we did, and again there was a round-up.</span> <span id="s2457">I don’t know if we had time to breathe, altogether.</span> <span id="s2458">And again the people were -- I -- you know, people say that the people in the ghetto were terrible, but we encountered only good will.</span> <span id="s2459">And -- and we were invited to another place to hide, and the we -- and it was very, very ingenious.</span> <span id="s2460">But we have to remember that by that time there was -- I -- I don’t think there were any p -- p -- Jewish police, because as they killed the head of the Judenrat, as they killed the head of the -- they broke up the police, there was no more Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s2461">They -- they created [indecipherable] other bodies, they created something else, but they replaced them somehow, but not as policeman.</span> <span id="s2462">And so anyway, so this was the p -- this -- why was it so ingenious?</span> <span id="s2463">Because the entrance was inside of a armoire, just like a -- you know, I don’t know if you remember, there is a tale by -- by Lewis, about some kind of fantasy that he wrote, how you enter through a -- into a fantasy land through a sleeve in a coat.</span> <span id="s2464">And we entered through a hole in the ground into the -- into the hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s2465">I mean, through the hole into the hole in the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: In the hole -- the -- the -- the hole into the armoire --</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: The hole was made inside the armoire --</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: -- moire, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: -- leading underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: And it covered only that area, I think, that -- of the armoire, more or less.</span> <span id="s2472">There was space for very few people.</span> <span id="s2473">But we went there, somebody covered the hole with the suitcase, I don’t know how many, there must have been many other shelters, because there was space for very few, but we were -- my mother and I were the two of them.</span> <span id="s2474">And so we went into this space, and -- and shortly after, we heard knocking.</span> <span id="s2475">And this time there were not Jewish police, there was S.S. and Gestapo, and they came with sticks, and they knocked all over the place.</span> <span id="s2476">They knocked in the walls, they knocked in the floor.</span> <span id="s2477">But because we were under the armoire, they did -- they couldn’t hear the hollow sound, and we survived that, too.</span> <span id="s2478">And so that was a short thing, it didn’t last too long, we didn’t stay there too long.</span> <span id="s2479">And we came out, and I remember that after this round-up again, the ghetto ga -- was made smaller.</span> <span id="s2480">But because we were hiding in that other place, and this place, Mina’s condition deteriorated.</span> <span id="s2481">And I don’t think he -- he came -- he came in time, cousin Emil, to give her shots.</span> <span id="s2482">And as we had to move -- we moved into another apartment again, and this time it was a beautiful place, a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s2483">And you could see, I -- it almost looked like somebody just left.</span> <span id="s2484">And -- and there were pictures of Swiss mountains, with prossprip -- prosperous people modeling in -- in front of beautiful chalets, and -- and all kinds of stuff put in a fancy wall, it’s -- with the finest [indecipherable] but a -- w -- nobody lives there.</span> <span id="s2485">And -- and so we -- we were not the only ones there, and I don’t think we had a bag, because my mother and I, we sat in a closet, one next to the other, with bags against the wall, and a -- and my mother felt bad that we couldn’t go to sleep.</span> <span id="s2486">I said, “As I hold your hand I’m okay.”</span> <span id="s2487">And -- and we were -- and I was sleeping sitting against the wall.</span> <span id="s2488">But when we woke up, Mina was dead.</span> <span id="s2489">She ha -- she -- they put her into a bed, but she was dead.</span> <span id="s2490">And that was very, very sad.</span> <span id="s2491">Again, we had to leave there, f -- it was just temporary and we had to move -- move out of that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: And is the child Juno, and Irena with you?</span> <span id="s2493">Or are --</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A: Yeah, we are all together, but different par -- I mean, we were together, was different place.</span> <span id="s2495">And the i -- and the poor Juno, he has distended belly because he’s hungry, we all hungry.</span> <span id="s2496">And -- and then you know, but it’s much ter -- more terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: And -- and he -- the children are quiet, they don’t even, you know, they -- they just take it.</span> <span id="s2499">And sometimes he would whine, but you know, it was hopeless, i-it -- it’s just -- I can’t imagine how hard it was on her, on -- cause it did -- it must have broken her heart.</span> <span id="s2500">It was hard on us too, to watch him suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: And -- well anyway, so Mina died, and we couldn’t even stay there to mourn or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: And just had to leave her.</span> <span id="s2505">And -- so we made a sarcophagus for her.</span> <span id="s2506">We laid her on the bed, and we gather furniture around her, just like a pyramid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: And -- and we said Kaddish, my cousin Irena, Irene said -- said Kaddish, and we had to leave.</span> <span id="s2509">And actually, before she died she probably felt that she was dying.</span> <span id="s2510">A-And she said, “I -- I -- I’m the happy one.”</span> <span id="s2511">And y-y-y-y-y-y -- Irene said that too, and she’s the happy one, after she died.</span> <span id="s2512">She -- she’s the happy one.</span> <span id="s2513">Right.</span> <span id="s2514">An-And -- and we left her.</span> <span id="s2515">And just left her as she was.</span> <span id="s2516">And then -- and that was -- that was abou -- about March ’43 by then.</span> <span id="s2517">And I still didn’t know my father is dead at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: And do you think your father was arrested in ’43, or taken into Janowska?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: In ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Yeah, he was taken when he was bringing the potatoes for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: I see, right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: And I felt terrible because I said, what if he didn’t bring the potatoes for us, he did it for us.</span> <span id="s2524">And I lived with that for years and years and years.</span> <span id="s2525">And -- and I felt guilty for my father’s death, until I realized that it wasn’t us who killed -- who killed him, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2527">Certainly not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: So how -- it takes two or three weeks before you find out, or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: I think it -- I don’t know how it is, but th-this -- first was the once hiding place, then the other, and then we had to evacuate.</span> <span id="s2531">I-It subs -- and then, after I go -- we go to the last place that Emil comes and tells my mother about Father’s death.</span> <span id="s2532">Maybe I was there, too, but I don’t remember, and my father died.</span> <span id="s2533">And I was absolutely heartbroken.</span> <span id="s2534">And at that time we were in a place where there’s no space to walk.</span> <span id="s2535">And the beds, they took somebody -- again, there were people who worked, and there were people who didn’t.</span> <span id="s2536">And allegedly there were two ghettos, ghetto A and ghetto B. Ghetto A were the people who worked, ghetto B were the illegals, who did not work.</span> <span id="s2537">And th -- you know, if you didn’t work, you had to go to Janowska or somewhere.</span> <span id="s2538">They were trying to eliminate the ghetto altogether.</span> <span id="s2539">So -- so we are on that place, and we are one of the bads, and it’s -- the day before, I find out that the father is dead.</span> <span id="s2540">And I sit on this bed all day and I cry, one of the beds.</span> <span id="s2541">And the next day at six o’clock they tell us we have to leave because the inspection is coming, and we are illegals.</span> <span id="s2542">So my mother packs up the little sack, or the billo -- suitcase that I have, and -- and -- and we go out in the square, not far from where they were.</span> <span id="s2543">And it’s six o’clock in the morning and nobody’s there.</span> <span id="s2544">So we just walk around, and walk around, and we talk and talk about what hope there is, what -- and so on and so forth, and how we going to -- to -- to -- what’s going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s2545">And will we live or will we die, I mean -- I -- and I -- I also worry that -- I feel that we still have hope, because as long as you live, th -- until the end, you hope.</span> <span id="s2546">And -- and just as we do that, there is a -- we don’t even know, but there is a fence on one side of the square.</span> <span id="s2547">And the fence is open and the people are walking out.</span> <span id="s2548">And -- and my mother puts the suitcase in my hand and say, “You go with them.</span> <span id="s2549">Go to Wanda.”</span> <span id="s2550">And I didn’t have her address, I -- I -- I’m a -- my mother, I think before, sometime before, gave me an address.</span> <span id="s2551">But I never tested it, so I didn’t know it for sure.</span> <span id="s2552">And -- and my mother pushes me out.</span> <span id="s2553">And I said, “Now how can I leave you?”</span> <span id="s2554">And my mother said, “Oh, you’ll take me out,” she says, lightly, you know, yeah, like if it was -- had nothing, t -- you know, to do that.</span> <span id="s2555">And -- and he -- she embraces this and she pushes me out, because you know, the people’s home is not very big.</span> <span id="s2556">And these are the people who go to work.</span> <span id="s2557">And before they go to work they have to be disinfected, which is a horrendous ordeal in -- in which they were beaten and -- and di -- teased, and -- and -- and humiliated terribly.</span> <span id="s2558">Ah -- but I don’t stay with them.</span> <span id="s2559">I drop my armband and I’m on the other side, and I leave them, I leave the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: And nobody catched --</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: -- and nobody is there, and I don’t know how it was there were no ga -- guards in that particular place there were no guards.</span> <span id="s2562">If there are guards, I am -- we don’t even look for them, we just -- I do whatever I do without -- just look around like this and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: And you’re still carrying your little suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: And I have my little suitcase, right.</span> <span id="s2565">And like -- I go to look for my aunt.</span> <span id="s2566">In the meantime I’m crying like a baby, with -- you know, I -- because I just left my mother.</span> <span id="s2567">It’s lucky for me there are not many s -- people on street, but all alone and ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: And the day before, you found out about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: Right, right, right.</span> <span id="s2570">Just day before, right.</span> <span id="s2571">And -- and I -- so I cry like a baby and I go and I cry, and all of a sudden I see a soldier coming up.</span> <span id="s2572">And it turns out to be an Italian soldier.</span> <span id="s2573">They would ta -- send Italian soldiers to the front.</span> <span id="s2574">And being an Italian soldier he’s very full of compassion, so he comes to me and he asks me -- I mean in Italian, r-right, w-which I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2575">Di -- di -- you know, but you don’t n-need to know, because body -- it’s body talk, or -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2576">Anyway, so he -- he tells me -- I mean, he doesn’t tell me anything, but he’s signs maybe he could help me.</span> <span id="s2577">And I say oh no, no, no, thank you very much, and I le -- and I just go.</span> <span id="s2578">And then I realize I better mind my appearance, so I stop crying, and I try to behave like everybody else.</span> <span id="s2579">And by the time it’s 7:30, I arrive to the place where should be my aunt’s apartment.</span> <span id="s2580">But it isn’t, it doesn’t look the -- she described her apartment to us as a place where there is a separate entrance.</span> <span id="s2581">And this place does not have an entrance, separate entrance.</span> <span id="s2582">So this is a wrong address, and I don’t want to knock on the door, so I stand in front for awhile, and -- and then all of a sudden the people -- there are people all around, so I can’t stand too long.</span> <span id="s2583">And I move on to the next place, and the next place looks very much like it might be her place, and I take courage in my hands, and I knock on the door.</span> <span id="s2584">And she opens the door, and she almost faints.</span> <span id="s2585">A whole -- a whole -- blood is drained from her face, she -- i-it -- it’s just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2586">I mean, it’s hard to describe.</span> <span id="s2587">And well, but she -- I enter, and she closes door behind --</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: So is the -- is the -- is it fear that’s coming over her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: -- or she’s glad to see -- she’s not glad to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: No, she’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: What comes to her mind, if I can read her mind, is what am I going to do with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2598">Well, of course.</span> <span id="s2599">And I don’t hold it against her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Me -- you were 18 at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Not yet.</span> <span id="s2603">Not quite?</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A: Wait a minute, it’s -- it’s 943, but I go -- I’m going to be 18 in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: In October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2608">So you’re pretty --</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: So I’m still --</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: You’re still 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: I’m still 17.</span> <span id="s2612">I’m very young, right.</span> <span id="s2613">That’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: Anyway, so -- so my aunt -- and then we cannot talk.</span> <span id="s2616">I cannot talk to her.</span> <span id="s2617">Now I’m completely drained, I don’t know what I’m doing, nothing.</span> <span id="s2618">I’m just -- I’m just in shock, I have to say.</span> <span id="s2619">And so my aunt knows what’s going on, so she puts me on her little couch.</span> <span id="s2620">She has a very small place.</span> <span id="s2621">There is a bed, there is a little couch with bookshelves on top.</span> <span id="s2622">There is one space that has a door that leads to the apartment next door, because she sublets from somebody.</span> <span id="s2623">And there is a door to the outside.</span> <span id="s2624">I don’t know where she does her ablutions, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2625">And so we cannot talk, because she’s not supposed to have anybody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: She has no guests, and she has to go to work.</span> <span id="s2628">So she puts a big, big bowl of grits in front of me, and I’m in seventh heaven again.</span> <span id="s2629">So I stay there all day eating grits and reading books, in the back, right.</span> <span id="s2630">So -- and then she comes back, and that goes on for three days like that.</span> <span id="s2631">And I don’t talk, and she doesn’t talk.</span> <span id="s2632">So it’s -- finally she says, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2633">I can’t keep you here.</span> <span id="s2634">I have to take you to the ghetto, and then I’ll commit suicide.”</span> <span id="s2635">And well, I think we did talk somewhat, but not much, only maybe in writing.</span> <span id="s2636">Because she did tall me -- tell me how very fearful she is of being discovered.</span> <span id="s2637">How she hears of be -- of women being tortured when they are taken for Jews, even not Jewish women.</span> <span id="s2638">And she tells me what tortures are applied.</span> <span id="s2639">Like hot -- hot and -- hot and cold, and all kinds of horrible things.</span> <span id="s2640">I mean, not all kinds.</span> <span id="s2641">Hot baths, real boiling water, and some other things.</span> <span id="s2642">Or ice water, something like that.</span> <span id="s2643">And -- and then, I finally think of the little paper that Pani Janina gave to me, and -- and I show it to her.</span> <span id="s2644">And when she looks at it, she has that glimpse of hope in her eyes.</span> <span id="s2645">And she said, “Oh, we can do something with that.”</span> <span id="s2646">And she has those two friends.</span> <span id="s2647">I -- I -- I’m kind of angry at them because I thought they should have been more helpful, but who is to know.</span> <span id="s2648">I don’t remember their names either, any more.</span> <span id="s2649">And those two friends were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: And she’s very close with them.</span> <span id="s2652">I felt that maybe they should have given more support, or maybe helped her more than they did, because she was very good to them in the times past, and wasn’t that -- like it was a new friendship.</span> <span id="s2653">So she takes the paper [indecipherable] to show it to them, and -- and she says maybe you can use it, but I tell her we can not use it without the permission of the lady, of the mother, Pani Janina, we cannot do it, because I wouldn’t want to -- if she wants to do it, she has to do it knowingly, not behind their back.</span> <span id="s2654">So they do that, they go to her and they ask her permission.</span> <span id="s2655">And I don’t see them, I’m -- oh yeah, I did see them one time, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: These two friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: I -- well, I knew them from before the war, as a child.</span> <span id="s2660">But I didn’t know them -- but I didn’t see them since then, and -- anyway -- so they go to Pani Janina and they asked her if it’s okay to use her paper, and she gives them another paper.</span> <span id="s2661">I don’t know which one is which, I -- one was extract of birth certificate, and the other is a school certificate of -- of her younger chi -- younger daughter.</span> <span id="s2662">And what happens is that -- she says yes, on the condition that I would convert if I survive.</span> <span id="s2663">And I say yes.</span> <span id="s2664">And the two friends come in to see if I -- what do I look like, if I can take a chance outside.</span> <span id="s2665">So they make my hair look like if I am a peasant, and -- which I -- I don’t -- I didn’t like my appearance at all, but -- right.</span> <span id="s2666">And then -- since then I gained weight.</span> <span id="s2667">I was fed on this grits every day, so I -- I got rounded up.</span> <span id="s2668">I-It took a -- maybe two weeks -- a week or two weeks, some like that.</span> <span id="s2669">And a -- but they tell me, but she du -- she walks like a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: What’s that supposed to mean?</span> <span id="s2671">A: Exactly what it does.</span> <span id="s2672">W-What do you think Jews looked like when they got out of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2673">Or if they escape from a train, what did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: Fearful?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2676">More dead.</span> <span id="s2677">That was fearful in every pore of their body.</span> <span id="s2678">In their eyes, in their hair.</span> <span id="s2679">That’s how fearful you are.</span> <span id="s2680">Well, anyway, and so -- well, but this could be overcome, so it wasn’t the most terrible thing.</span> <span id="s2681">And my aunt decides she’s going to take me to where my grandmother is and my uncle in Ponikwa.</span> <span id="s2682">But this time the count is not going to drive us with his car.</span> <span id="s2683">This time we are going to take a train.</span> <span id="s2684">So we take [indecipherable] and this is a -- we take the train to -- we have to take a train to Brody, and from Brody we have to go by something, by -- by cart to Ponikwa.</span> <span id="s2685">And well, the suitcase was put over our -- on the shelf above our heads, but by the time that they -- we arrived, there is no suitcase.</span> <span id="s2686">So -- and you know -- what was -- that was very dangerous, because everybody knew that the Jews when they escaped, they have nothing.</span> <span id="s2687">So if you had no clothes, that was one thing against you that was very significant.</span> <span id="s2688">But we couldn’t do noth -- anything about it, and that was the truth, they saw it.</span> <span id="s2689">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: Wh-Wh -- where were your papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">A: My papers, well wi -- on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: On you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">A: Not in -- God forbid they should have been in the suitcases.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: Oh my goodness, that would be the end.</span> <span id="s2696">No, they were on me.</span> <span id="s2697">I didn’t even think of it, but they must have been, right, cause I have them now, right.</span> <span id="s2698">So, or maybe my aunt held them.</span> <span id="s2699">I -- I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2700">That could be -- that too.</span> <span id="s2701">And so we went there, and I lived with my uncle, and -- and they introduce me as my -- the niece, the granddaughter, everything was legitimate.</span> <span id="s2702">And I lived with them.</span> <span id="s2703">And I went to the woods, looking for partisans, looking for mushrooms and looking for partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: The partisans, why are you looking for partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: Well, because I want to join them, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: Well, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2709">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: Or -- or -- or -- you know, I was looking for partisans.</span> <span id="s2711">I went to the woods, the woods were there, a-and yeah.</span> <span id="s2712">Well, it wasn’t -- it was as foolish as -- you know, it was a foolish thing, but I -- I really went deep into the woods.</span> <span id="s2713">And -- I wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: But you thought you might fight with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: Yeah, that I might find partisans.</span> <span id="s2716">But they probably were afraid of me, and they didn’t come out, if they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: They might have thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: They probably thought I was a nice little Gentile girl, and they all better stay away.</span> <span id="s2719">They were afraid to be discovered, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: And -- and I don’t know necessarily, maybe there were Jews hiding there too, because one day there was a big, big deshri, big scream on the streets, they ka -- killed the Jew, they killed the Jew, and everybody ran to ki -- to see.</span> <span id="s2722">The -- they -- they killed somebody who was probably hiding in the fields.</span> <span id="s2723">And the Ukrainian police with the dogs chased him and they killed him, but we never went to look.</span> <span id="s2724">We did -- yeah, we didn’t want to go to look because we didn’t know what our reaction would be if -- what we would say, or we would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: Are you depressed at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: I -- I -- I don’t know if you can be depressed, any more than you would be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2727">I’m not situationally depressed, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2728">I may be depressed later.</span> <span id="s2729">I don’t know, I don’t think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: Well, were you very sad when you were alone?</span> <span id="s2731">Was it very difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Oh, you mean when I di -- was I depressed when -- when this happened.</span> <span id="s2733">I was in terrible state, not depression, I was in despair, I -- it wasn’t a state of depression, it was total despair because my mother was in the ghetto and nobody was doing anything to help her.</span> <span id="s2734">And I didn’t see what they could do to help her, because we had no papers for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: So -- an -- and -- and no papers could be had without money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2738">So when you were in the village --</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: So I was in the village there from March, or -- or is it April, it’s a March April kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2741">In ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A: ’43.</span> <span id="s2743">And -- and -- and -- and my mother -- an-and my mother was in the ghetto, and nobody knew what’s going to happen, a-and -- and I didn’t have to wait long because in May they started it.</span> <span id="s2744">A-And we -- and rumors spread fast.</span> <span id="s2745">And not only that, shortly after we had a letter from my aunt’s friends, that she committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: That your aunt committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2748">And -- and they announced, a-and they -- they told us about a funeral and nobody went to the funeral, because w-we were -- I guess my uncle didn’t want to go to the funeral because he was afraid to be recognized by somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">A: And nobody went to the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: And the assumption is that she killed herself why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: Well initially I heard from my uncle, he told me she wrote a letter.</span> <span id="s2753">My aunt -- my mother gro -- wrote to her a very desperate letter from the ghetto, apparently you could write and be delivered.</span> <span id="s2754">I mean, the mail could be delivered.</span> <span id="s2755">And she wrote a desperate letter, and my aunt, since my aunt could not help her, she killed herself.</span> <span id="s2756">And then I spoke to my uncle not long ago, I mean, maybe half a year ago on the phone, and he told me that’s not the reason, that the real reason was that somebody stopped her and took her papers, and told her that they -- h-her papers are going to be verified, and they are going to come back after to her, to -- they going to return.</span> <span id="s2757">And she was afraid that she might be tortured, and she might give away our place where we are.</span> <span id="s2758">In other words, betray us under torture.</span> <span id="s2759">So she took pills.</span> <span id="s2760">An overdose, she overdosed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Q: Different story, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A: Yeah, well I -- but it’s very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: [indecipherable] yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: -- it’s -- well, it was very plausible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A: And they probably both true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q: True.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2769">They’re both true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: Maybe he -- at that time he didn’t want to scare us, because that was his -- is still under the -- it was still under the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: My grandmother, he -- they -- he -- he would have to tell my grandmother, too, and he probably didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s2776">That was her daughter, she lost two daughters, just like that.</span> <span id="s2777">A-A-And -- and shortly after, I had to work in the fields.</span> <span id="s2778">It was an ordinance that whoever didn’t work had to work either in the fields or pay some ransom or something.</span> <span id="s2779">I don’t know what happened, but I went to work in the fields.</span> <span id="s2780">Either way it was suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: If I didn’t work, was suspicious, if I pay the rents, was suspicious.</span> <span id="s2783">So I -- I went, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: You know, can you hold that thought?</span> <span id="s2785">Because we have to change the tape, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s2786">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: You were explaining that you were suspicious if you worked in the field and got money, and you were suspicious if you didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2790">So let’s talk about what you were doing when you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">A: So we ended up in that we -- we -- I guess we discussed it with my uncle and my grandmother, and we decided I should go and work.</span> <span id="s2792">And I went to work and I worked for a half day.</span> <span id="s2793">And I don’t know if it was the same day or the next day, I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: The same -- the first time that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: Worked half a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2798">I think that I -- had to be the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: Or maybe it could have been the same day.</span> <span id="s2801">If I worked in the morning I could ha -- I think I was arrested two o’clock in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: And I was arrested and put on a cart -- horse -- horse cart, right?</span> <span id="s2804">There was a seat -- there was a seat on the cart that was -- I don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s2805">How do describe a peasant means of transportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: A cart with a horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: A cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: A horse cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: I think it’s cart.</span> <span id="s2811">I think it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: It is?</span> <span id="s2813">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: Or carriage?</span> <span id="s2815">It wouldn’t be a carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: It wasn’t a carriage, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: No, that’s too --</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: -- no, oh no, it was too -- that would be too elaborate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">A: And so it was a horse cart.</span> <span id="s2821">And I was arrested by two Ukrainian policeman, and -- who were rather polite, and -- and he told me that I’m being suspected of being Jewish, and I’m taken to the Brody commis -- Commissariat of Police.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: Now this is the little town that you passed through when you first came, Brody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2824">Yeah, I think -- yes, definitely, it had to be.</span> <span id="s2825">That was the closest town to the area.</span> <span id="s2826">In the midway we are being stopped by some other Ukrainian police, and they bring a girl, about my age, dark, curly hair, looks like a gypsy.</span> <span id="s2827">Big, black eyes, very lively, making jokes, funny.</span> <span id="s2828">And they do the same thing with her, ther -- she’s being suspected of being Jewish, and now there are two of us being taken to the Brody jail.</span> <span id="s2829">And we get to the Brody jail and they put us in different cells -- different cells, and I don’t know, I remember time with people in the cell, and I remember time without people in the cell.</span> <span id="s2830">I think they put people in the cell to find out who I was.</span> <span id="s2831">You know, if I would part with some secrets or something.</span> <span id="s2832">Or just to observe.</span> <span id="s2833">And one time my uncle came, or -- and I spoke to him through the window, and I was trying to convince him that they will not deport me, I’m not going to be deported, but we didn’t speak of deportation to -- as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2834">We spoke of deportation as a Pole.</span> <span id="s2835">And -- because the jail -- the people with whom we were jailed were the people who were being readied for a departure to amer -- not to Germany, to forced labor.</span> <span id="s2836">A-And how it would work, there were the -- the organizations in -- organizations of private people in Germany who would put an order for forced labor help.</span> <span id="s2837">And they would recruit the people either by doing rafles on the streets -- rafles -- no, t -- said -- ch -- is -- that’s a French word, doing rafle.</span> <span id="s2838">Well, by closing the street and arresting anybody within.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: An aktion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: No, that wouldn’t be, because that was directed against the local population.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: Either Poles or -- I don’t know if that time they would take or ca -- Ukrainians too, because Ukrainians were actually their helpers and they were -- but they -- only in the beginning, later on turned to -- oth-otherwise.</span> <span id="s2843">But -- so there were people in that jail who were Poles being readied for transportation to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: But to us they said they going to -- they’re waiting for the Gestapo officers who are not there, and we are going to be interrogated.</span> <span id="s2846">And we sat there for at least a week.</span> <span id="s2847">And after a week they came around, they said well, since you say we are Lwów, we are going to send you to Lwów.</span> <span id="s2848">Let them interrogate you in Lwów, Lwów.</span> <span id="s2849">And they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: Now, in the meantime you have your papers with you, these papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: I have my papers, right, I showed them the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: But the -- they never interrogated me directly in Brody.</span> <span id="s2854">They -- I think they did it through subterfuge.</span> <span id="s2855">They put people in -- in the -- you know, in the jail cell to kind of figure out who you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: And apparently they didn’t come to any definite -- definitive conclusions, so they decided they don’t want to bother with it and they send us -- I don’t know what they did -- thought, but this is what I thought that they thought.</span> <span id="s2858">And they send us to -- a-and they sen-send us to Lwów.</span> <span id="s2859">And in Lwów they send us to a transit camp.</span> <span id="s2860">A transit camp was a camp that housed people that go to Germany as forced laborers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: And th-the ghetto th -- no longer exists?</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: That has nothing to do ghet -- the lot -- ghetto no longer exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: And where did they send you, it -- it’s actually in Lwów?</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: This is in Lwów and it’s also on the Janowska street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: But it’s not a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: It’s a camp, it’s a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: In that camp there are barracks, and barracks for men I think must be separate, and barracks for women.</span> <span id="s2871">And the women are -- yeah, and they -- yo -- yo -- and th-they -- and women are waiting for determination where they are going to go.</span> <span id="s2872">So they bring us straight to the commandant of the camp, in other words to the camp commanding [indecipherable] director, whatever you want to call.</span> <span id="s2873">And -- and he speaks Polish, and there’s one thing that I didn’t tell you, because I forgot, that on the little piece of paper, marking my name, there is a J, a big J, in the corner, underlined, it’s like made with a black magic marker, and we know what it stands for if it’s a J, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: For Juden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: And -- and a -- I think this paper has a copy attached to it.</span> <span id="s2878">And my friend Franka also has one like that.</span> <span id="s2879">But he doesn’t see us together again, he sees us separately.</span> <span id="s2880">And he tells me in Polish, “They tell me you are a Jewish -- you -- you are a Jew.”</span> <span id="s2881">And I say to him, “Ah, they are just teasing me.”</span> <span id="s2882">And he just dismisses it, and he said to me -- he tells me to report to the barracks.</span> <span id="s2883">So I go to the barracks and with all the bunch of all the other women.</span> <span id="s2884">And there’s already of wh -- and then I found -- I find Franka there, and we -- we sleep on the cots next to each other.</span> <span id="s2885">And there is a rumor already about some girls that look Jewish, and the whole barracks are full of rumors that those two girls are Jewish, but not us.</span> <span id="s2886">Another --</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: A second pair?</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: Yeah, another pair of girls who ap -- who apparently are attracting attention to themselves by singing.</span> <span id="s2889">They have beautiful voices, and they say they are Russians, and they are singing.</span> <span id="s2890">So I -- I mean, I -- I could -- didn’t -- I don’t know what happened, but I know that -- I don’t think that anything happened on that parti -- in the place about them, except that they were -- I knew that they got off in Erfurt when we went further.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Now, was Franka Jewish?</span> <span id="s2892">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2893">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Q: Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">A: Oh, right away.</span> <span id="s2896">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: You knew it right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: Oh yeah, we -- you know, we had th-the uncanny instinct to discover one another.</span> <span id="s2899">We did it always, even in Stuttgart when we finally got to our final destination, we discovered our -- identities of other girls in our situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">Q: Now on the papers that you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: It was that J.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: The J was put on by these Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A: Yeah, yes, and the -- but the J was only on the top copy, and on the bottom copy didn’t have it, because it didn’t go through, there was no -- anything before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: I see, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: So I don’t know how it happened, but Franka had the presence of mind, and one piece of paper was to be kept in -- in Brody and the other went with us.</span> <span id="s2906">So in her case, her piece of paper with the J stayed in Brody, and the white one went with her, and with me it was just the opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">Q: The opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">A: So, I was very scared that any time now we were escorted by -- well, we stayed in -- i-in bra -- in the -- in this camp for it -- I don’t know if a week or two weeks or something like that.</span> <span id="s2909">I think they -- probably a week.</span> <span id="s2910">I send the cards to my grandmother, to make sure they know they are being deported, which was a good sign because they wouldn’t deport Jewish -- Jewish people to Germany for labor, because the Jewish people were deported for death.</span> <span id="s2911">So that was a good sign for them, so they could, you know, could protect themselves that way.</span> <span id="s2912">And so what happened was that they put us on the train and it was a regular train, but we were escorted by soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: So you were sitting on chairs -- on benches.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">A: We were sitting on the benches.</span> <span id="s2915">And we had access to windows, but I was terribly depressed, speaking of depression.</span> <span id="s2916">I was so depressed that my unc -- my aunt gave me a little bottle with cyanide.</span> <span id="s2917">And she told me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: Your grandmother, or your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: No, my aunt, Wanda.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: Wanda, from a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2922">When I was there in her apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: She gave me a bottle of cyanide.</span> <span id="s2925">So I don’t know, I was so -- in such a despair that I decided I should -- I should do it.</span> <span id="s2926">And I was throu -- in the window, and nobody could -- I felt nobody could see me, I took it out, and I ga -- put it to -- to my mouth, and I kind of smelled it, and then I threw it.</span> <span id="s2927">And I was thinking -- I -- I think I -- I must have made a decision that if I did that, that would be a self accusation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: And -- and if -- and I wouldn’t jeopardize just me, but I’d jeopardize everybody who was with me.</span> <span id="s2930">A-And it was stupid.</span> <span id="s2931">And I still did -- I wasn’t dead, after all, and I was still going -- I was going to Germany and why do that, right?</span> <span id="s2932">So I made the right decision and I threw away the -- the what’s his name, the cyanide.</span> <span id="s2933">Who knows, might have not been good anyway, because sometimes they sold the -- you know, something that was strictly not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: -- f-falsified, right?</span> <span id="s2936">Well anyway, so we went on the train, and w-we passed through Plaszów, and we saw the people on the -- in the -- in the camp uniforms, in the depression and the -- it -- it was very hard to watch that, very, very hard.</span> <span id="s2937">And -- and then we were into Germany.</span> <span id="s2938">We passed Erfurt, we passed Trier, and we still didn’t know where we are going, I don’t think we did.</span> <span id="s2939">And we ended up in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s2940">And apparently what they did is they sent job orders that -- those were specific job orders and they already -- and we were already assigned in Lwów where we were going.</span> <span id="s2941">So my girlfriend ended up as a -- as a helper in a café house, and I was assigned to be a kitchen maid, and a -- and -- a kitchen maid in a restaurant in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: These are two different places?</span> <span id="s2943">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: Is a -- they’re both in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">Q: Right, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: But she’s in a different location, and I am different location.</span> <span id="s2947">I am in a restaurant, which is located in a suburb of Stuttgart called Feuerbach.</span> <span id="s2948">In Stuttgart, Feuerbach.</span> <span id="s2949">And she is somewhere else, I -- I don’t remember where.</span> <span id="s2950">And -- and our career as forced laborers begins in Germany.</span> <span id="s2951">And -- so there is a whole -- I get to meet my boss, my -- I have two bosses, he -- both are single, man and woman, sister and brother.</span> <span id="s2952">They own the restaurant, and they own -- I don’t know if they own the building, but they own the first -- I think first floor.</span> <span id="s2953">Their apartment’s on the first floor.</span> <span id="s2954">And this is a -- and a European first floor, so here it will be a second floor, because the restaurant is on the first floor.</span> <span id="s2955">I have a little -- a little -- I don’t know how to describe because it’s so small, a little cubicle on -- in the attic up there, all the way up on top.</span> <span id="s2956">But it’s very nice, it’s single, and -- and the roofs -- the roof was almost on my head, but it has furniture, it has nice, white furniture.</span> <span id="s2957">Has a white bed and a white dresser with a mirror, can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s2958">Wow.</span> <span id="s2959">So here I have this white dresser and a mirror, and the dresser is so close to the bed that I knocked it up right away.</span> <span id="s2960">I da -- the dresser, I mean.</span> <span id="s2961">Anyway, and what do -- that was an absolute blessing.</span> <span id="s2962">That fact, that I had it -- a room away from everybody, that was a blessing, cause if I was to work in a factory, I would have to share wu -- probably live in a camp kind of situation, in a barracks, or in dormitories with a bunch of who knows whom.</span> <span id="s2963">And it was bunch of really dangerous people, because many people who went to work in Germany, not Jewish, were people who -- who -- I -- I mean, I don’t want to denigrate anybody, but people in lower level element.</span> <span id="s2964">I-I won’t say criminals, but -- I wouldn’t go that far.</span> <span id="s2965">But it so happened -- but anyway, whoever they were, they will -- they might have recognized me.</span> <span id="s2966">Not becau -- because in -- in spite of re -- every sa -- appearances -- appearances are g -- are good for a short time, but if you live with somebody longer you -- you know the difference.</span> <span id="s2967">It’s deeper than the skin, you know, right.</span> <span id="s2968">So anyway, so that’s was my situation, my hours were from seven to 10, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">Q: Seven in the morning till 10 at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2971">With two hours of Zimmerstunden, meaning I had two hours break.</span> <span id="s2972">And that was yeah, that break was respected when -- when -- before the bombing started.</span> <span id="s2973">Once the bombing started I had to work all the way through, and I went -- I went hysterical one time, cause I -- I just couldn’t cope.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: With the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: Not with the bombing.</span> <span id="s2976">With the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: With the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: Well, because I ji -- I -- as I mentioned before, I loved my sleep.</span> <span id="s2979">And w -- and we had to go to a little shelter, and I -- I decided I only go to the shelter when the bombs are coming down.</span> <span id="s2980">Very often the alarms came in, but the -- the planes went further to another cities.</span> <span id="s2981">And -- but if the -- the alarm sounds you have to go, and I decided when I heard the bombs coming -- and you can hear it because there was a different sound, very, very specific, and those were fire bombs, they’re inflammatory bombs.</span> <span id="s2982">So you could -- that -- the swish, you could hear that.</span> <span id="s2983">And so I wouldn’t go to the shelter.</span> <span id="s2984">So my boss told me you have to go to the shelter, because they’ll say that you’re signaling the -- the -- the bombers.</span> <span id="s2985">So I had to go to the shelter, so I barely slept.</span> <span id="s2986">And my sleep was more important for me than anything else.</span> <span id="s2987">Well anyway, you know, we keep our idiosyncrasies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2990">So anyway, but in the -- sometime in between, I developed a very, very bad inflammation.</span> <span id="s2991">We had to -- when we were cooking we had to -- the potatoes were cooked on a steam, and th-there was a huge container.</span> <span id="s2992">And usually I didn’t deal with it, because it -- it was the boss, who was a man th-that did it with his sister, who was used to it, but one time I had to do it with somebody else, and the steam burned my hand.</span> <span id="s2993">I still have a scar somewhere.</span> <span id="s2994">Right, here is the scar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">A: I had the -- so the -- I got -- I was burned by this steam, and the steam -- and th-the -- the wound did get inflamed to such a degree that I had a red -- a red mark in my vein going up.</span> <span id="s2997">And so finally my boss decided that it looks too bad and send me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2998">And they -- and they operated immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s3001">And they put me asleep.</span> <span id="s3002">And wh-what was funny to me, I don’t know it has any significance at all, they made me count, and I counted in French.</span> <span id="s3003">I don’t know -- I don’t know what I could have counted, and I -- I don’t know what language I could have -- yeah, but I counted in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: Were you speaking fluent German?</span> <span id="s3005">A: By then I should have.</span> <span id="s3006">Not when I got there, certainly not.</span> <span id="s3007">But I s -- I went to look for books.</span> <span id="s3008">I went to look for culture, which was very hard, because I was a foreigner, Auslündering, so when I went to -- to the bookstores, they wouldn’t sen -- sell me anything.</span> <span id="s3009">But I think I ended up with a dictionary, and I eventually ended up some books.</span> <span id="s3010">I ended up with first volume of Dostoevsky, “Crime and Punishment,” in German, but not the second volume.</span> <span id="s3011">I ended up with another book which I loved, and a -- but I lend it to somebody and they got bumped, so the book, I never got the book back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: And what was that book?</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">A: I-I don’t remember this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">A: But it was a fantasy book and I loved it.</span> <span id="s3016">In German, everything in German, and -- and I had a free day on Friday and my girlfriend tried to get the same day, and sh-she didn’t work hard, because she was very pretty so they put on her a black uniform with a frilly apron and a little frilly lace hat -- the hat top, or something, and -- and she didn’t work too hard.</span> <span id="s3017">And -- and what she did, among other things, she had to paste the -- she had to paste the food stamps.</span> <span id="s3018">And she pasted the food stamps -- of course, the food stamps, th-they were rationed, the Germans were rationed, and it was very hard to get the meat stamps.</span> <span id="s3019">Anyway, but she -- apparently -- I don’t know whether she took it as a gift or she absconded with it, either, and she came up with a sheet of meat stamps.</span> <span id="s3020">So wow, that was so tremendous, we went and bought ourselves sausage.</span> <span id="s3021">And we sat on our -- in my bed, in my little bedroom, and we -- and we ate the sausage just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: Yeah, it was a special treat.</span> <span id="s3024">Because we had food there, but a -- you know, that wasn’t -- the best food wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">A: -- right, to be had.</span> <span id="s3027">But I was never hungry, I cannot complain.</span> <span id="s3028">And I wasn’t -- I wasn’t treated badly by my boss.</span> <span id="s3029">I had scary moments all the time because I was afraid that somebody’s going to discover my piece of paper with A on it, and every time the phone rang, the phone rang and my heart went into spins.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">Q: You mean with a J on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: With a J on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: J.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">A: Because the -- I thought that they -- it was taken to the Arbeitsant, which is a work office --</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">A: -- labor office, and that’s -- yeah, and all the way through I -- I was afraid somebody might discover it.</span> <span id="s3036">But thank God they didn’t.</span> <span id="s3037">I had a scare one day when my boss told me Herr Binder is coming, and I had a fit.</span> <span id="s3038">Cause Herr Binder is -- was the name of my father.</span> <span id="s3039">It happened to be another Herr Binder, and this was -- he was the -- he was deliverer of the so-soda vasser.</span> <span id="s3040">I mean th-the soda, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: Soda?</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">A: Bi -- bottles of soda.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: So what was -- what work did you have to do for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A: Okay, what work did I do.</span> <span id="s3047">In the morning I had to come, and I had to peel the potatoes, which wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s3048">And then I had to wash the dishes.</span> <span id="s3049">The primary job was for me to wash dishes, from -- restaurant dishes.</span> <span id="s3050">You can imagine that.</span> <span id="s3051">And that was -- there was no machines there.</span> <span id="s3052">So I stood forever, washing dishes, right.</span> <span id="s3053">I-Is that -- I had an adventure washing dishes, because there was a patron who saw me washing dishes, I guess, because every -- I was here, and here the door would open and the waitress would -- she was graceful waitress, she opened -- she had to -- maybe three sets of dishes in her -- or four sets of dishes in her arms, and she would open swinging door with her leg, and she would march in there.</span> <span id="s3054">It was a sight to see.</span> <span id="s3055">But every time she opened the door, there was the patron sitting by the -- what’s his name -- by the door, and -- and I was there, and to -- washing dishes.</span> <span id="s3056">So one day somebody send me a rose, a beautiful rose, a perfect rose.</span> <span id="s3057">It was fine, I -- I -- an-an-and the -- I -- and the guy who was smiling there, I guessed he must have been he, so I smiled back to him.</span> <span id="s3058">And lo and behold, a day after or so, somebody -- my boss, or my -- no, the waitress tells me that he wants to meet me after work.</span> <span id="s3059">And I say, “Uh-uh, I’m not meeting him.”</span> <span id="s3060">And that went on for a few days.</span> <span id="s3061">In the meantime the rose was getting more beautiful in my room up there, because it was a red rose, and the room was white, so in front of a mirror was multiplied, it was a beautiful rose.</span> <span id="s3062">Anyway, but I said no, and no, and no.</span> <span id="s3063">And then my boss came in and said, “How come you say no?</span> <span id="s3064">Why don’t you go and meet him?</span> <span id="s3065">He’s a nice guy, he send you the rose.</span> <span id="s3066">Go and meet him.”</span> <span id="s3067">I said, “No, I -- I don’t want to meet him.</span> <span id="s3068">You can tell him, I don’t want to meet him.”</span> <span id="s3069">And ended there, but I didn’t want to meet him because I didn’t want to get involved into attachments that may lead me where I don’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3072">So that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s3073">But I -- there were -- we met many girls, who were as us, on Aryan papers, on non-Jewish papers, and we met [indecipherable] anyways, all over the place, and somehow we felt each other.</span> <span id="s3074">One time we had a terrible scare.</span> <span id="s3075">We had my boss, who was very considerate, apparently, in some ways.</span> <span id="s3076">He was considerate that way, he was considerate.</span> <span id="s3077">I had to si -- wear a sign as a Pole, and he tore it off, he said, “In my house you don’t have to wear it.”</span> <span id="s3078">So I -- that meant that we can go anywhere.</span> <span id="s3079">I mean, we could go to movies.</span> <span id="s3080">And the movies was a good place to hide, I thought.</span> <span id="s3081">So on the way off, I couldn’t stay home, right?</span> <span id="s3082">So Franka and I, we would go to the movies.</span> <span id="s3083">And in the movies one time, somebody, as we were walking out, somebody knocks and touches our -- on our shoulder and say we -- and -- and two girls, and they say, “We know who you are.”</span> <span id="s3084">So that was as scary as [indecipherable], I said, “Yes, and who are we?”</span> <span id="s3085">And then we went out, and they admitted they were Jewish and we are Jewish, and -- and like this, yeah right, just like that, admitted immediately.</span> <span id="s3086">Because you know, we needed it.</span> <span id="s3087">We needed to be who we were.</span> <span id="s3088">We couldn’t -- we pretend, you know?</span> <span id="s3089">We didn’t want to pretend, we wanted feel -- we wanted to be our o -- who we were, really.</span> <span id="s3090">Right, right.</span> <span id="s3091">So we disco -- I counted 17 girls, and I’m sure there were more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">Q: 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">A: I discovered 17, yeah, 17 girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">Q: And -- and when you went to the movies, did you see newsreels and propaganda stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">A: Probably, probably.</span> <span id="s3096">I saw the propaganda stuff in the papers, terrible propaganda stuff, about the Warsaw ghetto, and terrible things, terrible things.</span> <span id="s3097">They showed women in mink coats entering, stepping over cadavers on the thing.</span> <span id="s3098">And y-you know, we know that Jews were not allowed to own furs, so how could they wear furs?</span> <span id="s3099">So, either they weren’t Jews, or they were -- I don’t know who they were, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">Q: And the kinds of movies that they show?</span> <span id="s3101">It was ger --</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">A: And the kinds of movies, they were very neutral movies, and I think that new -- movies are -- were made to kind of lift the spirit -- German spirit.</span> <span id="s3103">So we saw some comedies, we saw some -- some things I saw even more than once.</span> <span id="s3104">Some were pretty good, one had a background of pastoral symphony.</span> <span id="s3105">It was based on pastoral symphony, which was quite good.</span> <span id="s3106">And the music was good.</span> <span id="s3107">And so -- and so on, and so forth.</span> <span id="s3108">But in -- again, that -- for me that was the escape, I -- I was -- that was an ongoing theme.</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">Q: To escape, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s3111">To escape from the here and now, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">Q: Makes perfect sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3114">So that’s how -- and tha -- how it went on and on, and it -- what bothered me, yeah I did other tricks there.</span> <span id="s3115">I -- I -- I didn’t -- I wasn’t good cover up person.</span> <span id="s3116">My lady boss had a very nice voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Q: I’m going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">A: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">Q: -- hold that thought, because we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: Can you tell us where the res -- the name of the restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: I -- I believe that its name is Nordend, N-o-r-d-e-n-d.</span> <span id="s3124">And it was located on Siemmensstrasse 2.</span> <span id="s3125">Siemmen -- Siemmen Street number two.</span> <span id="s3126">And it was a corner kind of building and had -- it was like a promontory, and there were streets on each -- either side, and the front of is stood -- not exactly in front of it, but not far in front of it stood a huge shelter, and upright anti-bomb shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: What do you mean upright?</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: It was tall, with a tower.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">Q: Oh, not underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: And that’s our -- that was our air raid shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: It had very thick walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: I should hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3137">And that’s where I was supposed to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">A: -- every night when it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">Q: When they bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: Did they start bombing very quickly after you had co -- arrived in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: No, no, they started ba-bombing in the last year, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: In ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: Yeah, but we used to hear the V-einz, or maybe V-zwei -- zwei, you know the -- the V-1 and V-2, whatever, I don’t know which one was then when I was there.</span> <span id="s3146">But we -- you could hear it going to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: Yup, yup.</span> <span id="s3149">And -- and -- and not far from us, on the hills, in the vineyards -- there were vineyards -- vineyards around Stuttgart, was a fir -- flag -- flag -- you know, antof -- anti-aircraft guns, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">Q: So you were being protected from the allies, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: We were being protected from the allies, right, I -- and well, actually, I had absolutely no fear of the planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">Q: None?</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s3154">None whatso -- not only that, one time I had a bomb in -- in -- in my mansard window, in front of it, it was one of those windows that are made in the roof, I forget what they are called in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">Q: A sun -- a sun -- sun window, I mean a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: That’s a window that’s in the roof and has a dormer window, it’s called, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: Yeah, mansard in -- in French, from the name of the architect Mansard, right.</span> <span id="s3161">Anyway, so there was a bomb sitting there, the incendiary bomb.</span> <span id="s3162">So I went down my boss and I told him I have an incendiary bomb in my -- in my -- in front of my window.</span> <span id="s3163">So he went and -- he -- he went, he pulled the bi -- bomb out, and he dropped it, I don’t where he dropped it, but it was a dud, and nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">Q: Fortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: So how come you weren’t afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: Were you not afraid to die, or you just weren’t afraid of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: I was afraid to die by the hand of the Germans, but I wasn’t afraid to die by the hand of allies.</span> <span id="s3170">I wouldn’t mind if I were, it would have been okay to, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: When we ended the last tape, you were beginning to talk about one of the owners, the woman --</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: -- who had you said, a very nice voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: Yes, and her favorite aria was “Un bel di,” and she sang it in German.</span> <span id="s3175">And I couldn’t help but helping her with it.</span> <span id="s3176">And -- and it was very bizarre that the peasant girl out of God forsaken Poland can sing -- not sing, but is familiar with the “Un bel di,” right?</span> <span id="s3177">So, then my cover wasn’t very good, but by then they got used to me and they needed me so it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s3178">They didn’t pay attention whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">Q: But were you singing in a mezzo range, or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">A: I -- I -- no, I wasn’t singing, I was humming it.</span> <span id="s3181">I -- I could hum it with her.</span> <span id="s3182">She was singing, I would be humming --</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">A: -- and you know, or maybe while I was scrubbing the floor I was singing “Un bel di,” in German.</span> <span id="s3185">I mean, you could sing it in any key, right?</span> <span id="s3186">And -- and then not only that, what I did, they had a piano, so -- and oh -- lo and behold they have a -- had a piano and they had “Lorelei.”</span> <span id="s3187">And “Lorelei” is the ballad that Heine wrote to -- I think -- I don’t know whose music.</span> <span id="s3188">I -- I don’t recall whose music, but I don’t think it’s Schubert, it’s somebody else’s music.</span> <span id="s3189">And -- and of course, Heine was a Jew.</span> <span id="s3190">So I would go there, and I would play “Lorelei,” and I would sing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: So you could play the piano as well, you took lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: Oh well, now -- oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: But you didn’t talk about that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: Well, we didn’t talk about it because I was taking piano lessons before the war.</span> <span id="s3195">And even in the war -- I forgot about that -- but I was taking piano lessons until I couldn’t take them any more.</span> <span id="s3196">And I remember my last lesson with my teacher, and she told she was preparing me for the recital, and I was supposed to play “Fleurelise,” and she was very tough teacher, she was my mother’s teacher, and she was tough.</span> <span id="s3197">And -- and -- and she finally was pleased with the way I played, and she said, “Well, you’re going to play the recital.”</span> <span id="s3198">And I said, “This is my last lesson.”</span> <span id="s3199">And that was it.</span> <span id="s3200">And -- and she knew what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s3201">And that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s3202">And I never saw her again, and she probably di -- she, of course she didn’t see me either.</span> <span id="s3203">She probably thought what -- what befell me, befelled all the other people, or the other way around, right.</span> <span id="s3204">It -- what befell them befell me, right.</span> <span id="s3205">So that was the end my piano career, right.</span> <span id="s3206">I -- I’m planning to resume it after I retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">A: Yeah, I have a piano.</span> <span id="s3209">I bought a piano for that purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: Have you played at all over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: No, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: A little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: No, just a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">Q: Scale?</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3216">A scale.</span> <span id="s3217">I didn’t have time, I been doing other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3219">Well good, I’d like to hear you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">A: Well, it will take awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">Q: So you are at this restaurant for what, a year and a half, two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">A: I was there until the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: So you’re there almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">Q: It’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">A: Almost two years, yeah, right, right.</span> <span id="s3227">A-And -- and the end was getting very tough, because everybody else got bombed except us.</span> <span id="s3228">That means that we were -- yeah, and I saw that happen, because I had this room with the view, and I saw the city burn.</span> <span id="s3229">I saw Stuttgart burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: But not where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">A: No, no, no, I was on -- on the first floor, and watching Stuttgart burn.</span> <span id="s3232">Felt very good about it, I have to confess.</span> <span id="s3233">I hope not many people were killed, because I don’t wish anybody to be killed.</span> <span id="s3234">I -- I -- I hope they were all safe in the shelters.</span> <span id="s3235">But, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s3236">But I didn’t mind burning, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: Ho -- how was it for you to be with these Germans, who may have been supporting the Nazis?</span> <span id="s3238">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">A: Oh, they were supporting them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: They were supporting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: Th-They were supporting -- they were -- you know, oh we had an incident, let’s say, and that time Franka was with me, I think she was helping out because we had so much work, so she came to help us out.</span> <span id="s3242">And the window was open and we saw prisoners from camps, marching.</span> <span id="s3243">And Franka, who has a wonderful presence of mind, took a pear that was there, and threw it out of the window, right in the middle.</span> <span id="s3244">She knew right away who they were, and -- and -- and of course my boss got very mad, and he said, “These are criminals,” and closed the door -- and he closed the window, so we couldn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s3245">But he said, “You mustn’t help them, they are criminals.”</span> <span id="s3246">And that -- that was the incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: That was -- mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: Yeah, so -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">Q: Did they ever talk to you about --</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">Q: Nothing -- never.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">A: I never talked about anything with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: No.</span> <span id="s3255">Only things that pertained to -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">Q: So how tough was this to be with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">A: It was very tough.</span> <span id="s3258">It wasn’t life.</span> <span id="s3259">For me it was like being suspended in the air.</span> <span id="s3260">I -- I didn’t attach to -- didn’t want to attach to anybody cause I was afraid that I -- I was living a lie, and I didn’t want to connect with anybody and live the same lie.</span> <span id="s3261">It -- it’s been -- speaking of the representative of the other sex, an-and that’s why I didn’t want to connect with anybody, even though I knew that many of the Jewish girls had boyfriends, some of had -- some of -- the -- to whom they lied, and who were anti-Semitic, and they didn’t mind it because they were so much in love with them.</span> <span id="s3262">And I had one who had the boyfriend who was a German, and -- right.</span> <span id="s3263">So I -- I -- I didn’t want that, I didn’t want to do anything.</span> <span id="s3264">I didn’t want to complicate my life more than it was, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3266">And when you got together with these woman, who -- all of whom knew everybody was Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3268">So -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">Q: -- did you talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">A: Oh yes, we talked, we did -- we did black market with them, because since Franka had the fr -- the -- the sausage, so we traded the sausage for the -- for clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">A: Because they worked in a factory, clothes factory and they -- I don’t know what the fabric was, certainly wasn’t wool, was some synthetic fabric.</span> <span id="s3273">And so we got the fabric, and some girls worked in the -- as seamstresses, sewed us uniforms, kind of, we had skirts and tops, so we had the same outfit, skirt and a top, in dark blue.</span> <span id="s3274">That was it.</span> <span id="s3275">I mean, so we did lots of stuff like that.</span> <span id="s3276">But -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3277">And it was all cover, you know, undercover stuff, [indecipherable] kept in secret.</span> <span id="s3278">And those girls had very hard life because they were afraid that somebody will denounce them.</span> <span id="s3279">And some girls we thought were Jewish, but never admitted to it.</span> <span id="s3280">And then th-there were some men under cover, but they would never admit to it.</span> <span id="s3281">And -- because it was very hard to be a man and be in Germany.</span> <span id="s3282">My -- my husband, though, was.</span> <span id="s3283">He was in -- in forced labor too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3284">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">A: Chances are it cost his life, cause he had to spray the fields with arsenic.</span> <span id="s3286">And -- and then he ended up with leukemia, right, right.</span> <span id="s3287">So anyway, so i-it was -- for me it wasn’t living, it was being suspended, like suspended living.</span> <span id="s3288">It was just -- it’s hard to desc -- it’s not hard to describe, it was just like I -- I waited -- I waited.</span> <span id="s3289">It was living in waiting stance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: Well let me ask you what may be a strange question.</span> <span id="s3291">To think about the end of the war would mean that you would face a world without your mother, without your father, with so many relatives gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">Q: And yet facing the war -- you still face that, but possibly your own de -- I mean, it must have been a terrible conflict.</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">A: Well, y-you know, you don’t think about everything at once.</span> <span id="s3295">You think about things that are of immediate concern.</span> <span id="s3296">And my immediate concern is that nobody co -- should see my W -- my ji -- J there, and that was -- I was fearful of that, that was my main concern.</span> <span id="s3297">The other concern later on was that I was so overworked that I thought I can’t last.</span> <span id="s3298">And -- but the -- there, every d-day, war is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s3299">And I was very depressed all the way through.</span> <span id="s3300">I was extremely depressed all the way through.</span> <span id="s3301">Oh, and I have to tell you that there were some highlights.</span> <span id="s3302">I made an acquaintance of a French soldier who was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s3303">And I think he was -- I -- sometimes I would go out in the back of our place, lo and behold I saw the soldiers.</span> <span id="s3304">Oh golly, I ca -- I can -- I knew right away he was a French soldier, cause he had a French uniform.</span> <span id="s3305">Still, uniform without any epaulets or anything like that.</span> <span id="s3306">And -- and I tried my French on him, and he tried his German.</span> <span id="s3307">My French was very poor, and his German was so accented, we had a very hard time communicated.</span> <span id="s3308">But commun-municated we did, and was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s3309">And then I introduced Franka to him and he fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s3310">So there we were, the three of us, right, and that was wonderful because when the time came to leave Stuttgart he was very helpful, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">Q: So how was he a prisoner of war in the back of the restaurant?</span> <span id="s3312">Why --</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">A: Well, because they lived in a camp, but they had privileges of walking outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3315">A: Oh yeah, well how else would I have met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">A: Right?</span> <span id="s3318">I -- I mean, I didn’t question it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">Q: Just sal -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">A: -- he was there, that was it.</span> <span id="s3321">There -- there’s af -- however, however, I found out that there were many prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s3322">All prisoners were -- of war were offered freedom if they accepted to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s3323">And some officers and aristocrats did just that.</span> <span id="s3324">And then they went back to France, and they assumed their --</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: Their old --</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">A: Their old whatever that was that they were doing before the war, right, right.</span> <span id="s3327">But he was not one of them, he was a real soldier, and he did not abnegate his loyalty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3330">So anyway, he was a wa -- a very nice guy, and he helped us get away from a -- and a -- ya -- when we were liberated, it was a wonderful moment, that was one of the happiest moments after the birth of my child -- my children, right.</span> <span id="s3331">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">A: It was just -- that was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3334">For one thing, we left our places of work, and Franka’s people, who were very good to her, and who apparently appeared to be even anti-Hitler ga -- left her in charge of their apartment, which was completely empty, to -- of furniture, of everything.</span> <span id="s3335">But th -- they didn’t want to have it looted, or something, lose whatever there was, and -- and they g-gave her the keys so she could stay there.</span> <span id="s3336">So we stayed there even though -- there must have been a bed, I -- I must have slept somewhere, because the -- I assume there was th -- maybe a day or two before the -- th-the capitulation of the Germans.</span> <span id="s3337">And so we were there, and we are kind of hovering in the basement because we heard a -- a -- shots, and ov -- all of a sudden the shots stopped, and we kind of picked up, you know, to look through the window.</span> <span id="s3338">And then we saw a helmet, and that helmet didn’t look like a German helmet.</span> <span id="s3339">And we looked out, it wasn’t a German helmet, it was an American helmet sitting on a French, I don’t know, guy.</span> <span id="s3340">I don’t know how we knew what a French guy, he must have been in uniform.</span> <span id="s3341">He must have had a French uniform.</span> <span id="s3342">And that’s how we knew, and then we fell into each other’s arms and we cried.</span> <span id="s3343">We cried for a long time.</span> <span id="s3344">We really cried, and cried, and cried, yeah.</span> <span id="s3345">And then the -- and then we ga -- and -- and then Marcel came, and he had a bunch of Fr-French guys with him and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">Q: This is the POW that you met, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">A: Marcel, di -- yeah, right.</span> <span id="s3348">I -- his name was Marcel, he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s3349">I forget -- I don’t remember his last name, but I had it somewhere at home because he wrote letters to me, and he wrote -- he gave me books as mementos, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s3350">And -- and she introduced us and I have the pictures of the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">Q: These other boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">A: These other boys.</span> <span id="s3353">And these other boys were members of the resistance and they were given the privilege -- they were given the privilege to liberate -- to enter Germany, and -- and -- and they wanted to enter Germany, because France wanted to enter Germany to have some say after the war.</span> <span id="s3354">So this was General Leclerc’s, General Leclerc regiment, and -- and allegedly, I don’t know how true that is, there was a rumor that they used him because he had small tanks, and that was the area of the Black Forest, Forêt Noir, and they are going through that, and they had to have the small tanks.</span> <span id="s3355">And these guys who are resistance fighters, and they want to go to Germany to get -- to -- true revenge Oradour.</span> <span id="s3356">So their motto was, Remember Oradour.</span> <span id="s3357">Oradour was a city which was burned as a reprisal for some resistance deed, where all the people were killed, a-a-and it’s -- it’s -- and some were bur-burned alive in a church.</span> <span id="s3358">So that was their slogan.</span> <span id="s3359">But they were French so they weren’t very vengeful.</span> <span id="s3360">I -- I -- they did some tricks on the Germans.</span> <span id="s3361">I -- that’s again hearsay, I didn’t see it, but they were talking about it.</span> <span id="s3362">What they did, they took all clothes there was -- there were in the house, and they poured jelly on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">Q: It’s tough to clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">A: I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">Q: So how long before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">A: Couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">Q: Couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3368">A: Few days.</span> <span id="s3369">Very few days.</span> <span id="s3370">Why?</span> <span id="s3371">Because I didn’t know it again, the -- the allies said that they are going to put the -- all the foreigners into camps, and I had this idea that since I was not in a camp all -- all the horrible time, there was no need for me to go in a camp after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3372">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3373">A: It made absolutely no sense to me.</span> <span id="s3374">And since we had Marcel, and I want to go to Paris, and I very much want to go to Paris, cause I -- I was imbued with all this idea of that French culture -- this was really typical of Poland, because Poland had a very -- affinity with the French because of their aristocracy and because of Napoleon, who was promising them free Poland, and all that jazz, so I -- I loved everything French, and so we went to France, but it wasn’t so easy either, nothing is easy.</span> <span id="s3375">First we hitchhiked, and -- and I remember Marcel was with us for awhile, and we requisitioned a German farm.</span> <span id="s3376">We said that we needed a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">Q: A farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">A: -- requis -- a far -- not the whole farm, we went in and asked -- I -- I’m using the wrong word [indecipherable] my -- you have to forgive my English.</span> <span id="s3379">It’s -- we went to a farmer’s house, and there was a farmer’s wife, and we asked th-the -- sleeping quarters for the night, and breakfast.</span> <span id="s3380">And that’s what we got.</span> <span id="s3381">We slept on the floor, we didn’t sleep in bed, but was comfortable enough.</span> <span id="s3382">And then Marcel had to join his -- he had to be repatriated, so he had to go on his own, and we went -- we went -- we hitchhiked on American trucks.</span> <span id="s3383">There was nothing else that was going, so it had to be American trucks.</span> <span id="s3384">And the Americans were very good, and we told them we want to go home, or something, I don’t know what we told them.</span> <span id="s3385">But the -- we didn’t speak English at all, so we couldn’t speak English, so they pu -- they took us in and we -- and then where w -- they got off, we wer -- they had to stop, we got off, and we went in another truck, and th -- we ended up in a place where Marcel told us -- I -- I don’t recall exactly, but I now are just surmising, we m-met with him in a place where was a security center for the -- and I don’t know if it was on the French soil, or if it was on an American soil -- I -- not American soil, on the German soil, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s3386">It must have been on -- on the border, or something.</span> <span id="s3387">Or -- at that time there were no borders, so it didn’t really matter.</span> <span id="s3388">Because th -- now the f -- Germany had no more borders.</span> <span id="s3389">The former borders wouldn’t count.</span> <span id="s3390">So -- so we ended up in security place, and I had to go through security, and Franka had to go through security, and Marcel didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s3391">But Marcel concocted a story for me which now looking back it seemed so foolish and stupid that I can’t even imagine.</span> <span id="s3392">He decided I needed to tell them that I lived in France before the war, in my stupid little French, and -- and that I -- and my na -- and th -- and ga -- he gave me another name to sound more French.</span> <span id="s3393">I -- I was a -- a French in a -- from -- of Polish origin, and I was deported to Germany for labor.</span> <span id="s3394">Well, that opened a can of worms.</span> <span id="s3395">It was a terrible thing to do.</span> <span id="s3396">So I was introduced to this major, French major, and I explained to him what Marcel told me to do.</span> <span id="s3397">And he went to a hell and fury.</span> <span id="s3398">And he abused me using the language I could not even translate, so I don’t -- not do it.</span> <span id="s3399">And he called me all kinds of terrible names.</span> <span id="s3400">Allegedly, according to him, and I’m not sure it was hundred percent true, maybe he just wanted to scare me.</span> <span id="s3401">But he said that only volunteers, women volunteers went to Germany for forced labor, and if I were a women volunteer, then I -- and he called me whatever it is that he called me.</span> <span id="s3402">A traitor and some other juicy things.</span> <span id="s3403">And so I, being the little girl, I still was a little -- my mother’s little girl, I started to cry.</span> <span id="s3404">And I tried to re -- no, I [indecipherable] I am -- I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s3405">Ah, well that was another can of worms, you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s3406">Okay, let’s see -- look through your things.</span> <span id="s3407">And he tells me, and how come this sweater’s new and still has the mark a -- i-i-it -- it’s not -- it has a mark of the factory on it?</span> <span id="s3408">And how come -- you are a dirty Jew, you probably went and robbed the factory, you robbed and plundered.</span> <span id="s3409">You sale juive.</span> <span id="s3410">I -- I don’t think it stopped my tears, right.</span> <span id="s3411">An-And you know, the thing was that in order to have the sweater, in order to have whatever I had, my rucksack, I traded it, the dress that my aunt gave me, because I felt that I didn’t have room for it.</span> <span id="s3412">And I traded everything I had to have this nap -- knapsack and this sweater, and things that I could wear and put in the knapsack.</span> <span id="s3413">So I felt that -- and there’s one thing I could never stand and I still cannot stand is injustice.</span> <span id="s3414">So I thought that was the most, the -- the biggest injustice that to -- to -- to be faced with this bloody major, and I felt I was back in France of -- what was the name of the guy who was innocently accused of betrayal?</span> <span id="s3415">Well, I -- I know his name, but doesn’t come to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">Q: In “Les Miserables”?</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">A: No, no, no, no Miserables, that’s a real story.</span> <span id="s3418">That was a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">Q: Oh, Dreyfus.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: Dreyfus, right, and [indecipherable] Dreyfus, right.</span> <span id="s3421">They accused him of something they pin on him and I felt just like Dreyfus.</span> <span id="s3422">Right, well, you know, I always make connections to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">A: -- to -- to either history or literature.</span> <span id="s3425">Anyway, so here I was.</span> <span id="s3426">And then I had my -- but I had my diary, I kept a diary, I wish I had this diary, would have been lot of fun.</span> <span id="s3427">But I don’t know what happened to it, I think became -- it’s -- it got destroyed in France, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s3428">I should have taken it with me, too bad.</span> <span id="s3429">Anyway, so -- and they -- the next day, they gave me my -- everything back.</span> <span id="s3430">They were very polite, and they gave me papers, the papers that you ha -- that I have in my catalog of things that still -- that remained.</span> <span id="s3431">And -- a-and there we -- there was a pass to go to France, to Paris, and to enter France legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">Q: And Franka, how did she get in?</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">A: And Franka, since she didn’t speak French, my dear friend Marcel made her a Dutch girl.</span> <span id="s3434">Now he could have made me a Dutch girl too, but he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: And why was it okay for a Dutch girl to go to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: Because she was on her way to her country.</span> <span id="s3437">But as a Jewish girl, I was on -- also on my way somewhere, and I was trying to explain to him, I want to go to America to ga -- join the -- the -- my father’s brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">A: So that was my -- and they wouldn’t want strangers to stay in France, they fought it tooth and nail.</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">Q: So you had a diary that you wrote when, during these two years at the restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">A: It was a very [indecipherable] diary, but it was a diary, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3446">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">A: Yeah, it was written in Polish as far as I knew.</span> <span id="s3448">Right, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">Q: Yeah, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3450">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3451">Q: Although that would have been danger -- no, no, they knew you were Polish, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3452">A: Yeah, it was pro -- written --</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: And they couldn’t read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">A: -- in Polish and they couldn’t read it anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">A: -- and they were too busy with whatever was happening to them, they wouldn’t -- and -- and I -- oh, and I went back to my boss to get my papers, because I had papers, and he gave me the papers, and he was furious.</span> <span id="s3457">He said that the -- the girls are -- you see while we were working there, I recommended some of the Jewish girls for him to help because he needed so much help.</span></p> <p><span id="s3458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3459">A: All the other restaurants were bombed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">A: And those girls allegedly came and ask him for money, and -- and -- and he fi -- yeah, and he si -- thought that I set him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">Q: Okay, we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">Beginning Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3468">Janka, how long -- is it okay if I call you Janka?</span> <span id="s3469">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">A: Go -- by all means, if you wish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">Q: How long were you in Paris before you left with Francesca, or Franka?</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">A: Well, I -- not too long.</span> <span id="s3473">Y -- we arrived, let’s say in May -- oh yes, we arrived exactly on May eighth, because this was a day of victory --</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">A: -- and we witnessed the day of victory in Paris, and Paris was dancing.</span> <span id="s3476">So we stayed there, we were taken -- first we spend a -- a couple of days at the Hotel Lutetia, which was a hote -- a place where they gathered all the refugees coming out of the war zone, and they were giving them medical reviews, and then they was disposing wi-with them accordingly to their state of health.</span> <span id="s3477">And since our health appeared -- appeared to them adequate, they referred us to the Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s3478">And the Jewish agencies, since we were young girls, they were -- we were treated as adolescents, and we report to something called pension en famille, but it wasn’t really -- it was a converted synagogue, and we -- in [indecipherable] converted offices in we -- that was very -- it was very primitive because they were converted offices, and we spend there some time.</span> <span id="s3479">And then they made plans for us, as far as our future was concerned.</span> <span id="s3480">I was to -- to become a stenodactylo, meaning I had to -- I was -- since I didn’t have a high school diploma and I couldn’t have a high school diploma, I could not have the permission to study, so I had to learn a vocation, that vocation would have been -- that was the easiest thing, since I knew a little French, so I would go to the French school, and then I would become a stenodactylo.</span> <span id="s3481">And that was the plan.</span> <span id="s3482">And Franka had to learn French first, and then decide what to do later.</span> <span id="s3483">But in the meantime Franka came up with the idea that we -- she has to look for her family, she cannot start new life without finishing the old one, which was -- it kind of made sense.</span> <span id="s3484">And it made sense to me too, except it was so hard to get to Paris, and to leave it, we would have to do some horrendous things.</span> <span id="s3485">Because there were no trains, nothing.</span> <span id="s3486">The only trains that went back to Poland were the Russian convoys, with the rush -- Russian nationals, because there was a secret agreement at Yalta between the heads of states, that all the western heads of states relinquish the rights to Russian nationals, and will turn them over to the -- to the Russian authorities.</span> <span id="s3487">And that’s what they were doing.</span> <span id="s3488">And I witnessed them doing that in the movie theaters, where they would stand by the door, and watch for the patrons to leave, and they would round up whomever -- whoever they thought were a nash -- a Russian national, which wasn’t too hard to detect.</span> <span id="s3489">And the only way we could do that -- and then they would put them in a special camp that was organized in a place called Beauregard, near Paris, and once you entered this it was Russian territory, it was just like entering a ma -- a Russian embassy, and there you were in a Russian soil, that was it.</span> <span id="s3490">So the only way to ma -- Franka had some Russian friends, so she found that out.</span> <span id="s3491">She spoke Russian, her family was of Russian origin.</span> <span id="s3492">And she spoke Russian very well, I -- I just had little Russian.</span> <span id="s3493">And she decided that we can enter that camp, and -- and then they will transport us east.</span> <span id="s3494">I don’t know, we didn’t have it -- the idea that we might go to Lwów, but I -- I -- I don’t think ba -- well, anyway, by the time when we le -- we went to that camp, that was a very primitive camp, with barracks, and there were a lot of people, and they all under lock and key, of course.</span> <span id="s3495">That was a locked up camp with, I think, guards all over the place.</span> <span id="s3496">And I think we spend some time there, maybe week, maybe more, maybe less.</span> <span id="s3497">And we left in July, I think, or maybe late June, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3498">I can look at the dates in the papers.</span> <span id="s3499">And -- and we left on a transport, and it was -- i-it was not a regular train, it was a train tha -- for deportees, so it was not a -- it was freight train, in -- in other words.</span> <span id="s3500">And I think we sl-slept on the gr -- on the -- on something made from straw kind of things, inside the train.</span> <span id="s3501">And the train would stop very often because to let go other trains that had priority.</span> <span id="s3502">And one such train was a prison train, with -- guarded by soldiers, with -- with bars in the little windows, and right away the rumors spread that this train was a prison train for the followers of General Vlasov, and General Vlasov was a -- a traitor to the war effort because he -- even though he was originally a very heroic general, he surrendered to Germans and he promised them to fight on their side, along -- and he recruited lot of former prisoners of war, maybe mostly Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s3503">And they fought -- I don’t if they fought it, maybe -- I don’t know if Germans really trusted them to fight or not.</span> <span id="s3504">But, a-at the end of the war, they were considered the biggest traitors ever, both to the Russians, and to Americans, because they were fighting on the side of Germany.</span> <span id="s3505">But General Vlasov was thinking in terms of saving his skin, and so he pushed to be on the -- under the western side -- western sphere of influence.</span> <span id="s3506">So, he surrendered, somewhere in Czechoslovakia, or maybe not in Czechoslovakia, I think near Czechoslovakia, to the American forces, with his whole army.</span> <span id="s3507">And he was taken prisoner, but he didn’t know about that arrangement of yal -- at Yalta, and he was immediately turned over -- I don’t know if -- how immediately, but very soon turned over to the Soviet authorities, and he was sent to Russia and shot.</span> <span id="s3508">And I -- I don’t know if he was tried or not, if he -- you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3509">They -- they did show trials in Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s3510">But the soldiers, the soldiers we saw there, and the soldiers were making jokes with us, who would -- you know, we surrounded, surrounded the train right away, and there were young faces in these barred windows, and they were smiling and laughing.</span> <span id="s3511">A-And -- and we all knew they were going to their death.</span> <span id="s3512">And I didn’t know, you know, we knew they were going to their death, but what kind of death they met, I didn’t know then, until now I saw it on the internet.</span> <span id="s3513">And it -- there is a -- and there is a -- a report of somebody who witnessed, an engineer, American engineer in the army who witnessed their surrender, and he relates that they were shot immediately after they disembarked in -- on the -- out of the trains in Russia.</span> <span id="s3514">They were sho -- o-on -- on arrival.</span> <span id="s3515">They were shot on arrival.</span> <span id="s3516">A-And we met that -- we met them on the way.</span> <span id="s3517">And we had to wait because their train had the priority.</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">Q: So, in your going back to Poland, you were going to go with Franka, you were not going to go to find your own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">A: Well, I sure did if I could find them, because my uncle -- my uncle worked in Rzeszów before the war, that was the little town.</span> <span id="s3520">So I thought I’ll got to Rzeszów, and maybe he was there, maybe he came back and I could find him in Rzeszów because that’s where his job was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">A: And nobody knew there he was a Jew there, because he worked there as a Pole, so he could go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">A: So, I -- I-I -- I ha -- I -- I think we got off in Kraków, and we got the permit.</span> <span id="s3525">As refugees they would give us a per -- we got -- we escaped from the train, it wasn’t so easy, we -- we brood about it, and thought about it, and -- and we got off the train by subterfuge, telling we wanted water, or something, or food.</span> <span id="s3526">And we never got back on, and our papers went with the train, the main papers that we had.</span> <span id="s3527">And our name went -- yeah, they went to Russia.</span> <span id="s3528">So -- but we had some other papers still left, so we used them.</span> <span id="s3529">And I think we did anyway.</span> <span id="s3530">I -- you know, I don’t remember what I had or I didn’t have, I certainly acquire a lot -- acquired -- upon arrival, we acquired a lot of papers.</span> <span id="s3531">So -- and I know that if we went to Poland, we went under name of Franka and Helena, or Helene, because that -- otherwise would have been foolish.</span> <span id="s3532">So -- so a-an -- so we got off at Kraków, we got a pass to Rzeszów, we got off in Rzeszów.</span> <span id="s3533">When we got off -- I mean, we escaped from the train in Kraków, and we got a permit -- free train ride to Rzeszów, o-on the base that we were refugees looking for family, which was true.</span> <span id="s3534">We got to Rzeszów, and we walked in the situation after a pogrom.</span> <span id="s3535">And because there was a pogrom in there -- Rzeszów couple days before, and we learned that, and the streets were kind of empty, we didn’t know what to do, but we came across a person, we decided he must be Jewish.</span> <span id="s3536">So we stopped him, a-and he turned -- it turned out right, and right away he took us to the place, to a Jewish community, and they said people are in hiding now because we have the situation, and later on I found out that some people were even killed, but at that time he didn’t tell us that.</span> <span id="s3537">But I found out from other people who were there, and you know, and that’s why I knew about the -- I mean, from another point of view.</span> <span id="s3538">But in the meantime he -- he told us that -- well, i-if we want to get out, we should get out as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s3539">I don’t know if it was he who told us that the borders to Czechoslovakia, we have to get out from Czechoslova -- through Czechoslovakia, might be closed, and he send us to Kraków, back to Kraków, and he gave us money, and he prepared our -- I-I don’t know if we got a train pass, or we paid for the train, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s3540">They ro -- and they received us just like we were their brothers, or their family; very, very well.</span> <span id="s3541">And they put us on the train, and we ended up in Kraków, only this time to stay, not to leave.</span> <span id="s3542">And the first thing we did, we went to the Jewish Community Center, and we started looking for people who registered there, because whoever came, registered there.</span> <span id="s3543">And he told us that, he told us go to -- go to [indecipherable] to examine the registry of survivors.</span> <span id="s3544">And lo and behold I found my girlfriend from Lwów.</span> <span id="s3545">The girl, with whom I went to school, the high school, was my best friend in high school.</span> <span id="s3546">So of course I located her, and I told her our situation, w -- she -- she told me her story.</span> <span id="s3547">She had a tragic story too, convoluted tragic story.</span> <span id="s3548">Her fa -- her brother went to -- volunteered to fight for -- in Warsaw ghetto -- not Warsaw ghetto, the Polish Warsaw uprising, and he -- he fought as a Pole, and he was taken prisoner and he died in somewhere, of his wounds.</span> <span id="s3549">And so she was now alone, and -- and her parents got killed in the round-ups of Lwów, and she says she wants to go with us.</span> <span id="s3550">So there were three of us now.</span> <span id="s3551">So -- but she knew a lot of people in Kraków, so she arranged for passes to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s3552">The reason we went to Czechoslova -- we were going to Czechoslovakia is to -- to go to the French embassy.</span> <span id="s3553">And the fren -- the closest was in Prague, so we went to Prague.</span> <span id="s3554">So we -- so she secured the -- she helped us secure the passes, and that time was still passes and the wonder was, that was one of the last passes every issued at that time.</span> <span id="s3555">Later on the borders were closed, there were no passes, and whoever wanted to get out had to do it illegally.</span> <span id="s3556">So the people were crossing to Germany instead of Prague.</span> <span id="s3557">And we went -- I think we went through Katowice, because I have a pass to Katowice.</span> <span id="s3558">So he -- we went through Katowice to Prague.</span> <span id="s3559">Of course Prague is the mo -- one of the most beautiful cities of Europe, and we were there for three days and I’m s -- kind of speeding it up, so we did see some places and things.</span> <span id="s3560">But when we went to the French embassy we presented our case, and -- and -- and without any ado, they granted the per -- as the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3561">We told them that we -- we were in France and we came back to look for the family, and we didn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s3562">So since we didn’t find any -- in Rzeszów I didn’t find anybody, my be -- my uncle wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s3563">And I checked with -- they had registry there too, the local registry and he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s3564">And -- and so I went -- so we told him the truth, and he said yes of course, and he said com -- that there’s a plane tomorrow that leaves for Paris.</span> <span id="s3565">Be on it.</span> <span id="s3566">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3567">Q: And so you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">A: On a plane, on a military plane, repatriated to Paris, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">Q: And where did you go when you were in Paris?</span> <span id="s3570">Did you all three stick together?</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">A: Oh yes, absolutely, and the thing is that we didn’t come in under our own name.</span> <span id="s3572">All our papers were issued in -- in the fa -- under false names.</span> <span id="s3573">So I -- I was very lucky, sometime after, but not right away after, maybe months after, I got to talk to a very -- very thoughtful and helpful social worker, and I told her that I -- here I have my real name, but I live under this false name, and -- and she said, “But you can change it, I can arrange it for you.”</span> <span id="s3574">And she did, without any pro -- I don’t know how she did it, but she did it, and I got my own name back.</span> <span id="s3575">But Franka stayed on her other name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3576">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3578">And -- and my girlfriend, who escaped from a Belzec train --</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">A: -- you heard that girl -- my girlfriend from high school, her name was Maryla.</span> <span id="s3581">She -- she yeah, she had horrendous stories to tell.</span> <span id="s3582">And she escaped from the train, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s3583">And she was with us, and we shared for awhile, we -- now they treated us as adults, no more children, and they put us first on the d -- Ambrose Thomas for a short time, and then they transferred us to -- to Guy Patin.</span> <span id="s3584">And then the -- we start a new life again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3585">Q: And is -- is that where you were interviewed by David Boder?</span></p> <p><span id="s3586">A: Yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3587">Q: Let me -- I just want to play the first minute of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3588">A: By all means.</span></p> <p><span id="s3589">Q: Have you -- have you heard your tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s3590">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3591">Q: You have heard the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3592">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3594">A: I have a very nice voice on that tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3595">Q: Yes, you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">A: Very nice, girlish voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">Q: Let’s see if we can -- I can just -- [plays excerpt from audiotape]</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">Q: We won’t go through your story [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">A: That’s good.</span> <span id="s3600">But you -- the quality of your tape is much better than any of mine.</span> <span id="s3601">The one I have is terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">Q: Well then, we’ll provide you with --</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">A: Yeah, that would be nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">Q: -- a good -- a good quality tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">A: And if you could send me a good copy, too, that would be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3606">Q: Yeah, yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3607">A: A -- a written copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">Q: Of the transcript?</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">A: Because mine is very --</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">A: -- all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">Q: So how is it that you came to be interviewed by this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">A: Well, I think he needed for -- h-he wanted to interview survivors, and where is a better place than in a survivor home [indecipherable] of the local agency, right?</span> <span id="s3616">So he found th-there many candidates.</span> <span id="s3617">I don’t know how many people were actually interviewed on g -- on Guy Patin, because most of them were survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">Q: So a number of you were interviewed?</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">A: Oh yes, many people were interviewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">Q: Do you remember being interviewed [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3621">A: Not at all, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3622">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3623">A: Not at all, not -- and I was so amazed when my friend informed me that my interview was on the internet, and I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3624">I said, “That’s not possible, I was never interviewed.”</span> <span id="s3625">And well -- and I -- and yes, and I went to the internet, and I saw my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">Q: And you saw the transcript?</span> <span id="s3627">A: I didn’t see the transcript.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">A: I don’t know how I -- I wa -- I -- actually -- I don’t know, I had a di -- I -- I wasn’t that well versed in the computer use that I could do that.</span> <span id="s3630">So I think I notified then my son, and he located it right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3632">A: He locate it and he provided me with everything.</span> <span id="s3633">And I told him I’m not happy with having it published without my permission, and he located whoever was in charge of that project, and -- and they removed my name --</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">A: -- and my tape and everything off the internet.</span> <span id="s3636">And this is how it wasn’t listed.</span> <span id="s3637">It was not listed on the list of interviewees.</span></p> <p><span id="s3638">Q: Right, it was taken off.</span></p> <p><span id="s3639">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3640">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3641">So you have absolutely no recollection of him, or the day or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s3642">A: I have ver -- I -- I can have only recollection by listening to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3643">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3644">A: -- to my voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3645">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3646">A: Because that I recognize.</span> <span id="s3647">And I vaguely recognize his too, because I apparently had -- and I remembered -- and I have a very neg -- a rather negative memory of the interview, because I felt myself be very vulnerable during that interview.</span> <span id="s3648">Not -- yeah, right, for some reason, I don’t know, just listening to the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3649">Q: That you were feeling vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s3650">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3651">Q: And did you feel he was being aggressive, or you were afraid of him, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3652">A: I think I was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s3653">I think he must have reminded me of my Professor Napadiewich.</span> <span id="s3654">He had that way about him, you know, like condescending way of a professor speaking down to his student.</span> <span id="s3655">Not an American professor, but a German professor, or the Russian professor from before the war, which is a different thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3656">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3657">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3658">Q: Then that’s what you -- that’s what you recall feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">A: Yeah, so I felt -- I -- I don’t know how I felt.</span> <span id="s3660">Tha -- in the beginning I felt co-comfortable, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">A: When I started answering question, but later on I think it changes.</span> <span id="s3663">But I -- I gave him the answers as best I could, I guess, and that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3664">Q: What do you think about him now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3665">A: Well, I think he -- I have a great admiration for him.</span> <span id="s3666">I don’t know h-how he was -- what motivated him to do what he did.</span> <span id="s3667">Whether it was a desire for a -- for fame, or was it a genuine research of a scientist.</span> <span id="s3668">I mean, ger -- and was the general desire of a scientist to want to research?</span> <span id="s3669">Probably both, I imagine it was both.</span></p> <p><span id="s3670">Q: He didn’t become famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">A: Well he didn’t, but -- but he is famous now, and he will be even more famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3672">Q: Yes, that may be -- that may be true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3673">A: He was -- it will be posthumous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3674">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3675">A: His fame is going to be posthumous, but -- but he certainly earned it.</span> <span id="s3676">He definitely earned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3677">Q: What did you think when you listened to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s3678">A: Well, I didn’t like myself too well --</span></p> <p><span id="s3679">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">A: -- on that tape.</span> <span id="s3681">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3682">I -- I -- I -- maybe because it’s different to look at it from the hindsight.</span> <span id="s3683">I felt that I -- I -- I shouldn’t be fee-feeling so -- so vulnerable, that I should have been more responsive to his questions in terms of if I didn’t like him I could have said so.</span> <span id="s3684">But I didn’t, I -- it seemed to me that I wanted to tell him what he wanted to hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">Q: You wanted to please him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3688">A: I -- I have this feeling now.</span> <span id="s3689">I don’t know if it’s -- I -- I -- that too may be incorrect, but that’s what I think.</span> <span id="s3690">But you know, it’s all speculation, you specu -- you speculate about things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3693">So -- and I may be wrong even now, but I have a great admiration for him, a -- y -- y -- you know, nobody wanted to hear our stories, nobody did, really.</span> <span id="s3694">A-And th-the reception we received, it was a wonderful reception -- I wa -- that I received in France, both times.</span> <span id="s3695">It was an inconditional positive regard, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s3696">But nobody really wanted to hear anything.</span> <span id="s3697">Even I came to America, none of my -- except for one cousin, none of my family wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s3698">You see, you s -- said, it’s okay, you are here now, and -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">Q: Forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3701">You know, and things like that you don’t forget, you li -- not [indecipherable] you don’t forget it, but your unconscious mind doesn’t forget them, and it -- and it takes over.</span> <span id="s3702">A-And I ne -- and you make decisions, and you make -- and you live according to what you’re -- yeah, what’s dictated to you by your past, in a way.</span> <span id="s3703">So I would never forget it.</span> <span id="s3704">So he was the only one who had determination, and the stamina a-and interest to hear that.</span> <span id="s3705">So I -- I think he deserves all the credit he -- he should get.</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">A: Right, that’s how I feel about him now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3708">Q: You -- you know at least one other woman that she has spoken with --</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">A: I -- I -- maybe more than one, I me -- I -- I’m -- I’m just suspecting the other one, too --</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">A: -- but I am not hundred percent sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3712">Q: But Bella, who lives outside of Paris --</span></p> <p><span id="s3713">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3714">Q: -- you’ve spoken to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3716">Q: Does she have a clear recollection about him, or is she as vague as you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s3717">A: According to -- well, I -- I know that that may be -- Elizabeth knows that, maybe, cause I don’t know, I have no idea, cause I didn’t speak to Bella about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3719">A: I only called her to find out if she’s willing to give the information on request of Mr. Marziali.</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3721">From NPR, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3722">A: Right, and so I checked with Sara because otherwise I wouldn’t give him her address.</span></p> <p><span id="s3723">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3724">A: And I assumed since she was willing to do it for him, that she would do it certainly for the Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s3725">Q: Museum, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">A: So that’s how it came about.</span> <span id="s3727">And for some reason, I -- I have this uncanny suspicion that the other w-woman might be another interviewee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">A: And -- and -- you, of course, this has to be checked out.</span> <span id="s3730">I could have maybe even call her sometime, but you know, I haven’t been in touch with her for a long time.</span> <span id="s3731">Maybe last year I called them.</span> <span id="s3732">Every so often I call them up to make sure that they are still around.</span></p> <p><span id="s3733">Q: Did Franka stay in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s3734">A: I don’t know what happened to Franka.</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">Q: You don’t know what happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s3736">A: Franka disappeared from my --</span></p> <p><span id="s3737">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3738">A: -- horizon completely, yeah.</span> <span id="s3739">What happened with her was that our -- our ways parted.</span> <span id="s3740">Maybe not unnecesar -- not necessarily on a positive note, but not an unfriendly note either.</span></p> <p><span id="s3741">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3742">A: I mean, not completely, we didn’t break up or anything.</span> <span id="s3743">But she -- I heard -- the last I heard of her that she was adopted by a na -- a Canadian family and was going to be brought --</span></p> <p><span id="s3744">Q: To Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s3745">A: -- to Canada.</span> <span id="s3746">And I looked at her all over the place on the internet and in Canada.</span> <span id="s3747">I looked on -- for her under her assumed name, and under her real name that I knew.</span> <span id="s3748">And of course, if she got married I wouldn’t know her married name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3750">A: So, and we didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3751">Q: So you lost her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3752">A: I lost her, right.</span> <span id="s3753">And she lost me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3754">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3755">Hm.</span> <span id="s3756">Well, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s3757">Okay, we’re going to change the tape, and let -- End of Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3758">Beginning Tape 11</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">Q: I said I had one question, but actually I have a couple.</span> <span id="s3760">First of all, what was Franka, or Francesca’s full name?</span> <span id="s3761">Her real name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3762">A: Her real name was Roberta Lander.</span> <span id="s3763">L-a-n-d-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">Q: That’s her real name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">A: Her real name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">Q: And what was her fake name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: And her fake name was Francziszka Markowiecka.</span></p> <p><span id="s3768">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s3769">Where did she come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s3770">A: Well, I think h-her family was of Russian origin, but they ended up in Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s3771">Q: Sounds ita -- doesn’t sound Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3772">A: Lander?</span></p> <p><span id="s3773">Q: Lander.</span></p> <p><span id="s3774">A: Well, that sounds Jewish and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3775">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3776">A: It’s like Binder.</span></p> <p><span id="s3777">Q: Right, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3778">A: And you can have Binders in Germany, and there are Binders in French --</span></p> <p><span id="s3779">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3780">A: -- and in French there’s even a street called an impasse binder somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s3781">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3782">Just shows my ignorance, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3783">A: Well -- I -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">Q: What about the other woman who you met in Lwów who came back with you -- oh, you met in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">A: Oh, well sh -- sh -- I don’t know her assumed name, but her real name was Maryla Bardach, B-a-r-d-a-c-h, and I don’t know what was her -- I don’t remember her married name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3786">Q: Nice names.</span></p> <p><span id="s3787">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3788">No, nice Jewish names, you know.</span> <span id="s3789">They -- but they were Jewish in Poland, and you had a Jewish name, that was the end of you.</span> <span id="s3790">I mean, not [indecipherable] of you, but of your career, of your anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3791">Q: Do -- do you have a sense of how this history has affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">A: I’m working on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3793">Q: You’re working on it.</span> <span id="s3794">It’s hard, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3795">A: I’m working on it.</span> <span id="s3796">Yeah, I -- I still don’t know how to ge -- explain it.</span> <span id="s3797">I think that if I was formed by the Holocaust, I was much more formed by my upbringing and my genes.</span> <span id="s3798">And -- and the Holocaust may have reinforced what was there, or destroyed some of it.</span> <span id="s3799">I ya --</span></p> <p><span id="s3800">Q: Did it make you cynical in any way about human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s3801">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3802">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3803">No, no, and I -- didn’t destroy my faith either.</span></p> <p><span id="s3804">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">A: No, no, because I explain it -- I have my explanation which I find comfortable.</span> <span id="s3806">And explanation is that we are all endowed with free will, and with a sense of responsibility and -- and we are responsible for our acts.</span> <span id="s3807">So I don’t blame God for what the Germans did.</span> <span id="s3808">And I’m very, very existentialistic about it.</span> <span id="s3809">And maybe Jean-Paul Sartre had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s3810">And -- and I feel that everybody’s responsible for his acts, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s3811">And hiding behind God, or demon, it’s not going to -- or devil, or Satan, it’s not going to do any good.</span> <span id="s3812">That’s my philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3813">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3814">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">Q: So I know that you married in 1950 or ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">A: ’51, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">Q: Came to the United States in ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">Q: You married a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3820">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">Q: Who unfortunately passed away in ’77.</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">A: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s3823">And he was in Warsaw, he -- he participate in the resistance, he smuggled papers, and probably arms too, but I’m not hundred percent sure about that.</span> <span id="s3824">And -- and he went through Pawiak, which is a horrendous prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">A: And he got himself deported to Germany, which was -- which was absolutely a tour de force, because for a Jew, get deported to Germany, it’s just incredible.</span> <span id="s3827">They had to go through the physical examination, and -- and if you were circumcised, that was obvious, but he sometime -- somehow -- somehow he managed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3829">A: And he was farmed out to the farmers.</span> <span id="s3830">So he worked on the f -- on the farms.</span> <span id="s3831">And he had very hard work, he had to work very hard.</span> <span id="s3832">And -- and w -- at the liberation he was actually working for the American army, and -- as an interpreter, and he had a di -- uniform and a motorcycle, and -- and he was happy, I guess.</span> <span id="s3833">Until he got to Belgium, and it was the -- this particular, seventh, I think, regiment, was transferred to Belgium, and in Belgium they -- they no longer needed a German translator.</span> <span id="s3834">So he was -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s3835">He was let go.</span> <span id="s3836">And -- but he happened to have family in France, so he went to France, to Paris.</span> <span id="s3837">And one day he needed some information in the office near the Guy Patin.</span> <span id="s3838">And he knocked on the door of the office, there was some writing on the wall -- on the door, but I don’t remember what it was, and lo and behold there were three girls there instead of the office.</span> <span id="s3839">And so he -- he was very happy, and he told his story and the girls told their story and he started dating one of the girls, but it wasn’t me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3842">And it was my girlfriend Maryla, and well, I -- I -- but I -- I guess she wanted to get married, and he wasn’t ready to get married.</span> <span id="s3843">And he found a good listener in me, so I took her place.</span> <span id="s3844">And that’s how it went.</span> <span id="s3845">And we got married in 1951.</span> <span id="s3846">No, 1950.</span> <span id="s3847">Right, 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s3848">Q: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s3849">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3850">Q: And your first son was born in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s3851">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3852">And then we -- I -- I had to -- you know, in the meantime I applied to American embassy for the visa, and for my visa, I don’t know why I had to wait so long.</span> <span id="s3853">I didn’t obtain the visa until six years of wait, and I found many people who got it much sooner, out of Germany.</span> <span id="s3854">They -- they got the visa sooner than I got it in Paris.</span> <span id="s3855">And then my -- I got my -- since I got married, my husband had to get a visa, too.</span> <span id="s3856">So it took another two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3857">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">A: So we waited there for eight years.</span> <span id="s3859">We wait there -- we didn’t wait --</span></p> <p><span id="s3860">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s3861">A: -- waiting in Paris is okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3862">Q: Is -- is -- is not so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3863">A: Right, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3864">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3865">And you had two more children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3866">A: But I had -- they were born in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3867">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">Q: So you have three boys, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3870">A: I have three boys, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3871">Q: And we will stay here all night if we go into your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s3872">A: Right, absolutely, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">Q: -- all -- all time --</span></p> <p><span id="s3874">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3875">Q: -- and so maybe we’ll do that at another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3877">Q: But I want to thank you.</span> <span id="s3878">I can’t tell you how much I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">A: Oh well, you’re most welcome, I -- I -- I’m the one to thank you, because the fact that you want to hear it, that’s -- that’s -- makes room for my gratitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Q: Well, we all thank you.</span> <span id="s3881">I thank you so very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3882">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3883">Q: Cause it was wonderful to be with your today.</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">A: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">Q: And Janine, who is this?</span> <span id="s3886">A: This is my grandmother Aurelia, on my mother’s side, and this is picture of my grandfather Herman.</span> <span id="s3887">And most of these pictures were taken on their wedding day, I believe, in 1899, or 1898.</span></p> <p><span id="s3888">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3889">A: This is a photograph of my mother at the age of two, taken by her father in the living room of their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3890">Q: And who is this, Janine?</span></p> <p><span id="s3891">A: This is my father, before his marriage, in the Austrian uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s3892">Q:
