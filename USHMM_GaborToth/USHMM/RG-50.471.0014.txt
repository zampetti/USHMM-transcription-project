Are not allowed to play the, are not allowed to, to, to learn the lesson. Even the kindergarten is clandestine, the school is clandestine.
All this was given in orders. But the people didn't take to the orders of, people went to, to, to learn and they went to pray. My husband was quite a, I don't believe her, but in the ghetto on Yom Kippur he went to pray because it was not allowed.

I myself when I saw a child I saw the, the mal , the, the is flying over them. I knew the children, I remem, very great danger because children don't work. They done, they, they are only, they are only would asked to feed them. They are mouths to feed. So I, I felt I knew that the children are in the first round to go and then and then afterwards or already there was in , there was an action and all the children are taken out so I was all the time frightened and thought how can I take out the child from the ghetto.
And this is ironic. Because before the war broke out, and I was sitting at the radio, radio set and Hitler was speaking, speaking shouting, crying, like, like an animal and what he will to the Jews. And Deni didn't, didn't understand German but she felt is when she came in and she said to me, lady please give me the Shulameet, I shall take her to the country and nobody will know she is a Jew. I shall keep , because they say terrible things will be done to the Jews. She heard it of course in the, in the church. I, I think, I admit that I thought no, I, I shall not give the child. Because a child must be with her mother. I thought well she'll be hungry, or she'll be cold. But I, I didn't think about it that they will kill, they will kill innocent people, innocent chil- dren. I couldn't imagine it.

And then came a time when I going to, to Veronica. And then she couldn't do anything, she was working in a monas- tery. And she didn't have a place you could go, take her so we began this church, this uh for a, for a place for her. And this, all this made Avraham, and it's a
long story.
Q: In the ghetto did getting what was that like.
PT: It's a, it's at first it was very hard. Whatever we brought from, from the before the ghetto and we managed to buy in the last minute, we had it was gone very soon and then the, the first month it was couldn't get anything in the ghetto. And where brigades were going out to work and they brought food. But the, the brigades it wasn't yet ordered. Afterwards they, all these work it was ad, administration and the, and the it was a order. Everybody was, could go out but in the first we had the went out into the, to the so I, I went to ask to, to the gate and there was a policeman and I told him look I have nothing to eat at home.

So the German oh so hi, he went and he sold to one woman, you stay here today and this woman will go. And this woman went every day and they, they were not in lack of food. But they begin to quarrel between themselves who should stay. And I stood there as it was, I was very, very much it was, there were quarreling and cursing one another. It was terrible. I stood still like a mouse.
Afterwards when, I want to tell you this story because it is very drastic. I went out and I, they were going on foot about ten kilometers or so. And it came to the place and the people were very kind to me and they came and asked me if I wanted a , if I want also appar- ently I was happy to, to get it and then I never came.
And he told me we are going out to, to, to buy and change our things on food. I had, I had with me of course towels, some blouses or so I went out with him and at the end of the day I had a fortune. Potatoes and carrots and, and the, the cabbage. 20 kilos I went to food, it was a fortune.
And the we came to walk back. After we worked all the day, we went back and we saw then who, who tried and, and shouted and she, she went forget what we were going in, in a line of twos. And I was so silent, I felt so guilty. And she looks at me. I went into and I, I couldn't, I couldn't go on with this household.

And she gave me, she had a only a satchel briefcase because she didn't need much. She, she went every day.
So I take the briefcase and I felt I had, I believe couldn't go and I think I wasn't used to it. And after several kilometers I gave, I am going very heavy so she looked at me and she said give me these two. She went and she gave me some little things she had. And she kept, she took my parcel and her parcel to the ghetto. And this was a woman who cursed and shouted and I was so much afraid of her. And this was the first time I brought in food at the ghetto.
We didn't have, we didn't have uh when it was, we get to, fuel. We didn't have fuel. So, so I had on the, on the was sending my, my bed uh my bed. It was very hard wood. Very good hard wood. So I had to, to, to how you say. To, to cut it to pieces and I burned with this wood for some time. And it so the people, people used to go and the fences. They took off the fences and the, the wooden fences and the burned things. The Aldestenrat had fer, permits to bring in afterwards. We never, everything was . That cabbage bring in food for and or if this permit they brought in again and again not little so that, so we managed to solve the problem. And not very good but some....we could get on.

This food was not to, not to die, not to live. It was for instance, it was 200 grams of bread but we got only 120. Because Altestenrat didn't, didn't announce all these old people and the children were in the ghetto because they are afraid you will be in your latex. So we had, so they had to take off from all our other people the brain. And to give these people real clan- destine. We now and so we had 120 gram bread. For instance in my house I, I , a cousin of mine, he used to go every day on the airport to us. Very hard work.
It was early in the morning til late in the night.
It was in the sun and in the rain and the, and they didn't get anything. Not even the Ushnik we've got in the other brigades. So of course we gave him all the bread we house. So he had a long time we were
without bread.
Later on we're, were to live in these conditions. We have smuggle din floor and bread was baked and you
could get to People were going out and changing things and buying
and bringing and selling it in the ghetto. So there was already we kept going if they wouldn't kill us.

For, Doctor Browis was on the way to the hospital with his son, Dr. Jake Browis now and this I heard from them afterwards.
