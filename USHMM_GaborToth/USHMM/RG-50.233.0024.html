in a very small town.</span> <span id="s44">Not many Jews lived, and I remember that my mother told me there was a lot of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s45">It was in Vries in Drenthe in Holland.</span> <span id="s46">My mother come from a family from eight children.</span> <span id="s47">She was the oldest; and they had a store, a textile store.</span> <span id="s48">I remember we were once in Holland, and somebody showed us this store.</span> <span id="s49">My mother went to the farmers on a bicycle; and she had the suitcases in the front of the bicycle; and she went selling textiles, as she had to do a lot of helping for the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">This was when she was a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">No, it was a teenager, I think; that I don’t know exactly, I think like a teenager.</span> <span id="s54">My mother got married very late in life.</span> <span id="s55">I think they got shadchaned (ph?</span> <span id="s56">c. 14).</span> <span id="s57">In that time they put people together, man and wife.</span> <span id="s58">I think my mother was not young, and my father was also not young when they got married.</span> <span id="s59">So … Do you know much about her education?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s61">She was a very intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s62">She read a lot, and she was president in my home — in Zwolle, in Holland.</span> <span id="s63">My parents had their own hotel and she was president from Hadassah.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Okay, could you tell me once again the name of that organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">It was Practice (ph?</span> <span id="s66">c. 20) Palestine Work.</span> <span id="s67">It was something from Jews in Holland; had worked for Israel.</span> <span id="s68">It was not Israel in that time, it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s69">My mother was president from the group, and I remember she had to make a speech and worked together with my brother on it.</span> <span id="s70">They were very active in a Jewish — a Jewish temple in my hometown, in Zwolle.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Do you know of anything else about her childhood, or her youth, or the year that she got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">No, I don’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s73">Somehow, I put that really out of my mind.</span> <span id="s74">No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Maybe we should move up to Zwolle.</span> <span id="s76">This is where she and your father settled?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">No.</span> <span id="s78">My father and mother had a brush factory in Groningen; that’s not far from where my mother lived.</span> <span id="s79">In 1929, the difficult time, they went bankrupt.</span> <span id="s80">So they had to do something else; and they bought a hotel, a kosher hotel, in Zwolle, that’s another state, Overijssel.</span> <span id="s81">That was the only kosher hotel.</span> <span id="s82">My father and mother worked that ‘til they went — my father died in 1941— until they went to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s83">My mother was very active in Drenthe (?</span> <span id="s84">c. 34) when she lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Why don’t you tell us a little about your family?</span> <span id="s86">When did your mother start having children, and how many children did she have?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">We — I don’t remember when my mother had children.</span> <span id="s88">I was the youngest from the four children and the only girl.</span> <span id="s89">I had two, three older brothers; one was two years older, one was four years older, and one was six years older.</span> <span id="s90">The one what was six years older was Braham, and he was hidden in the war; and he got out of it.</span> <span id="s91">He had himself four children, and he came alive out of the war with his wife and the four children.</span> <span id="s92">I had two other brothers, one was named Marthyn (Marthijn), we have a picture of him; and one was named Maurits.</span> <span id="s93">What you want to know more?</span> <span id="s94">We had a very nice family.</span> <span id="s95">We went bicycle riding a lot, and we fought a lot.</span> <span id="s96">We lived — my parents had a hotel on a cattle market, and it came a lot of Jewish salesmen; they slept overnight in our hotel.</span> <span id="s97">It was very Jewish oriented; still, we didn’t wear payos (peyes, peyess, peyos, payas) or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s98">We were religious, but very assimilated; and religious.</span> <span id="s99">My mother, when my brothers were young, they had to lay tefillin and all these things.</span> <span id="s100">Still, it was very different than in Poland; and much more assimilated.</span> <span id="s101">I had a lot of not Jewish girlfriends; I stayed overnight there.</span> <span id="s102">I remember I had to take my own sandwich with me when I went there, but we had a lot of non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s103">And also when we were always — prayers on Shabbat, after dinner, that we always did that.</span> <span id="s104">Not the outside world; it was always private, things like that.</span> <span id="s105">My brothers — one brother went to college.</span> <span id="s106">We had a —.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">If you don’t mind, I’d just like to go back a little.</span> <span id="s108">Maybe you could tell us a little bit about your mother as a person, what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">My mother was a very nice person; she was always very happy, and she was singing a lot.</span> <span id="s110">I don’t remember everything exactly; somehow, I don’t remember much when I was young.</span> <span id="s111">I very completely — I don’t know; I try to block it out perhaps, I don’t know, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s112">I remember that my mother was very religious, and she prayed in the morning and in the afternoon; especially when difficult times.</span> <span id="s113">We had to go every Friday evening, every Shabbos morning we had to go the temple.</span> <span id="s114">Then we came home, and we had, you know, nice things, lunch together, very fresh (?)</span> <span id="s115">cholent (c. 65) together.</span> <span id="s116">Also Friday evening there was a very big thing always with Kabbalat Shabbat.</span> <span id="s117">Also in the evening the making the end of the Shabbat; it was very religious.</span> <span id="s118">And also with Passover, everything is changed.</span> <span id="s119">We had a hotel, so there was a lot of work; all the glasswork had to be kosher-made.</span> <span id="s120">My mother was a very religious person; my father was not, but my mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s121">And the hotel was also a kosher hotel, strict kosher.</span> <span id="s122">Many times there was the old rabbi standing in the hotel when there was dinners, from the kosher thing.</span> <span id="s123">(c. 71).</span> <span id="s124">My mother was a very nice person, and very pleasant.</span> <span id="s125">What it was, they were always very busy in the business, in the hotel.</span> <span id="s126">Because in the evening there were so many salesmen stayed overnight; so I was never allowed to come in the room, the hall where they was sitting, most of the time.</span> <span id="s127">So the maid brought me to bed; I’m really brought up by the maid, I think, because I don’t remember much that my mother went to me and kissed me good-night or something like that.</span> <span id="s128">I don’t know; in Holland, they are much colder, I think, the people.</span> <span id="s129">They didn’t kiss so much, and they didn’t show so much the affection to each other.</span> <span id="s130">I remember when I once lay on my mother’s shoulder that my brother said, don’t do so childish or so.</span> <span id="s131">You know, the people in Holland were not too affectionate.</span> <span id="s132">That is really what she was — a very strong, capable person.</span> <span id="s133">Of course, it was the religion, I think, that helped her a lot; because my father died in 1941, and she had the whole load on her shoulders by herself.</span> <span id="s134">In the beginning of 1942, she had to go out of the hotel, and she was a very strong person; much stronger than I am, I think, very strong, very business-like, very intelligent.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Do you remember any particular times that you spent together?</span> <span id="s136">Any particular trip that you took or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">My father and mother never took vacations.</span> <span id="s138">They went — they only worked.</span> <span id="s139">I remember they went when there was something from the Queen, in The Hague (?</span> <span id="s140">c. 88).</span> <span id="s141">Then they took a taxi, and they went to The Hague and saw the Queen and the King; not the king, the prince.</span> <span id="s142">The Queen, they saw her, and that was for her the biggest thing.</span> <span id="s143">I don’t remember that my father and mother ever went on vacation, never.</span> <span id="s144">They always worked; that was the system.</span> <span id="s145">I don’t remember that they took vacations, no.</span> <span id="s146">I don’t remember — we went on Shabbat—on Shabbos we went, walked.</span> <span id="s147">For hours, we walked; my mother and my father and I. My brothers never went; my brothers stayed always home with friends and played cards.</span> <span id="s148">But my mother, when my mother came in, there was not allowed on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s149">I remember that I had to walk with them.</span> <span id="s150">They came together a lot with friends; was very nice Jewish kehillah, community, very nice.</span> <span id="s151">A lot of things going on always in the hotel, Jewish.</span> <span id="s152">There was a Jewish organization and kept the clubs in our hotel, and we had something to do.</span> <span id="s153">And then we went to Sunday school, and there was parties always from Sunday school.</span> <span id="s154">There was a very large community, Jewish community, and very active.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">That’s nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Yeah, it was really very nice.</span> <span id="s157">I had a very nice youth, very nice.</span> <span id="s158">I went to camp when I was young, Zionist camp, and there was lands en trein veer (ph?</span> <span id="s159">c.102) came together with all the youth from Holland.</span> <span id="s160">I know a lot of people; I had a lot of Jewish friends also in other towns.</span> <span id="s161">I went to visit other people in other towns.</span> <span id="s162">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s163">When my father and mother worked very hard, yeah; we had it perhaps, easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Is there any way that we can get a little bit closer type to the period between 1940 and 1944 that you know what happened to your mother?</span> <span id="s165">Is there anything that you might know, maybe you could tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">What it has to do with the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">My mother—in 1942 the Germans came and told my mother that she has to go out of the hotel.</span> <span id="s169">They put her in a very small house; very poor neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">This was in Zwolle?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Everything was Zwolle.</span> <span id="s172">Z-o-w-l-l-e.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Z-w-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Oh, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s175">I told you that we were once picked up and sent—.</span> <span id="s176">She was a very strong person.</span> <span id="s177">Also, I don’t know, she never showed really her fear for anything.</span> <span id="s178">I remember that she was always knitting; she knitted everything for me.</span> <span id="s179">She was always knitting; she knit whole suits and socks and stockings and sweaters.</span> <span id="s180">She was always knitting in that poor house, that little house where we lived.</span> <span id="s181">There was no electricity; there was no bathroom; there was — barrel, came once a week to empty it; was no shower there.</span> <span id="s182">I thought it was horrible.</span> <span id="s183">I didn’t want to stay there; I didn’t stay there much.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">That was in 1942.</span> <span id="s186">So I went in 1943; I went away from home and was hidden in another place.</span> <span id="s187">My mother stayed there ‘til 1943; in 1943, they sent her away.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">You don’t know what month that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">I don’t know; I never wanted to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">We have a correction.</span> <span id="s191">We were going to go back, and it was still in 1942—.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">1942.</span> <span id="s193">Because in 1943, I went already to Sobibor.</span> <span id="s194">In 1942, I was hidden.</span> <span id="s195">And my mother in the time that I was hidden, somebody told me, that on the way out, that she was planning to go and hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s196">The police came, and I think that perhaps the Gestapo; and they picked her up and sent her to Poland.</span> <span id="s197">So that’s all that I know about my mother.</span> <span id="s198">My brothers are living; I never exactly found out.</span> <span id="s199">I really never wanted to know.</span> <span id="s200">Lately, now we talk more about it, I think I should find out; I really don’t want to know.</span> <span id="s201">Because I don’t want to know if they suffered a lot, and when I know what camp they went, it suffered more; and I hope that they went to a camp like Sobibor that they went right away to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s202">So I really never wanted to know exactly because it doesn’t make me happier; doesn’t fulfill my life when I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Well, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s204">Maybe we should move on now to talk about your brothers.</span> <span id="s205">I’m sorry this is a difficult topic but thank you.</span> <span id="s206">Okay, we’re now talking with Mrs. Engel about her brother, .</span> <span id="s207">.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Marthyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Marthyn Wijnberg.</span> <span id="s210">Mrs. Engel what can you tell us about your brother?</span> <span id="s211">When was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">He was born in December 23, 1920.</span> <span id="s213">He was two years older than I am.</span> <span id="s214">I remember that we went every Sunday bicycle riding; before breakfast we went to a little town.</span> <span id="s215">We drove 20, 30 miles every Sunday morning, and then we came back for breakfast.</span> <span id="s216">We were always singing, the bathroom was downstairs and his was upstairs, and we were always singing.</span> <span id="s217">He could sing very beautiful; he was very musical inclined.</span> <span id="s218">We got along very well.</span> <span id="s219">We had a very—.</span> <span id="s220">I remember when we were young.</span> <span id="s221">We were—we had a very nice time together.</span> <span id="s222">We were already teenagers; that’s the time I can remember the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">What type of schools did he attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">He went high school; he went to a culinary school too.</span> <span id="s225">He was a very good, exceptional fine bakery, but the same bakery what they do in Holland.</span> <span id="s226">In Holland they have very fine pastry, and he was very, very good in it.</span> <span id="s227">He could make a — I remember he made once a very large bridge from sugar, you know.</span> <span id="s228">Yeah, very large; and it was in our hotel in one of the cabinets; and it was dancing evening, and the thing broke.</span> <span id="s229">Very fine make; he really could paint from marzipan.</span> <span id="s230">In Holland this is very big, the pastry business; and he was very good at it.</span> <span id="s231">Also he could play music; any instrument.</span> <span id="s232">He could play the piano and saxophone and accordion.</span> <span id="s233">We had always a lot of fun with him.</span> <span id="s234">That he did—.</span> <span id="s235">You know, one brother played the piano, and he played on the accordion or the violin.</span> <span id="s236">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s237">We had a very nice—.</span> <span id="s238">We went—I went—he was very young already and went out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">About what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">I think he was 17, 18.</span> <span id="s241">So I don’t remember so much what we did together.</span> <span id="s242">He went also to school away from home, so I don’t remember so much that I went out with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Can we just back up for a minute?</span> <span id="s244">Can you tell me what type of schools—were these Dutch public schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Oh, yeah, Dutch public schools.</span> <span id="s246">After school, every day, we went to a Hebrew school; I hated it.</span> <span id="s247">When we went—we had to go every day after school; we went to Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Oh, every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Every day; not a Friday, but every other day we had to go.</span> <span id="s250">I don’t remember Sunday, but I know after school we had to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Did you learn Hebrew there?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Yeah, we learned Hebrew there, and we learned history.</span> <span id="s253">We got Jewish education in this school, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">These were Zionistly inclined schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">No, that was not Zionistly inclined.</span> <span id="s256">Was a Zionist organization in my home town, a youth organization; and I was really the only one of all the kids, from the four kids, that was very active in it.</span> <span id="s257">Went to a Zionist camp in the summer, and we went bicycle riding and met other groups to other little towns.</span> <span id="s258">There was all little towns; all over lived Jews.</span> <span id="s259">A lot of Jewish people lived in the whole area outside—very small towns.</span> <span id="s260">In every small town was a synagogue in Holland.</span> <span id="s261">Then we came together always, every other Sunday, and it was very active always with the… But Marthyn was not as involved as— No, he was not so much involved in that somehow.</span> <span id="s262">The other brothers were not so much involved.</span> <span id="s263">Maurits was more involved, but Marthyn was not involved, and my oldest brother was not so much involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Did he go out—was he in any bands or anything if he was so musical?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">No, there was no such a … I don’t remember that really.</span> <span id="s266">He was away; he went to school, and he had to make a living.</span> <span id="s267">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s268">I really don’t remember that; that he was in a band.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">When he left the house, you said as a late teenager, is that when he went to go to the culinary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Yes, he went to the culinary school.</span> <span id="s271">Then he went, when he was 18, he went working in Rotterdam; he was in a very fine place.</span> <span id="s272">He was the headmaster already from that place for pastry.</span> <span id="s273">Big business was that.</span> <span id="s274">He was a very charming guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">He had a lot of friends growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s277">Yeah, he had friends; he lived still.</span> <span id="s278">Friends what he had, I know.</span> <span id="s279">He had very close friends, and he lived still in Holland.</span> <span id="s280">When we were at Maten (?</span> <span id="s281">c. 195) Holland, I met this friend, and he told me about him.</span> <span id="s282">They were very close friends.</span> <span id="s283">This friend is very, very religious, now in Holland.</span> <span id="s284">He doesn’t take the telephone; he teaches Sunday school; he has the synagogue; he’s the president from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s285">So we come from a very religious background, very religious.</span> <span id="s286">I never had anything that was not kosher, you know.</span> <span id="s287">First thing I had not kosher was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s288">Perhaps in jail or somewhat… So do you know what happened to Marthyn after—?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Not exactly, I don’t exactly—what was going on.</span> <span id="s290">I really don’t—I never want to find out exactly—that was my whole system really.</span> <span id="s291">That I never want to go … All right.</span> <span id="s292">So basically after he had left home and gone to the culinary institute, did he come back to Zwolle?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Yeah, he came back in the war; he came back to Zwolle.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">About what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">He was in the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">He was in the military, and he was a sergeant in the military.</span> <span id="s298">He was in the war too.</span> <span id="s299">He fought in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">In World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Yeah, in World War II.</span> <span id="s302">Well, only ten days; the war was only ten days.</span> <span id="s303">But he was in the war, and he was in the military from the beginning of the war—already before the war, he was a military.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">He had been conscripted?</span> <span id="s305">There was a draft?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Yeah, there was a draft, yeah.</span> <span id="s307">He was in the… Then he came back to the family (?</span> <span id="s308">c. 214).</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Yeah, he came back to the family after the war.</span> <span id="s310">He came back to his family, and then we had to go out of the hotel.</span> <span id="s311">Then he stayed also in the—he slept in the hotel—in that little house.</span> <span id="s312">But I don’t remember so much in daytime.</span> <span id="s313">He was always out with friends; that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s314">At that time, we didn’t have so much contact with him.</span> <span id="s315">When I went away from home, in 1942 already, I was away.</span> <span id="s316">It was already in July, 1942, I say goodbye to my brothers and my mother; I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s317">That was the last time I saw.</span> <span id="s318">After the war, I was so occupied with my own life, I think, that I didn’t want to know exactly what.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">When you say that he was out with friends, was it dangerous for people, for Jews to be out or —?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">No, not in daytime.</span> <span id="s321">It was dangerous ever, and I think, perhaps, he stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s322">I don’t remember much, I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">For example, could you go in the street and buy groceries and things like that?</span> <span id="s324">Or I mean there probably weren’t too many groceries at a certain point, but—?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">I think—of course we had groceries in the house.</span> <span id="s328">In daytime we were allowed to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">But you had to wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">I had to wear a star, yeah.</span> <span id="s331">I had to wear a star.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">So basically once you had gone to go into hiding, you didn’t see your brother again.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">No, I never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">You’re not sure of his fate?</span> <span id="s335">You know he was somehow he—?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">What it was… I think he was hidden, I remember.</span> <span id="s337">He was not home; because in 1941, there came in man to our hotel.</span> <span id="s338">He say when you give me money, I will help that your brothers will get them to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s339">So I give him all the money; he was a traitor, that guy, and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s340">He was a very charming man.</span> <span id="s341">He came to our hotel and give lots of money, lots of money.</span> <span id="s342">And he didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s343">So they were hidden; he was hidden.</span> <span id="s344">He was not home; anyway, he was not home.</span> <span id="s345">I don’t know much; he was not home.</span> <span id="s346">He was hidden perhaps in the war; he was not home.</span> <span id="s347">I don’t remember much, it’s strange.</span> <span id="s348">I just put it klun (ph?</span> <span id="s349">c.243) completely out of my mind, all these things.</span> <span id="s350">I should go and be hypnotized.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Maybe you—.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Who cares?</span> <span id="s353">He’s gone.</span> <span id="s354">They’re dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Well, I think—.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">They’re dead, and my kids never ask about it; and then they never want to know about it.</span> <span id="s357">Nobody wants to know about it.</span> <span id="s358">I know that he was sent to Poland; but what it was; now I remember.</span> <span id="s359">This brother had to go to a work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Maurits; he had to go to a work camp, work camp.</span> <span id="s362">All the Jews in Holland — had to go, were made —they had to go to a work camp; weekends, sometimes home.</span> <span id="s363">And he say when he goes to a work camp, I go too; when I can help him.</span> <span id="s364">So he went free over to the work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Marthyn joined your other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Yeah, yeah, yeah, to the work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">But they were not incarcerated there?</span> <span id="s368">They didn’t have to sleep there?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Oh, yeah, they had to sleep there.</span> <span id="s370">They went away for the whole week, and on weekends sometimes they came home from the beginning.</span> <span id="s371">Weekends they came home.</span> <span id="s372">So the Germans did as soon as the people went home… Okay, we had a brief interruption, but we were just finishing up about what you were telling me about Marthyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Marthyn.</span> <span id="s374">Just Marthyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">It’s not written here.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Well, it must be some—we’re looking at the picture.</span> <span id="s378">And there, a picture of Marthyn and his friend with… Yeah, but you don’t want to make a picture from this star, with a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s379">It was very important to them that they have a picture.</span> <span id="s380">They went to a real photographer and had a picture made from Jewish star; so idiot.</span> <span id="s381">Yeah, joke.</span> <span id="s382">You see how they can joke… Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s383">OK.</span> <span id="s384">Well, thank you very much for this information, and we can move on now to talk about one of your other brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Okay, we’re talking with Selma Engel about her brother Maurits, Maurits Wijnberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">He was a very nice guy, a very soft-spoken nice boy.</span> <span id="s388">He went always skating, and he was once very sick.</span> <span id="s389">When he was twelve years old, he had meningitis.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Meningitis, oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Yeah.</span> <span id="s392">He was very , very sick.</span> <span id="s393">I remember that my father and mother put hay on the street that the cars didn’t make too much noise in the hotel, in another hotel.</span> <span id="s394">When my father and mother build it later, this new hotel in Zwolle, not new any more, of course.</span> <span id="s395">He was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s396">I think he came out very well because he went to high school.</span> <span id="s397">He had studied very hard, much harder after the sickness, I think.</span> <span id="s398">He went to high school, and he helped a lot in the hotel.</span> <span id="s399">He went to a textile school and learned for business; he was in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Can we back up for one second?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Can you tell me his date of birth and where he was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">He was born in De Leek next to Groningen.</span> <span id="s404">He was born in January 10, I think, 1918.</span> <span id="s405">He was four years older than I am.</span> <span id="s406">He was very active also in the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s407">He was the only one from the boys that was active, active in the Zionist organization together with me.</span> <span id="s408">We went always there together.</span> <span id="s409">He went out a lot with not Jewish girls, I remember.</span> <span id="s410">My father and mother were very upset about it — when he was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Even though he was in the Zionist—?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s413">He had a lot of not Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s414">He went skating with them, and he took me out always to the movies.</span> <span id="s415">When we were dancing, organizations, he took me out dancing.</span> <span id="s416">No, he was a very—he was very young already—had later on not Jewish, Jewish girlfriend.</span> <span id="s417">That’s the girl that he married to.</span> <span id="s418">He got married in the war, so he was very young.</span> <span id="s419">He got married when he was 21; 21, 22.</span> <span id="s420">He got also married to a not Jewish — to a Jewish girl, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s421">I have a picture from her, too.</span> <span id="s422">He was hidden.</span> <span id="s423">I don’t remember much what we did when we were children.</span> <span id="s424">I don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s425">I remember that he had a lot of—we had a lot of Jewish friends; and Shabbos when my father and mother were not home, they played cards.</span> <span id="s426">When my father and mother was there, they were not allowed to play cards on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s427">When they came home, they put the cards quickly under the table so my mother wouldn’t see it; that I remember.</span> <span id="s428">But I don’t remember much about him at all.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t remember much, I don’t—it somehow… You were telling me that he hadn’t studied tech, he went to a business school?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Yeah, he went to a special—Handelsschool (ph, c. 303), that was in Holland.</span> <span id="s431">He went to that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Where was it located?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">In Zwolle, in my hometown.</span> <span id="s434">Later he went to a business school, that I remember; he went to a business school.</span> <span id="s435">I remember that he was very young already.</span> <span id="s436">He was 17, 18; he went with this Jewish girl later on —Bep Davidson, Beppie (Betje) Davidson, Davidson.</span> <span id="s437">[Note: last name was more likely Jakobs; her sister married Dolf Davidson].</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Do you know how to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Davidson.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Oh, no, no.</span> <span id="s441">The first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Bep.</span> <span id="s443">B-e-p.</span> <span id="s444">She—they went very young already together.</span> <span id="s445">Then they broke up; they went together again; finally they got married —in the war they got married.</span> <span id="s446">I remember he was—you were not allowed from the Germans to exchange your address, so he went at 11 o’clock, dark on the side of the houses, he went to her house.</span> <span id="s447">He was sure that in the morning before—very early in the morning—it was very dangerous what he did—he came back to the house again.</span> <span id="s448">So, but he was a lot with my mother and also his wife.</span> <span id="s449">They were a lot in my mother’s little—that house after the war.</span> <span id="s450">He helped a lot my mother also when my father died in 1940; he helped my mother a lot in the hotel.</span> <span id="s451">My oldest brother was married already, and he was not home anymore.</span> <span id="s452">So he helped my mother a lot.</span> <span id="s453">He and I, I don’t remember, he and I went very early over in the morning and made coffee for the people that came to the hotel.</span> <span id="s454">We made breakfast together for the people in the hotel.</span> <span id="s455">Yeah, that I forgot.</span> <span id="s456">But—he was a very big help for my mother, much more than I am; I remember.</span> <span id="s457">But he was a big help, and he helped my mother a lot.</span> <span id="s458">He was hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">When did he leave the little house to go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">He was—when we lived in the little house, he was hidden.</span> <span id="s461">Then they told my sister-in-law, he was married already then; that when somebody in the family was hiding, that her father had to go to Poland right away or had to go to camp.</span> <span id="s462">So he came out of the hiding place because his wife, that was his wife already, told him to get out of this hiding place.</span> <span id="s463">Then I went already very early out of the house, it was in July, 1942; I went away so I don’t know exactly what was going on then.</span> <span id="s464">I didn’t have any contact with them; only that I know that they were all sent to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Who told his wife this, that they would be—?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">I don’t know; it was just a rumor, what goes around.</span> <span id="s467">The Jewish (Joodse, Joodsche) Raad; there was a Jewish group of Jewish people what helped the Germans really to organize everything.</span> <span id="s468">That was very active in Holland, I think.</span> <span id="s469">So anyway, somehow there was — and he was — that’s the way he went out of the hiding place, and he went together with her.</span> <span id="s470">I think — I don’t know together with her; I don’t know how they went over to Poland; I don’t know.</span> <span id="s471">I never found out anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">That was in ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">That was in ’42, yeah, 1942.</span> <span id="s474">Very surely in the area where we lived; much more than in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s475">In Amsterdam, was the underground much quicker and was already going on in there.</span> <span id="s476">The Jews were—our life much more from Amsterdam area.</span> <span id="s477">But the Jews lived northern Holland where I come from, they all got killed; almost nobody left.</span> <span id="s478">The few what are left, they live in Israel.</span> <span id="s479">There’s a lot of Dutch, not a lot; there are Dutch Jews what are alive, they all went away to Israel.</span> <span id="s480">The most other to America, but not many to America; the most went to Israel.</span> <span id="s481">They—but I know that all little towns where you go now in Holland, you see all memorials in every little town.</span> <span id="s482">In every little town there was a Jewish community; they all had synagogues there.</span> <span id="s483">In all these little towns where I come from, from northern Holland — from Overijssel, Drenthe, Groningen — all province like Connecticut; there’s nothing left.</span> <span id="s484">In Friesland there’s nothing left.</span> <span id="s485">They all got killed in early ’42; a lot got caught too.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Can we try to shift back a little?</span> <span id="s487">You said your brother was very—do you know of his other interests?</span> <span id="s488">You said he was very soft-spoken and nice.</span> <span id="s489">Did he have any hobbies like your other brother, or—?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">He was—no, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s491">I remember he was active in the Jewish organization, also in the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s492">I remember that the war broke out in 1940; that he was there, and he helped my mother a lot in the hotel in that time.</span> <span id="s493">He was already very young with this Bep; was very young, they went together.</span> <span id="s494">So they went ice-skating together, and that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s495">I don’t remember much that he had hobbies and things like that, no; I don’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Okay, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s497">So is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your brother Maurits?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">No, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s499">He went to Handelsschool.</span> <span id="s500">He did the high school and went to the college there.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Handel as in the composer?</span> <span id="s502">H-a-n-d-e-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Handelsschool, yes.</span> <span id="s504">There was like a MULO, like in high school, like in high school;

then when the war broke out, and I was not much home.</span> <span id="s509">When we were younger, I really don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s510">I somehow put things out of my memory (?</span> <span id="s511">c. 388).</span> <span id="s512">We had a very nice life, like the kids here.</span> <span id="s513">We went out, lots ski; he went always ice skating.</span> <span id="s514">I went swimming a lot, so we didn’t have the same interests.</span> <span id="s515">I went every day swimming, and he went more with the boys out.</span> <span id="s516">He studied a lot;

that was 1931.</span> <span id="s586">And that hotel was on a cattle market; but they moved that cattle market two years later.</span> <span id="s587">But they didn’t know when they bought the hotel, and they had to build a new hotel on the new cattle market; and that was also in Zwolle.</span> <span id="s588">And — Daddy (ph?</span> <span id="s589">c.36) did very well; it was very hard, when they didn’t have so much money when they lost the money in 1929.</span> <span id="s590">And they had to build up the hotel; and got loans from the beer factories and from the banks and ….</span> <span id="s591">Later on, I remember when I was a teenager, they did already very well.</span> <span id="s592">It was already out of the difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">OK.</span> <span id="s594">And you said that your father died in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">No, my father died in 19 — 41 or ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">5701 Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">My father died when he was 55 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">So that would be — yeah; I think it would be 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">1940; OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">All right; of what causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Oh, he had a heart attack?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Yeah; he was very nervous with that both brothers were in the army, and they were looking for them; and very short after that, he died in a heart attack.</span> <span id="s604">And it was good; then he’s buried in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">So he hadn’t really experienced too much of the … No, nothing at all; no, no, almost nothing at all.</span> <span id="s606">I don’t think so; no.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">OK, but do you think it was part of the pressure of what was going on with the Nazis invading?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Possible, possible; that had something to do with the heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Was there talk of that in your family when …?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Of course; when the war broke out, we did; we right away saw ….</span> <span id="s611">We never saw there was a concentration camp, gas chambers, but ….</span> <span id="s612">I was a tomboy, and I was very young.</span> <span id="s613">I was — not so young — I was 18.</span> <span id="s614">I never — talked seriously; they never talked with me when I was there around, like money worries, not.</span> <span id="s615">And, so — of course, we talked about it.</span> <span id="s616">When all the German Jews came to our hotel, and they stayed overnight many times in the hotel; and then they were smuggled to Belgium.</span> <span id="s617">And then when boats went away from there; so we had a lot of people always overnight when we had, were still in the hotel.</span> <span id="s618">We get also after the war, we did a lot of people came over to the hotel, and they were smuggled out, and slept in the attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Yeah.</span> <span id="s621">A lot of from the camps slept in the attic with us and were smuggled to Belgium and — Was your father involved in helping any of these, or was this afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">I don’t remember, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s623">But that’s what I tell … What’s also in the war we had a lot of Germans came to our hotel, German Jews, and stayed in the hotel overnight and when smuggled someplace else; in the beginning, yeah.</span> <span id="s624">But also in 1945, that was already after the war, we had a lot of Jewish people that stayed in the attic the whole night, and we give them food; 50, 60 stayed in the attic, slept — we had the beds on the floor.</span> <span id="s625">And then they were picked up and cycled (ph?</span> <span id="s626">c. 62) in the evening, and they were sent to Belgium; I think like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">When would that begin — the smuggling?</span> <span id="s628">Do you know what year, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">That was in 1945 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Oh, after … Also, in the war, that was in the very beginning, very beginning; yeah, very beginning — in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Yeah, yeah, 1940; that we had the Jews in the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">And you knew that this was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Of course you knew.</span> <span id="s635">The help (?</span> <span id="s636">c. 67) was not allowed to talk about it with anybody; and nobody came to the hotel and things like that.</span> <span id="s637">But it was very short time that could have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Right.</span> <span id="s639">OK.</span> <span id="s640">Well, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about what you can remember?</span> <span id="s641">About your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">No?</span> <span id="s644">That should do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Yeah, that should do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">OK; all right.</span> <span id="s647">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">OK.</span> <span id="s650">We’re speaking with Selma Engel about her late sister-in-law, Bep Jakobs.</span> <span id="s651">Mrs. Engel, what can you tell us about Bep?</span> <span id="s652">What do you know anything about her birthday or when she was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">She was born in Emmen in, also in Drenthe; in Overijssel is a little town and she comes … Her father and mother had a very beautiful store in Zwolle.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">What type of store?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A big sports store; very, very, they did very, very well.</span> <span id="s656">And she had another sister, “voti ellipse” (ph?</span> <span id="s657">c. 75), in Holland, in Zwolle.</span> <span id="s658">And they went toget … my brother and her they went together when they was 16.</span> <span id="s659">And my father and mother were a little bit against it; I don’t know why, since we were not so rich … (?</span> <span id="s660">c.78); they were very well to do already.</span> <span id="s661">And they …, I know she was a very nice person; and they went ice skating together.</span> <span id="s662">And she was very musical; she played beautiful piano.</span> <span id="s663">And she went to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Oh.</span> <span id="s665">Do you know what she studied?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">I don’t know; no, no.</span> <span id="s667">I think she just went to high … like gymnasiums.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">But it’s like a college here — gymnasium.</span> <span id="s670">She was very intelligent; she was very business-like; and I know that she was very nice.</span> <span id="s671">And she came always; in the war she stayed with my mother when I wasn’t there, and also Maurits was with the mother.</span> <span id="s672">And they were very much in love and was a very nice couple together.</span> <span id="s673">And she played tennis; I know remember she plays tennis.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Was she involved in any of the Jewish groups, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">No, no.</span> <span id="s676">She was not so much involved in Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s677">No; her sister was involved in Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s678">She was not so much involved in the Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s679">She went to school; and she was not so much in Zwolle that I remember.</span> <span id="s680">She was, perhaps, not in the town so … I, I was not friendly with her; she was two years older, there was a big difference in the age group.</span> <span id="s681">I was friendly with her sister.</span> <span id="s682">And I don’t think she was from …; I didn’t see her so much.</span> <span id="s683">And, she was a very nice person, she was very close with my mother; there was really very happy with.</span> <span id="s684">And she could knit, and her knitted together also with my mother.</span> <span id="s685">They talk about books; she read a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">And so she married your brother in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">In 1940; and she stayed in the parents’ house.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Was that before your father died that they got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">After my father died; after my father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">And she stayed in her parents’ house separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Yeah, because she was not allowed from the Germans to change the address.</span> <span id="s692">So middle in the night, 11 o’clock it was dark, 10 o’clock it was dark; my brother went dark places and went to her house.</span> <span id="s693">In the morning, early, he came back to our house.</span> <span id="s694">When daytime, they were together.</span> <span id="s695">But nights, she was not allowed changes from address.</span> <span id="s696">And officially, perhaps, the Germans were not allowed them to get married.</span> <span id="s697">So that was … Anything else?</span> <span id="s698">So she was with you … She was a big help for my mother to, to … you know.</span> <span id="s699">I was not much home, see, so I don’t know exactly what was going ….</span> <span id="s700">I couldn’t sit in a little house; I hated it.</span> <span id="s701">So I went away on Sunday, and I came back Friday evening; something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">So, the last time you saw her then, would have been in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Yeah.</span> <span id="s704">The last time that I saw her was beginning 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">You believe that she probably … She, I think she went, perhaps, together with my brother.</span> <span id="s706">Her father and mother would have been out to, I think, to Auschwitz; they went out to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s707">Anybody would want to know it exactly, they could find it out in Westerbork, in the archives in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s708">When you want to write that, they will tell you exactly; the Westerbork of the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s709">In Holland, they have it exactly written down, and they will tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s710">When you want to know, write me a letter.</span> <span id="s711">Exactly, also my brothers and everything, you can find it out exactly in Holland.</span> <span id="s712">… (?</span> <span id="s713">c.110).</span> <span id="s714">I never want to ….</span> <span id="s715">I was always afraid that I would know that they were martyred (?</span> <span id="s716">c.110) and things like that, and hoped that they went to a camp like Sobibor always; but they didn’t go to Sobibor.</span> <span id="s717">Oh well, I saw many, many people from my home town walk to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">So you said, I’m sorry, just to reiterate; she had one brother and one sister; or one sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">No; she had one sister; one sister, yeah.</span> <span id="s720">And her sister lives in Zwolle.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Saartje.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">S-A-A-R-T-J-E</span></p> <p><span id="s725">S-A-A-R-T-J-E It’s my maiden name too.</span> <span id="s726">(?</span> <span id="s727">c.115) OK; all right.</span> <span id="s728">Well, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s729">Is there anything else that you can remember that you’d like to tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">What I could tell you about — my brother, my brother Braham, didn’t tell you anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Right, right.</span> <span id="s732">We’ll move on to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">OK; thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">OK.</span> <span id="s736">We’re talking with Selma Engel about her brother, Braham Wijnberg.</span> <span id="s737">Mrs. Engel, when was Braham born and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Braham was six years older that I am, so he’s born in 1916 in De Leek, May the 14th.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">And what do you remember about him as a youth?</span> <span id="s740">He was a bit older, so he would have been a little bit ahead of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Yeah, he was six years older than I am, and he was like my father.</span> <span id="s742">He was very wise, and I could always ask him all the questions what I didn’t get from anybody else.</span> <span id="s743">And I never went to my father; I went always to him when I want to know things.</span> <span id="s744">And he was very intelligent, and he was very nice; and he helped in the hotel.</span> <span id="s745">Because he had a scholarship, in Groningen, to go to college, but he had to go and help in the hotel because they just started the hotel; and my parents couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s746">So he didn’t go to college.</span> <span id="s747">Later, he went to the hotel school; culinary school.</span> <span id="s748">Hotel school is that — in Holland.</span> <span id="s749">And he graduated from that, and he helped in the hotel many years.</span> <span id="s750">And he was also a dance, dancing teacher; because in Holland, when there is a party, there has to be a dance master.</span> <span id="s751">For the Holland government you’re not allowed to dance when there’s no ….</span> <span id="s752">So he was very popular in Holland for the not Jewish places.</span> <span id="s753">And he was very popular, and he worked very hard, and give also dancing lessons in the hotel; also before the war.</span> <span id="s754">And I helped him dancing always.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Do you remember which dances you would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Any dance; any kind of foxtrot and rumba; and we danced for public.</span> <span id="s757">Remember once for 1,000 people were watching; we were dancing.</span> <span id="s758">And we went to Amsterdam; we learned to dance.</span> <span id="s759">And I danced, I was always dancing with him.</span> <span id="s760">She has this picture with my dancing clothes together with my brother; from this woman.</span> <span id="s761">Yeah, he was very, very good brother; we getting along very well.</span> <span id="s762">And he took me out a lot, and we had a very nice understanding together.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">So basically, was he with you in the hotel when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">No; he got married.</span> <span id="s765">He got married in 1940 — May 8, 1940.</span> <span id="s766">He moved out, and he lived in Utrecht together with her family.</span> <span id="s767">And he was not in the hotel, and he was not in the war time too connected with us at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Do you know what happened to him during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">He was hidden in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">By a gentile family?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">By a gentile family, with his wife; and he got four children in the war.</span> <span id="s772">And the one, the youngest, was born after the war.</span> <span id="s773">And they all were hidden in the war.</span> <span id="s774">And very coincident, even the doctor what brought one of the children in the world got in contact with them not long ago; with one of the girls — she’s now 46 years old.</span> <span id="s775">And the doctor what brought her in the world wanted to now what came out of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">So during the duration of the war, they weren’t deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">No.</span> <span id="s778">They were not deported; they were all hidden in Holland.</span> <span id="s779">In Holland, by not Jewish people — different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Did they remain in Holland after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">And they remained in Holland after the war when they went to Canada in 1956.</span> <span id="s782">They went to Canada; they emigrated with the whole family to Toronto, in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">OK.</span> <span id="s784">And the children still live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">And the children still live there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">OK.</span> <span id="s787">Well, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">No.</span> <span id="s789">He died very young; he was very upset what was happened in the war.</span> <span id="s790">And he had a tremendous guilt feeling, I think, that he didn’t tell my parents, my mother, and my brothers that they should hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s791">And he was very, very bitter.</span> <span id="s792">And when he was in Holland later, he took the hotel over.</span> <span id="s793">We went out of the hotel, and he took the hotel over.</span> <span id="s794">And when there came Germans in the hotel, he didn’t want have any Germans in the hotel; and throw them out, out of the hotel.</span> <span id="s795">So he get a lot of problems with the police; when officially it’s a public place and you’re not allowed to discriminate people.</span> <span id="s796">And so he had a lot of problems that, so he, he was very unhappy to be in the hotel.</span> <span id="s797">And he sold the hotel and went to Canada.</span> <span id="s798">That was, I think, was one of the reasons he went to Canada.</span> <span id="s799">He was very unhappy person; very unhappy man; and, I think, because of the war.</span> <span id="s800">He felt very guilt feeling.</span> <span id="s801">And he died when he was 62 years in a heart attack, and he didn’t want to live; he didn’t took care of his health.</span> <span id="s802">He smoked a lot — three packs of cigarettes a day; and drank coffee a lot.</span> <span id="s803">I think he didn’t want to live; he died really young.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">That’s a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Yeah; it was a shame.</span> <span id="s806">He was very nice guy; I liked him very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Well, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">He had four wonderful children; they grow up wonderful.</span> <span id="s809">So he did a very good job in bringing up the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Very nice.</span> <span id="s811">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">You’re welcome.</span></p></body></html>
