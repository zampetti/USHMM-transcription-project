id="s18">Q:Let me just introduce you on the tape.</span> <span id="s19">This is October 21, 1986.</span> <span id="s20">I am Martha Bennoff interviewing Per Anger in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s21">What you, we’d like you to talk about your experiences with Wallenberg, but as well as that, also I’d like you to talk about yourself, and not just hear about Wallenberg though certainly that’s important.</span> <span id="s22">But we’d like to hear about you and your experiences, as comfortable as you are talking about them.</span> <span id="s23">In Budapest, your relationship with Wallenberg, you know, the pre-Budapest days, during ‘44, and whatever you are comfortable sharing would certainly be appreciated very much.</span> <span id="s24">If there’s a place that you would like to start, by all means.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A:Yes, well I [noise] in Budapest, you know, in, at the end of 1942 and, to work for the, there, I was assigned as Secretary to our embassy, or legation, as it was called at that time.</span> <span id="s26">And my main job at that time was dealing with the trade between Sweden and Hungary.</span> <span id="s27">It wasn’t very much of a, we didn’t see very much of the war in Budapest at that time, in 1942, ‘43.</span> <span id="s28">Hungary had already been out on the East Front and lost quite many soldiers there.</span> <span id="s29">I think they lost the whole army in some battles there against the Soviets.</span> <span id="s30">And so one had the impression that the Hungarians said, “Well, look here, now we have done our duty.”</span> <span id="s31">And they tried after that to stay out of the war more or less, which, of course, annoyed the Germans and also led to what happened further, later on.</span> <span id="s32">And so in Budapest at that time it was, I think it was about the same situation as it had been before the war, and the same gay sort of, the music, gay life.</span> <span id="s33">The Hungarians are, as you know, people who enjoy music and are easy-going people and so on.</span> <span id="s34">So it was that atmosphere still prevailing.</span> <span id="s35">And you walked along the Danube, and you heard the Gypsies playing their music, and the good food and in the restaurants.</span> <span id="s36">And, of course, people knew that the war was going on but they sort of postponed the idea of being more involved again.</span> <span id="s37">So, my job was mainly to go on as, with the ordinary work in the embassy and the negotiations with the Hungarian government about the trade between our countries and support.</span> <span id="s38">And that went on for the whole of ‘43, I would say.</span> <span id="s39">And, of course, you noticed the discrimination against the Jewish people already then.</span> <span id="s40">It had never gone to that extreme, of course, as in Germany.</span> <span id="s41">The people were not deported, but they were, there was, you know, certain professions where they were not allowed, or at least there was a kind of limited admission for students, for Jewish students, in special professions, and so on.</span> <span id="s42">So there is no doubt that there were some, there was a kind of a anti-Semitic feeling also in Hungary, not as strong as in Germany, of course.</span> <span id="s43">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q:Could it be a feeling that people were able to ignore?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A:Well it’s, I think it, you noticed it, especially if you were a foreigner and came there.</span> <span id="s46">You saw it.</span> <span id="s47">But I don’t think that the people themselves, I mean we had many Jewish friends there in the society, [unclear], of course, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s48">And when you were together with them, and so you would never give a thought of it, and they didn’t mention anything.</span> <span id="s49">So, they went on with their business, and they were mostly in the business life which was where I met those people.</span> <span id="s50">And then they didn’t complain very much about the situation.</span> <span id="s51">They, of course they compared the situation in Hungary with how awful it was in Germany and those countries who had been occupied by Germany, of course.</span> <span id="s52">So they thought that they were very well off in comparison with what happened to others.</span> <span id="s53">So, it wasn’t till March, then, 1944, when the Germans then invaded, overnight they occupied Hungary, just to force them to fight in a more efficient way on the front against the Soviets, and also to persecute the Jewish people more and to take harder steps against the Jewish population than they had done so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q:What did you see happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A:Well then, what happened then was that when they marched in, the same, really the same day, the Jewish people in Budapest, of course, I was there and I wasn’t at the countryside then, they understood what was going to happen, of course, from there.</span> <span id="s56">And they became rather desperate and they were queuing up and outside the neutral embassies, the Swiss and the Swedish, the Spanish, Portuguese, and the Vatican representation, and begging for, pleading for help.</span> <span id="s57">It wasn’t very much, of course, we could do to start because it was a new, quite a new situation, you know.</span> <span id="s58">And it’s in our instruction source, in the book of instructions I would say there is nothing said about giving protection to another nationality.</span> <span id="s59">We, of course, our job is to take care of the Swedes, and Swedish, our citizens.</span> <span id="s60">This was a new situation.</span> <span id="s61">Well, we didn’t know how to handle it to start with, but finally we tried to find the ways and means to help.</span> <span id="s62">And we got authorization from Stockholm to give a visa to Sweden to Jewish people who asked for help.</span> <span id="s63">That is, we couldn’t, of course, give the visa to 200,000 people who were in Budapest, but, so you had to have a kind of criteria to start for, to whom can you give it.</span> <span id="s64">I mean, to at least have a kind of a legal basis for this.</span> <span id="s65">So, we said, “O.K., we’ll give it to all those who have relatives in Sweden, Jewish men married to Swedish women, and so on, and those who had cousins in Sweden and whatever, and also executives, the Swedish companies’ representatives.”</span> <span id="s66">So that was also a criteria we sort of established.</span> <span id="s67">And...but the number of people asking for help only increased every time, so, every day, so it was rather difficult for us to cope with the situation.</span> <span id="s68">We had started to issue, I found out an idea that to give those people a piece of paper, a kind of a little certificate, with a stamp on, saying that the holder of this paper has been granted a Swedish visa until he or she is able to travel to Sweden; there they will be under our protection.</span> <span id="s69">I mean, a rather illegal document to wish you in a foreign country, by a foreign embassy.</span> <span id="s70">Anyhow, we did it, and to our astonishment anyway we noticed that many of these Nazi people, they were impressed with this document.</span> <span id="s71">So quite a few people managed to escape from being deported, in showing those papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q:Why do you think that was?</span> <span id="s73">Why do you think that worked?</span> <span id="s74">You say to your astonishment they...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A:Well, we didn’t think that they, we didn’t know they were that kind of stupid or what.</span> <span id="s76">But there were many illiterate people among them, see, and they were sort of impressed with this official, semi-official document they found.</span> <span id="s77">Not that everyone managed to get, to save their lives through this, but quite a few.</span> <span id="s78">And we counted around three, four hundred to start with whom we had been able to help.</span> <span id="s79">But then we couldn’t, we were only a handful of people.</span> <span id="s80">There were, say, five people at the embassy.</span> <span id="s81">Imagine, it was the Ambassador, myself, the Chancellor officer, a girl, and a driver.</span> <span id="s82">That was the whole staff!</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q:And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A:That was it.</span> <span id="s85">And so we had to put all ordinary work aside and just concentrate on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q:Can you describe a little your, recall of your feelings as you went through that?</span> <span id="s87">I mean here you were, issuing those kinds of documents, and saving lives, and knowing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A:Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q:Can you describe a bit of what was going on internally for you in...</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A:The, well, yeah, internally it was, of course, a, some feelings of, “Am I doing the right thing now?”</span> <span id="s91">Because, “How far can I go?”</span> <span id="s92">Because, “If I go too far here, then we run the risk to be expelled from Hungary.</span> <span id="s93">They might declare us persona non grata and we won’t be able to help anyone.”</span> <span id="s94">So that was this balance, which was, intrigued me the whole time.</span> <span id="s95">How can we?</span> <span id="s96">And they were all scared that they will one day discover this kind of bluff.</span> <span id="s97">Because it was after all a bluff.</span> <span id="s98">We couldn’t take any person under our protection really.</span> <span id="s99">And then the whole thing would explode and we would, it would be the failure of all our mission there in Budapest.</span> <span id="s100">So that was, of course, what I was afraid of.</span> <span id="s101">But God helped us and it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s102">And, but as I said, they, we couldn’t cope with the situation because there were, the number increased to all kinds of people whom we wanted to help and who were entitled to be helped according to this kind of criteria we had established.</span> <span id="s103">So we sent for more staff from Stockholm.</span> <span id="s104">And that is the time which coincides then with the negotiations in Stockholm between the American Embassy and the World Jewish Congress on one side, and the Swedish Foreign Office, asking us to send someone to Budapest to organize this along more, draw the lines or draw the scales, to say.</span> <span id="s105">And, well, the Americans then offered the financial support for this operation.</span> <span id="s106">And so that is how Raoul Wallenberg comes into the picture.</span> <span id="s107">He volunteered for it and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q:He was a volunteer for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A:He volunteered for it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q:O.</span> <span id="s111">K. And when he then came, can you describe a bit of how things changed in the embassy when he arrived, what kinds of things he put into operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A:Well, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q:And how he mobilized Foreign Services?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A:Well, you see, yeah, then he, see, he then, he was the man, I knew him, of course, before from his younger days.</span> <span id="s115">And then also I met him when he came in business.</span> <span id="s116">He was a businessman in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s117">And he was working with a Hungarian Jewish partner in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s118">So he was very well informed also about the situation through his Jewish partner.</span> <span id="s119">So, I think, in his mind already from the beginning he was quite prepared for this.</span> <span id="s120">He had, I noticed when he came on visits in 1943 that he was trying to contact his Jewish partner’s family, who, not that they had been deported, but they, there was coming on something they felt.</span> <span id="s121">And he himself, Wallenberg, I think he sort of thought of, “What can I now do to help them?”</span> <span id="s122">And so on.</span> <span id="s123">And perhaps he had prepared already a plan for helping them out from Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q:Can you describe him a bit, just as a man, as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A:Well, he was a..</span> <span id="s126">.</span> <span id="s127">he was not a he-man or a superman type.</span> <span id="s128">He was a, more looking like an intellectual person, a professor, like a professor, in a way.</span> <span id="s129">He was an unusual person, I would say.</span> <span id="s130">He was, but he was a great idealist and had a very strong inner strength—it was remarkable I must say—which he was going to show during all this time, which came.</span> <span id="s131">And he had a great sense of humor, which made it very easy also to cooperate with him.</span> <span id="s132">And he had all those qualities, you know, which I think was very good to have for that task.</span> <span id="s133">He was a very good organizer and...a clever negotiator.</span> <span id="s134">And he had the imagination needed to find solutions, you know.</span> <span id="s135">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q:Did he have fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A:Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q:Did he have fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q:As you knew him?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A:Well, yeah, he told me that, well, that’s the example of that which I described in my book is when he comes, then on this mission in July, ‘44 and comes into my office and dressed in a, I don’t know, a wind breaker on, and a rucksack and a sleeping bag.</span> <span id="s142">And I thought this was a rather strange equipment for a diplomat, you know.</span> <span id="s143">And then he took out a revolver and put it on my desk.</span> <span id="s144">“Look, here, this is the revolver, you see, but I don’t need it, to touch it.</span> <span id="s145">But I think it’s awful these sort of things.</span> <span id="s146">But you see I had to have it to give myself courage, because I am so scared.”</span> <span id="s147">And, I think, it’s all right to say that people who say that they are very scared, they are always very often very courageous.</span> <span id="s148">And that he was.</span> <span id="s149">He was a very courageous, very courageous person.</span> <span id="s150">And he took great risks, of course, especially toward the end of this.</span> <span id="s151">But all these qualities, you know, made him just very suitable for this task.</span> <span id="s152">He, an immense [?]</span> <span id="s153">imagination.</span> <span id="s154">When he saw these papers I had then started to issue, he said, “Well, this is fine, but we can make them still better.”</span> <span id="s155">And so he invented [unclear] to take the passports in Swedish, in there the Swedish colors and Swedish coat of arms on and all that, with the same text, of course, as I had suggested before.</span> <span id="s156">And also, he even then negotiated with the authorities and got them to approve, to start with, to approve 5,000 passports.</span> <span id="s157">And that meant to have those people, the whole of those people, live in the houses.</span> <span id="s158">We had under our protection houses, we had bought or rented with the help of the American monies, you see.</span> <span id="s159">And then he organized it.</span> <span id="s160">Then he organized this job.</span> <span id="s161">He had, rather soon he got many volunteers who offered their help, and Jewish people who, of course, had no jobs any longer.</span> <span id="s162">So there was on his staff a few hundred.</span> <span id="s163">I mean, I would say two, three hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q:How did he mobilize that?</span> <span id="s165">How did he mobilize that...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A:Well, they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q:That number of volunteers?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A:They came to him, more or less.</span> <span id="s169">They knew, they heard about him.</span> <span id="s170">They came to him.</span> <span id="s171">So, to start with those executives in the Swedish, business people in Swedish firms, the Hungarian Jewish people, for instance, they, of course, were the first to come.</span> <span id="s172">And they became the, I would say they became the top...his next in command were a few of those executives.</span> <span id="s173">And so, that was quite an elite, you know, of a new staff of doctors and scientists and executives and business people.</span> <span id="s174">And he organized them, his officers, and they took care of that, and those, his staff, and they issued the passports, and they administrated the houses where the people were living.</span> <span id="s175">You know, there was quite a..</span> <span id="s176">.</span> <span id="s177">something to do with, supply with food, and medicine and see that the whole thing works.</span> <span id="s178">Actually, we had, say, not only 5,000 people, but in all secrecy, we were perhaps hiding three times as many there.</span> <span id="s179">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q:Can you talk about that, how that happened, how you hid the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A:Well, I don’t know that we hid them.</span> <span id="s182">They were living in the houses.</span> <span id="s183">The houses were under our protection, and happily enough the Hungarians never, you know, the authorities at that time never went in and controlled how many there were.</span> <span id="s184">So, these were the houses under the Swedish flag, and so on.</span> <span id="s185">And it’s quite something, you know, to administrate houses with 15,000 people in them, you know, you see?</span> <span id="s186">So you can understand that those four, three, four hundred or what he had, the staff they had, it was a full-time job for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q:I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A:And required organization.</span> <span id="s189">And that, he was a master in naturally, so he organized it.</span> <span id="s190">And that made him also free to act himself, in person, and to, and there he becomes this legend, you know, the man who goes to the railway station and then liberates people, then to, on the death marches to the Austrian-Hungarian border and all that.</span> <span id="s191">And I was with him many times and so I saw how he practiced it, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q:Can you describe one experience that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A:Well, it was, perhaps I’d better describe, an event which I, where I was, did it myself, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q:O.</span> <span id="s195">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A:Maybe that’s more...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q:Yeah, I’d like to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A:I was with him many times, and I learned from him.</span> <span id="s199">And one day he telephoned me and said, would I. I knew, I know now that from him, that a train is going to leave from that and that station with so and so many people, for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s200">“And I have no time to go there because I [unclear] and try to save people on another station.</span> <span id="s201">Could you do it?”</span> <span id="s202">And I managed to help that moment, so I went there.</span> <span id="s203">And I practiced the same there, and did the same trick as he always did.</span> <span id="s204">I said to the German Kommandant that there are, “I’ve heard that there are people in these cars who have Swedish passports, and you couldn’t deport them from here.</span> <span id="s205">That’s, it’s not done.”</span> <span id="s206">And, “Open the doors.</span> <span id="s207">I’m the Swedish diplomat.”</span> <span id="s208">And I showed him my passport and so on.</span> <span id="s209">And they opened the doors and then I had, had the good help, that, by a Hungarian police officer, whom Wallenberg had bribed.</span> <span id="s210">Not, he hadn’t bribed him in the way that he gave him money, but he had promised him to see to it that after the war we should sort of help him.</span> <span id="s211">And then this man, I don’t know if he’s alive now because he was not that young at that time, but he came to Switzerland afterwards.</span> <span id="s212">And I wrote a letter to him and, certifying that he had been a great help, that.</span> <span id="s213">So he was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s214">He was just an ordinary policeman.</span> <span id="s215">But he was a very impressive man, a strong person, with uniform and medals on.</span> <span id="s216">And he was standing there on the platform, together with the German officers and all that.</span> <span id="s217">So, in I went in the car and said, “All in here who have Swedish passports,” and there were only two, but then I said, remembering the Wallenberg way of doing things, that, “But, I remember that you were there.</span> <span id="s218">I saw you the other day when you got the passport.</span> <span id="s219">Have you lost it or what has happened?</span> <span id="s220">Don’t you have any other documents showing that you have that Swedish passport?”</span> <span id="s221">And so they understood, and they showed their driving licenses and then the receipts or all kinds of paper in the Hungarian language, which the Germans didn’t understand, you see.</span> <span id="s222">So I said, “O.K., that’s enough proof.</span> <span id="s223">Come now, follow me.”</span> <span id="s224">And so I handed them over to this police officer, and he said, “Oh, yes, come here,” he said, with great authority.</span> <span id="s225">And he marched them, took them in front of the Germans and marched away, and we lodged them all in our Swedish houses.</span> <span id="s226">There were about 100 people at that time.</span> <span id="s227">So that is the way how Raoul Wallenberg did it, and I happened to do it at that occasion, just once.</span> <span id="s228">Perhaps I might tell you this, in connection with this, if you have, you have seen the film, the Richard Chamberlain film and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A:And I told the producer that it’s a good film [Wallenberg: A Hero’s Story, 1985].</span> <span id="s231">He has perhaps, he has accentuated my role, I said to him.</span> <span id="s232">Because I wasn’t sitting every day together with Raoul around this table and helping him and being his kind of next in command.</span> <span id="s233">Because we had them, of course, I went, I often helped him as often as I could.</span> <span id="s234">But we had there also many other things to do.</span> <span id="s235">We, this little staff I described to you became a kind of, the headquarters for quite a huge organization.</span> <span id="s236">Namely, you had the Raoul Wallenberg sort of operation, all this, his, with this humanitarian relief work.</span> <span id="s237">You had the Swedish Red Cross, who also were working for the same purpose, but not to that great extent, because they were, had no, they didn’t have the possibilities that Raoul had.</span> <span id="s238">But anyhow, they all also were working out.</span> <span id="s239">We had the Save the Children.</span> <span id="s240">And that Swedish lady was also trying to save Jewish children.</span> <span id="s241">That was three.</span> <span id="s242">And number four, which is also very important, namely that he had seven other countries’ interests, you know.</span> <span id="s243">There was Switzerland and Sweden beginning in the World Wars, so I mean the First World War and Second World War.</span> <span id="s244">We more or less took over the two parties’ sort of fighting [unclear] interests.</span> <span id="s245">I mean, you can’t have your embassy in an enemy’s capital.</span> <span id="s246">But that was.</span> <span id="s247">So, that buildings, for instance we had in Budapest the Soviets’ interest.</span> <span id="s248">We had taken over that building, the Soviet Embassy here, the Finish with the, and the Dutch, the Norwegian, and all that.</span> <span id="s249">So we had, I had quite a whole department for that job.</span> <span id="s250">We had two Swedes on the top of that, Lars Berg and Carlsson was the name.</span> <span id="s251">Those were the whole time dealing with those very important questions of helping or protecting those nationalities, you see, or which we legally could do.</span> <span id="s252">So, all this, and here we were sitting then in the middle and trying to, my boss was quite old at that time, and so he gave me free hand to act.</span> <span id="s253">So my role was more or less to sit and try to coordinate this whole operation, all this which didn’t prevent me or Berg or Carlsson or any one of those two, as soon as he asked for help, Raoul, if he asked for help, well, so we ran out as soon as we could to stand by and help with him.</span> <span id="s254">So that’s how it worked.</span> <span id="s255">And the producer, when he heard this said, “Well, I know about all this.</span> <span id="s256">But we knew that you started this before Raoul came.</span> <span id="s257">And we couldn’t portray all these Swedes here.</span> <span id="s258">We had to select one, so you may symbolize all the other Swedes.”</span> <span id="s259">I tried to explain that to Lars Berg because I think he did a very good job also, you see.</span> <span id="s260">Anyhow, so that’s perhaps a comment on my part to explain my role here, that I wasn’t that sort of every day, sitting with Raoul and running out with him the whole time to help, because I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s261">But I was with him on many occasions at the railway station and on the death marches and all that, and saw many examples of how he saved people.</span> <span id="s262">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q:Where did you get the strength?</span> <span id="s264">When so many people couldn’t do that, so many people didn’t do that, where do you think you got your strength from?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A:Well I think when you...first of all, you are young.</span> <span id="s266">We were thirty years old.</span> <span id="s267">Raoul was thirty-one; I was thirty.</span> <span id="s268">And so physically you could do it, because there was rarely a hardship in that way also.</span> <span id="s269">But when you get involved in this, you see, you, there is no way back.</span> <span id="s270">And I think that is very typical for what happened to Raoul, that he became involved in something which perhaps he, neither he nor I, had ever thought of being there, or taking that dimension.</span> <span id="s271">I mean, being, I mean, expanding to that magnitude, I mean, he...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q:At the time that it was happening, did you realize the magnitude of it then?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A:We didn’t, no, no, we didn’t, you see, really.</span> <span id="s274">We, but you were driven into it, in a way, and, of course, if you see people who are deported and suffering, of course, you helped.</span> <span id="s275">I mean, how could you help not, how could you hesitate?</span> <span id="s276">I mean, there was just to do whatever you could, to help as much as possible.</span> <span id="s277">You know, sometimes you think that you could, you should have done much more.</span> <span id="s278">And it’s a, I remember how paralyzed we were the first days.</span> <span id="s279">And I was living, we were, I was living in, well my wife and I, we rented a house where another, where a Jewish family also lived.</span> <span id="s280">And we had breakfast with them every morning and so on.</span> <span id="s281">And just a couple days after this the Germans arrived, they had disappeared towards the end of March, ‘44, then.</span> <span id="s282">And we wondered, “Now, what has happened to them?”</span> <span id="s283">And then we heard the rumors, “Well, the Germans have taken a few, not many, but they have taken a few prominent Jewish people in Budapest, a couple of hundred or something.”</span> <span id="s284">And these were many of our friends, who were the industrialists and so on, well-known Jewish people.</span> <span id="s285">So I said, “Well, look,” I went out and to see where they were.</span> <span id="s286">And I went, and I came to a place which was fenced in and with soldiers with machine guns.</span> <span id="s287">And within that territory, there I saw them.</span> <span id="s288">And I waved at them and they came closer to this fence.</span> <span id="s289">And they were [unclear].</span> <span id="s290">“There is nothing we can do.”</span> <span id="s291">And what could I do?</span> <span id="s292">I..</span> <span id="s293">.</span> <span id="s294">and we were very, we had a, a wonderful girl who was quite, had, whom we knew, we Swedes, very well.</span> <span id="s295">And there was a young bachelor, a Swede bachelor, who was very much together with her.</span> <span id="s296">Not that they were going to marry and so on, but they were good friends.</span> <span id="s297">And she disappeared.</span> <span id="s298">And her father was the, he owned a big factory.</span> <span id="s299">He, and he was then taken to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s300">But she and her mother just disappeared.</span> <span id="s301">And we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s302">We asked the, we, I think we engaged a lawyer to stop and see who, “What can you do?</span> <span id="s303">Can you help?”</span> <span id="s304">And we, and the Swedish friend gave him money.</span> <span id="s305">And I went officially to the Foreign Ministry with a note saying that, “Here is a girl so-and-so, and she is a, we,” he said, “I’m prepared to marry her.”</span> <span id="s306">And, “Here we have a Swede who is engaged to be married with this girl,” and so on.</span> <span id="s307">And the Foreign Office, they just shrugged their shoulders and they just, you know, they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s308">There, in there was the Germans.</span> <span id="s309">The Germans were working.</span> <span id="s310">And this lawyer managed to follow where they were.</span> <span id="s311">And we could follow how they were deported and just in the last minute, I managed, it was too late, he said, “Well, now I learned today that they were just handed over, they were just transported over to Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s312">If we had been able to, well we always came one day too late to find, to see where they were.</span> <span id="s313">I think that there could have been a possibility to bribe them, some guard, you know, some, to get the amount or what.</span> <span id="s314">Now see, all this, we had no routine for this.</span> <span id="s315">We didn’t know how to do it, and our...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q:You were just inventing it as you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A:So afterwards you always think, “What could I have done?</span> <span id="s318">Couldn’t we have it, tried to employ them, you know, at a house or something?”</span> <span id="s319">But then again, then we would have risked our own- Tape 1 of 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A:because I was hiding a Jewish person, which it was not allowed.</span> <span id="s321">And then I couldn’t have done anything more to help.</span> <span id="s322">So it was all this sort of, so you had to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q:That sounds like the true dilemma.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A:Yeah, it’s really, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q:To have to balance the...</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A:It’s, it was a very, very, so, therefore, the Raoul Wallenberg action was the right one, that you tried and you man-, and he managed through his ability to get the kind of authorization or acknowledgment from the authorities, from the Hungarian authorities that we could have, we could issue those passports.</span> <span id="s327">A limited number and so on, that we then issued more than that.</span> <span id="s328">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s329">But anyhow, we, he found the way of doing it in a kind of semi-legal way, see.</span> <span id="s330">And then, so that’s how it went.</span> <span id="s331">And all these episodes, and when I was with him, and so on, I’ve been, of course, rather reluctant sometimes to tell about it and, or to write about it, because people will say, “That’s, this is, this can’t have happened.</span> <span id="s332">Miracles don’t happen that way.”</span> <span id="s333">But wherever I’ve come, you know, in the world, I’ve heard stories from those who were saved by him, and they are the same stories, along the same line how he, how Raoul Wallenberg blushed all the time, and how he came with his registry he had, with the fake names, and then he picked them off and had these people sort of admitting that, “Oh, yes, we have a passport,” and so on.</span> <span id="s334">And there are two examples of how he, which I think are typical for how he saved people.</span> <span id="s335">One time, quite a few, and there was a Jewish doctor in Toronto who told me a story how he was a student at that time.</span> <span id="s336">And he was standing at the border line.</span> <span id="s337">He was being then deported by foot, now, to have marched this two hundred kilometers in the snow, and he managed to survive that.</span> <span id="s338">And so he was standing together with seven hundred other Jewish people, on the border between Austria and...Hungary—just to be handed over to the Eichmann Kommandos too, on the other side, to just to try to take over—when Raoul arrived.</span> <span id="s339">And he then said the same thing.</span> <span id="s340">“Are there anyone here, is there anyone here who has a Swedish passport?”</span> <span id="s341">And there were only then two who came, so, who had that, and they came forward.</span> <span id="s342">But then he immediately invented a way of saving the others, so he said, or the majority of them, so he said, “Well, but you will remember that the Hungarian government confiscated your passport the other day.</span> <span id="s343">You must have had this passport.”</span> <span id="s344">And so five hundred people came forward.</span> <span id="s345">And he lodged them in a barn during the night, and had them then transported back to our houses the following day.</span> <span id="s346">This is one example how he always found ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q:It seems like he would always have to find a slightly different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q:Otherwise...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A:Yeah, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q:Over time it would become...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A:Yeah, certainly.</span> <span id="s353">Oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s354">And the other example is also a doctor.</span> <span id="s355">He was, I met him in Montreal a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s356">And he told me his story.</span> <span id="s357">And that was, he was a student also.</span> <span id="s358">And he was already to, in a railroad car that must have been nailed like.</span> <span id="s359">And the train was just going to leave and Raoul arrived and he forced this Kommandant there to open the doors.</span> <span id="s360">And how this officer then takes his pistol and tells the students that if anyone here tried to come out who doesn’t have a passport, who has a false passport, “Then I will shoot him.”</span> <span id="s361">And then this doctor-then-student says, “This was a very good time for me, because I had a false passport.”</span> <span id="s362">But I said to myself, “It can’t be worse,” so I lined up in front of Raoul.</span> <span id="s363">And then, when I came closer to him he was sitting there at the table with his big register, ticking off those people who had passports or he sort of, perhaps not all of them had it, but anyhow, they were among this group which he saved at that time.</span> <span id="s364">And I whispered to him, ‘Sir, I have a false passport.’</span> <span id="s365">And when he looked up and said, ‘Look here, oh, I recognize you.</span> <span id="s366">You were here.</span> <span id="s367">I gave you the passport yesterday.</span> <span id="s368">Pass on.</span> <span id="s369">’” And so he saved, with his right hand he [unclear], just saved one person’s life like that.</span> <span id="s370">So, it’s, anyway, we both agreed, that was a very difficult decision to take, many times.</span> <span id="s371">And I think you see one of these episodes in the film that, he says to an old lady, “I’m sorry, we have to take the children first,” or something.</span> <span id="s372">But other words, you, he, the time was so precious, you know, and if you are involved in a rescue work, then it’s the question of saving as many people as possible at the time.</span> <span id="s373">And if you get involved in every single person, you know, that they were queuing up, continued to queue up us, all the offices, but if Raoul Wallenberg would sit there every day and talk to each one like that, say, and try to save people like that, he wouldn’t have been able to save those hundred thousands which he had saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q:So he really could not be appealed to on an individual kind of basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A:He couldn’t.</span> <span id="s376">He did it.</span> <span id="s377">He, there were exceptions the whole time, exceptions there.</span> <span id="s378">And many, there are many Jewish people who tell stories about that, that he managed to run to a kind of Nazi headquarter and liberate the person like that.</span> <span id="s379">That he did, but that was rare moments, because he was the whole time involved in these, first of all these passports—but that had been routine, this, issuing those passports, and so on—and, but then, after all, during the death marches he saved say a couple of hundred every time.</span> <span id="s380">So, that’s something which was more important than to sit in his office and scrutinize these applications and see if that was O.K. or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q:When you talked with him about his missions, about going out, what kinds of, what did he say to you?</span> <span id="s382">What were his personal kinds of thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A:Well, I don’t know what you really...</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q:You’re talking about the drive, that at a point you get so caught up in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A:Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q:That you’re so much a part of the experience you can’t back away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q:I was just wondering, when he had his few private moments, his few personal moments, how he felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A:Well, of course you got so upset about this Nazi sort of, that, he was, he got so, was so upset that something of that kind could happen in modern time, that it was so unreal in a way to see all this.</span> <span id="s390">So your reaction became very, very strong.</span> <span id="s391">You were always in your heart so, so angry.</span> <span id="s392">So you hated this.</span> <span id="s393">You hated.</span> <span id="s394">You couldn’t understand that people could act that way, and that they just exterminated, tried to exterminate a whole race.</span> <span id="s395">But they did.</span> <span id="s396">Of course, we didn’t know very much about it till, I would say till, I didn’t know much about Auschwitz till, let’s say, April 1944 when there came two witnesses back, two boys who managed to escape, who came up to the embassy and gave us the whole situation.</span> <span id="s397">And they had sketches also.</span> <span id="s398">And we looked and then we reported it back to the Foreign Office.</span> <span id="s399">I knew, of course, about deportations and bestialities and all that.</span> <span id="s400">But I wasn’t very much aware myself about this way of exterminating people.</span> <span id="s401">And the first time I heard about it was in ‘42 or ‘43 when I had a very good friend, a Hungarian journalist, who had been out in the war, on the East Front.</span> <span id="s402">And he told me the story then how he in a village in, somewhere in the Soviet Union, where the Germans then, which the Germans had occupied, that he saw how two German soldiers executed 5,000 Jewish people who were forced to dig their graves first and so on.</span> <span id="s403">That was the first real witness report I heard.</span> <span id="s404">And I, as he was my good friend, a journalist, I had no reason to doubt, to believe that this wasn’t the right version of it.</span> <span id="s405">So then I understood that they were, but I took it more as a, I thought, “You can’t go on, execute, say millions of people like that, because you don’t have the guns enough, and so on.”</span> <span id="s406">But they, it was, this was bad enough, of course.</span> <span id="s407">So, then we realized, of course, what, that they are, that this was going on on a much larger scale in Auschwitz, when these people, these reports.</span> <span id="s408">We thought then that this is, would be a very interesting report for the West, to hear about that, for America, for the United States, and Britain, and so on.</span> <span id="s409">And of course then I realized later on that they had known it for quite a few years already.</span> <span id="s410">I think that they were, they became aware of this already in ‘43, I think.</span> <span id="s411">So was it.</span> <span id="s412">But, they did nothing, as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A:The whole world, the whole world was passive.</span> <span id="s415">I think that’s also, to think of how they failed, how it was more important to win the war—that’s kind of the explanation—than to save Jewish people’s lives.</span> <span id="s416">And they didn’t bomb Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A:They didn’t bomb the communication lines.</span> <span id="s419">They didn’t, the Soviets vetoed any negotiations with the Germans when Eichmann offered one million Jewish lives for ten thousand trucks and all that.</span> <span id="s420">I mean, you know all the stories.</span> <span id="s421">There are many examples of this.</span> <span id="s422">And the big Jewish organizations, and all those in Palestine, then Israel, and the big Jewish organizations, they didn’t do much either.</span> <span id="s423">That is the tragedy of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s425">And you must have felt alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q:During all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A:We felt very, very alone, and we also felt that the Swedish government worried, was scared about the way we did it and so on.</span> <span id="s429">Of course, we had all the, we had, we were in a delicate situation, of course, with Germany the whole time.</span> <span id="s430">Not that the risk was very big towards the end of the war, that they would occupy us, but from the beginning we were in great danger the whole time, and so on.</span> <span id="s431">So it’s interesting to see how the Swedish government, on one hand, they were very grateful that we did the job, because that gave them an alibi or sort of a, they could show off towards the Allies that, “O.K., we are not neutral; we are helping you; we’re helping Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s432">At the same time, they didn’t give us the real tools for it.</span> <span id="s433">That is a typical [unclear] that, for this is, I shouldn’t criticize my own government, but that, it shows you how cynical the world is and how there are the political interests are prevailing the whole time.</span> <span id="s434">And human lives don’t count, so to say.</span> <span id="s435">And then they, of course, discovered, finally, that we were out in, we took great risks.</span> <span id="s436">So they got cold feet at home and towards the beginning of December, ‘44, when the Nazis had discovered more or less what started the, the Hungarian offices discovered our bluff, they invaded the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s437">That was the first start, and then they of course liquidated the embassy.</span> <span id="s438">But we managed to escape.</span> <span id="s439">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s440">But anyhow, at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q:It’s hard.</span> <span id="s442">There’s so many other stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A:There are many other stories.</span> <span id="s444">But at that time, the Swedish government came to think that we have to give them a chance to come back to Sweden.</span> <span id="s445">So they sent a cable to us saying that we leave it now to you to decide if you think it’s best thing to leave now, or perhaps it’s too dangerous for you, or part of you leave and you leave in part, or all the embassy back, and the others leave, or it’s up to you to decide.</span> <span id="s446">I mean, that they know the responsibility for, and, of course, we had a meeting at the embassy and we discussed this.</span> <span id="s447">And everyone said, “Of course, we are going to stay on.”</span> <span id="s448">Because when we had started this, the relief work now, if we would leave tomorrow, the Nazis would immediately discover, this was before they had liquidated us, before they had occupied our embassy and all, if we leave tomorrow, they would immediately discover this great bluff.</span> <span id="s449">Of course, we were all saying to them that that was the only card you could play with.</span> <span id="s450">We were all saying to them that you’ll, we will recognize your government, you know, because you’re very fine people.</span> <span id="s451">And then these Foreign Minister, Kemeny, you know, who, his wife played that role as you know in helping Raoul Wallenberg, he was kind of a fanatic person.</span> <span id="s452">But I could negotiate with him because he was the Foreign Office man.</span> <span id="s453">And so I told, the only card I could play with was that I told him, “Look here, we are soon getting the authorization from Stockholm to recognize your government and you, Mr. Minister, you will be the first Ambassador to Stockholm.</span> <span id="s454">I’m sure.</span> <span id="s455">You are so able,” and all that.</span> <span id="s456">He was very proud, you know, to hear this, and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q:You really bolstered him.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A:Oh, and you see.</span> <span id="s459">So that was how we played this game with them.</span> <span id="s460">That was the only play we, at the same time Stockholm had forbidden us, they had said, “By all means, we are, the Swedish government is never going to recognize that Nazi regime.”</span> <span id="s461">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q:Did you have any mixed feelings when they said, “It’s your decision.</span> <span id="s463">Come home, or stay.”</span> <span id="s464">And you said, “Obviously, we had to stay.”</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A:We had to stay be-...</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q:You choosing a humanitarian effort and obviously...</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A:No, no, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q:At tremendous personal risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A:We had to stay because we couldn’t, I mean it was quite logical to stay.</span> <span id="s470">If we would have left, the whole work would have been in vain, so to say.</span> <span id="s471">So we stayed on, and God helped us.</span> <span id="s472">We and nobody except Wallenberg, of course, but he wasn’t killed by the Germans, so I mean, by the Germans or the Nazis.</span> <span id="s473">They didn’t manage to get hold of us.</span> <span id="s474">We went underground when they attacked us, and we managed to escape and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q:How did you manage to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A:Well, we, that’s a long story of course, and that’s towards Christmas, then, 1944, when Raoul and I was called to the Foreign Ministry and they told us that we are going to evacuate now.</span> <span id="s477">The Foreign Minister is going to the western part of Hungary and you have to follow.</span> <span id="s478">You have to come with us.</span> <span id="s479">And no foreign embassies can stay on here now.</span> <span id="s480">And then we, and that was just what they wanted.</span> <span id="s481">They wanted us to get out from there, so they could have a free, more a free hand with the Jewish people, you see, in the last minute.</span> <span id="s482">And then the, our answer was of course that we have the instructions to stay on and we aren’t going to leave.</span> <span id="s483">And so the answer from that part was, “Well, then you have to, then you will see what happens to you.”</span> <span id="s484">I mean, it was a threat.</span> <span id="s485">So I went back to the embassy and told my staff this.</span> <span id="s486">And the Ambassador, he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s487">He was somewhere else at just that day or, I think he was invited somewhere, so he was not at home.</span> <span id="s488">And in the embassy was, there was then Lars Berg and Carlsson and the girls.</span> <span id="s489">There was those four, and the Chancellery officer, and so on.</span> <span id="s490">So I told them, “Well, look here.</span> <span id="s491">I’m not quite sure what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s492">It has never happened that an embassy is violated and occupied by those, even by soldiers or from the country where you are accredited.</span> <span id="s493">So, but I am not quite sure about this.</span> <span id="s494">And they, it could well happen that they will do something against us here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q:Did you feel responsible for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A:Yes, very much.</span> <span id="s497">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q:You were the senior with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A:I said then, “Look here, I don’t think we should stay on.</span> <span id="s500">We shouldn’t sleep, you shouldn’t sleep here.”</span> <span id="s501">They were, the girls lived in a house just next to the embassy.</span> <span id="s502">So I said, “I’m certainly not going to stay at home in my flat tonight.</span> <span id="s503">I’m going to hide together with a Hungarian friend somewhere.”</span> <span id="s504">And they all, they said, “Oh, no, nothing’s going to happen,” and, “tomorrow is Christmas and we are going to bake cakes now and have a party tomorrow for you here,” and so on.</span> <span id="s505">You know how it goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q:Taking care of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A:So I, of course, that was very flattering, of course, that they were, also from that aspect, spending Christmas together.</span> <span id="s508">But I said, “No, well, do as you like it, but we have, I have a feeling that it could happen something.”</span> <span id="s509">And so I went with this friend and slept the night with, so I spent the night there.</span> <span id="s510">And in the middle of the night there was a big, I would say towards early morning at 5:00 or something, one of the girls telephoned me.</span> <span id="s511">Of course, I had given her my telephone number.</span> <span id="s512">She said, “Now they are coming here, and trying to, with a big bus, and they say they want to evacuate us to the western Hungary.”</span> <span id="s513">And I said, “Well, try to delay it.”</span> <span id="s514">I said to her, “Try to, say you would like to pack, and then take it very slow.</span> <span id="s515">And I’ll see what I can do.”</span> <span id="s516">So I rushed to the German general, who was, lived nearby there where I was hiding.</span> <span id="s517">And it’s an S.S. general.</span> <span id="s518">And he was asleep but his aide opened, and I said, “Here’s my passport.</span> <span id="s519">Now something terrible has happened.</span> <span id="s520">The Hungarian troops have invaded our embassy.</span> <span id="s521">That’s...I never heard of a thing like that.</span> <span id="s522">But you have the power in this city, and now you have to stop it.”</span> <span id="s523">And the aide went in and the general, he just sent the message back that, “It’s not our business.</span> <span id="s524">You’ll have to talk it over with the Hungarian Kommandant about that, because I can’t do anything about that.</span> <span id="s525">These are Hungarian soldiers,” he said.</span> <span id="s526">So I went to the Hungarian headquarters and met the general.</span> <span id="s527">It was very early in the morning, this, of course, but he...just happened to arrive.</span> <span id="s528">He was a very fine man.</span> <span id="s529">He was the Hungarian Kommandant of Budapest.</span> <span id="s530">He was an old type of general.</span> <span id="s531">And I said to him, “Look here, this has happened.</span> <span id="s532">And this is very serious.</span> <span id="s533">It could mean that it will be,” and I sort of excited him, “mean war now between Sweden and Hungary here!”</span> <span id="s534">[chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q:You laugh now.</span> <span id="s536">I bet not then!</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A:No, not then!</span> <span id="s538">I love that.</span> <span id="s539">And him, he was very upset about it to hear this, a new enemy then!</span> <span id="s540">[chuckles] So he said, “Oh I’ll see what I can do.”</span> <span id="s541">So he telephoned to the government, and there was one minister left.</span> <span id="s542">And then, I understood from their conversation there was nothing to do because this means that, “Oh, the general will, you shouldn’t bother about that at all, because these are our Nazi police who have done that, and that’s nothing of your business.”</span> <span id="s543">So he came back and said, “I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s544">I can’t do anything.”</span> <span id="s545">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s546">Well, I went to my Swiss colleague.</span> <span id="s547">And he was a young man like me.</span> <span id="s548">He was in charge of the embassy, and he was just there—I still remember—he was there in his apartment, and just packing his Christmas gifts, and had his Christmas tree [unclear] and all that.</span> <span id="s549">And I told him my story, and, of course, he said, “My God, we have to do something.</span> <span id="s550">And how shall we arrange this?”</span> <span id="s551">And so on.</span> <span id="s552">And I was very upset.</span> <span id="s553">I was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s554">And of course I was, of course, now I felt the great responsibility for this, that.</span> <span id="s555">So, and then the time passed and oh, Christmas Eve, I think, the whole day, till the evening.</span> <span id="s556">And then everybody knew that we should meet at my secret place I have, I had.</span> <span id="s557">So, I was sitting there, and I had my revolver and then, waiting.</span> <span id="s558">And it was, I heard some noises, I mean knocking on the door.</span> <span id="s559">I had to go, to go [unclear].</span> <span id="s560">And I was certainly not going to give in like that.</span> <span id="s561">And that was Lars Berg coming, and Carlsson coming, and with the others.</span> <span id="s562">But the girls were missing.</span> <span id="s563">They were still missing.</span> <span id="s564">And then someone said, “Well, we have heard that they have been deported to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s565">Ah ha!</span> <span id="s566">And I told this, I told my Swiss colleague that, and he said, “Well, let’s see what we can do.”</span> <span id="s567">So he sent the International Red Cross, the Swiss gentleman, so he sent the Swedish, the International Red Cross man with his big car to the ghetto, who said to the people, “Look here, there is a mistake here.</span> <span id="s568">There are some Swedish ladies here who by mistake have been deported here.”</span> <span id="s569">And he just picked them out right like that, in the very last minute, I must say.</span> <span id="s570">These girls, you know, they told me the story afterwards.</span> <span id="s571">They had been marched all the way to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s572">And first they were lined up together with the whole group of Jewish people, against the wall, a military barrack.</span> <span id="s573">And on that wall was I don’t know how many holes from bullets.</span> <span id="s574">And then they were standing there and they discussed, “Now, should we shoot them now or should we wait, or,” and so on.</span> <span id="s575">And I don’t know how it happened, but somebody said, “Well, look, perhaps we’ll take them to the ghetto to start with.”</span> <span id="s576">Like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q:Plucked from the hands of death literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A:It’s so that’s how it happened, you know, and then how we then lived underground the whole time and how we...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q:Where was Wallenberg during all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A:Well, Wallenberg, he had then at this time, he was hiding on the Pest side.</span> <span id="s581">See he was also alerted about this; so of course, well he was together with me when, so see he also felt that something is happening.</span> <span id="s582">So he was hiding there and was not captured at that time.</span> <span id="s583">Lars Berg’s story is fantastic if you heard about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q:No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A:Well he and his friend, Carlsson, those two were in charge of the foreign interests, the other countries’ interests.</span> <span id="s586">They were at home in the house where they lived, and they had their office in the Finnish Embassy’s building, where we had the Finnish interests.</span> <span id="s587">And they were telephoned by some caretaker in the morning saying, “Look here, you have to come because the Nazis are here.”</span> <span id="s588">So, there they went and Lars Berg was immediately arrested by the Nazis, by these [unclear] people, who said, “Now you have to come with me to, with us to western Hungary and you aren’t allowed to stay on here,” and so on.</span> <span id="s589">And Lars Berg then told them, “Look here, but I can’t go like this.</span> <span id="s590">I have to go home and pack.”</span> <span id="s591">So they allowed him to go home with a guard, and with the machine gun, sitting next to him and, just to drive home and to pack his things.</span> <span id="s592">But instead of driving home, he drove directly up to the German headquarter where there was a German general whom he knew, because we had also some contacts with those people.</span> <span id="s593">Because they wanted us also to take, we hadn’t got the permission from Stockholm yet, but they wanted us to take over their interests when they were going to leave, you see.</span> <span id="s594">So he went up to the general and just jumped out of the car and told the general, “Look here, I’m a Swedish diplomat.</span> <span id="s595">You know that we are going to take over your interests, and look here, this man, this Nazi, a Hungarian Nazi, he is threatening me.”</span> <span id="s596">And the general just gave him a kick out like that.</span> <span id="s597">And then he gave, and this was the funny part of the story, then he gave Lars Berg a big certificate saying that, “I hereby certify that Mr. Lars Berg is under the protection of the...” the big German sort of empire or whatever you call it, [chuckles] with a stamp on it.</span> <span id="s598">And we duplicated that in many copies so everyone got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q:So everybody was official!</span> <span id="s600">[chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A:Was official.</span> <span id="s602">That’s how he saved his life, and also lots of...</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q:A lot of ingenuity.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A:And there are lots of... A fantastic story, I must say.</span> <span id="s605">So that’s how it all happened.</span> <span id="s606">And then, and Raoul then, to continue, then we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s607">We didn’t, we were not able to do very much, but we had contact all the time with Raoul, who came over to our side.</span> <span id="s608">We were on the Buda side, and Raoul on the Pest side.</span> <span id="s609">And the last time when I saw him, then when he came, it was bombed.</span> <span id="s610">And the city, it was bombed, and being bombed then the whole time.</span> <span id="s611">And there was rather a, not very pleasant to be out-of-doors and [unclear] because you never knew when you were going to be hit by a bomb.</span> <span id="s612">But he came and we had discussion there.</span> <span id="s613">And I told, I asked him to be careful and to hide, “Because I think you have done enough, now,” I said to him.</span> <span id="s614">I mean, “Now you have to think of yourself.”</span> <span id="s615">And then his, this answer he gives me then, which I was quoting in my book, that, “You see, I can’t go back to Stockholm if I don’t know where, if I am not quite sure that I have done everything possible to save as many people as possible.”</span> <span id="s616">And so, and then he goes back to the Pest side, and the day after they blow up bridges.</span> <span id="s617">Of course, the Germans are withdrawing then because they feel that the Soviets are advancing.</span> <span id="s618">And then these, I would say two, one or two days before they entered, well attacked the Pest side of the city, then...</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q:I want to make sure we’ve got tape here, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A:Then he accomplishes this enormous task when he saves the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s621">That is the end of his mission work, which is fantastic, how he then sends the message to the German general that, “I’ve heard that the Hungarian Nazi now planned to mass murder the ghetto, seventy thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s622">So if you don’t stop that, I will see to it that you will be hanged after the war as a war criminal.”</span> <span id="s623">And then he stops it.</span> <span id="s624">So there he saves these seventy thousand people’s lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Tape 2 of 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A:Now, where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q:I want to hear a little bit about Wallenberg after he was taken by the Russian, what your understanding was when you got that, when you found out, when you got back to Sweden.</span> <span id="s628">And a little bit of those after war years, as far as, I know, your efforts, a lot of people’s efforts, to find out as much as they could about him and his whereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A:Well, first of all, we lost very much time to start with, because the Swedish government didn’t understand, or didn’t think that anything serious had happened to him, because the first report we received from the Soviets was that they had found Raoul Wallenberg, and that he was under their protection.</span> <span id="s630">That was during the fighting then, I guess, when they entered the city.</span> <span id="s631">And this was on the 17th of January, ‘45.</span> <span id="s632">They hadn’t heard anything from us, from the other part, because we were in, the embassy people, so to say, on the, from the Buda side.</span> <span id="s633">And then we were completely cut off from the surrounding world by Christmas, because the Soviets were surrounding the city, and then they were fighting in the streets.</span> <span id="s634">Then they finally occupied first Pest, and then a month later, Buda.</span> <span id="s635">So in Sweden they didn’t hear anything about us, and they thought that, I mean, my wife, whom I had brought home with our baby, she could read in the papers that, you know, Budapest is burning, and nobody is going to escape alive from that city.</span> <span id="s636">And it’s like Stalingrad, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s637">So that was, and the Foreign Office, they had written us off more or less.</span> <span id="s638">I understood that they were very surprised...</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q:I’m sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A:When we came back.</span> <span id="s641">And so on.</span> <span id="s642">And then, but that hadn’t, you see, then again, they would have said, “Well, look here, we gave them the chance to return, but they didn’t.”</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q:Did you feel supported by your government?</span> <span id="s644">I mean it sure doesn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A:No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q:It sure doesn’t sound it.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A:No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s648">Anyhow, I don’t think that anybody felt supported.</span> <span id="s649">The Jewish people certainly didn’t feel supported by their organizations abroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q:For sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A:And then, so they didn’t, so when we finally arrived in Sweden, we were all, during that time, we were then a month later, then in February when the Russians came to Budapest, we were imprisoned then, and sitting interned, shall we say, you know, in different farmer’s houses and so on, behind the front.</span> <span id="s652">This, the fighting was still going on, but they held us behind the front like that, isolated then, and it was not possible to communicate with anyone.</span> <span id="s653">And they didn’t tell Stockholm that they had found us, either.</span> <span id="s654">But very late, then, they apparently took the decision to send us home to Sweden.</span> <span id="s655">So, we left then in the beginning of, the end of March, I would think.</span> <span id="s656">And we passed through Bucharest, where we had an embassy, and through them we were able to communicate home that we were alive.</span> <span id="s657">So, the whole time—January, February, and March—nobody knew about us.</span> <span id="s658">And Stockholm said, “Look here, the concern is now about those, and Raoul Wallenberg, he...we know that he is safe.”</span> <span id="s659">So when we then arrived in Sweden in April, towards the end of April, ‘45, and Raoul is not with us, then people started to wonder now what had happened to him.</span> <span id="s660">And then we thought the whole time that he had long ago been back after he was sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q:You just assumed it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A:You know, we assumed that he was in Sweden long before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A:So then we started to ask the Soviets, and the Soviets didn’t reply.</span> <span id="s665">“They, they were looking into this.</span> <span id="s666">We don’t know where he is, because those soldiers who found him, they have, they were killed in the action, and they don’t know in this confusion, you know, we don’t know anything.”</span> <span id="s667">And not till 1947, two years later, did we get an answer, official answer, from the Soviets, from the then Assistant, the Foreign Minister Vishinsky, saying that, “We have looked all over but we can guarantee that Raoul Wallenberg isn’t, he is not on our territory.”</span> <span id="s668">And when I came home, then, in, with this group in ‘45, of course, they asked me, “What do you think about Raoul?</span> <span id="s669">What has happened?”</span> <span id="s670">And I said, “Well, I am, I have a feeling that he has been imprisoned by the Soviets.”</span> <span id="s671">“Oh, no.</span> <span id="s672">The Soviets couldn’t do a thing like that to Swedish people.</span> <span id="s673">That’s impossible.”</span> <span id="s674">Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q:Why did you think that?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A:Well, I thought always, of course, I knew, I heard already then, I had heard already on my way, I think there are people in Bucharest who heard it, that the Swiss, the whole Swiss Embassy had been arrested.</span> <span id="s677">They took five Swiss diplomats and deported them to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow.</span> <span id="s678">And they, when I spoke to them after the war, they told me that they were quite convinced from the beginning that we were taken, because they wanted us as objects for an exchange if they, they had a feeling that they would need some persons of our caliber.</span> <span id="s679">They sort of collected VIP persons, you know, of course, diplomats are good to have because you can exchange them for...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q:As pawns.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A:For, yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s682">So that was one reason why I thought.</span> <span id="s683">And I heard that there was one special department in that prison just where they’re holding the diplomats.</span> <span id="s684">There were Italian diplomats and, of course, Germans.</span> <span id="s685">Oh, the enemy diplomats of course, were of course there, but the, it’s never heard of that they used, grabbed neutrals also.</span> <span id="s686">And then also I heard that a Swedish journalist had been imprisoned in Moscow.</span> <span id="s687">He was in Berlin, had been taken into Moscow—I heard that the first days when I came to Stockholm—and that he had met someone who said that he had been in the same prison as Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s688">But the Swedish government didn’t pay any notice to the journalist because they thought he’s, you know, he had been in Germany so long so they considered him to be a Nazi person, and you can’t believe a man like that, you see, was their attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q:Sounds like there was just so much disbelief around.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A:Yeah, there was, exactly.</span> <span id="s691">And the whole thing was these thoughts about the Russians, about the Soviets, not only in my country but in the whole western world, that the Soviets are those wonderful people because, of course, they had helped us now to win the war, and to defeat the Nazis, and they don’t, can’t do a thing like that!</span> <span id="s692">You know, there was kind of an illusion, a dream world people live in.</span> <span id="s693">And not till 1948 during the Prague coup, when they took over, the Communists took over in Czechoslo-, then one started to understand what they were aiming at, namely to take over the whole of that part of Europe and so on, even if it had been sort of decided upon in Yalta and so on, that there would be a kind of a border line.</span> <span id="s694">But apparently Roosevelt had believed in what was said to him, that these countries are certainly going to have their full independence and their own governments and all that.</span> <span id="s695">It was, of course, not going to be the case at all.</span> <span id="s696">So there was, eyes were opened then rather late.</span> <span id="s697">So the first years you couldn’t say a bad word about the Soviets.</span> <span id="s698">Then you were looked upon as, you know, as a Nazi person.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q:What were you doing in those three years then?</span> <span id="s700">You had this sense in ‘45, a strong sense, that he had been...</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A:Well, in ‘4-...</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q:Taken and...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A:So, ‘45 when I said that, they said to me, “Well, look, we understand that you have gone through; you have had some hardships and for your nerves and all that, would you like to be transferred?”</span> <span id="s704">“Yes, I would be very happy about that.”</span> <span id="s705">So we were sent to Cairo, my wife and myself.</span> <span id="s706">We had a wonderful, two wonderful years in Cairo, between 1946 and ‘48.</span> <span id="s707">In ‘48 I got a cable from the Foreign Office saying, “Now you are called home to the political department.”</span> <span id="s708">When I came home, they said, “Look here, now, there are signs, some signs about Raoul Wallenberg, and now you’ll take over that file.”</span> <span id="s709">Well, I said, “What did I tell you?”</span> <span id="s710">No, I didn’t say that, but I thought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q:That’s what you were thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A:So, that is the time when I started myself with the Raoul Wallenberg question, and going through the files, and trying to do my best.</span> <span id="s713">And what I found that the only way is is to speak the same language as the Soviets and to have an exchange for someone or to give them something or to... But the Swedish government informed me [unclear] that he has refused.</span> <span id="s714">They said, “We don’t deal, we don’t deal with matters in that way.</span> <span id="s715">That’s not in our philosophy.”</span> <span id="s716">And so it was impossible.</span> <span id="s717">It was quite impossible.</span> <span id="s718">So I resigned from that post and got another job in the Foreign Office.</span> <span id="s719">And since then I have not been dealing directly with, but I’ve followed it from a distance also.</span> <span id="s720">And, of course it, this all has been in my mind, the Raoul Wallenberg cause, of course.</span> <span id="s721">But anyhow, then after this first answer, then in 1947 nothing happened then.</span> <span id="s722">And when I took over, nothing happened because they didn’t follow my advice.</span> <span id="s723">But 1951 then the first witnesses came back.</span> <span id="s724">That was, the Italian diplomats came back from Lubyanka prison, reporting that they had been with Raoul Wallenberg in 1945 and ‘46, I think it was.</span> <span id="s725">And so, there we started to get witnesses and evidence.</span> <span id="s726">And after that prisoners of war came, and there were soldiers, one Austrian who had been in the same cell as Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s727">So, all this was collected and scrutinized.</span> <span id="s728">And then the Swedish, two Swedish judges went through the whole thing and declared that this is absolutely 100% evidence.</span> <span id="s729">And with that material the Prime Minister went to Moscow in 1956.</span> <span id="s730">And the Soviets then were very embarrassed.</span> <span id="s731">They said, “Well, we’ll have to look into this,” and so on.</span> <span id="s732">And again it took a long time.</span> <span id="s733">It took nearly a whole year till they came to their answer, when they couldn’t deny then this.</span> <span id="s734">But they found out that we couldn’t prove further than 1947 at that time.</span> <span id="s735">So they said, “Well, sorry, but there was a mistake, and he died in prison in ‘47.”</span> <span id="s736">But it didn’t last long till we had new witnesses coming forward saying, telling us that he was helping, he had been transferred from that prison to another.</span> <span id="s737">And so it was going on through all the years because we could follow how he was transported from Lubyanka to another, and he was in the Vladimir Prison in the ‘50s, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s738">And there were also, reliable witnesses have sort of appeared during the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q:Over all that time, why do you think they wanted him?</span> <span id="s740">Why?</span> <span id="s741">Why did they want him?</span> <span id="s742">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A:Well, and then—this is the question—why did they arrest him?</span> <span id="s744">And I think it’s quite clear now that they, I always said that, my theory is that they could never understand that a Swede, that the Swedish-given diplomat, stayed on the battlefield to risk his life just to save Jewish people.</span> <span id="s745">There must be a pretext for it, or something.</span> <span id="s746">There are others.</span> <span id="s747">And then when they discovered that he was financed and got money directly from America the whole time, and corresponded with the United States, the Embassy in Stockholm and so on, then they were confirmed in their conviction that he was an American agent.</span> <span id="s748">And then he also declared to them when he was arrested, just before he was arrested, he told the Soviets that, “I’m going to stay on here now and I’m going to...build a new organization.</span> <span id="s749">And I’m going to have a new humanitarian relief work start, reuniting the families and all that,” and so on.</span> <span id="s750">Then, of course, they said to themselves, “He’s going to stay on here and spy on us.”</span> <span id="s751">See?</span> <span id="s752">Now all this has been confirmed in a way that my theory is the right one when you have read the book, The Abandonment of the Jews, which appeared here last year, where on one page they quote the State Department’s quote about Raoul Wallenberg’s mission, saying that the man in Stockholm, at the Stockholm Embassy, Iver Olsen who was the War Refugee Board’s representative, and with whom we dealt all the time—I knew him well, and Raoul knew him, and Raoul corresponded with him, and he got the money through him directly and so on, quite officially and so on—so that the Soviets could follow that.</span> <span id="s753">And there [unclear].</span> <span id="s754">But, in the same paper he said that this Iver Olsen was in the same time the OSS man, that is the implied CIA, the Secret Service man at the embassy.</span> <span id="s755">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s756">And, of course, Iver Olsen didn’t send Raoul as a spy.</span> <span id="s757">He had two tasks, Mr. Olsen, so this was his function as the War Refugee Board man that he sent Raoul, of course.</span> <span id="s758">But the Soviets of course don’t make any distinction there, and they knew, of course they knew that Iver Olsen was an American agent.</span> <span id="s759">So, consequently, apparently they said to themselves [unclear].</span> <span id="s760">“Here is an American agent has sent another agent to Budapest to spy on us when we come into Budapest.</span> <span id="s761">And if we grab him, and he’s apparently a key person in this, that we might be able to get valuable news about the American Secret Service system, you know, and all that.”</span> <span id="s762">Now you’ll say, “Well, we were allies, the Americans and the Soviets.”</span> <span id="s763">But the Cold War had already started then, and the Soviets just, that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s764">So there is no doubt that this is the reason for capturing Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s765">And so then he has been there for all the years, and the Soviets never give anything away if they don’t get anything for it.</span> <span id="s766">And I don’t think that the question has really been put forward straight to them, “Look here, what do you want now?”</span> <span id="s767">I think that is the question one should have asked them long ago.</span> <span id="s768">And that’s what...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q:By the Swedish government?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A:Yeah, the Swedish government or any government.</span> <span id="s771">I would say that today we don’t consider Raoul Wallenberg’s case or Raoul as only as a kind of a Swedish concern.</span> <span id="s772">He is Swedish, of course, but he is now an honorary citizen in Israel, Canada, and America.</span> <span id="s773">And I think, and also these countries have the responsibility, and I think the whole world has its respons-, the whole western world has its responsibility because he has become a symbol for the fight for human rights.</span> <span id="s774">I mean, protocol was signed by the Soviets in Helsinki and all that.</span> <span id="s775">But I mean, if we want to stand up for human rights, I mean, then we actually we have to fight for Raoul, all of us.</span> <span id="s776">So that’s how I feel about it.</span> <span id="s777">And the Swedish government is, of course, in a delicate situation now of being a neighbor to a super power of the type of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s778">So, I am not able to judge if they have pushed with the right policy because I am out of this.</span> <span id="s779">But, they apparently have their reasons to act as they do, and I, sometimes I have a difficulty to understand it.</span> <span id="s780">I have no inside information about how serious the situation is.</span> <span id="s781">We have, of course, the Soviet submarines in our waters and all that, which we have heard about and so on.</span> <span id="s782">So this is a very tense situation when you are just on the border to the Soviet Union, which perhaps they take into consideration when they discuss all kinds of matters with them, including the case of Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s783">So we have in our committee, of course, concentrated very much on first of all spreading the knowledge about him all over the world, to increase the pressure, the world opinion, on the Soviets, and all...</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q:Is that primarily what you’re doing now?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A:Yeah, yeah, to spread it around, and to encourage, of course, the committees we have all over the world to put pressure on their governments.</span> <span id="s786">We can’t do it, of course, but it’s up to, I think it’s up to all those who feel for this cause in all the western countries of the world, to put pressure on their governments to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q:Have you seen any movement at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A:Well, of course, we are very grateful that the United States has acted.</span> <span id="s789">I mean, President Carter raised the question in Vienna with Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s790">I think that was very much on the request of Israel at that time.</span> <span id="s791">Israel, they don’t have diplomatic relations, you know, with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s792">But we, on our behalf they sort of asked President Carter if he could raise it.</span> <span id="s793">And he raised it with Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s794">We know that President Reagan raised it in November, last year, with Gorbachev.</span> <span id="s795">And we do hope that that will continue now, and that in connection with this new situation after all, with open dialogue between the super powers, and the exchanges and political dissidents and so on, the Soviets apparently wanting to create goodwill in the west, that Raoul would fall into this picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q:When was the last time that you heard of somebody specifically seeing him, knowing his whereabouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A:Well, of course, the official, the people who came forward then who was known all over the world, and then caused the, one of the explosions after a long time of silence then in the ‘60s and the ‘70s, was this Kaplan who came forward in ‘78.</span> <span id="s798">And he, when he said that he had been together with Raoul, or seen Raoul in the Butyrki Prison outside Moscow in [unclear] ‘75.</span> <span id="s799">And other witnesses have indicated towards the end of ‘77, and I think there was one statement in 1981, also indicated that they had seen him as late as that time.</span> <span id="s800">Now, today, we don’t have firsthand witnesses any longer.</span> <span id="s801">But we have single, still singles from there, where people coming have heard about him and so on.</span> <span id="s802">And they...</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q:Up, right up until the present?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A:Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s807">And if he has managed to survive the first years and then survive, and then live that long, we have reason to believe that he is still alive because he is a very strong man, both physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s808">But he apparently lives there under the complete isolation.</span> <span id="s809">So that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q:Why do you think it is that they do keep in that complete isolation?</span> <span id="s811">Why in complete isolation?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A:Well, I think that they, and that started, you see, that isolation started already when we got the, when the witnesses came back, and, those who had been together with him.</span> <span id="s813">So in 1947 we have the reports that all of a sudden, all those prisoners who had been near him, sitting in other cells around or in his cell, they were all sort of deported in different directions.</span> <span id="s814">And they saw to it that from that on, he was never together with any other prisoner, you see.</span> <span id="s815">And that has gone on then for all the years, a complete isolation for him.</span> <span id="s816">That explains why he has never been able to send any messages out.</span> <span id="s817">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q:Any final thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A:No.</span> <span id="s820">Well, I think I’ve said most of what I had in mind.</span> <span id="s821">And we are sort of, we are not giving up, but we are still working for his release.</span> <span id="s822">And, as I said, the task for our committee has been two-fold.</span> <span id="s823">It has been to work on his release, and, secondly, to work for spreading the knowledge about his deeds to the world.</span> <span id="s824">Of course, I think it’s very important for the young generation to know about this, and it should never be forgotten.</span> <span id="s825">And it’s very important that it’s taken to the historical sort of, the education in the schools and universities about this time of our history.</span> <span id="s826">It’s a dark period and part of the Holocaust and all that.</span> <span id="s827">And that if you will neglect this part in this history, you run the great risk that something of that kind could be repeated again.</span> <span id="s828">That’s very, very important, that you all the time continue and talk about it and so on.</span> <span id="s829">Well, I think that’s all there is now.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q:I thank you.</span> <span id="s831">It’s been a privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A:Very good then.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Per Anger is the author of
