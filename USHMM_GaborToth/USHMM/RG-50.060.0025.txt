Phoenix, Ariz 01:19 In the cattle car for 2-3 days, no food or water, as people died the bodies were pushed away. On arrival women went to showers 01:20 Those who lived were not necessarily fortunate, it means a lifetime of day and night nightmares 01:21 They were made to run like cattle, treated like animals. after the showers they were put into barracks like sardines, laying on boards 01:22 Made to get up at 4:30 for work, food minimal - some "soup" and a piece of bread, many passed out and were beaten 01:23 After 10 days there, they were asked who had skills and they picked 150 women with sewing skills to work in sewing blankets; she got typhus while there but she didn't go to the camp "hospital". Stayed there 11 mos.
01:24 Worked 36 hrs. at a time to be able to be in the kitchen and get an extra piece of food; feels that is what enabled her to survive.
01;25 Moved to Auschwitz as the Russians got closer; left with permanent leg injury where SS man beat her; leg swelled 01:26 Mengele came for selection process- she survived that and stayed there
for 5-6 mos.
01:27 Moved to a munitions factory in Chopow (ph) , hardly conscious - as if mentally doped up; worked in tool and dye factory 01:28 As front got closer they were moved to Theresienstadt; 7 days in a cattle car without food or water; like skeletons when they arrived; Russian advance saved their lives; many people died soon after, some from trying to immediately eat; liberating armies were not equipped to deal with inmates of the camps 01:32 Worked at a hospital helping other survivors; all SS denied who they were, supposedly the SS had a tatoo under their left arm.
01:34 They were liberated May,1945 and a group went together to Lodz, traveling on the tops of trains; found a cousin through the Jewish Organization Registry 01:38 Returned homebut home and everything had been destroyed, accosted with anti-semitism everywhere, married and went to American-occupied section Germany, after two years came to U.S. because of relatives in Chicago.
Difficult adjusting at the beginning but now have two daughters and 3 grandchildren. The world knew what was happening and didn't care - it didn't even care about the suffering of children.
