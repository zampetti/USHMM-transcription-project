SB: First of all, tell me when and where you were born.
BZ: I was born in Kovno, in 19--in 1929...to a family.
I had 2 brothers, an older sister. My parents was affluent. My father was a owner of a horse or course a were the second largest in Lithuania. A normal reli- gious family in Lithuania. We lived in downtown Kovno, in Douchgutway, later we changed to Kovnogutway.
Nothing special, till 1939. Then things started to change. With the war starting; the German, Polish. In 1940, the Russians marched in, confiscated the store.
We were already uprooted. At one time the are got wind that the Russians want to come in and arrest us as Burgoisers because we are rich people and wanted to send us to Siberia. Once we got wind of it, everybody left the house. The children were sent away to differ- ent areas and when they came to get us, nobody was home. I was sent away down the Namen, that was the river there led to a town.

If they came home--came a place, where they didn't find them, forget it. They talk go down and you didn't know when will come back. But this time we were saved. And that was after they confiscated the store.
In the beginning they put my father as a uh worker there. He worked there for a few months and then they chased him out. We had a lot of uh after we run. But you had to have some kind of an occupation. Otherwise you were already a criminal. So my father took an occupation after being a watchman. That was the only way he could get away without working on Saturday.
Later on, we saw that this wasn't the answer. We opened what we call the little restaurant in our house.
We had a big apartment with a big dining room so we made a little restaurant. Actually this was a cover so you can--people can come in without doing any suspi- cion. And between then they did a little business on the side. If anybody strange or any stranger--anybody unknown use to come in, everybody would sh--shocked white. Nobody would say a word. And just eat a meal, get pay--pay the big and then get out. That went in 19--that was 1940. Before the war--when the war broke out. That was uh Saturday night or Sunday morning, I remember that the Sunday evening we had a meeting in our house and they had to decide. My father and a lot of friends came in the house. Should we run or should we stay and wait the Germans to come in.

But even without knowing that, they decided not to run because we hated the Russians to run because they were no better than the Germans. So the decision was not to run. Those who did run unfortunately didn't make it.
Uh, it was a couple months that the Germans sent us to the ghetto. The Germans came in I think it was Wednes- day morning or Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning in Kovno. Um the time before went into the ghetto, they use to come into my house--our house to pray in the morning and they needed a median which called a qur--quorum--10 people. So people even from the house or from very close by, use to sneak into our house to pray. When they were in middle of praying, they saw a German officer comes in. I don't know what he knew but he came to father and looked at the--the--the are in the are gobbed with the film intelation. And all of a sudden, he comes to us said, 'Do you have a Shohanora?' Which is a uh actually the code of the Jewish Law. My father was amazed that a German officer should ask him a question like that. He gave--showed to him. He put it back in the suitcase and left. It didn't take more than 5 minutes. A whole group of German officers came in and questioned, 'Was anybody here? Did he demand anything? Did he ask for anything?' And that's when again interrupted the players. They didn't say any- thing and left. A few minutes later, a few big offi- cers, high ranking officers--exactly I don't know what the ranks were but they were higher ranking officers Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 4 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

We some tried to take off their telations--their--their clothes and its film.
And it no--no--no do--don't--will--will--you should not. Don't take it off. So we thought that this is the end of course us the way we--we look. The put us in the yard, put us against the wall. Take out cameras and take pictures and told us all to get back in. This was Vermacht officers. Of course they--they--ah--our uh lives were on the line. We thought this was the end of us. This is the--one of the first experiences that I had with seeing the Germans. It didn't take long. I think uh, in the middle of the summer and everybody was supposed to find a place and get there. They designat- ed an area and all of the Jews had to move there.
Looking around where to find a place to--to move wasn't easy. The Lithuanians that had to move out from that area weren't too happy either. However, my father had owned a building. I think a 16 family house--what we called a Greenenbahg--the 'Green Mountain' in Kovno.
And looking for a place, he found uh a uh Lithuanian that had a 4 family house--a 5 family house--4 families and an attic. And he said, 'How about making an ex- change. Here I give you a big house--16 families--a real income house for this little hut that you had without whatever. Without uh eh--eh--eh--eh--eh--eh--any plumbing and that's the way they exchanged houses. So we found a little place in the--in--in--in ghetto. There was 4 little apartments.
Each apartment had a kitchen and a room and a little Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 5 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

My uncle and the family--my aunt and uncle and family took one apartment. We took another apartment and the other couple families were there and the arrangements were that I didn't know. That the--they took the apartments. That's how we moved in
together.
SB: Do you remember what you took with you?
BZ: We took the bare necessities. We couldn't--we had a big apartment and Kovnogutway Katavolika. The Kovno- gutway number 14. And what we uh went--was only a room--a two rooms; a room and a kitchen. So only what we did necess--the most important things that we could think of, we took along with us. Among the things that we took with us was, somehow in a we had a--a valise with wheat--namgut wheat. And my father foresaw that in case we have to stay there through Passover, he will need something to--to make--to buy back Matsa from. So he took along that valise wheat.
That was among other things. Course, we took along a uh--we had a uh as a potato men, bible and uh whatever books. The most important books we took along with us and that's how we went to the ghetto.

C: Oops, second stix.
SB: Okay, go ahead and tell me.BZ: While we were look- ing a place in the ghetto. I went along once with my father. And that was what you call Slabotka. The ghetto was a Slabotka. Kovno was like a peninsula. It had two rivers on either side of the town. And--and at the end of the town the two rivers met. The one river was the Namen dead on the Valir. Slabotka was on the other side of the Valir. That's where the Kovno ghetto was. While going there to look for a place that we had to move into the ghetto, we walked into some of the abandoned houses that Jewish people leave before and the blood that we saw in the beds; beds unmade; cribs full with blood stains--in the cribs and that was right after the Germans came in. The Lithuanians themselves made sets of pogroms. They went through Jewish houses, killing everybody--old, young, babies in the cribs.
That scene with the blood in the beds and blood in the cribs--this I will never forget. And that was the Lithuanian watsum--the--the--the Lithuanian murderers that committed these things. Later, we have seen a lot Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 7 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

out the--the Holocaust.
SB: When you moved into the ghetto uh, were you afraid?
BZ: Fear was not the--the--the--the question. We were afraid everyti--every--every time we heard uh foot- steps. The--the--the joke was that when the Germans were coming because they--they are banging on it--the way they were walking--you could hear for--for a block away. Uh--uh--the only problem was in ghetto, in the street that we live was not paved. It was scent and uh but if you saw a German from 3 blocks away, you hid.
In ghetto itself, after it got some kind of an amolity--whatever an amolity could be in ghetto. The did have rations and they did ha--have--has--has to supply the minimal of bread or whatever this the--the minimal of uh. The never trusted incapable people to man to the uh store, to watch the bakeries and so on.
My father, being a very honored an trusted individual, capable businessman--they somehow favored him. I'm talking the ghetto administration and gave him an inside job. In other words, they should not have to go out everyday from the ghetto to uh--to uh work. But gave him a job, in the ghetto, because they needed him.
They needed somebody to trust who should administer a uh a did--a--a--a store where bread was being divided and given out on the rations to the people. So that was my father's job most of the time; in the store and Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 8 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

That nothing should be stolen. Nothing
should done un--unjustified.
Uh-and--and--they--they--they trusted him and he was the--the taking care of that job. So that's enabled him not to have to meat the German on the daily basis.
SB: And um what about humiliation to you father? Tell
me about his...
BZ: The humiliation--once while he was in the store, behind the counter, a German came in. And through seeing my father with a beard, pulled out his sword and cut it off a half a beard. And he wanted to go further but somehow from the outside, somebody called him, so he left him like this. My father being a religious man and didn't care, you know, that he would not give in to their--so he would not even straighten out his beard.
Half of it was cut off--he took a scarf, wrapped in around his face and that's the way he wa--he was walk- ing, till the beard grow back. But he wouldn't cut it.
Bigger humili--humiliations then beatings and--and uh spitting in the face--that's that was uh even worse.
Yes my uh--had cousins and other family that were beaten brutally. I remember once specific--an older cousin. I was at that time, 11--12 years--13 years and a cousin that was uh 19 came with boros from head to toe. A German--if somebody else probably wouldn't have survived. This was a young fellow, strong fellow and Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 9 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

SB: Do you remember one of the early actions--the
Intelligencia Action?
BZ: That was uh in the Jewish uh calender, Marhusbin, Ziemarhusbin--the 7th day of the month what we call Marhusbin. That was the Big Actia. Everybody had to go out on the--on the uh--the big open field and they were selecting. Right--left--left--right. At that time, the most of them were families. The didn't take--the--the--they uh not as much breaking up fami- lies but families on one side--families on the other side. Fortunately we were selected on the right side.
The--those that were selected on the left side, the pushed in to the--in the what you call the Klainagut- ter. The ghetto was a big eh highway or what for there it was a big highway, went through the ghetto. On one side of the highway, was a smaller part, that was called the Klainagutter. But being that the highway had to go through the ghetto, so each uh--each part was individually uh wired or--or uh fenced in. Those that selected were taken in the small ghetto and the next day, the morning, they took them to the 9th Fort and--and uh killed them. At that time I understand the uh 9,000 uh Jews I thing in the Great Actia.
SB: Do you remember that day?BZ: I remember the day vividly.

The day was a dismal day. It was uh--uh--uh I don't--was raining what was a cold uh damp day. And uh stayed until late in the evening and then we were sent back to the house. For my family, my uncle uh Mihnk's family--only 3 children were left on the right side--the right side; the rest of the family on the left. So these 3 children later moved into with our--with us in the 2 rooms. We had the the--the kitchen in the room and the partitions of the kitchen.
These 3--these 3 slept behind the partition in the kitchen. While we meaning my--my parents and two more brothers, myself slept in one room in the other room.
It means at night, the room became one bed. 12 were larger than a meter. And in the morning, they use to put it together because they wanted to make a quorum, a meeting in the house, even in ghetto. So the, every- thing was posed on the side and the 10 people used to come in and used to play down right there. Later they took away the books so there was uh they--they--they--they without the books, so we had--they--they--we had to hide whatever we wanted to--the--the--the few books that we kept, we had to hid them that God forbid shouldn't see it and then--then--then and that was biggest crime.

I mean it was a fleeting moment. We came in the line. Walk to the right--we went to the right and
that's it.
SB: Did you know--had you already figured out which was
the good side?
BZ: I did not remember figuring it out at that time.
But after a while, we are already realized that it was--it was the--we are were on the right side.
SB: Okay we have to put another roll on.

C: 3 marker.
SB: And in the Big Action, when you talked before to Paul, you told him that it looked like the people doing the selecting and the guarding were enjoying their job.
Is that right? Laughing?
BZ: To them it was a joke. They're kidding around. Go here--go there. I was like uh with--with smiles on there faces and uh--and the biggest joke was that uh people that did not know what was right and what is wrong. People did not know what was happening.

They did them a favor. Some--some people asked them to go the other way because families were separated so they uh--they was a joke. Ha ha you want to go there, go ahead. They--they did them a favor. It was joke.
I don't remember exactly what of the few officers there were there standing there and of course a lot of guards and uh that way they it went--in went through. Eh--SB:
--and. Go ahead.
BZ: As a result of that eh Big Actia, what we called.
People realized that many times they--they--there was a lot of other Actias but even before and after. That if you're not there and you survived it, you have a bet--better chance to stay surviving instead of going to a selection. So what we started doing is make hiding places; wuntas as we called. And of course not every house or every place could or was suitable so we teamed up with a neighbor across the street from us who had a little house. And uh the uh water source was a well in the yard and next to the house would be 10-12 feet away from the house was a barn. That we kept uh wood if you had any--anything to keep there. So we decided to dig up the barn, make like a--a uh bunker underneath, cover it up with what ever wood we could and cover it up with the dirt and uh dig a tunnel because once you went into that little house the vesti- bule had like a cold basement. I mean like it's a poured cement. That was like a basement only smaller.
It was just uh under the vestibule. So they had a trap Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BEREL ZISMAN page 13 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

The--the broke through a wall in--in--in the cement, dug a tunnel from there to the uh room that was actually underneath that barn.
Now they needed any kind of supplies. The--the wall was very close by so they made it so that they took all the first around from the well, covered it up and put the well also into the bunker. Not nowhere and they were taking water from our well that we had in the backyard. By the Klay--Kinder Actia and that was already forty ehh in '44. And then in Jewish date it was 2 days the Kinder Actia. That was the 3rd and the 4th day of the month of Yessin. We were hidden there in that bunker. However a parent of one of the people of our neighbor somehow were found that somewhere else and in order to be released or he'll thought he will be released, he snitched on us so they let should let him go. So the last--the second day of he Kinder Actia, in the late in the afternoon, all of a sudden they started banging on the wall because they already found us out. They--they wouldn't of found it unless somebody pointed a finger. And that is the one who pointed the finger at us. They took us all out and that when my father and my younger brother were taken away. Before that, when I was about 14, that was means 2 years in the ghetto, they also realized that if you have a profession or you're employed, you had a better chance of survival--at least on a day to day basis. So my father put me in the Klainerverstacten. In ghetto, I should learn a trade of Tinsmith and capable I was and picked up very fast.

So much so that what we were doing there was for half-houses we used to make the cans--the spray cans or milk cans. So it made it turning the uh medal and also uh soldering. I could answer first that it's not how you holding the solder iron or you leading the solder but how you apply the acid before and that's how the solder will be. When I once went bought in a utensil finished. It was only about 2 months after I started--you know not even 2 months and I showed him that I did--I finished it--the foreman couldn't believe it. You couldn't do it. He wouldn't trust me--said he accused me that somebody else did it for me. Till he went in the shop with me and I showed him how I solder that just like a string.
That convinced him yet that I did it. In a month later he made me the foreman for the whole shop. That was what I did in the ghetto after I was 14. My father were doing in that time, as I said before in the bak- ery. But then they were short in people to sent out for certain jobs outside of the ghetto and they didn't have enough could they send and they had to--to say that the men would of give me 60 men or a hundred men or 300 men and they were short, they'd grab whatever they could. So even my father who was employed in the ghetto had to go out--outside. Usually he did not go outside the ghetto. The problem was that this was a winter and they used to go out when it was dark and you know, father was very religious and he had to put down that film. During the day not during the night--you can not do it put it down.

That is torture because anybody that knows that there are certain limitations, certain restrictions what you can do--you need it fever and you where it film. And that is torture what few time he had to do it or other wise he was not exposed to the outside of the ghetto.
SB: In--in the house, was it cold?
BZ: In the house, we had a oven that was heated by wood and uh the back of feet was in the other room. It was in between the two rooms and the same oven you use to bake something and being like I said my father in the uh--in the uh bakery so probably had maybe a little better than most people. But in the house--the--the--the--the--uh colder the house was more or less bearable. We managed the best we could. Of course, wh--it was not comfortable but manageable according to the ghetto standard. In one summer I remember, we had uh no where to put the garbage so in the back yard--these houses were separated and each one was a small houses and--and uh lots so the whole back- yards the--the uhh be--toilets were in the--the eh--eh--eh--eh separately little houses in the back- yard. And when the--you use to did a hole for garbage to put the garbage. When the hole were filled up, you--you--you uh covered it with the dirt and dug a hole next to it.

There are certain weeds or certain ga--grass that grows on top of an old garbage dump. And I recognized that this is tomato to plants. And I didn't kept it a secret but this is definitely the tomato plants. So in the corner of the house--what we had in the other side, I took this plants and made a garden. That year I picked a hundred and fifty kilo of tomatoes. Uh I was about 14--13/14. I use to sell the tomatoes. A kilo of tomatoes for 2 kilo of bread. That helped us survive.

And what ingenuity did your mother use for example and?BZ: What uh actually helped us a lot during that, I said before, three of my cousins stayed with us. One of them were was going out to work in a kitch- en in Kovno. I don't know what kind of a place it was or for a army place or but one of the jobs was peeling potatoes. Of course the peeling potatoes and the peels they bring them home. And uh imagine that being that uh they needed the peels so that they get go home, they peeled a little heavier. But this was a uh one of the sustaining things--potato peels that came from kitchens and that way use to be washed, cooked, and all kinds of food made out of it. Even if you had to burn a little flour and make uh Kanadlak--you know, Kanad- lakha--uh potato rolls. And they put in hot water and boil it and make soup out of it. That was part of that--of our diet. And whatever else you could find or trade or people that use to go outside of the ghetto and deal with the gentiles and the give away a piece of a sweater or a uh--or a uh a garment or uh jewelry or whatever they could find for anything for a piece of food. But all in all we co--comparatively we had it uh--we managed in ghetto eh for the ghetto standard the

You asked me about heating. Anywhere you had a piece of wood that you could further tear off and bring it home. That was uh--that was brought home. Anywhere you could find a piece of uh a wire it went home. For instance, we use to, we didn't have --we made ourselves a uh what they call to--to make a high gl--uh hot water. I took two spoons wired them up, hold out a piece of cotton and uh--on--on--on a piece of wood and when you connected it and put it in the water this is boiling. You made uh makeshift things. I want to go back to the Kinder Actia when I said before when they found--the--the they found us in the bunker and they pulled us out and they made a selection and put part on one side and on the other side we did not know what's going on. But my father was on one side and I was on the other side. And then and one of the officers twist--turned it around. He said he sent my father on that side and me he pulled to the other side. We didn't know what was right and what was wrong. My brother and a girl, a daughter of the uh my neighbors escaped my uh miraculous. It was a game by the Germans had big dogs. And they told these two kids--go run!
And the dogs started off to chase them. Somehow, as I said before, it was late in the afternoon. The dog chased them. The run around the houses.

That was my personal encounter with the police. All and all, I understand that they were a--as--uh--as--uh--as--uh whole they were helping the Jewish people rather than eh hurting them. Rather than getting out. So they were not collaborating with the Germans as I've heard other places but this is as a rule eh--eh generally.

BZ: The Kovno role was the uh the Avahahvum of Vumsha- piro. That was the--that was he's name. He died in 1942. I personally as a kid, I was 9 or 10 years old, when I had a incident and that I met him and that was because there was a summer place, not far from Kovno, called Callituba. And he use to stay in a villa there.
And we were also, for the summer, in that place. One day I went in the street and I see him going out for a walk. I went over. I was very blatant as a young kid and I said, 'Good morning Kovno Role.' He took me for his hand and for a hour, he walked with me; asking me all kinds of questions and family. So I had a big honor and unusual that I had me that know--know him in person. He was very learn scholar for what I have in his book from Varabum. And uh in general he was very highly respected but uh in ghetto, I understand that they let him uh--live--let him alone.

Of course the--the--the be--be--between interruptions and between uh--uh the black clouds from the outside, we did not constantly believe, as children, we did not constantly have it on our minds. But uh we were re- minded quite often that we were in ghetto. Quite often we were reminded. Uh my cousins were taken away. I don't remember what Actia. Either they were sent to Riga or they were sent away uh and then they were--they were not there anymore. After my father and my younger brother were taken away, I remained with my uh--with my brother the--the other brother and my mother. That was--we were numb.

And Passover came, we called in a--a uh some acquiantance to make us say the--say the prayers or to say the. I think we had a couple Matsas there. But this was going through the--motions.

At that time we were already too num to look for shel- ter, to look for bunkers, to hide. Some did hide and survived. Some hid and did not make it because a lot of the houses were burned to the ground. But they had a suspicion, anybody hiding there, they burned the--the uh houses to the ground when the ghetto was liquidated.
But I understand about 7000 people, that they were liquidated from the ghetto and they took us into to--to uh the--the uh freight trains and it came--we came to Studhoff. That's where they separated the women from the and the children from the--from the other men. My brother wanted to go with my mother and my mother wouldn't let him. She understood that a better chance for--even for a young kid, to be with the men in a working camp rather than to go with the women. And he wanted to go with mother--mother pushed him away. I uh you can imagine how hard for a mother to push away a child. But she figured that this is a better chance.
From my mother, I never heard since. And I did hear about her that she was still alive. Eh in the begin- ning of the winter of uh 1944/45. A couple weeks after Sutkiss, somebody still saw her in--in--in that camp but uh near Studhoff. But after that we are never heard of her. My brother was and I myself we were sent ot Dakaw. In Dakaw, after the second week, the sepa- rated the younger kids and took away about a hundred and twenty--a hundred and thirty children and sent them back to Auschwitz and my brother with them.

To describe this airport, after I look at it and being in construc- tion now, it was fabulous eh type of construction. The actually created a mountain, put a ten meter cover of solid cement with a reinforced with the--with the uh metal uh--metal rods. And afterwards, dug out the mountain from underneath--leaving a big large tunnel where two large planes can stay--can pass by each other side by side. And at the ends of the--at the side of it, the had the shops--the workshops. That was a fabulous idea. However, they did not finish it. My brother was sent in Auschwitz. I was sent in stayed in Dakaw till April. In April they took us back to when the--when the Americans came closer, the took us to Dakaw Proper and then from there afterwards we went on the Death march in Turoll and I was liberated in Tu- roll, May 5th. My brother I didn't find. Especially I didn't find him till the--the day before Yom Kipper of 1945, which is quite a few months after liberation.
But I did hear about him in uh about 2 months or 3 months after the war ended that he was in Salbergs.
And so the whole story--the way I went to look for him--couldn't find him because he went with the trans- porter--that he thought was going to Lithuania and then he found it--it--it--it was not going to Lithuania, he skippped the transport and came back to Austria and that's the second time. That's when I found him deep in Austria, in a--in a DP camp.

the things there?
BZ: The way I understand, the committee in the ghetto, and that is Kovno ghetto, I think they--they were more loyal to the Jewish people to the in the ghetto than what I hear in other ghettos. They really transformed the ghetto in a work uh Laga--in a work force. Making the Germans, being dependent on the labor that the ghetto was providing. And I think that is maybe be one of the reasons that Kovno ghetto survived longer than other ghettos. Because after a while, they became to be dependent on the labor forces--use to go out to the ghetto in different areas to do--to perform work. In the ghetto there was the Kleineverstaten and the Klei- severstaten. The Kleineverstaten was doing the small things and also services. Like I said before, for half-houses, for other uh areas, for farmers, to--to supply them with the uh necessary things. But the Kleisverstaten, even more so.

And therefore this idea was every- body should be employed. To--they were hiding--if somebody could not be employed, they were hiding it and pushing it under--make sure that everybody has a name and a number--they are employed. And this was the idea in ghetto and that's why I think the Kovno ghetto survived longer than the other ones. With this in mind--that was the idea that I became a--a uh Tin Smith and I came--I came to a concentration camp in Dakaw.
They asked, 'Do you have any professionals?' 'Yes, I am a Tin Smith.' The end was I ended up in taking care of one of the officers in--in the Mole. For uh--for a long time, I took care of the uh hud.

When the wagons came we were called back. Every twenty people had a an S.S. storm trooper watching us besides the forman German to tell us what to do and that was for the Mole.

The wanted--had to go from one place to the other place, they had to go stand abreast--3, 4 or 5 abreast and that's the way we were marching so the German could see exactly who is march- ing--how many people we are. Because he was late and he got hell for not watching men, he wanted to take it out on me.

Before uh the uh Holocaust or now, we have either regular alarm clock or regular time clock and we have uh people that allowed to put on and put off the lights so no problem. But there was a problem. So what we did is I took a regular alarm clock that you wind up and you take the--the wrap around a piece of string and put it on the switch. You put it--the clock tight on the wall and when the time comes this starts rolling, it shuts of the light. This was we built ourselves.

So all the politics that went on, more or less, we knew it in our house. And all I know is what I heard--overheard the adults talking about.

Are we gonna cooperate with them or we'll say no--we don't--we're not--we're not cooperating. By not coop- erating it--it means two things.

Asuka means when we take a couple old doors and cover it up with some of the clothes which is the Asuka and we had Asuka in ghetto.

He was served the uh, also the refresh- ments whatever it was and then he was told that this is a Bar Mitsva of my brother. He was amazed and this is one of the two rights in the book. He was amazed how the religious people can forget about all of the trials and tribulations, all the was doing outside in the ghetto and eh--eh--eh and the Germans and still be devoted and some of us to--to play and to sing. Even so the song was something that expressed the hopeful- ness in the worst situations, we still the hope to--to God to ask him. So much so, that the man ends his book that he envys those who believe. And that was my father's character; to make somebody happy. I know of a other story that somebody would ask what are you doing on this street, you don't live here. People use to go out to work for a long long day from early morn- ing to night and that man used to pass by our house, said you don't live here what are you doing here? Said well I was hoping maybe I would meet Fivel Zisman and a few words would enliven me--would--would--would--would condole me for the next day or so. That was the char- acter of my father and that was the way people thought of him. To speak to him a few words was enough to uplift somebody and unfortunately with all the hope, some of them did not materialize. And he went perished in the Holocaust like so many other millions. But the Bar Mitsva of my brother was something special that other people in ghetto could celebrate together with
him.

SB: Was religion a form of resistance?
BZ: It was not a question of resistance. It was a question that we will not give up. That we'll not surrender. We will do us, what ever happens, we will still do us will hope and with prayer to God that some how, hopefully, we'll survive. And those that did,
did. I did.
SB: And the year that this Bar Mitsva took place, when--when was this relative to the Kinder Action?
BZ: That was a half a year before the Kinder Action.
This was in--in the beginning of the winter and the Kinder Action was at the end of the winter.
SB: Did you know anything about Partisans?
BZ: We heard about it through the grape vine and a matter of fact, I had somebody that came into ghetto that I knew from before the ghetto and he use to come in dissapear and reappear. And he use to go, sneak out of the ghetto somehow and he belonged to the Partisan.
He is alive now. He is what's his name Usic--uh I don't--I can't recall his name what yes he--he went to

BZ: Yes sure we help dig that--that tunnel. And uh I
SB: What did you do with the dirt?
BZ: On--on all four to dig a tunnel in the ground, support it with whatever we could, pieces of lumber, pieces of wood to--to support. The only way to get in is as I described before is through that uh basement of that vestibule and there was a slab of cement that when you took it out and then you could inside you had a way to put it back in place--to pull it back in place.
That when you looked at it, you see--you could see crack in the cement but you wouldn't not recognize that this was something like a door. You had to go on all four to creep into that and c--and uh 10/12 feet to go to that room that was dug out there in the room was made like uh a couple of beds like uh the one a top--one a top of the other. And that's the way if people see it set or--or laid down and there was also a problem with air. So there was a pipe in the back of that shed in the bushes there, we left a one pipe for air to--to--to--to have some air inside there. The tunnel was like a wide. It had a uh turn that it went to the--to the uh well and anytime you wanted to, you could fetch some water with a pail and a rope and from there it went back to the--to the shirt where under- neath the shirt, maybe two or three feet underneath there was two feet of dirt on top of it and underneath there, there was a bunker. So yes we built it and took us months to build it.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: night. One night the well dissapeared. No--nobody knows there's any trace of it. That we covered. We took a couple of rings, covered it up and--and--and filled them with dirt. Make sure that the growth--the--the some growth on top of it like nothing--nothing before.
And that was the--the--the bunker. While there, air was eh the biggest problem. We had also--in made a couple cans and--and--and the--the little food we did have and we spared something and right up make what we call uh Soccerringus. Made bright pieces of bread into cans, in case we have to stay there for more than Day or two, we would have something to--to nourish our- selves. Cuz we also left in cans in that bunker. But when they came in, we knew that we are found out, we had no choice but to get out of there. Had we staid there, ther would have blown up the whole thing.
SB: And what did you do with the dirt when you...?
BZ: The dirt that we put on the side and then put in on top and spread it out and put in--in--in--in on top of the well as well as there's a hole. The dirt was--it was problem when it was spread out over the gardens, especially if they did it in--in--in the uh the time that the--the--the--it was not uh the winter that people in there was big lots around the houses. It wasn't just the houses. It was a house and a lot. So there was places to put the dirt and spread it out.

think is important?
BZ: No, I don't know what else you want to know. I mean a lot of interesting stories that I have in for instance, in ghetto, since I was Bar Mitsva I use put on it film everyday. In concentration camp, we only had one pair of film and that was my last day. Many times it use to be, he use to be--he use to work day--day--day shifts--night shift and the way you use to meet and pass by and--and--and they passed by, we passed over each other--that's why--all this was taking chances with your life because had you been caught you probably they put you up and shoot--shoot you. The damage was the biggest uh thing to make you an example.
The--the--the if they--they uh hold somebody in the ghetto, the pulled everybody out and they in--in--on the lot in a--in a open field, an everybody had to run out for that--go out from the houses and watch uh somebody being hung. In concentration camp, somebody took a blanket--or what I say? --5 people took a blan- ket, tore it up and made Smata--you know what Smatas are eh? --to cover the feet--there were no socks--just to cover the feet in the winter. So they put a blank--a tall blanket--for that 5 people were hung. In-- (Audio Cassette Ends Here; End Missed) Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ DA-88 code
