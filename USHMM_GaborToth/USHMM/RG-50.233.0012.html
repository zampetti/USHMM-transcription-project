less religious.</span> <span id="s58">My mother was completely free but we were always observing the holidays.</span> <span id="s59">We went for the holidays to my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: This was your father’s father?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: My father’s father, yes.</span> <span id="s62">The other people did not observe at all.</span> <span id="s63">If you can see

see it.</span> <span id="s66">I had this picture here.</span> <span id="s67">I was in high school up to the age 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was this public high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Public high school up to the age 12.</span> <span id="s70">That’s when Hitler came and my father decided that they destroyed his apparatus, his x-ray apparatus and they destroyed it.</span> <span id="s71">My father said that’s the end and he quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What provoked them to come destroy his equipment?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Oh, these are young fellows, these are young fellows.</span> <span id="s74">Absolutely nobody told them anything.</span> <span id="s75">They just came and destroyed.</span> <span id="s76">They just were young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Were they specifically targeting Jews at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: You bet, of course.</span> <span id="s79">Only Jews, only Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So your father had the apparatus in his practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Had the apparatus in his practice, sure.</span> <span id="s82">They threw in the windows and they threw in some of the apparatus and my father said, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So that was in about 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: ’33, January 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Okay, just after he became chancellor?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s87">I know the whole family left Heidelberg at that time.</span> <span id="s88">I myself went first to Switzerland, to Basel where we had some relatives and friends that took me up.</span> <span id="s89">Where the others went, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s90">But for about three months, I didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s91">My father found a place in Holland where he could go to and he even opened a practice in Holland but it was undercover because he did not have the doctor’s license in Holland.</span> <span id="s92">So it was undercover in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Your father said no more, we’re going to leave Heidelberg and everyone split up?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s95">I don’t know where my sisters went.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: But they told you, you’re going to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: I was in Switzerland and I don’t know where the others went.</span> <span id="s98">We were reunited in Holland in about May of 1933.</span> <span id="s99">Was it three months?</span> <span id="s100">Maybe March.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: In March of ’33?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: April, maybe.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t really know for sure but I was prepared in Holland for my bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s104">That’s right, it was May and I had to prepare for the bar mitzvah in two and a half months.</span> <span id="s105">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s106">I really didn’t know much about the Jews at all but I’m circumsised and I didn’t know any further.</span> <span id="s107">The people, the rabbi in Holland who taught me, I don’t really remember him at all.</span> <span id="s108">He prepared me for the bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s109">I was bar mitzvahed in August 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Where in Holland were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: We were in The Hague.</span> <span id="s112">We were in The Hague, t-h-e h-a-g-u-e.</span> <span id="s113">The Hague in Holland.</span> <span id="s114">I even remember my address it’s __________, 37.</span> <span id="s115">I remember that.</span> <span id="s116">We lived there and more or less okay at that time.</span> <span id="s117">You don’t really know when you’re so young like I was 12 years old and my brother who was then seven years old, six years old, he was very small.</span> <span id="s118">He didn’t know either.</span> <span id="s119">I remember that I was in this house, in the highest room there was in the house, I was there.</span> <span id="s120">That was my room, the very highest.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So you had a house, just your family had a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: We had one house and we even rented a room to a boarder.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Was this a Jew, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: The boarder was not, no.</span> <span id="s125">He was very strongly not Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s126">Andrew von Ameron.</span> <span id="s127">I heard of him later.</span> <span id="s128">He was not a Jew at all but anyway, I was bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s129">A little bit later I went to Hachshara which prepared people for Israel with a different instruction such as for instance, I did cabinet making.</span> <span id="s130">I was for Hachshara, I was there four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: In The Hague, that was in -- well it was out in the___________.</span> <span id="s133">Not very far from Texel, T-e-x-e-l.</span> <span id="s134">Again the name is the Texel, t-h-e.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So you were intending to go to Israel or to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: At that time, yes, at that time.</span> <span id="s137">But then after a while my father became a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s138">His grandfather was a Frenchman in 1820 or 30.</span> <span id="s139">Also his name was Adolph and I remember that he is the one who gave us the French nationality because he was an Alsatian and my father was able to get his French nationality and we too got the French nationality.</span> <span id="s140">We moved to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: We moved to France a little bit between 1933 and ’36.</span> <span id="s143">About 1936 and I came in ’37.</span> <span id="s144">Father was already in France and he was very well established.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Where were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: In Paris.</span> <span id="s147">After Father came to France, his practice was very, very well known and well received by the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: There he was a legitimate physician?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: A legitimate physician, yes.</span> <span id="s150">There were lots of people there even though he didn’t speak too well French.</span> <span id="s151">He did very well, he did very well after that.</span> <span id="s152">I spoke very well French, afterwards.</span> <span id="s153">It took me a while to get the French accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: I guess you had been speaking Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Dutch.</span> <span id="s156">I was so good in Dutch that a Dutch person said I didn’t know you were from Germany.</span> <span id="s157">Apparently I didn’t and I also remember what car this man was driving.</span> <span id="s158">Was a LaSalle at the time, was 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: That’s when you were leaving to go to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: That’s when later on I left France.</span> <span id="s161">I saw the International Exposition in France which was starting in 1936 to 1937.</span> <span id="s162">I was much more impressed by the Germans at that time, cast a one-meter block of steel.</span> <span id="s163">That is a difficult thing to do.</span> <span id="s164">A one-meter square, cube, a one-meter cube, block of steel.</span> <span id="s165">Now that’s a difficult thing to do.</span> <span id="s166">They did this and I saw this.</span> <span id="s167">They had everything, the Germans had everything at that time.</span> <span id="s168">Well, when I came to France, I just didn’t have very much to offer the people.</span> <span id="s169">I worked in a couple of shops.</span> <span id="s170">One was the piano factory, Pleyel, and I worked in several places.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Here you were tapping your skills as a cabinetmaker?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s173">I worked as a cabinetmaker in Pleyel and I made radio enclosures which at the time were made of wood and very fancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: This was at another factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, no it was the same factory Pleyel, yes.</span> <span id="s176">We also made the composites of upper deck of the pianos and all those things.</span> <span id="s177">I did those at Pleyel.</span> <span id="s178">After a while I got sick and tired of that, I enlisted in the French army.</span> <span id="s179">That was 1939 and I enlisted September and got called up in October, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you enlist because of the war?</span> <span id="s181">The war had begun already in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s183">The war had begun in France too in September 1.</span> <span id="s184">I enlisted in the French army in October or November.</span> <span id="s185">Anyway I got assigned to the artillery in Orleans and I remember my father came to Orleans and I had to ---.</span> <span id="s186">He took me out and gave me all of the things that they would like, the grown-up persons and I didn’t like at all.</span> <span id="s187">Like how do you call these mussels that you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Escargot?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No, the mussels, escargot are snails.</span> <span id="s190">I hate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Oysters?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Oysters, oysters!</span> <span id="s193">He gave me oysters and champagne.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Your father brought this for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: My father invited me to eat oysters and champagne in Orleans and I couldn’t eat that.</span> <span id="s196">I could not eat that.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Just didn’t like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I never did try it before and this was the first time and I just couldn’t eat it at that time.</span> <span id="s199">I was a lot thinner at that time too.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Was your basic training in Orleans?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: The basic training was, no the basic training was -- we were shipped from Orleans to some other place.</span> <span id="s202">We went into the Maginot Line, and were trained there.</span> <span id="s203">After I enlisted in Orleans and I guess we were educated in military manners in Orleans, then we were shipped to the Maginot Line.</span> <span id="s204">Then I drove a car that was absolutely 1919, unbelievable with its handles, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s205">It was 1917 I think, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s206">I said I drove a car to the instructor, I said I drove a car.</span> <span id="s207">But that car I could not drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: He was looking for somebody to drive?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s210">I tried and I tried and I could not so I was shipped to the Maginot Line anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: If you could have driven the car, you would have stayed in Orleans for some time?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s213">I would have been in the Maginot Line to drive that thing.</span> <span id="s214">That was when I did that.</span> <span id="s215">Later on, it was a much better car, I had a transporter that get munitions to the line.</span> <span id="s216">That I could drive, that I could drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: I guess it was a newer model?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Was a newer model, correct.</span> <span id="s219">They also taught us 175 gun.</span> <span id="s220">Yes, 75 mm gun, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Do you remember the feeling at that time?</span> <span id="s222">Did those with you in the army feel that there is going to be a war with Germany?</span> <span id="s223">That is a physical war with Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: There was a physical war with Germany.</span> <span id="s225">You’re mistaken.</span> <span id="s226">There was a physical war declared by France in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: But the invasion wasn’t until ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: The invasion wasn’t until 19490, that’s correct.</span> <span id="s229">I think it was May ’40, May 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did you all feel that you would be actually seeing battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No, we didn’t see any battle until May, 1940.</span> <span id="s232">At that time, the Germans attacked us from Germany and at that time, I --… Was a funny thing, there were no more officers.</span> <span id="s233">I was not promoted at all.</span> <span id="s234">I was not promoted at all and I was in charge at the end of four guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Of these 175 mm guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Seventy-five mm guns.</span> <span id="s237">I was in charge of four of those.</span> <span id="s238">I don’t know how but I shot until there was no more munitions and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s239">There were no more officers, there were no people around to instruct us this, to instruct us that.</span> <span id="s240">Once we got rid of our guns after a while, the Germans were very close at that time.</span> <span id="s241">I mean with a 75 mm you shot up to about those hills over there.</span> <span id="s242">That’s how we did it.</span> <span id="s243">We shot at them, I learned how to do that.</span> <span id="s244">Then we were out of munitions, no more officers, nobody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So we’re in May 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: That was towards the end of May, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: The officers left or were captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s249">The officers apparently left.</span> <span id="s250">As my brother gave me an account of that time, is that the officers had cars and they left in cars.</span> <span id="s251">We didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s252">We were left alone.</span> <span id="s253">A few days before the Germans arrived really.</span> <span id="s254">I got out and put my identification which I had -- which was at that time, I was then called Kurt Braunschweig.</span> <span id="s255">That was the German name, Kurt Braunschweig.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: That was the name you were born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: That’s the born name I was born under, Kurt Braunschweig.</span> <span id="s258">When I saw that the Germans are going to come, I better get rid of my military identification and changed the name to Brunswic.</span> <span id="s259">There comes the name Brunswic.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: You just didn’t want them to know that you were --?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well of course not.</span> <span id="s262">These are our mortal enemies.</span> <span id="s263">It was very difficult to keep up the time anyway in captivity too.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So shortly before, you took your ID and revised the name on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s266">I buried it.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: You were able to obtain a new one?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No, I had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: You had nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I had nothing.</span> <span id="s271">I had absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s272">I know that the Germans they drove the people in front of them.</span> <span id="s273">They fired on the people from planes, just like in -- just like Mr. Picasso showed it in his famous picture.</span> <span id="s274">The famous picture from Picasso, -- my mind is not so --.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Vernacov?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: In Vernacov.</span> <span id="s277">They drove us down the road and they shot at all of us, everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Describe to me the capture, how you were captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well they drove us all together in one big place.</span> <span id="s280">The soldiers are on one side and the civilians are on another side.</span> <span id="s281">They did separate us.</span> <span id="s282">I still had my soldier’s uniform at that time.</span> <span id="s283">Well, I was a French soldier at that time and was taken prisoner as a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: How long did you actually hold the line?</span> <span id="s285">How long did you actually fight before you were overrun by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: That was about two days, 2 ½ days until we learned how to get the thing going.</span> <span id="s287">There were four guys that got the ammunition.</span> <span id="s288">We had 80 rounds, how long does that take for a 75 mm gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Probably not long?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Not long at all.</span> <span id="s291">I took maybe an hour.</span> <span id="s292">That was the actual resistance, an hour.</span> <span id="s293">Then we stayed around there and then we went there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s294">I don’t really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you have any idea of what was really happening?</span> <span id="s296">Did you know where -- was there anybody reporting to you, telling you what was going on?</span> <span id="s297">Run, the Germans are coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: That’s about the size of it.</span> <span id="s299">Run, the Germans were coming; run the Germans were coming.</span> <span id="s300">Everybody ran and I did too.</span> <span id="s301">I remember that I got a bicycle on which there weren’t any tires on it and it just -- it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: So you were able to ride away?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I ride a little bit, not very long.</span> <span id="s304">Then I gave that up too and I was taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s305">They were just coming, so many of them.</span> <span id="s306">So many Germans come through and they were well organized, well organized.</span> <span id="s307">They were not on horses at all.</span> <span id="s308">Everything was motorized, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What did you see first in terms of the German army?</span> <span id="s310">Did you see infantry or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Infantry, always infantry and planes, yes.</span> <span id="s312">Always planes, always overhead.</span> <span id="s313">The infantry came after the planes, the planes strafed us and then came the infantry.</span> <span id="s314">They were as if they were on a picnic, these guys.</span> <span id="s315">They said, well these are the French army.</span> <span id="s316">That’s all there was at that time, there wasn’t very much.</span> <span id="s317">I know that I went to -- I was evacuated at that time.</span> <span id="s318">I don’t know how I got there but I got to Bacarah and that’s about 30, 40 miles off there.</span> <span id="s319">From Bacarah I was transported in the forty men, no, a hundred men, 50 men and 10 horses on these trains.</span> <span id="s320">They had us on those trains and shipped us back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So you were in there with horses?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No, no, not me, not me, not with horses.</span> <span id="s323">The train is called either 50 men or ---.</span> <span id="s324">.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Oh, in terms of the size?</span> <span id="s326">I see.</span> <span id="s327">This is a boxcar of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: A boxcar, it is a boxcar.</span> <span id="s329">We were in there.</span> <span id="s330">We were moved to Bacarah, from Bacarah to -- I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s331">We ended up we ended up in Trier and that’s where I was registered as a prisoner of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: How long was that journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: I don’t think I can remember.</span> <span id="s334">I’m sure it was longer than one day, I think two or three days.</span> <span id="s335">From Bacarah to Trier, it’s not very far really and that’s where I was registered, 10,088, my number.</span> <span id="s336">I remember my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You were with other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Oh, plenty, plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: You were with people, you still, anybody from your company was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: They were not from my company, they were all mixed up.</span> <span id="s341">There was nobody from my company.</span> <span id="s342">Really I don’t understand how it was around there that I was not together with permanent people but I always changed so quickly.</span> <span id="s343">Anyway it was a hard time.</span> <span id="s344">This was definitely one of the worst times I passed in Germany when I was shipped out from that camp to get the barbed wire out of the west coast of Germany to the east coast.</span> <span id="s345">We got the wire from the west coast and rolled it up and they transported it to the east in preparation for the Russians.</span> <span id="s346">They took us right away.</span> <span id="s347">Finally they learned that I spoke German and from then on, it was better time.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So how long were you held in Trier?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Oh, I was all the way in Trier until late 1944.</span> <span id="s350">In the meantime I was shipped back and forth to a farm in Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Just for forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Forced labor and I was shipped back into Trier to cure me of an infection and then back to Laufeld that’s where the camp was, Laufeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: L-a-u-f-e-l-d, Laufeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What do you remember about the conditions there, at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Once we were back with the peasants, we were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s357">Once we were back with the peasants, we had much more liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: That is working on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: On the farm, yes.</span> <span id="s360">Much more liberty and at that time, again I didn’t speak German at all.</span> <span id="s361">Again after a while, they learned how I spoke it, what can I do huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: But that worked to your advantage?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It worked to my advantage, yes, it worked to my advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">I can’t say that it didn’t because if I said that, it wouldn’t be true, it worked to my advantage.</span> <span id="s365">But the Germans are our enemies, they are, they were and they will be.</span> <span id="s366">The Germans are our enemies, they do not like Jews.</span> <span id="s367">I remember one time when we were in 1943 when we were in that camp, there came a delegation of German soldiers and they asked us, which one is a Jew?</span> <span id="s368">Which of you is a Jew?</span> <span id="s369">I didn’t speak German at all at that time?</span> <span id="s370">When they came, I didn’t of course.</span> <span id="s371">I don’t know why the other guys didn’t tell these guys, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Tell them that they knew that you were or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Sure, they knew that I spoke German at that time.</span> <span id="s374">But they didn’t tell the other guys and I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s375">Anyway there was a delegation there looking for Jews.</span> <span id="s376">They were looking for Jews, which one of you is a Jew.</span> <span id="s377">My friend Jacques de Fren, good John, came forward and said, there are no Jews here.</span> <span id="s378">We are all French soldiers.</span> <span id="s379">I thought he’d shoot us right away but he didn’t and they left.</span> <span id="s380">I don’t know who was what and where but I spoke German when I was in this farm, in several forms.</span> <span id="s381">I worked in one, two, three, four different farms.</span> <span id="s382">At the end, I even got a tractor.</span> <span id="s383">This one I was able to operate, a tractor with the plowing and all of that.</span> <span id="s384">He gave this to me, the foreman gave this to me.</span> <span id="s385">The foreman couldn’t work anymore so he gave this to me to operate, so I operated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: What was the nature of the work on the farm?</span> <span id="s387">Was it just -- were these all to help out the general farm work?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: General farm work, yes, general farm work.</span> <span id="s389">I think that the hardest work was to pick up potatoes.</span> <span id="s390">When you cut the potatoes out of the ground, you have to pick them up into these baskets and I tell you it was very, very hard, very hard work.</span> <span id="s391">When the foreman on the farm gave us something to carry around, he wanted this oats to be moved up -- from downstairs to upstairs.</span> <span id="s392">He gave me a little les.</span> <span id="s393">He gave me a little less.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: These were sacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Sacks of oats.</span> <span id="s396">Gave me a little less.</span> <span id="s397">Transport the oats.</span> <span id="s398">This is the oats from I don’t know how many fields, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s399">Five of us carried the stuff upstairs.</span> <span id="s400">This was quite a bit of drudgery but we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did you sleep at the farms?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, we slept in a camp.</span> <span id="s403">We had to come back from these peasants, back to camp every day and we slept in a camp.</span> <span id="s404">There were eight of us, Laufeld had 8 prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Oh, that’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yeah, it’s a small hamlet.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Where did they hold you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: They held me in one of these little barrack type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: All together everybody was?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yeah, eight of us altogether.</span> <span id="s411">It was a small room, smaller than the outside of this, not very large.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: So each morning you’d be woken up --?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Sure and the soldier, he was very proud to wake us up.</span> <span id="s414">He said rous____.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Did you work every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yes, well except Sundays.</span> <span id="s417">Sundays we did not.</span> <span id="s418">As a matter of fact, most of the time when I was in camp, I went to church on Sundays.</span> <span id="s419">But no longer when I was in Laufeld, I didn’t go to church.</span> <span id="s420">Also we were not supposed to go to the peasants on Sundays because apparently Sunday was their rest day.</span> <span id="s421">Six days we worked, that’s all right with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Let me switch the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes, do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">End of Side A, Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: You’d work six days a week on the peasants’ ---, on the farms?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: The peasants gave us very good food.</span> <span id="s429">I mean it was probably Russian, whatever, but to me it was plenty.</span> <span id="s430">Anyway I didn’t eat too much at that time.</span> <span id="s431">It was just fine with me at those four places.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Those four places, were they all in the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: They were all around Laufeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: So Laufeld was your hub?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: That was the hub, yes, that was the hub.</span> <span id="s436">I stayed in Laufeld until late 1944 at which time the soldiers said, now you have to out and you have to repair the railroad tracks in Trier.</span> <span id="s437">That’s where we went first, in Trier.</span> <span id="s438">Of course the railroad tracks was a mess.</span> <span id="s439">That lasted for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: They were destroyed during Allied attacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah, Allied attacks, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: You probably heard those attacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s444">No problem at all.</span> <span id="s445">I mean we saw them come over every time.</span> <span id="s446">We were even, we bucked this German guard a little bit but not too much.</span> <span id="s447">Otherwise, boy, he was so nasty, would have kicked us or something like that.</span> <span id="s448">But we showed him the planes going through.</span> <span id="s449">We were in the right area between Trier and the Moselle River, on the uplands of the Moselle River.</span> <span id="s450">It’s called the Scnei, the snow_____.</span> <span id="s451">The planes came over there, not very far and we saw them, yes.</span> <span id="s452">At the end, we were moved from there, from the railroad tracks to -- I don’t really know where.</span> <span id="s453">Anyway, I don’t know what happened then and I don’t remember very well because between September or October, 1944 and January, we were moved on and certainly moved in several places that I don’t remember at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Many prisoners were moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Again in cattle cars or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: That was marched, we marched a lot at that time.</span> <span id="s458">The winter came, the winter of ’44, ’45 and how was it that I got into a hospital.</span> <span id="s459">I got into a hospital at sometime.</span> <span id="s460">We had enough to eat in that hospital for us to eat, several prisoners and several Soviet refugees and all that.</span> <span id="s461">There was such a mix of people, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What kind of hospital was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: It was a hospital in -- it was bombed -- a bombed out hospital.</span> <span id="s464">The lower floors were still going, were still intact and the top was bombed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Were you just being held there?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: We weren’t held any more.</span> <span id="s467">That was between September, October, November and then the snow came.</span> <span id="s468">I know that one of those planes, from the British plane, shot up one of those trains going through the rail that we were guarding or whatever and they were shot down terribly.</span> <span id="s469">They were saved for their lives so I felt through with them, that this was going to be the end.</span> <span id="s470">Then I got into that hospital.</span> <span id="s471">The hospital finally in January or February, no January 1945 was liberated by American troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So this hospital, the Germans left?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Most of them, yes.</span> <span id="s474">There were some nurses there.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: They had supplies?</span> <span id="s476">These were---?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: They had supplies, I don’t know, I just don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: But it was within Germany you were still?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Oh, yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s480">I was still within Germany.</span> <span id="s481">As a matter of fact, at the time I finally left Germany it must have been the end of January, 1945.</span> <span id="s482">There were a lot of people, a lot of girls too on that train that finally left Germany.</span> <span id="s483">I think I was liberated according to -- I was demobilized on February 7 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: What do you remember about the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: The first guys that came to us, to me anyway, pointed the gun at me and said who are you?</span> <span id="s486">I said I’m a French citizen and we are all prisoners here and we can’t do anything and we are not against you at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: This was an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: An American soldier, yes.</span> <span id="s489">He accepted that.</span> <span id="s490">I guess I’m a little bit forward so I spoke to them first.</span> <span id="s491">Then they came to us from a French -- not that time.</span> <span id="s492">anyway I know that I was demobilized in France.</span> <span id="s493">We had gone by cattle cars and whatever to get to Paris.</span> <span id="s494">We were demobilized in France February 7 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Were you shipped back with other French prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Lots.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Lots of everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Lots.</span> <span id="s499">They didn’t ask us anybody who is what.</span> <span id="s500">They asked us what’s your nationality?</span> <span id="s501">You say French so you get into this car.</span> <span id="s502">The other ones go in the other car.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Once you got into Paris ---o”</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No, I got to my parents by way of the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s505">They find out where my parents were and I went there about the 10th of February.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Where were they during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Oh, my parents were, first of all my father was hidden in pension in the south, way in the south near the Pyrenees.</span> <span id="s508">My father, mother and my sister they were in -- I’m sorry I have this stuff over here.</span> <span id="s509">I can’t get it because I gave it to my daughter to read it.</span> <span id="s510">I didn’t preclude that you would interrogate me on this.</span> <span id="s511">My sister was in the resistance, in the French resistance.</span> <span id="s512">She was in danger very often.</span> <span id="s513">Her husband was in danger very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Also in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Also in the resistance and my brother-in-law, which is my sister’s husband was going to be deported from France too.</span> <span id="s516">It was a matter of minutes that he was going to be deported.</span> <span id="s517">He managed not to be deported and they married later on.</span> <span id="s518">Yes.</span> <span id="s519">That was quite an interesting thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: When you came back into Paris, where did you go from that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: When I came back to Paris, my brother said he saw me and I was full of filth when I came to Paris.</span> <span id="s522">I was just full of filth.</span> <span id="s523">It was from every place, it was not very good.</span> <span id="s524">I was not very nice and clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: When you were first taken prisoner, had they issued you a uniform to wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s527">They gave a form of despates.</span> <span id="s528">In France you have these colonial troops, despates.</span> <span id="s529">This you don’t want to see because these are very large trousers that are attached to the belt.</span> <span id="s530">This is very funny, this is ridiculous and I had the despates uniform on for at least three months, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: The same uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: What do you think, the same uniform.</span> <span id="s533">What do you think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I think that -- I like to make sure we get it on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Oh, sure absolutely.</span> <span id="s536">There was no way to wash the stuff.</span> <span id="s537">There’s no way I could wash It.</span> <span id="s538">As you know, even at that time we wore one shirt and then we wore the next shirt and when that was more dirty than the first shirt, we wore the first shirt.</span> <span id="s539">This is what there was, there was not very much.</span> <span id="s540">But once we were out with the peasants we could wash our shirts, we could even prepare some food here and there.</span> <span id="s541">When we were with the peasants, we were treated very well.</span> <span id="s542">One thing that we were always afraid of is that one German soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I have no idea, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Had he beaten other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s547">But he didn’t touch me; why, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Did you speak German with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s550">I spoke German with him and why they didn’t say that I actually originated in Germany, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s551">I can’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Did you hear any news from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Well, we were prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s554">Mail was collected every several months.</span> <span id="s555">I do know that I wrote to my parents.</span> <span id="s556">First of all, I didn’t write at all because I didn’t want my name in the German files.</span> <span id="s557">In 1943, I did write and the parents answered.</span> <span id="s558">They were already in Poland and they changed their name to Bactel.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: How did the letter ever get to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: How did that letter ever find them?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s563">I don’t know what happened, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s564">I always wrote to Brunswic and I don’t know how this worked.</span> <span id="s565">It never was very regular but I did get a letter about like once a year, twice a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: From your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: From my parents, yes.</span> <span id="s568">My father signed P, papa.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Just the letter “p”?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Nothing else, but that was just enough for me.</span> <span id="s571">I knew it was them.</span> <span id="s572">After we saw the planes coming over in September 1944, we were out with -- there was absolutely no correspondence at all.</span> <span id="s573">I don’t know where they went.</span> <span id="s574">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s575">You just told me the thing that I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s576">I didn’t know how to address my father.</span> <span id="s577">My father’s Bactel name.</span> <span id="s578">I never addressed anybody to the Bactel name.</span> <span id="s579">No letter came to Bactel name.</span> <span id="s580">I was always Brunswic.</span> <span id="s581">I don’t know how they got it but they did get it though.</span> <span id="s582">They did know that I was a prisoner, they also did not know where I was.</span> <span id="s583">Of course, there was nothing to tell them where I was because the Germans didn’t give out any information whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: So you would write a letter but clearly it was looked at, information was taken out?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: It was very much looked at.</span> <span id="s586">Yes, sometimes, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s587">I never knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: They knew you were a POW though?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s590">They knew that after about 1943.</span> <span id="s591">I know that from 1943 on, they got more regular, every six months or so, they got a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: What do you remember hearing about the progress of the war when you were a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Oh, yes, we heard about it.</span> <span id="s594">We heard about it and we were very happy by the newspapers.</span> <span id="s595">For instance, I was very happy when I was in camp in Trier.</span> <span id="s596">When I translated, I didn’t translate at Trier.</span> <span id="s597">It was not Trier.</span> <span id="s598">It was another camp that we were there first and I know that the Germans had a hard time in northern Africa.</span> <span id="s599">That was 1942 and I also know that I was in four years in that Laufeld place.</span> <span id="s600">It was first in a different place.</span> <span id="s601">It was in a different place, there were American ---, they’re less than an officer, what do you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Enlisted men?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Well, not enlisted men.</span> <span id="s604">What d you call that, higher than an enlisted man?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No.</span> <span id="s607">In between.</span> <span id="s608">You’re not very informed either.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: I don’t know what would be in between unless they were sergeants or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Sergeants, right!</span> <span id="s611">That kind of thing.</span> <span id="s612">The Germans got the sergeants out of the enlisted men’s quarters and at that time I got out of the enlisted men’s quarters too because I spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So these were American?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s615">This is in the German camps, this is before I got to Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Your first capture, before you go to Trier, they hold you someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: They held me someplace, yes.</span> <span id="s618">That’s where we got the barbed wire to the east front.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: They gave you this task of ---?</span> <span id="s620">This was barbed wire they already had, they were using?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: This was barbed wire on the western front?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: On the western front and we tore it out from where it was and shipped it together on rolls and shipped it together to the eastern front.</span> <span id="s624">That was definitely so.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: That must have been horrible work?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: That was the worst time.</span> <span id="s627">The first time, that was the winter of 1940, ’41.</span> <span id="s628">That was the worst time, even I think part of it also ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: How much barbed wire did you collect?</span> <span id="s630">It must have been thousands of feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Millions, millions.</span> <span id="s632">The Germans had everything and we just didn’t have --very problematic was to grab the barbed wire and tear it out.</span> <span id="s633">We had leather hand things, leather gloves to tear it out and that was the hardest time I spent in a German camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: What did you pull it out from?</span> <span id="s635">Was it nailed into ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: No, it was not nailed.</span> <span id="s637">It was staked in.</span> <span id="s638">We pulled out the stakes too.</span> <span id="s639">The stakes were -- everything was well designed.</span> <span id="s640">The stakes were so well put in that you had to take them out with a shovel.</span> <span id="s641">With a shovel you could get in; it took a while to get these things out.</span> <span id="s642">Boy, that was the hardest time I ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: This was all in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A; This was all before, before Laufeld, yes.</span> <span id="s645">Before I found Laufeld.</span> <span id="s646">When I finally found Laufeld, I think that was the end of pretty good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you cleaned up, prepared this barbed wire to be shipped to the other front for several months?</span> <span id="s648">Then you went on to Trier?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Then I went to Trier, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Was it there they formally registered you as a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, in Trier.</span> <span id="s652">That’s right, I was not registered before.</span> <span id="s653">I was not registered before.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Where were they holding you in that first camp?</span> <span id="s655">Was there some kind of barracks or were you sleeping outside, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: No, there were barracks and just too many people in each barrack.</span> <span id="s657">You can’t do that to -- there were -- all those people were in barracks and we were in barracks too.</span> <span id="s658">After that, yes, I spoke German and then I got a bit better off.</span> <span id="s659">As a matter of fact, I told you that we first got the barbed wire off in Germany.</span> <span id="s660">Then later on they found out I spoke German and I got freed from this task.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: They felt they could use you in some other way, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Right, to get the wires (?)</span> <span id="s663">around.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: You translated for --?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I translated for the Germans, yes.</span> <span id="s666">Even then we knew how bad it was in North Africa and how bad it was in -- and how it happened.</span> <span id="s667">No it did not because North Africa was later.</span> <span id="s668">North Africa was 1942, ’43.</span> <span id="s669">I don’t know really, I’m sorry, I just don’t have my reference now.</span> <span id="s670">But that was the worst time I had was the first year I was in camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s671">It was the baddest time I ever had.</span> <span id="s672">The food was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: What was the food like?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Whatever.</span> <span id="s675">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s676">I just don’t know but there was some food just to keep us alive and working.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Do you remember anyone ever trying to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: There was very little escape.</span> <span id="s679">Why was there very little escape?</span> <span id="s680">Because at first everybody was under German power.</span> <span id="s681">The second one was there was a very great anti-Jewish community in France.</span> <span id="s682">I never forget them but I do know that the Jewish community in France, they didn’t like us very well.</span> <span id="s683">But people escaped, yes.</span> <span id="s684">I did escape twice.</span> <span id="s685">The first time I got as far as the end of the camp, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: This was the first camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: That was when I was tearing up the barbed wire out of the ground.</span> <span id="s688">The second time I escaped from Trier.</span> <span id="s689">From Trier we had two people, three people with me.</span> <span id="s690">We tried to go through France to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s691">The Alsace people, the people from Alsace-Lorraine, we got as far as Alsace-Lorraine ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: So you were able to cross the river?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s694">No problem at all.</span> <span id="s695">We got over the bridge and into Alsace-Lorraine and we were caught by a person who didn’t like the prisoners in Germany.</span> <span id="s696">Because the Frenchmen didn’t have much to eat and they thought that we were too fat.</span> <span id="s697">That was from Trier south to Alsace-Lorraine and we gave it to the German officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: This was a Frenchman?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: A Frenchman, yes.</span> <span id="s700">He gave it to the German officials and they caught us and that’s when I was in prison.</span> <span id="s701">I was in prison one month for escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: They took you back to Trier?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s704">They took me back to Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Did they march you back or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So this man who turned you all in was a Frenchman who was -- sounds like he was jealous that you weren’t thinner, that you weren’t treated worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s709">They didn’t like us and they gave us up to the Germans.</span> <span id="s710">The Germans came and they picked us up.</span> <span id="s711">I mean it was so easy, too easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Where were you when they picked you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: In the barn, in the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Just hiding there?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Just hiding there.</span> <span id="s716">We were asleep.</span> <span id="s717">There wasn’t very much and they didn’t do much about it.</span> <span id="s718">They knew exactly what we were doing, knew exactly where we were going.</span> <span id="s719">They knew exactly everything about us, they knew exactly.</span> <span id="s720">They knew who we were also or did we give them our names?</span> <span id="s721">I think we did, give them our prisoner names and that was it.</span> <span id="s722">I was one month in prison.</span> <span id="s723">In prison, it was pretty bad because I was --.</span> <span id="s724">This was an underground prison and I know that the people above ground, they were all Russians.</span> <span id="s725">They put me into this thing, into the Russian camp because, not because, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s726">They put me in a Russian camp, I was in prison in a Russian camp.</span> <span id="s727">If the Russians had not given me cigarettes and food, I might not have survived, who knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Were you in a cell by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: In -- pretty small, yes.</span> <span id="s730">About the size of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: These were Russian refugees or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, no, Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s733">This was 1943 or after.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Your buddies who you escaped with?</span> <span id="s735">They also were --?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah, and I don’t know where they went.</span> <span id="s737">They were shipped to somebody else, someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: They threw you in this little cubicle, they really weren’t feeding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Well, they gave me something, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: But the Russian soldiers --?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: They kept me and I speak no Russian or whatever.</span> <span id="s742">They were really very good pals, these guys.</span> <span id="s743">They gave me cigarettes too.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: They just passed them into you?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well it wasn’t that way.</span> <span id="s746">The thing was underneath, underneath where the Russians were.</span> <span id="s747">I heard the Russians play to the tunes la-la- etc.</span> <span id="s748">And the guy came to the -- between two of these floorboards and passed a couple of things down.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s750">Extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Extraordinary.</span> <span id="s752">I really take my hat off to those guys.</span> <span id="s753">I really do, I really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So they kept that up on a regular basis, passing down?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes, every evening, not during the day.</span> <span id="s756">In the day they could not
