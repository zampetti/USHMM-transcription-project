Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A. Before the war, my parents originally came from Poland, in the beginning of the 1920s.</span> <span id="s16">My father was a watchmaker, jeweler.</span> <span id="s17">We had a very modest life because he never made a lot of money, but it was a quiet simple life.</span> <span id="s18">I had three sisters.</span> <span id="s19">One of them passed away.</span> <span id="s20">We were not religious people, maybe the reason was it wasn't very easy in Paris in those years to buy kosher food.</span> <span id="s21">It would have been an effort.</span> <span id="s22">My mother stopped after a little while to go to a small Jewish section of Paris to buy kosher food.</span> <span id="s23">So, we started to live like everybody in the neighborhood without being kosher, and our religion was not very, very important in our household.</span> <span id="s24">During the 1930s, even I being a young boy, listening to the radios, reading some newspapers, hearing my parents when they were talking, we heard what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s25">You know, we were religious, but we still were very Jewish.</span> <span id="s26">I knew personally some of the tradition.</span> <span id="s27">I knew some of the holidays, but I never went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s28">But this being Jewish I knew it and I felt it; I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s29">What was going on in Germany touched us.</span> <span id="s30">In the later 30s I started to see some people coming from Germany, and they were Jews who were running away.</span> <span id="s31">I was hearing some of the hardship they had in the country.</span> <span id="s32">But it didn't you know it was something I heard, but I didn't feel it.</span> <span id="s33">I was too young, but I knew about it.</span> <span id="s34">In 1939, just before the war, I was listening to the radio like most of the people and we heard that there might be a war against Germany.</span> <span id="s35">Germany attacked Poland, there might be a war, but we didn't have to worry about it because we were so strong.</span> <span id="s36">France was so strong, that if Germany ever they are doing anything, we would run over them in a very short time.</span> <span id="s37">And all this was lies.</span> <span id="s38">But we believed it.</span> <span id="s39">Every single day we heard that propaganda And the poor folks everything was a lie, because it took the German army to conquer France in a couple weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q.</span> <span id="s41">In Paris you went to a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q. And were you friends very mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A. Mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q. Catholic, Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A. Mixed, that's how religion is because we didn't have any allies, we didn't have any black people, because before the war it was very rare when you saw a black person in the street.</span> <span id="s47">So, when we talk about mix, it was religion.</span> <span id="s48">But like I say, I didn't feel any different between the Christian and me.</span> <span id="s49">Enough of this, I have the feeling it never went to their mind that I was different than they were.</span> <span id="s50">Because we were a small minority, and as long as they knew that I was born in Paris.</span> <span id="s51">I spoke like them.</span> <span id="s52">I didn't have any accent, so I must have been in their mind, I'm sure, they must have thought I was like them, a Christian.</span> <span id="s53">Even when I was in the Army, it never went to their mind that I could have been different.</span> <span id="s54">That's how religion was.</span> <span id="s55">My mannerism and everything was Parisian.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q.</span> <span id="s57">You never were aware of anti-semitism as a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A. I knew it existed because I knew how you know sometime when people were arguing or fighting they said to somebody else, you know, he's a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s59">But I don't know, but it never was addressed to me, because I don't want to sound macho, but I wouldn't have tolerated it.</span> <span id="s60">So, they did nothing to me.</span> <span id="s61">I already didn't feel anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s62">I didn't feel anything like that when I was a young kid in school.</span> <span id="s63">I was like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q.</span> <span id="s65">What do you remember about the Germany occupation, the first days?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A.</span> <span id="s67">What I remember is I really saw the Germans in 1940.</span> <span id="s68">I didn't see them in 1939, because when the war started my father was called into the army and like the result of all that propaganda and all this they mobilized a million people, but they were not ready for it.</span> <span id="s69">My father had half of a uniform, no guns, sleeping in the subway.</span> <span id="s70">You know, this was supposed to be the 12 median French army.</span> <span id="s71">So, the commander decided, and I think in the end of 1939, tried to evacuate women and children from Paris.</span> <span id="s72">Not because we didn't know you know the Germans were going to bomb Paris, whatever, so they decided -- and also I remember in school they gave us some gas masks, that you were supposed to carry at all times with our gas masks in it.</span> <span id="s73">Like I was saying before, they decided to evacuate women and children and we were to register, the women and children, and they send us out I think about 100 miles from Paris, in small little villages.</span> <span id="s74">And this is where my mother, my sister and myself went.</span> <span id="s75">It lasted a few months, until the Germans really had their offensive.</span> <span id="s76">One day the offensive, they had a big offensive all of a sudden they are finally I think they realized they had so many men in the army, but they didn't have anything to give them.</span> <span id="s77">So, what they did, they released my father who had four children.</span> <span id="s78">When my father was released, the first thing he did was go into the village where we were.</span> <span id="s79">When he got there, he heard on the radio where the German army is advancing and the French government did something also not very smart.</span> <span id="s80">They made a call over the radio that all men 13 years old must try to move to _____________ to reform and fight the Germans there.</span> <span id="s81">I never saw a gun in my life.</span> <span id="s82">I'm 13 and they're going to make me fight there.</span> <span id="s83">But, we decided the Germans are not going to catch us.</span> <span id="s84">We didn't have any transport.</span> <span id="s85">We didn't have anything, we started to work, and we found some trucks going by or whatever and we got a lift.</span> <span id="s86">We got to a train station and then we tried to get on the train, and we finally got to ___________.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q.</span> <span id="s88">When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A. 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q.</span> <span id="s91">In June?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A. I think it was the early part of 1940, maybe in June.</span> <span id="s93">May, June, I don't remember very well.</span> <span id="s94">It wasn't very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q.</span> <span id="s96">But you hadn't yet seen Germans coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A. I didn't see them.</span> <span id="s98">We knew while we were on the road going to _____________ we saw the plane bombing us.</span> <span id="s99">You know you had thousands and thousands of refugees, you know, the farmer was there with his animals.</span> <span id="s100">We had people on bicycles, people walking.</span> <span id="s101">You're talking about people on the ___________ and all of a sudden you saw those German plane come in, he started shooting.</span> <span id="s102">So, my father, we finally reached the salt mines, and we met another refugee like this and talking to them, some of them were Jewish, and they said we are going over to Purinae, over to Spain.</span> <span id="s103">If you have anybody in the United States, try to reach Lisbon.</span> <span id="s104">The American consulate will try to get you some papers to reach America.</span> <span id="s105">So, my father had a brother there in New York.</span> <span id="s106">So, we said, Okay, let's try it.</span> <span id="s107">When we got to the border we were stopped.</span> <span id="s108">We said okay, we are going to go in Spain but what's going to end up with my mother and sisters.</span> <span id="s109">I cannot abandon them.</span> <span id="s110">So, we decided to go back.</span> <span id="s111">We couldn't leave my mother.</span> <span id="s112">So, we decided to go back because we could not abandon my mother and sisters.</span> <span id="s113">And then France was divided.</span> <span id="s114">Already the German army stopped in the middle of France with an armistice and the northern part, the Germans were there, and the southern part was the Vichy government.</span> <span id="s115">So, I don't remember exactly the date, but we got on board a train and got back to Paris.</span> <span id="s116">In the meantime, my mother and sisters were back into Paris, and when I got to the border between South France, northern part, this is when I saw the Germans for the first time.</span> <span id="s117">They went to the train, but it wasn't that important because he had so many people trying to get back to their home, so they didn't look at us too close.</span> <span id="s118">We got into Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q. Was it frightening to see the German presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A. No, not at all.</span> <span id="s121">It was orders and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q. Was it fairly easy to go back and forth between Vichy and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A.</span> <span id="s124">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s125">It was not easy because after that you need a visa, which we are talking a few days after the armistice was signed.</span> <span id="s126">So, I really don't think they were organized to really put a lot of control, you know, between the north and the south.</span> <span id="s127">So, we got into Paris and then life went back more or less normal.</span> <span id="s128">You saw Germans in the streets of Paris.</span> <span id="s129">All of a sudden a few months later, I think it was the beginning of 1941, all of a sudden we were told if we were a Jew, we had to register.</span> <span id="s130">We had to go to what we called _____________ police, you know the man in the police station to register as Jews.</span> <span id="s131">But not really knowing what anti-semitism was, so we really didn't care.</span> <span id="s132">If you want to know if we are Jews, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s133">We went there and there were lines of people who registered.</span> <span id="s134">I think at that time they put a stamp on our identification card, because every French person must have an identity card, and they gave us a gold star, a Jewish star, the Star of David.</span> <span id="s135">They told us you must put it on your clothes.</span> <span id="s136">And also, certain restrictions.</span> <span id="s137">If we took the subway, we were to go only in the last wagon.</span> <span id="s138">We were not allowed to go to public places.</span> <span id="s139">So, my mother sewed my clothes, the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s140">The next day, I told my mother, take it off, please.</span> <span id="s141">She said, no why?</span> <span id="s142">I said, nothing doing.</span> <span id="s143">I said if they are going to decide to pick me up, I'm not going to make it easy for them.</span> <span id="s144">You know, I don't look exactly like what the Germans think a Jew looks like, you know with the big nose and things like that.</span> <span id="s145">I said no.</span> <span id="s146">After arguing for a little while, she took it off.</span> <span id="s147">I could not accept those restrictions.</span> <span id="s148">I wanted to be able to go into a park.</span> <span id="s149">I want to get into a move.</span> <span id="s150">I was young.</span> <span id="s151">The danger was not that great.</span> <span id="s152">And after that, we noticed something else.</span> <span id="s153">They were starting to pick up Jews, but they were picking up mostly foreign Jews.</span> <span id="s154">We noticed what they were doing, they knew people were coming back from work at 6:00 at night, so they were closing off streets not far from the main subway stations.</span> <span id="s155">So, I worked out with my father.</span> <span id="s156">I said I'll go at the time he was supposed to come back home, and I will walk in front of him about 1,500 hundred feet.</span> <span id="s157">If I saw them, closing the street I being a young fellow, I could run pretty fast in those days, I was running back and I would have told him and we would have taken another way of going home.</span> <span id="s158">This is what we did for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q. Now, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s160">You were born in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q.</span> <span id="s163">But your parents were not born --?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A. My parents were born in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q. Would they have been vulnerable to the roundups?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A. No, no, because you see lucky for us, my father and my mother thought Poland is not for them.</span> <span id="s167">They were born there and they saw the anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s168">They saw how bad it was for the Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s169">So, one day they decided to -- the original idea was to go to America, but they couldn't get a visa.</span> <span id="s170">In France, in the early 20s needed people to work in the mines in northern France, to work in the factories, things like that, so they were letting foreigners come to do the work that Frenchman would not do.</span> <span id="s171">So, my father got a job with Renault.</span> <span id="s172">He had in mind, I can't go to America, I'm going to stay in France.</span> <span id="s173">I might as well try to become a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s174">I have the privilege and obligation of a citizen.</span> <span id="s175">I don't want to be a foreigner in a country.</span> <span id="s176">So, what he did, after a couple of years, he applied for citizenship and he was a Frenchman and my mother and this is what French people do.</span> <span id="s177">Being born would have made me a Frenchman, but still they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s178">So, you know, they were picking on the foreign Jews more or less, but we knew it was a matter of time for us.</span> <span id="s179">So, this was our life from about 1941 to 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q. Were you in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A. I was in school.</span> <span id="s182">I was in school but they were looking for trouble.</span> <span id="s183">They give us all the time in school.</span> <span id="s184">I couldn't continue with certain things.</span> <span id="s185">They put me in another school, some kind of what do you call, trade school.</span> <span id="s186">They really tried to get us out all the time.</span> <span id="s187">This was until 1942.</span> <span id="s188">In the beginning of 1942, I think the end of June or the beginning of July, all of a sudden we heard it was going to be bad for the Jews.</span> <span id="s189">We already had all those laws.</span> <span id="s190">We had all those restrictions, and talking to some older fellows they told me a little bit more about it.</span> <span id="s191">They said they know from somebody in the police department they messed up picking up the Jews of Paris.</span> <span id="s192">I think it was the 14th of 15th of July all of a sudden I was told to warn the Jews in my neighborhood that I knew, they were coming to pick up the Jews.</span> <span id="s193">But they are going to pick up the men and the boys.</span> <span id="s194">This is what they are going to pick up.</span> <span id="s195">So, they asked me to warn anybody I knew.</span> <span id="s196">Those people must have been from the resistance, I don't know where, but they had the knowledge I didn't have, and they told me, they asked me to do it.</span> <span id="s197">So, I started to tell everybody I knew.</span> <span id="s198">I chose men and boys and on the 15th it will happen.</span> <span id="s199">So, again you warn everybody.</span> <span id="s200">So, a lot of men with their sons who believed it will happen, who believed us, they tried to find a place to hide and to see what will happen.</span> <span id="s201">I went with my older sister, -- let me go back to something.</span> <span id="s202">Let me go back to something else.</span> <span id="s203">It was getting very bad in Paris in the beginning of 1942, and we knew two people that we had contact with, the Germans are really going to go after us, with the help of the French police.</span> <span id="s204">So some people started to organize a way of getting out of the occupied zone into the free zone and those people were helping people to go to the free zone where what we called ___________, people who were passing people on the other side.</span> <span id="s205">Some did it for money.</span> <span id="s206">Some did it because they wanted to help.</span> <span id="s207">So, when we saw what was going on, the first thing we did was try to get my father out.</span> <span id="s208">Because I was a young boy, we figured they are going to get the man, so we spoke to one of those ___________, and we worked out some kind of deal within and my father left.</span> <span id="s209">It must have been the end of June and on July 16th my father was gone.</span> <span id="s210">So, it was my older sister we went to sleep in a Christian's home because we were told they were going to pick up the Jews in Paris on the 16th.</span> <span id="s211">During the night I heard a lot of noise, and I looked through a window and I saw the police dragging children, with little bundles.</span> <span id="s212">So I saw the French police dragging little kids with their mother, little bundles in the street taking them I didn't know where, but I saw them, you know, at night, coming out of buildings and walking in the middle of the street with those French police around them.</span> <span id="s213">The mothers crying and I was so shocked, because we were expecting them to pick up men, and they picked up the women and small children, everybody.</span> <span id="s214">Lucky for us, we were French citizens.</span> <span id="s215">In our building there were a few Jewish families and they were going from one apartment, they must have got a list of maybe not a list.</span> <span id="s216">They went from one apartment to another, and they knocked at my mother's door.</span> <span id="s217">When she opened the door she had a Jewish star on it and they asked her for some identity car and she showed an identity card, she was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q.</span> <span id="s219">You were talking about the police came in and your mother showed them her identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A. Yes, and because on this particular night they didn't pick up French women.</span> <span id="s221">This is how we were lucky to survive that particular night.</span> <span id="s222">But we decided that we must get out of Paris because today they would find Jews and tomorrow maybe it would be us.</span> <span id="s223">So, what we did was we tried to get into contact with a man who helped my father go to the other side, but he disappeared.</span> <span id="s224">Either he was caught or he wouldn't do it anymore, but we had an idea of what it took to go to the other side.</span> <span id="s225">So, we decided and my mother and my two little sisters would go first because if we all disappeared in one shot or whatever, it will be too visible.</span> <span id="s226">So we planned it that they were going to go on a vacation and my older sister would stay, but we closed up the place as best we could after they are gone.</span> <span id="s227">So, they left, to the train to a certain city, I don't remember the name a few miles to the identification line, and they got to that small little town, and the next morning they started to walk.</span> <span id="s228">They were a couple miles from what was supposed to be the free zone, and they were walking early in the morning and a Frenchman came by with a bicycle.</span> <span id="s229">He looked at them and he knew the way they looked that they were not from the region.</span> <span id="s230">So, the walk was leading right to the other side so he asked my mother if she wanted him to take the two kids on his bike and put it on the hood.</span> <span id="s231">My little sister was three years old and the other one was seven, eight years old and they couldn't walk that well.</span> <span id="s232">So, she really didn't feel like it, but she accepted it.</span> <span id="s233">And she found the fellow with the two children a couple miles down the road waiting for my mother.</span> <span id="s234">Because he wasn't going to cross over to the other side.</span> <span id="s235">So, he said walk over a little bit over there and the next village you see will be in the free zone.</span> <span id="s236">So, they got to a field and saw the village and my mother told my sisters start running and don't stop until you get over there.</span> <span id="s237">And this is what they did.</span> <span id="s238">My little sister was so small that they just cut the wheat, they cut it so they had the little stump left so it was catching up her little pants, so my sister grabbed her and ran with her.</span> <span id="s239">All of a sudden my mother a patrol, a German patrol came by and stopped my mother and they already had two women, Frenchwomen arrested there because some Christians were also trying to get to the other side to see their family.</span> <span id="s240">And to go to the other side you needed a special pass and something, so they arrested those two women, and that German soldier got my mother and said what are you doing.</span> <span id="s241">She's says I'm on vacation.</span> <span id="s242">And she said my children are running in the field over there.</span> <span id="s243">I want my children.</span> <span id="s244">I want to get them.</span> <span id="s245">So he said show me what you have in your pocketbook.</span> <span id="s246">She opened up her pocketbook and what she had was a piece of paper from a hospital in Paris and the name of the hospital in Paris was ___________________.</span> <span id="s247">The little French she knew he could understand sick children, hospital for sick children.</span> <span id="s248">She said, see my children are sick, on vacation, so I don't think he was a very hard man.</span> <span id="s249">He said go ahead and get your children and come right back.</span> <span id="s250">So, she was lucky.</span> <span id="s251">She went to the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q.</span> <span id="s253">Did you mother wear the Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A.</span> <span id="s255">In Paris yes, but when she left she did not wear it because she knew she couldn't be Jewish to go over there.</span> <span id="s256">A few days later it was my turn to leave Paris.</span> <span id="s257">So, what we did with my sister we packed what we could, big bundles and boarded this train station to be shipped to South France where my father already was.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q.</span> <span id="s259">You had gotten communication from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A. Yes, we got letters.</span> <span id="s261">So, we thought with my sister to go the same route.</span> <span id="s262">It was the only route we knew.</span> <span id="s263">We were very lucky because we got to that small little town.</span> <span id="s264">I don't remember the name and we spent the night -- I don't remember if it was a motel or whatever -- and 5:00 in the morning we left, we walked.</span> <span id="s265">We heard motor cycle patrols, and so when we heard it we got out of the road and went to the field.</span> <span id="s266">We turned down so much that we didn't know what the free side was.</span> <span id="s267">So, I told my sister I saw somebody in the field, I told my sister you stay right here and I'm going to run over and ask him where am I. So, I ran over and I asked him and he said you are standing right here on the free zone.</span> <span id="s268">So, I waved my sister and she came on in and we got to the village and when we got to the village, the French __________ asked us what are we doing here.</span> <span id="s269">We said we are Jews and we left the occupied zone.</span> <span id="s270">But being French citizens, he couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s271">This particular guy couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s272">So, we took a train and changing trains and all this it took us about seven or eight hours until we got to ____________, and we find my father there.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q. Let me just ask you a question.</span> <span id="s274">When you were all in Paris together after your father left, how did you make decisions?</span> <span id="s275">Did you as the boy, even though you were very young, feel responsible?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A. Always and I stayed the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s277">My father was a wonderful man, but he was an easy going man.</span> <span id="s278">He wasn't making an important decision didn't come easy to him.</span> <span id="s279">I being young I didn't have the vision that he had for me making a decision was easy.</span> <span id="s280">I started to make decision in -- I started with my father -- I pushed him to go back to Paris when we were in France, and from this day on I kept making decisions to this day.</span> <span id="s281">All of a sudden I wasn't anymore a child, I was responsible for what was my family.</span> <span id="s282">This is the way it was.</span> <span id="s283">I never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s284">I was a man in 24 hours.</span> <span id="s285">We got, like I said, we got into ___________, and we started the best we could.</span> <span id="s286">My father found a small apartment, two room apartment with six people.</span> <span id="s287">So, at night we were opening the beds and in the morning we were closing them.</span> <span id="s288">The toilet was in the hall.</span> <span id="s289">But the hardest part was finding food.</span> <span id="s290">Because we didn't know anybody in the city of ______________.</span> <span id="s291">People knew each other.</span> <span id="s292">They were born that way.</span> <span id="s293">They had a way of getting food more or less at no price.</span> <span id="s294">We had to buy everything on black market.</span> <span id="s295">We were not rich people.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q.</span> <span id="s297">You couldn't just go to a local store?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A.</span> <span id="s299">You needed the coupons.</span> <span id="s300">You needed the food rations.</span> <span id="s301">You couldn't.</span> <span id="s302">So what you could buy was nothing without coupons.</span> <span id="s303">Everything else was black market, and we didn't have any contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q. And the coupons that you had would have been from Paris were different?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A. No, no, we registered through the department that was taking care of that.</span> <span id="s306">We were getting so many coupons for the months.</span> <span id="s307">And it was very hard because it was so hard as my sister was about seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s308">We had to pick her up in school she was fainting from hunger.</span> <span id="s309">It was tough.</span> <span id="s310">Later on we met some contacts and we knew a little bit more so we could get some kind of food, but in the beginning it was terrible.</span> <span id="s311">It was not only us, it must have been quite a few people that ran away from the northern part.</span> <span id="s312">I'm sure it wasn't easy for the local people, but it was a little bit easier than us because they knew how to get stuff.</span> <span id="s313">So, it was like that until I don't remember exactly when the German army came in.</span> <span id="s314">It wasn't too long, but a lot of people went to ______________, Nice, the eastern side of Southern France because it was occupied by Italians, the Italian Army.</span> <span id="s315">the Italians were not bad.</span> <span id="s316">For instance, they were not the Germans.</span> <span id="s317">They didn't have the hatred against the Jews that the Germans had.</span> <span id="s318">So what we did in ____________ we had to go somewhere, go where the Italians are.</span> <span id="s319">And also, a lot of people were trying to go to that eastern part of Southern France because from there some tried to get to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s320">Some were lucky enough and some of them were rejected by the police army or custom.</span> <span id="s321">But when the Germans decided it was time, all of a sudden they invaded the rest of France and I am sure they were very unhappy with the Italians who were not tough enough with us.</span> <span id="s322">So, then after a little while when I was in ______________, I met somebody that I knew who asked me if I wanted to do some work for the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q.</span> <span id="s324">This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A.</span> <span id="s326">It was in 1943.</span> <span id="s327">So, I said yes.</span> <span id="s328">And we started through there and people who were deporting were not going to be deported.</span> <span id="s329">They were ready to work, like we heard about work because the Germans all of a sudden I think in 1940 they asked for a French man to go and work for them to build the Atlantic wall and things like that so working for the Germans was something the Germans were looking for because their men were in the Army.</span> <span id="s330">So, for a little while we had the illusion that they were taking people to go to work.</span> <span id="s331">But in 1943 we heard stories that they were deporting Jews to kill them.</span> <span id="s332">This was in 1943.</span> <span id="s333">It's not like people were saying we never knew.</span> <span id="s334">In America they didn't know they were killing Jews.</span> <span id="s335">We knew already in 1943.</span> <span id="s336">What date, I don't remember what we were told they were deporting Jews and killing them.</span> <span id="s337">How they were killing them we didn't know, but the objective was to get rid of the Jews.</span> <span id="s338">So, this is why it makes me feel I must do something.</span> <span id="s339">And, I was 16 or 17 years old.</span> <span id="s340">I don't think of I was really conscious of the danger.</span> <span id="s341">To me, now, if somebody would say I was talking easy the two men I already had in mind would never get me alive over there, and I meant it.</span> <span id="s342">To me that you know was not something I could be scared of.</span> <span id="s343">It was part of the time.</span> <span id="s344">Now, I'll be careful on the street.</span> <span id="s345">I don't go to Manhattan too often, but in those days this was the age when I wasn't afraid.</span> <span id="s346">They asked me, so they asked me if I wanted to go in and try to collect some money and help people who will go by the city of __________ to find them a place safe to stay and if I wanted to do some counter propaganda the German and Vishi government was doing.</span> <span id="s347">Because you saw quite often in the street in the city big posters with the face of a man who looked unshaved and things like that, and they were saying those are the terrorists who are doing this and this and this.</span> <span id="s348">Putting bombs and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s349">Usually they were Jewish names or Spanish names.</span> <span id="s350">The poster was saying the trouble we have in this country are not the French people, a bunch of foreigners who are the terrorists.</span> <span id="s351">Those are the people, and usually those people were people who already shot or hanged.</span> <span id="s352">So, they asked me we have to do something to counter propaganda.</span> <span id="s353">So, what they were doing they were buying these tickets with one sentence, "Die for France."</span> <span id="s354">They asked me to go to every post I could and put the sticker on.</span> <span id="s355">We usually were working two fellows.</span> <span id="s356">One watching and one putting the sticker and vice versa.</span> <span id="s357">One day, I was supposed to meet somebody, somebody was going to work with me and he was going to bring me the sticker.</span> <span id="s358">Somebody was going to bring him the stickers.</span> <span id="s359">I went to the point.</span> <span id="s360">He wasn't there.</span> <span id="s361">I waited, waited.</span> <span id="s362">He wasn't there.</span> <span id="s363">So, I went to him and going on I saw my sister coming in the street.</span> <span id="s364">I asked her what are you doing here you're supposed to be at a movie.</span> <span id="s365">She said, oh when we got to the movie you know there was line and we didn't want to wait.</span> <span id="s366">She started to give me some kind of story, but I knew her.</span> <span id="s367">I looked at her and all of a sudden I said, I noticed she had a package under her arm.</span> <span id="s368">I said what do you have there?</span> <span id="s369">She said nothing.</span> <span id="s370">Nothing, I said show me.</span> <span id="s371">She was a year and a half older than I was, but I was still the boy of the family.</span> <span id="s372">I said show me.</span> <span id="s373">And I saw the stickers.</span> <span id="s374">She was supposed to go to work with somebody else who didn't show up also.</span> <span id="s375">She had a sticker and this is all around and my sister was working for the resistance.</span> <span id="s376">So, when I saw the sticker I said as long as you have the sticker let's go.</span> <span id="s377">So, it was even easier with her than with the fellow I was working with, because with her I was pushing her against the wall where the sticker was and I was making believe the I was kissing her and was putting the sticker right in her back.</span> <span id="s378">And in France you know, of course I don't know if it is now, but seeing a couple against the wall kissing was not something unusual.</span> <span id="s379">So, it made it easier.</span> <span id="s380">I was surprised that my sister was doing this because she never told me, and I never told her either.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q.</span> <span id="s382">So your parents didn't know you were involved in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A. No.</span> <span id="s384">They would have been scared.</span> <span id="s385">Like I said, I wouldn't talk to my sister either because I really didn't want her to be involved.</span> <span id="s386">Once we knew I never worked again with her, but I knew she had her own job.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q.</span> <span id="s388">Did you talk about your work to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q. Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A. No.</span> <span id="s392">Because we really didn't know what our work was going to be.</span> <span id="s393">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s394">Sometime I was getting some money I was getting it to somebody else who was going to collect it.</span> <span id="s395">Sometimes I was getting some small arms.</span> <span id="s396">Sometime I was getting a little bundle with false i.d.s, you know because the printers were printing false i.d.s or they were stealing them when they were making identification cards for the police department and keeping part of it, but we took it to somebody else who was using it to make something else.</span> <span id="s397">I was sometime getting some stamps from different police departments.</span> <span id="s398">All this, I was some kind of point where people bring something to me and I was giving it to somebody else.</span> <span id="s399">The only thing I kept after a while was a handgun.</span> <span id="s400">And they didn't mind, and I never knew who was going to show us.</span> <span id="s401">We had some way of knowing when somebody, but I didn't know who.</span> <span id="s402">For instance, we had somebody coming and telling me we had some training.</span> <span id="s403">Some small arm use, some kind of what would happen if we were fighting in the street and we were getting some kind of training, not much, but some kind of training, and the training we were getting usually there is an avenue there is a river, the ___________ River goes there and this particular part of ______________ is some kind of island and that island which was very quiet where we could go two or three fellows we're going to start there and talk.</span> <span id="s404">We couldn't use any arms, but we could dismantle the things like that.</span> <span id="s405">This is where we were getting this training during the occupation.</span> <span id="s406">I never asked them where they came from.</span> <span id="s407">If they were from a Jewish underground or a communist underground.</span> <span id="s408">It was never part of my mind.</span> <span id="s409">They were part of the resistance and that's it.</span> <span id="s410">The only thing I had in mind was resistance against the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q.</span> <span id="s412">So you never joined one resistance group or another?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A. No, I found out really just before the Russians, the people were doing and I was part of the FFI.</span> <span id="s414">We never talked about politics.</span> <span id="s415">We never talked about religion.</span> <span id="s416">We were there to help and do what we could do.</span> <span id="s417">We'll help without a Jew going by who needed a place to stay or a ration card, but it didn't make any difference to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q.</span> <span id="s419">Did you know who your leaders were?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A. No, I never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q.</span> <span id="s422">Did you know how large the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A. No, never knew.</span> <span id="s424">After the war, I found out it was pretty large.</span> <span id="s425">There were only small groups, because you know if they would have caught us, we couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s426">Like I say, I knew a few people in the city, that's it.</span> <span id="s427">They were coming and talking to me and asking me if I could do that and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s428">But I never knew that Gold was the leader.</span> <span id="s429">I didn't know the ______________.</span> <span id="s430">It didn't make any difference to me anyway.</span> <span id="s431">I was just resisting the Germans.</span> <span id="s432">And in 1943, I think it was in 1943, I don't know what month, it got pretty bad also and the people from the resistance, the people I spoke to said listen we have to try to save the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q. I think you were talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A. I think I was starting to say in 1943, the people I knew in the resistance told us it is becoming harder for the Jews in France so what we are to try to do is to save the children.</span> <span id="s437">So, they asked me and I asked my parents if it's okay to have them take the little children and give it to somebody in the resistance who is going to place them somewhere where they are going to be safe.</span> <span id="s438">It was very hard for my parents.</span> <span id="s439">For me, I said sure, they're going to be safe, why not?</span> <span id="s440">But for my parents this was very hard.</span> <span id="s441">My little sister was three years old.</span> <span id="s442">The other one nine.</span> <span id="s443">We talked about and we said we might have a chance to survive, but why not give them a chance.</span> <span id="s444">So, what we accepted the offer from the resistance and one day a woman, if I remember well, an Italian Frenchwoman came down and she says I'm going to take them and we wanted to be safe and also it was with one of my sisters fainting from hunger we decided it would be a good idea.</span> <span id="s445">We tried to teach my little sister, three years old to call that woman Mommy.</span> <span id="s446">The older one it was easy.</span> <span id="s447">Before they left my mother sewed in I think in their lining, in the bottom of her skirt a piece of paper with the name and the address of my uncle in the United States.</span> <span id="s448">We told my older sister, the nine year old.</span> <span id="s449">We told her if the war stopped and we're not around, get in contact with your uncle.</span> <span id="s450">And they left.</span> <span id="s451">We didn't know where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q. Your parents must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A. I'm a father myself so I can imagine how tough it was for them.</span> <span id="s454">So even without any children you can imagine how it is to give away, giving those two little children up not knowing where they were.</span> <span id="s455">Because it was always the same story, life in the resistance we didn't know too many people because in case we were caught, the same thing with that.</span> <span id="s456">We couldn't know where they were because if something would happen to us, we couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s457">So, this is what we did.</span> <span id="s458">We found out later on they were taken to a small little village in the mountains of ____________, and I think the name was __________________.</span> <span id="s459">That particular region ___________________, and I had the feeling I was told the farmers that there were young children from the big cities undernourished and they are here to get better food, better air.</span> <span id="s460">But I don't think we fooled them.</span> <span id="s461">They didn't say anything and never mentioned anything and never took my sisters to church.</span> <span id="s462">They took them to school, but they never took them to church.</span> <span id="s463">So, I already had the feeling that they knew what they were dealing with.</span> <span id="s464">And they were safe like that until liberation.</span> <span id="s465">And I was told where they were and I went there to pick them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q. By the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A.</span> <span id="s468">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q.</span> <span id="s470">The resistance then told you where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A. Oh, yes, they were the only ones who knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q.</span> <span id="s473">But you didn't know who the resistance was?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A.</span> <span id="s475">But the people we were dealing with, they got in contact.</span> <span id="s476">We were in contact in end we were in contact almost every day with different people in our little group.</span> <span id="s477">And one of them knew somebody who knew where they took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q.</span> <span id="s479">Did you initiate that or did certain people come to you and say do you want us to save your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A. No, they give us that option.</span> <span id="s481">I didn't know that option existed.</span> <span id="s482">I couldn't go to somebody and say what can you do for my sisters or even for myself.</span> <span id="s483">They came to us and told us there is a way to save the children if something should happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q.</span> <span id="s485">What did they think -- what was the idea that might happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A. Being caught by the Germans and be deported, being killed.</span> <span id="s487">For instance, my sisters, okay, they were saved.</span> <span id="s488">They were safer over there in the mountain, but we were in the city.</span> <span id="s489">And I don't remember the date, but they started to pick up the Jews of __________________.</span> <span id="s490">So, now we had the problem what to do.</span> <span id="s491">For me it was easier.</span> <span id="s492">I was a young fellow, so I could find places that were safe where I could sleep, I could stay.</span> <span id="s493">But my sister was a bit older than I was.</span> <span id="s494">Her being a girl she couldn't sleep like that.</span> <span id="s495">Once in a while I slept outside, because you know a safe place, I didn't have any room.</span> <span id="s496">The first thing, when we had a safe place, it was my parents.</span> <span id="s497">So, the resistance again, somebody from the resistance I was talking to told us there is a way we can help, having my sister go into a convent.</span> <span id="s498">This was already at the end of 1943, or the beginning of '44.</span> <span id="s499">We said okay.</span> <span id="s500">So, they talked to the Mother Superior and she accepted it.</span> <span id="s501">So, my sister went into a convent.</span> <span id="s502">But you know all the sisters, everybody was going to mass except my sister, so you know when they were asking they never tried to convert her.</span> <span id="s503">They never tried to put any question on her, and the only one who really knew for sure was the Mother Superior and one other sister said why doesn't she go so the Mother Superior told one day I will tell you.</span> <span id="s504">But it never bothered her not going to mass.</span> <span id="s505">I think they figured it out by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q. I'm surprised that she didn't go to mass just in case somebody else would find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A. No, because she was in a convent.</span> <span id="s508">She was not outside going to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q.</span> <span id="s510">But couldn't the Germans come in even to the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A.</span> <span id="s512">They could but they never did it.</span> <span id="s513">They never did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q. So, your sister was placed in a convent, and you and your parents were still at large?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q.</span> <span id="s517">What did you do every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A.</span> <span id="s519">What I found -- I found a job.</span> <span id="s520">I had a little training as an office machine mechanic.</span> <span id="s521">I went to a small business who was dealing in that kind of machines, calculators and that type and so on and so forth, and I told him I had some small training, can he use me.</span> <span id="s522">So, the first thing he did was call in the labor department to find out if he could hire a Jew.</span> <span id="s523">Because I never hidden -- when I really had to deal with people, I didn't volunteer but I never hidden.</span> <span id="s524">And also, the question was what are you doing with your accent, your Parisian accent here?</span> <span id="s525">So, I told them the truth.</span> <span id="s526">I left over there because I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s527">So, I had a job.</span> <span id="s528">My father being a watchmaker, jeweler, he was working for different stores, going there and doing some repairs.</span> <span id="s529">So, this is how we were making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q.</span> <span id="s531">In between you were trying to help the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A. Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s533">Somebody in the resistance knew we existed so when somebody needed some help going by ___________, they had our name.</span> <span id="s534">We helped them either if we could get them some false i.d.s or if we could get them some ration cards, or we find them a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s535">They were going to wherever they wanted to go, to Marseilles, or wherever they were trying to reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q.</span> <span id="s537">When you say we, you're just talking about you and a few others?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A. Few, everybody I knew, and I'm sure what I was doing must have been repeated by the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q.</span> <span id="s540">Did you have, I know you didn't know who your overall leaders were but was there one person who supervised you or told you what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A.</span> <span id="s542">There was one guy seemed to have more information that we did.</span> <span id="s543">He was telling us, he was telling assignment tomorrow somebody is going to be you know.</span> <span id="s544">He was between us and somebody else.</span> <span id="s545">He knew while we were talking about maybe leaving the city and maybe going up to the mountains to the Marque to join you know a lot of groups of different men who were fighting more or less organized with a heavy weapon.</span> <span id="s546">Weapons they were getting from either dropped by the Allies or stolen from different places, but they decided to keep us in the city.</span> <span id="s547">They needed us in the city, so we never went really to join those people in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q. Was that something you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A. I was going to do anything.</span> <span id="s550">I was going to anything as long as it was fighting against the Germans.</span> <span id="s551">I don't think I was thinking too clearly, but sometimes I was sticking my neck out where I shouldn't.</span> <span id="s552">All of a sudden while I was working in the little shop over there, a young German soldier came in with his gun, with everything, and he had a typewriter and he asked my boss if he could use the shop to repair the typewriter.</span> <span id="s553">So, my boss was not going to refuse him.</span> <span id="s554">He said, sure.</span> <span id="s555">So, that younger fellow who we give him a place on the bench and he started to look at the typewriter and he couldn't communicate in French, but my Yiddish came back.</span> <span id="s556">You know, so I started to say a few words of Yiddish and he understood some of it and I understood some of his Germans.</span> <span id="s557">So we got a little bit friendlier and he told me story.</span> <span id="s558">He was a young fellow.</span> <span id="s559">He must have been 18 or 19 years old and he was from Austria and in the shop it was already turning bad for the Germans.</span> <span id="s560">So, in that shop we had a map of Italy and we were pointing every day the advance of the Allied army in Italy.</span> <span id="s561">He was looking at it.</span> <span id="s562">One day I told him I said they are going to be there very soon.</span> <span id="s563">I said what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s564">He said I don't know.</span> <span id="s565">They might send me ___________, might send me somewhere, some place.</span> <span id="s566">I said why don't they keep quiet and stay somewhere here, in France.</span> <span id="s567">It came out of my mind without even thinking.</span> <span id="s568">He was a nice fellow he said I wish I could.</span> <span id="s569">I will always remember his name.</span> <span id="s570">His name was ___________, something like that, but I stuck my neck out really without thinking.</span> <span id="s571">So, that gives you an idea of my state of mind.</span> <span id="s572">I wasn't afraid because of the age or whatever it was at the time.</span> <span id="s573">You couldn't really be afraid.</span> <span id="s574">When it came to finding hiding places, this must have been in somewhere in the beginning of 1944 just before the landing of the Allies in Normandy and thinking about landing in South France, they started bombing.</span> <span id="s575">They were bombing a lot because it was a railroad turnaround, and by coincidence, it was almost in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s576">But they were bombing almost halfway there like clockwork.</span> <span id="s577">What they did, the government of _____________, the castle of the French pope was a wall about four or five foot thick.</span> <span id="s578">They opened it up and we could stay inside and sleep inside in those rooms because of bombings.</span> <span id="s579">So, for me it was beautiful because a lot of French people were going there to avoid the bombing before me.</span> <span id="s580">It was somewhere without really to hide.</span> <span id="s581">Also, it got to the point where we got so used to the bombing so sometime we were looking if I was with a friend, we were looking at the planes coming over and we were already figuring if they were released now, the Germans had this from somebody else.</span> <span id="s582">But you know being afraid now, it's amazing how you lose fear.</span> <span id="s583">It's part of the daily routine and we were watching them and first the Red Cross ___________ for some kind of hideout or whatever after the bombs were coming down.</span> <span id="s584">Also, they asked me -- and also the French government was kind to ask us, if anybody to help the people after the bombing, because sometime a lot of the people were killed.</span> <span id="s585">So, we had to go there and try to dig them out, but everytime we heard a plane coming, a lot of people were cursing.</span> <span id="s586">We were happy because while the bombs were falling, they didn't worry about us.</span> <span id="s587">For us, everytime we saw those planes coming it was a closer day to liberation.</span> <span id="s588">Sure, we could have been killed but for us it was a relief.</span> <span id="s589">We knew it was stopping the Germans and _____________ of getting us.</span> <span id="s590">So, you know it was a very strange atmosphere in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q.</span> <span id="s592">Did you get information from outside of ______________?</span> <span id="s593">Did you get a radio broadcast or?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A.</span> <span id="s595">We were listening to all those ears, the information we were getting was from the BBC.</span> <span id="s596">I don't remember exactly at what hour, but we made it our business to listen.</span> <span id="s597">This was all the information we got because everything else we got from the French government were lies.</span> <span id="s598">But the BBC was the life line to the news.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q. Back to this resistance organization that you were involved in.</span> <span id="s600">I know you said you didn't know too much about the organization, but what can you tell me in more detail the sorts of things you did for them and how you got what you got and where you took it and that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A. Usually, you know it might not be very dramatic, usually I was collecting stuff from people.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q. From what people?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A.</span> <span id="s604">Other people from the resistance who were bringing me a package with for instance, small arms, or a package of propaganda material or a package of ration cards, something like that was brought to me.</span> <span id="s605">And somebody else was picking it up from me.</span> <span id="s606">See, this was a thing.</span> <span id="s607">I didn't do anything heroic, you know, but it was part of my job.</span> <span id="s608">And also, about close to the end before the liberation all of a sudden so many railroad tracks were blown up.</span> <span id="s609">So much sabotage was done, all of a sudden the Germans had a bright idea of saying that all men and I don't remember from what age must report every night and watch the railroad track and put our men every 50 meters, every 100 meters.</span> <span id="s610">And you must go there and if something should happen, you're responsible.</span> <span id="s611">So, I think I was too young.</span> <span id="s612">My father was called.</span> <span id="s613">That's when I said to my father, it's crazy.</span> <span id="s614">First of all, some of my groups are going to blow it up anyway, and how can you be responsible for something like that.</span> <span id="s615">You're already hiding so don't go.</span> <span id="s616">What are they going to do?</span> <span id="s617">There's nothing they can do, you know, you are not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q.</span> <span id="s619">So your father, at this point, knew you were involved with the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s621">At that point he knew it.</span> <span id="s622">He knew it from the moment we spoke about sending away my sisters.</span> <span id="s623">Then he knew.</span> <span id="s624">So, it didn't go watch those tracks and a lot of other things happened and we by the end were told to watch anything going on.</span> <span id="s625">If there is any train organized with people in it, to make sure that those trains would not go through.</span> <span id="s626">This was our job so I hate to see anything going on, something different in the city.</span> <span id="s627">We were watching to see if the Germans were not moving too much, and little by little we say them disappearing, because we didn't have any big fighter on there.</span> <span id="s628">You see, when they came to France, the first time when I saw them, in the street of Paris, where you saw young guys must have been in their 20s, strong young guy, when they left, what do you see, old men pushing carriages with their belongings in it walking.</span> <span id="s629">A young kid maybe 14 of 15 years old because they must have used the army somewhere in a different front before the occupation they took anything.</span> <span id="s630">You know, what a difference between an army __________________ and a retreat.</span> <span id="s631">So we saw them but we didn't see any big fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q. Was there a pretty large German presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A. For a little while, yes.</span> <span id="s634">For a little while they were all there.</span> <span id="s635">Every time we turned around there was a German there.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q. And Vichy police as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s638">Not only the Vichy police but we had different kinds of police.</span> <span id="s639">You had the police of the city, you had the ________________ with the Nationals and it was part of it the munitions.</span> <span id="s640">Those were the worst collaborators there is.</span> <span id="s641">They were the ones doing the dirty job.</span> <span id="s642">You know they were working with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s643">So, we had to be careful of a lot of different organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q.</span> <span id="s645">Did you see when you were living in the south Jews being taken away or people being beaten or any of that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A. Beaten in front of me, no, but being grabbed and thrown into a car and taken away, yes.</span> <span id="s647">This I saw it.</span> <span id="s648">I saw it quite a few times.</span> <span id="s649">You know, because sometimes walking the street, all of a sudden they were asking for identification paper, and the ones who didn't have the right kind they were grabbing them and throwing them in the car and taking them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q.</span> <span id="s651">Did you feel that you had any real close calls?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s653">Yes, I had a very close call.</span> <span id="s654">I was working with a fellow, and he had some propaganda stuff he was supposed to give me.</span> <span id="s655">What he did, he did something very, very stupid.</span> <span id="s656">He picked it up from somewhere, I don't remember where and he had it on his back.</span> <span id="s657">In those days, you know, there were no cars.</span> <span id="s658">So, everything was bikes and we had what we called bike garages, and those bike garages were in the courtyard inside of a building.</span> <span id="s659">So, he says I'll wait over there and I will give it to you.</span> <span id="s660">We walked and I said go ahead and pick up your bike and I was waiting outside.</span> <span id="s661">As soon as he got in, I saw them, either the police or the Gestapo and they grabbed him.</span> <span id="s662">When I saw them, the only thing I could do was turn around.</span> <span id="s663">They called me, but I wasn't going to stop for them, so it was a very close call.</span> <span id="s664">Another time I had another friend, he was arrested.</span> <span id="s665">Because in that particular day they picked up a lot of people.</span> <span id="s666">In that particular night they were arresting quite a few young people, Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s667">And that friend of mine that was Jewish also was part of the resistance.</span> <span id="s668">He wasn't exactly what a German would have thought a Jew looked like.</span> <span id="s669">He was blonde, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s670">When they arrested him, in the meantime they put him in the hotel and the next morning the Gestapo was coming or the ammunition or whatever, and the same night another fellow I knew, wasn't Jewish was arrested also, and he told me the story.</span> <span id="s671">I wouldn't have believed it.</span> <span id="s672">What they did, they arrested so many young fellows they put them in the courtyard of the hotel with a very big door with a big padlock.</span> <span id="s673">My friend was a small little fellow.</span> <span id="s674">He must have been maybe 5'5" or 5'6" and he went to that padlock.</span> <span id="s675">He must have been so desperate, he bolted and he run away, and other guys run away too.</span> <span id="s676">The other fellow I knew ---</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q.</span> <span id="s678">You were talking about ?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A.</span> <span id="s680">This fellow told me he saw it with his own eyes, a little guy like that breaking a big padlock like that.</span> <span id="s681">He wouldn't have believed it.</span> <span id="s682">And they all ran away.</span> <span id="s683">Because you see, he knew, he knew the next morning the Gestapo or whoever was going to interrogate him and ask him and even with all this false paper, they would ask him to drop his pants down.</span> <span id="s684">And you know in France, nobody was circumcised that was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s685">So, he must have been so desperate that he did it.</span> <span id="s686">This is how the things were with the young people.</span> <span id="s687">We knew how bad it was for us to be caught and be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q. Had you thought about going into real hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A. Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q.</span> <span id="s691">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A. I don't know.</span> <span id="s693">It wasn't in me.</span> <span id="s694">The only thing I thought was if they wanted me to go to the ___________.</span> <span id="s695">I was ready for that.</span> <span id="s696">But going into hiding, no.</span> <span id="s697">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s698">You see like I say it was very hard to communicate this but I was born in France.</span> <span id="s699">I always felt completely free.</span> <span id="s700">Nobody is going to tell me really what to do.</span> <span id="s701">You see, maybe certain people came from different countries, you know, like my father told me, in Poland sometime you know when they saw a soldier you know they would get off the sidewalks because they were afraid somebody was going to hit them.</span> <span id="s702">They knew more about pogrom than I did.</span> <span id="s703">I never saw a pogrom in my life.</span> <span id="s704">So this is what to me I think and it never went to my mind.</span> <span id="s705">I was hiding to avoid being taken by the Germans but trying to find a place somewhere in a hole in the mountain or whatever, it wasn't in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q. Or to pretend you were catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A. I never did that.</span> <span id="s708">Even when I was in the army, they send me an _______________, so one day, I will always remember, we went to a small little town in the mountain somewhere around ______________, and the captain all of a sudden got the idea of everybody is going to go on Sunday to mass.</span> <span id="s709">We had to get up early and we all go to church.</span> <span id="s710">I got up like anybody else but when we got to church they all got in and you know kneel and cross themselves, I stayed at the door.</span> <span id="s711">They asked me why don't you go in.</span> <span id="s712">I said I don't mind going in, but I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s713">I never volunteered.</span> <span id="s714">I never told them, they never asked me, but when it came the time to say it, I said it.</span> <span id="s715">They were all surprised because I was the only Jew in the whole unit.</span> <span id="s716">It never came to their mind that I could be different than they were as far as religion.</span> <span id="s717">During the war, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s718">If I felt like I mentioned before, if I applied for a job, I didn't write I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q.</span> <span id="s720">Why not, wouldn't it have been easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A.</span> <span id="s722">It would have been a lie.</span> <span id="s723">It wouldn't have been helpful.</span> <span id="s724">Because you see I was a Parisian with a different accent.</span> <span id="s725">What was I doing in ______________.</span> <span id="s726">You see?</span> <span id="s727">So, I told them that there was no law against hiring a Jew and that's it.</span> <span id="s728">Maybe I wasn't smart.</span> <span id="s729">I don't know.</span> <span id="s730">But I never did hide it.</span> <span id="s731">I didn't hide it in the army.</span> <span id="s732">I didn't hide it anyplace.</span> <span id="s733">The only thing I was hiding it when I had false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q. Now, what did you get the false papers for?</span> <span id="s735">What did you need the false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A. For the resistance.</span> <span id="s737">For instance, they were stopping the people the in the street and asking for identity card and in France everybody has an identity card.</span> <span id="s738">So, the police a lot of times stopped you and asked you for an identity card.</span> <span id="s739">So, then I had a false identity.</span> <span id="s740">Sure, I wasn't telling them I was Jewish when I was showing them my identity card.</span> <span id="s741">If not, there was no reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q.</span> <span id="s743">Why wouldn't you use that same card for the man who was going to hire you or anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A.</span> <span id="s745">You see, in France, I was missing something.</span> <span id="s746">In France for a young fellow, I don't know how it is now, you needed a permit for a young man to go to work, and I didn't have that permit.</span> <span id="s747">I had it only in my name.</span> <span id="s748">The permit when I went from Paris.</span> <span id="s749">My name was Federman on the permit, it was not Richard.</span> <span id="s750">So, you know it was more involved, plus we needed the money to survive.</span> <span id="s751">I had to get a job.</span> <span id="s752">You know, and where do you find, the resistance never, never offered any, you know, the false permit for children to go to work.</span> <span id="s753">So, this must be one of the reasons why I didn't use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q. Was it your sense that there were other Jewish members of the resistance --?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A. Yes, yes because I knew some fellows that were Jewish, but it was never something you know that important.</span> <span id="s756">Our main objective is to resist.</span> <span id="s757">That's how it is.</span> <span id="s758">We were willing to help anybody who was willing to resist, who was part of our resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q.</span> <span id="s760">There were girls in the movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A. Yes, my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q.</span> <span id="s763">Did the girls have different kinds of jobs than the boys, different types of responsibilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A.</span> <span id="s765">They must have because my sister never got any kind of training about fighting.</span> <span id="s766">You know, and it's very hard now when I'm thinking about it, we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s767">We never talked about the details about what she was doing and what I was doing.</span> <span id="s768">It's very hard to explain, but we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s769">Like for quite some time we never talked about the details that happened during the war.</span> <span id="s770">You know, I start to really talk about is when my kid got older.</span> <span id="s771">But it's not _______, some people, I personally felt had a lot more interesting things to talk about than I did.</span> <span id="s772">Some people were in concentration camps, some people suffered a lot more than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q. Were you aware of the Jewish underground organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s775">Like I told you, we had some contact with the people coming mostly from I'd say who were -- we knew there was some kind of organization, but I knew so few people in ____________.</span> <span id="s776">So, it wasn't a problem of trying to find a group where you fit.</span> <span id="s777">Sure, if there was a lot of Jews in ____________, I'm sure I would have been with them.</span> <span id="s778">But I didn't know enough people.</span> <span id="s779">See, so this is why I worked with the resistance.</span> <span id="s780">By the end, I found out it was the FFI, but I wouldn't have been surprised if somebody would have told me it was a communist movement or a Jewish movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q.</span> <span id="s782">So the name of your group was?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A.</span> <span id="s784">After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q.</span> <span id="s786">That you found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A. ____________________, the French Force of the Interior.</span> <span id="s788">Like you have the French army outside in North Africa or England who were supposed to be inside doing what we could.</span> <span id="s789">Some of those forces was a lot more active than we were because they were organized to really fight in the mountains, in the ___________.</span> <span id="s790">Some of them were very, very well organized.</span> <span id="s791">The resistance from the French railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q.</span> <span id="s793">These were all separate organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A.</span> <span id="s795">They were separate organizations.</span> <span id="s796">They had contact with other organizations to synchronize some of the work, but everyone was assigned a certain job.</span> <span id="s797">Some people were -- it never happened to me-- but some people were specialized in airplanes, allied flyers who were shut down, to go to Spain or to go back to England.</span> <span id="s798">They were specialized in that.</span> <span id="s799">They were looking for that.</span> <span id="s800">Some had direct contact with _____________, but we didn't have those.</span> <span id="s801">I'm sure some of those Jewish underground I had the feeling they had contact with the zionists from Palestine.</span> <span id="s802">Some were I'm sure were in contact with American Jewish organizations which were very active trying to help the refugees.</span> <span id="s803">They were helping a lot more of the foreign refugees than the French, but I'm sure they were there, but we were French, we were not foreigners.</span> <span id="s804">So, we had a different way of reacting.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q.</span> <span id="s806">So you really didn't know about all of others?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q.</span> <span id="s809">Did you ever feel isolated?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A. No.</span> <span id="s811">Once I started to work with the resistance, I knew I was not isolated.</span> <span id="s812">I knew somebody was trying to do something for us because you know this is why they give us the option of the resistance.</span> <span id="s813">I knew what I was doing was helping somebody else.</span> <span id="s814">So, I knew I was part of a large group, but my personally I didn't know those people.</span> <span id="s815">After the war, then I saw in the _______________ dozens of different groups, and more or less we synchronized in doing what we were to do.</span> <span id="s816">We were watching to see if the Germans were not doing an sabotage.</span> <span id="s817">We were waiting for the Allies to reach us.</span> <span id="s818">But the Allies had an easy time because when they reached us, everything was already under control.</span> <span id="s819">The first time I saw Americans, I was told go in see where the Americans are.</span> <span id="s820">The city was already under control of the resistance, but we are told go and give a look.</span> <span id="s821">So, I inquired and somebody told me they are somewhere not far from there, and they were a couple miles down the road from the city, and I got there and I saw three tanks.</span> <span id="s822">This is the first American I saw.</span> <span id="s823">By coincidence one of the tank commanders, the leaders, I think it was a lieutenant or whatever, spoke a few words of French, because he didn't know what to expect either.</span> <span id="s824">We told him it's open.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q.</span> <span id="s826">The Germans had just disappeared?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A.</span> <span id="s828">They just went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q.</span> <span id="s830">When was this?</span> <span id="s831">Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A. I think summer of '44.</span> <span id="s833">They disappeared, and we saw them little by little disappear and like I said we saw them walking, pushing the carriages with their belongings.</span> <span id="s834">We saw them on bicycles.</span> <span id="s835">We even saw a couple with some kind of small motor boat, you know they must have stole it somewhere going up the ___________ River maybe going to ___________.</span> <span id="s836">But it was not like a big fight like in Normandy, whatever.</span> <span id="s837">They went and that was all there was to it.</span> <span id="s838">The only time we worried a little bit was in the winter of '44 '45.</span> <span id="s839">We were already liberated and all this and all of a sudden the Battle of the Bulge started.</span> <span id="s840">So, we were already talking about what do we do if the German army comes back.</span> <span id="s841">But it didn't last that long.</span> <span id="s842">Also, the regression we saw a lot of different groups because all of a sudden we were told to look around to see if we can pick up any Germans who stayed behind.</span> <span id="s843">So, we got from different people their names and the address of a Frenchwomen who was living with Germans.</span> <span id="s844">The Germans were gone, but those women were caught.</span> <span id="s845">We were interested and the only thing we did was we left them with their panties on.</span> <span id="s846">It didn't make any sense but it was maybe a relief so we dragged them to the street.</span> <span id="s847">After that, when we saw a woman with a scarf on her head for a few months, we knew what it was.</span> <span id="s848">This was a different group again.</span> <span id="s849">Sometime we're walking and one street was dragging a couple of women and we met in another street another group with another couple of women.</span> <span id="s850">So, we knew there were different groups working.</span> <span id="s851">After that, we were told to help to try and round up the collaborators.</span> <span id="s852">So, this is what we did.</span> <span id="s853">We went to the French police and they were taken to court.</span> <span id="s854">There was a very fast trial and then we took them to the cemetery and we shot them down.</span> <span id="s855">But it lasted --it didn't last too much.</span> <span id="s856">Most of those people were shot were people with a lot of proof of what they did.</span> <span id="s857">Even when I was in court once and their lawyers and I heard the lawyer talking and he said no chance of a death sentence and everytime it was that sentence by a couple jurors.</span> <span id="s858">This was the atmosphere of that liberation at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q. So, back to the liberation itself.</span> <span id="s860">The Germans had disappeared, you heard some American tanks were nearby.</span> <span id="s861">That was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A.</span> <span id="s863">We went there.</span> <span id="s864">That was it, and after that, a few days later we saw the Army coming.</span> <span id="s865">You know, the regular army.</span> <span id="s866">The French army and the American army, and I saw it.</span> <span id="s867">I didn't know they existed.</span> <span id="s868">I saw the Paris Jewish Brigade going too.</span> <span id="s869">All of a sudden, one day I was looking at all those soldiers and what do I see?</span> <span id="s870">Jewish guys.</span> <span id="s871">You know who were part of the what do you call, the English army, Jewish ___________.</span> <span id="s872">I don't know if you ever heard of that?</span> <span id="s873">So, this really make me feel real good when I saw those guys.</span> <span id="s874">They went through and they kept on going up to Germany.</span> <span id="s875">After the liberation, I wanted to go up with the French Army.</span> <span id="s876">They looked at me and said what's the matter with you.</span> <span id="s877">You are not trained.</span> <span id="s878">You are not a soldier.</span> <span id="s879">You are somebody from the resistance.</span> <span id="s880">You are not a soldier so wait a little bit.</span> <span id="s881">I waited a few months and after that I went into the French army and I went up to Austria and I did an occupation the first three years mostly in ___________ and in Vienna.</span> <span id="s882">I don't remember _____________, but somewhere I found out there was a concentration camp in Austria and I never knew the name, and even now I don't know the name of it.</span> <span id="s883">Nobody talks about it, but somewhere in Austria, I don't know if it's up over _________ or wherever.</span> <span id="s884">One day I took a ship and went there and the camp was already liberated, and I saw the barracks and all this, but until now I never really made an effort to find out the name of that particular camp.</span> <span id="s885">So, there was a camp right in Austria, a concentration camp, right there.</span> <span id="s886">After that, they asked me very nicely to go back home, because we were also -- a fellow like me coming from the resistance and we were not trained with the discipline that a regular soldier is when somebody was looking at us and saying something, you know sometime we were very rough with him, what were you doing in the war.</span> <span id="s887">Where were you?</span> <span id="s888">We came from the resistance.</span> <span id="s889">What were you doing there those four years.</span> <span id="s890">So, I think the French government decided to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s891">We were not very good soldiers.</span> <span id="s892">So, I came home.</span> <span id="s893">During the war we lost everything.</span> <span id="s894">In 1942, we abandoned everything and left Paris.</span> <span id="s895">My father had a small little store with an apartment.</span> <span id="s896">Everything was taken and in _____________, after that we found out that we had hidden in our small apartment.</span> <span id="s897">After that when we tried to go back everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s898">So, neighbors told us I don't know if it was true but one day -- maybe it's true.</span> <span id="s899">A German army came in with a truck and they were looking for us and they emptied all things and they find a statement, so we lost everything around twice, but we were smart enough to put our life more value on our life than our belongings.</span> <span id="s900">Some people were caught because they stayed.</span> <span id="s901">It's very hard for somebody who worked all his life and see that house, if something should happen, I will take my suitcase and go.</span> <span id="s902">I figure you know material things are not important, but for some people they are important.</span> <span id="s903">The businesses, they lived in the same house or apartment for years and years and abandon everything and go, they couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s904">They figure maybe they won't pick us up and they were picked up.</span> <span id="s905">This is why a lot of people were picked up.</span> <span id="s906">They figured it will not happen to them.</span> <span id="s907">I understand now until now I couldn't understand why it would be so hard for people to abandon everything just to save their life and maybe start over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q.</span> <span id="s909">How did your family get back together again.</span> <span id="s910">How did you find everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A.</span> <span id="s912">The liberation I was told by the people who took them that took my sister, where they were and I went to pick them up.</span> <span id="s913">My sister came out of the convent.</span> <span id="s914">My mother and father were in the city, so we got back.</span> <span id="s915">After that I don't remember what month, I went back to Paris.</span> <span id="s916">We're talking about taking ___________ my father didn't go.</span> <span id="s917">I went back to Paris to see what happened to the apartment we were in in Paris.</span> <span id="s918">When I got into Paris, the apartment was empty and on the first floor of the apartment house there was a bakery and he was using our apartment as a storage place for his flour, bags and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s919">And also, I had something good going for us.</span> <span id="s920">The French government passed a law immediately anybody who comes back must get their apartment back.</span> <span id="s921">It's not some French people, the Jews were picked up, they moved in.</span> <span id="s922">A lot of them are still there because people never came back.</span> <span id="s923">So, I asked to give me back the apartment and I asked the baker to please empty the whole thing and we came back to Paris and we bought some furniture and I went to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q. Was the baker resentful?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A. I don't know, but he never said anything.</span> <span id="s926">He knew the law.</span> <span id="s927">He must have been very, very surprised that we came back, because they didn't expect us coming back.</span> <span id="s928">For instance, in 1945, we saw the trains coming from concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q. And you were in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A. No, no.</span> <span id="s931">I saw them in the army, but we saw them also in France.</span> <span id="s932">They were coming from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s933">They were liberated and they were coming to France to get some medical help and also to see what they can be relocated.</span> <span id="s934">Because a lot of those people were without any nationality.</span> <span id="s935">No country really recognized them.</span> <span id="s936">Some we called them ____________, with no nationality whatsoever.</span> <span id="s937">So, then I'm sure a lot of American Jews in our organization helped them resettle either in Israel in those days Palestine, or bring them to America.</span> <span id="s938">Then I heard about the Joint Committee, but we saw them every time, you know.</span> <span id="s939">I was making my business when I was in Paris to go to the train station and see those trains coming and see what I could do to help those people.</span> <span id="s940">A lot of them you saw cadavers.</span> <span id="s941">You saw those films.</span> <span id="s942">People emaciated, you know, came out of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s943">So, a lot of people in France they thought they will not come back because they already knew about the killing.</span> <span id="s944">They already knew these things, so they were very surprised to see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q.</span> <span id="s948">You were talking about going and seeing these trains coming with refugees from the camps and what they looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A.</span> <span id="s950">They looked so bad.</span> <span id="s951">They looked so bad.</span> <span id="s952">You could see those people were walking skeletons.</span> <span id="s953">Some of them couldn't even stand up.</span> <span id="s954">So, I was there and I was sometimes helping them get off the train going to an ambulance.</span> <span id="s955">I was helping.</span> <span id="s956">While I was in Austria, in occupation over there I was in ___________,and all of a sudden my brother-in-law send me a letter.</span> <span id="s957">He says _____________________, my brother was originally from Hungary.</span> <span id="s958">So, he said you are in______________ over there and there is a cousin of ours that is somewhere in the locating station somewhere.</span> <span id="s959">Give a look and see if you can find him.</span> <span id="s960">So, I asked around, and I was told that not far from _________ a little town by the name of ___________ they had some kind of camp like that was a Hungarian refugees.</span> <span id="s961">So, I went there and saw barracks, but it was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s962">I saw barracks, and I saw some families there already together waiting.</span> <span id="s963">I had his name and I said do you know so and so.</span> <span id="s964">I was asking and finally somebody said if he was single they put them up in a hotel in ___________.</span> <span id="s965">I said okay.</span> <span id="s966">So, I went to the hotel and I got to the desk and I asked her his name.</span> <span id="s967">They said, yes, he's here.</span> <span id="s968">I said where, what room?</span> <span id="s969">I went up to the room and after that I realized I did something wrong.</span> <span id="s970">I went to the room, opened the door and saw about eight or ten young fellows in that room.</span> <span id="s971">I walked in and I said who is this and this man.</span> <span id="s972">I didn't realize how I presented it.</span> <span id="s973">I was in full uniform.</span> <span id="s974">So, they got scared.</span> <span id="s975">So they pointed to one fellow and they said this is him and they all disappeared and he stayed with me.</span> <span id="s976">I said listen, your cousin is my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s977">In Yiddish I said your cousin is my brother-in-law, and I had to repeat this four or five times until it dawned on me.</span> <span id="s978">And I didn't realize you know he was talking to authority.</span> <span id="s979">In his eyes, I was in uniform.</span> <span id="s980">So, finally when he realized what I was saying, then I said let's go down to the restaurant and let's have something to eat.</span> <span id="s981">I asked him how he was doing if he needed something.</span> <span id="s982">He says he trying to get to France but he cannot get a visa to go to France.</span> <span id="s983">I said, let me see what I can do.</span> <span id="s984">So, I went to the French representative over there and I said that's my cousin.</span> <span id="s985">He came out of some concentration camp over there in Hungary.</span> <span id="s986">I'm his only family.</span> <span id="s987">I want him to go to France.</span> <span id="s988">What can you do?</span> <span id="s989">The girl was very nice she says I wish I could but I cannot.</span> <span id="s990">We cannot give any visas.</span> <span id="s991">Visas are coming from Paris.</span> <span id="s992">I cannot give it to him.</span> <span id="s993">After that I had a very good buddy of mine in the Army, in the army you usually get one friend who is more of an __________ than anything else.</span> <span id="s994">I told him listen.</span> <span id="s995">When we are going on furlough to Paris, the only time they're stopping us is at the border before we reach ______________.</span> <span id="s996">This is where they're stopping us.</span> <span id="s997">They're asking us sometime for a pass, but usually any time, ________ I told him what can we do for the guy.</span> <span id="s998">Well, we can put a uniform on him and once we are in France, there are a thousand refugees over there.</span> <span id="s999">They don't pull them out and since that idea we go on furlough in a couple weeks, we'll take him with us.</span> <span id="s1000">He can sit between us, he cannot talk because something is wrong with his throat and we'll go on through.</span> <span id="s1001">We can always borrow a uniform somewhere.</span> <span id="s1002">We went back to the hotel.</span> <span id="s1003">I said look we cannot get it legally, but according to what I know once you are in France they don't throw you out, so this is what we can do.</span> <span id="s1004">He was so scared he wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1005">So, after that he waited for about a year, year and a half and he needed a work certificate to get a job.</span> <span id="s1006">So, my father who was a little jeweler, said he'll give him a job.</span> <span id="s1007">So, this is what we tried to do.</span> <span id="s1008">To help as much as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q.</span> <span id="s1010">After the war, as a Jew in France, did you feel any differently.</span> <span id="s1011">Did the general reaction change at all or was it the same as before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A.</span> <span id="s1013">The same as before, and also when I'm thinking about it I was a little bit cocky because you see a lot of people were standing on line to see a film you know and I was going right up to the window and buying my ticket.</span> <span id="s1014">When somebody was looking at me and started to say something I say listen I don't have the time, now.</span> <span id="s1015">I have to go back.</span> <span id="s1016">I was cocky.</span> <span id="s1017">So to answer your question, I didn't have any fear.</span> <span id="s1018">You see the only think I knew I had to do something.</span> <span id="s1019">I came back, when I was released from the army we didn't have any money and France was in very shape.</span> <span id="s1020">I didn't see really a future a bright future for somebody like me.</span> <span id="s1021">No money, nothing, plus you know the country was always a little bit ___________ society, you know father and son get business and so forth.</span> <span id="s1022">So, having ____________ and being a Frenchman, was never really _____________.</span> <span id="s1023">So one day I decided let me go to the U.S. and see what I can do here.</span> <span id="s1024">If I don't like it, I can always go back.</span> <span id="s1025">I'm not a refugee.</span> <span id="s1026">I'm not running away from France because somebody is doing something to me.</span> <span id="s1027">I'm trying to get a better position.</span> <span id="s1028">So, I applied and I got my visa pretty fast.</span> <span id="s1029">I came to this country and the ___________ I knew some Americans are going to be offended, but the little I know as a mechanic, the little training I got, all of a sudden when I came to this country I find out I knew more than the Americans knew.</span> <span id="s1030">Because you see the apprenticeship was more intense than what the Americans were getting.</span> <span id="s1031">You see, for instance, I was often paid what I worth, so I didn't actually produce.</span> <span id="s1032">So, I started to work, I think I got less than a week and all of a sudden I discovered what I knew was worth something.</span> <span id="s1033">So, instead of working for somebody that didn't like the attitude I went from one store to the other and I started in brokering.</span> <span id="s1034">Because in brokering it was almost a place where I could communicate very, very little English, some Yiddish, so I could communicate with the customers.</span> <span id="s1035">I went to the store and I said listen.</span> <span id="s1036">I'm a mechanic.</span> <span id="s1037">I can fix machines, so they looked at me and we heard that story before.</span> <span id="s1038">I told them, listen you give them to me, if you don't like it, you don't pay me.</span> <span id="s1039">That's all there is to it.</span> <span id="s1040">So, what they did was they went to their basement and pick up any junk nobody wanted to fix, and I fixed it, at a very, very low price.</span> <span id="s1041">Little by little I made enough business man where I could get the work.</span> <span id="s1042">They were bringing the work at home.</span> <span id="s1043">I was working at home.</span> <span id="s1044">I had a little apartment in Brooklyn and I was working at home, and my mother and my younger sister came.</span> <span id="s1045">I had the apartment prepared for them, and my father and my sister, the middle one stayed with them because the other one got married, because he was going to close and sell whatever his business was.</span> <span id="s1046">So, I had my mother and my little sister, and I was already making enough to support them.</span> <span id="s1047">A year later my father came.</span> <span id="s1048">My father really never worked for anybody either.</span> <span id="s1049">He was always a little watchmaker in a small little store making a living as best he could.</span> <span id="s1050">So, we decided to open a store in Brooklyn because we knew the language.</span> <span id="s1051">In those days it was a Jewish section.</span> <span id="s1052">This is where the ________________are.</span> <span id="s1053">In those days it was no liberation.</span> <span id="s1054">We opened a little store.</span> <span id="s1055">Half of it was typewriters and the other half was jewelry and watchmaking.</span> <span id="s1056">We each went on like that for a couple years.</span> <span id="s1057">One day I met a beautiful Parisian girl, very Jewish and we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s1058">My father was a man who was happy what he was.</span> <span id="s1059">He didn't want too much.</span> <span id="s1060">But I was frustrated because I wanted a little bit more than that.</span> <span id="s1061">So, I was trying to do certain things in business where he was scared.</span> <span id="s1062">So, one day I told him, "Dad, I love you, but I must go."</span> <span id="s1063">So, what I did, this was working and what I had in mind was Manhattan is where business is.</span> <span id="s1064">So, he said I don't know anything about Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1065">One day I saw an ad in the paper they were looking for an experienced mechanic.</span> <span id="s1066">So one day I got the job and give me a chance to see what business is really like in New York.</span> <span id="s1067">In the meantime, I was going to work in Manhattan and at night after work I was going back to the store and taking care of whatever came in.</span> <span id="s1068">This took a few months and one day I saw the bus and I said listen I didn't come in to work for you.</span> <span id="s1069">I came in to see and his business was already having some difficulty.</span> <span id="s1070">He didn't have the know how.</span> <span id="s1071">He was just an accountant.</span> <span id="s1072">He didn't know the technical side.</span> <span id="s1073">He was depending on all the other people.</span> <span id="s1074">It didn't work.</span> <span id="s1075">So, I told him, either I go or I buy my way in.</span> <span id="s1076">He must have seen the picture he was really in a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s1077">I saw that he was in trouble but in my mind I could put it back in place.</span> <span id="s1078">This is what I did.</span> <span id="s1079">So, for quite a few years I went back every single day.</span> <span id="s1080">We lived in Brooklyn, my wife, myself and we had an only child.</span> <span id="s1081">So, I was going to the store and this is what was going on.</span> <span id="s1082">Sometimes I would start at 5:00 in the morning and finishing at 11:00, 12:00.</span> <span id="s1083">Saturday and Sunday I was working.</span> <span id="s1084">This went on for a few years, and one day I told my father, listen, you are hardly making a living now because you never understood the American way of doing business.</span> <span id="s1085">There is competition.</span> <span id="s1086">It's not France.</span> <span id="s1087">France before the war you bought something for $50 and you sold it with 40 or 50 percent profit.</span> <span id="s1088">Here you have to watch what the next guy does.</span> <span id="s1089">If you are not competitive you are never going to survive.</span> <span id="s1090">So, the merchandise he bought the first day when we left the store, we still had.</span> <span id="s1091">He never understood.</span> <span id="s1092">So, when I talked to my father I said, listen, you are hardly making a living and I thought about it, thought about and said why don't you come to work with me.</span> <span id="s1093">So a son going to work for a father is something acceptable but a father going to work for a son first of all is very hard for a son, because you cannot talk to an employee that's your father, but it had to be done.</span> <span id="s1094">So, he closed the business in Brooklyn and came to work for me until he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q. I just have a few questions that related to before you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1096">You younger sisters were hiding with someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q. Your other sister was in the convent and you were out there at risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q. Can you think of ways in which these years changed anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A. I'm sure it must have changed us.</span> <span id="s1102">I cannot pinpoint exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q.</span> <span id="s1104">Did you see them come out of that home different than when they went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A.</span> <span id="s1106">They were too young to show anything, but I think it did something to them.</span> <span id="s1107">I don't know maybe I'm looking too hard on that.</span> <span id="s1108">For instance you see Hitler tried to get rid of us, tried to do something to us.</span> <span id="s1109">Maybe we are trying to prove he didn't succeed at all.</span> <span id="s1110">My little sister, the little one three years old, right now is Professor at Harvard and is a doctor in Biology.</span> <span id="s1111">My other sister graduated college, maybe this gave us the little push we needed, you know.</span> <span id="s1112">I don't know if this is an answer to your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q.</span> <span id="s1114">You don't think you would have those positions in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A. Maybe yes, maybe no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q.</span> <span id="s1117">What about you?</span> <span id="s1118">Did it change your attitude?</span> <span id="s1119">Make you stronger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A.</span> <span id="s1121">In a certain way it made me stronger, you know, and it proved that --I don't want you to take it the wrong way -- it proved something that not too many men in their lives had, the proof that you can sacrifice yourself for somebody else.</span> <span id="s1122">I hope nobody is in a position like that, but being at the border to Spain and not going over, this proved to myself, I had enough feeling for my family and other people to not have done it.</span> <span id="s1123">I said this happened maybe once in a lifetime to a few people.</span> <span id="s1124">This is what I did.</span> <span id="s1125">And also it put me in a position where I never stayed back.</span> <span id="s1126">Some times it's not very smart because you get hit right in the face, but this is the way I am.</span> <span id="s1127">Maybe this makes me like that.</span> <span id="s1128">When there is a problem, I confront it right away.</span> <span id="s1129">For instance, it made me also less care than other people.</span> <span id="s1130">I had a couple experiences.</span> <span id="s1131">I was sitting in my office and a guy walked in and he had his rain coat on the ground and a few seconds it took for him to walk over to my desk, he pulled out a gun and asked me for money.</span> <span id="s1132">I was very calm.</span> <span id="s1133">I didn't panic.</span> <span id="s1134">I wasn't scared.</span> <span id="s1135">My father was in the repair department.</span> <span id="s1136">The only thing I said to that man -- he said who is in the back?</span> <span id="s1137">I said to the man I'm going to give you some money but my father is in the back.</span> <span id="s1138">He has a heart condition.</span> <span id="s1139">I don't want you to go over there.</span> <span id="s1140">The way I looked at him, I don't know, he took the money and he went.</span> <span id="s1141">Once I had another experience.</span> <span id="s1142">Once in May in New York City they have an art show on Fifth Avenue near the village over there.</span> <span id="s1143">So, one day we decided with my wife to go see the art show and look at the work of the artists.</span> <span id="s1144">We parked if you're not too familiar with New York, we parked on the corner of 13th Street and Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s1145">We looked at all those artists and after that we went to eat in a little Spanish restaurant in the village and when we came back we walked over to the car.</span> <span id="s1146">It was about 8:00 or 8:30 and in my car you can flip a button and it would open every door.</span> <span id="s1147">So, I got to my door, flip the button and in the meantime my wife goes around to the other door and sit down, and I sit down and somebody was holding, let my wife go.</span> <span id="s1148">I thought it was a panhandler and I heard him say get out of here.</span> <span id="s1149">He pulled a gun out.</span> <span id="s1150">He pointed at my wife.</span> <span id="s1151">He looked at me and he said you don't want me to hurt your wife.</span> <span id="s1152">I said okay I'll give you some money.</span> <span id="s1153">Since the incident in the office I always carried one wallet with larger bills and I carried a money clip with a lot of single bills in case something like that would happen.</span> <span id="s1154">So, I had my single bills and it looked like it was a lot of money but it was like maybe $25 or $30 and I told the fellow I said check the _____ and I give him that money.</span> <span id="s1155">I was so calm.</span> <span id="s1156">I said okay I'll give you the money but how about giving me back my money clip because it is a souvenir.</span> <span id="s1157">Just to show you so this might be the result of having lived through that war.</span> <span id="s1158">You know, because when you really think about it, in that period of time I was condemned to death if they would have every caught me and I was never scared.</span> <span id="s1159">Now, I may be scared of a lot of stuff because I'm old and different things.</span> <span id="s1160">In those days, no.</span> <span id="s1161">This might be these two occasions might show me how I still react, I'm not scared.</span> <span id="s1162">My wife was also amazing because she stayed very calm.</span> <span id="s1163">She didn't yell.</span> <span id="s1164">After that she said why did you ask him for the money clip.</span> <span id="s1165">It's ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1166">It doesn't make any sense but this is the way I am after the war.</span> <span id="s1167">They could have taken me for anything.</span> <span id="s1168">So, this is why I figured we survived.</span> <span id="s1169">They were not as anti-semitic like the Poles or the Russians.</span> <span id="s1170">You see, I'm sure there is a lot of anti-semitism in France.</span> <span id="s1171">They were there and they're still there, but they didn't touch us as other Jews of other countries.</span> <span id="s1172">Plus we, I don't know we were acting a little more different.</span> <span id="s1173">Maybe we were more aggressive.</span> <span id="s1174">Maybe I remember I didn't have any feeling of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1175">If they were to call me a dirty Jew or whatever I wouldn't have turned my back.</span> <span id="s1176">I didn't know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q. Do you think the French resistance was effective?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A. Very effective.</span> <span id="s1179">This is why you have survivors like I am.</span> <span id="s1180">They were very effective.</span> <span id="s1181">I'm sure some of those French, people in the resistance.</span> <span id="s1182">I'm sure some of them didn't like us, because we were Jews, but they hated the Germans more than anything.</span> <span id="s1183">But they did help us a lot.</span> <span id="s1184">We cannot say we survived on our own.</span> <span id="s1185">We needed a lot of good French people with good hearts.</span> <span id="s1186">For instance ______________ like the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s1187">So there must have been a lot.</span> <span id="s1188">We lost a lot of Jews, but a lot of them are still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q. Do you ever think about how you really sacrificed your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A. I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s1191">Sometimes I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to really enjoy my childhood.</span> <span id="s1192">Sometimes I'm sorry I never got a better education because when I look at my children, they had a chance in life of going to college.</span> <span id="s1193">They have a chance in life of picking their future.</span> <span id="s1194">I didn't have a chance.</span> <span id="s1195">But I didn't have those chances.</span> <span id="s1196">Like I said, I didn't have any use.</span> <span id="s1197">The war was there.</span> <span id="s1198">The only thing I had in mind was not to be caught and not being killed.</span> <span id="s1199">We were condemned to death and this must have done something you know in me.</span> <span id="s1200">You know because it's very hard to hope that it would never happen.</span> <span id="s1201">But being condemned to death for so long.</span> <span id="s1202">Being thought that we were going to be sent to be killed or being thought of doing something in the resistance would mean being shot, it made me work -- lucky I was young.</span> <span id="s1203">So, that to me was not that tangible.</span> <span id="s1204">I'm sure sometime I must have acted, sometimes my response to somebody looking at me or talking to me may see something I don't see.</span> <span id="s1205">Maybe sometime I react in a very aggressive way.</span> <span id="s1206">It's almost impossible in my mind in talking to my kid the doctor, it's almost impossible to live four or five years in that condition where you are not affected by it.</span> <span id="s1207">Now, I can't personally put my finger on it, but I'm sure if somebody was studying me for a little while they are going to notice he went through that.</span> <span id="s1208">I had it easy.</span> <span id="s1209">The people who spent two or three years in concentration camps and survived, those people were really affected.</span> <span id="s1210">Also, this is why asking me if it did affect me, I'm sure it did, but it didn't stop me of living and getting married and raising a family.</span> <span id="s1211">This is what the beauty of all this, that even after living through all that, you can still keep on going.</span> <span id="s1212">I don't see anything else I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q. Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">(viewing pictures.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A.</span> <span id="s1216">This is a French identity card.</span> <span id="s1217">Every French citizen I think from the age of 12 had to have an identity card.</span> <span id="s1218">This is for everybody.</span> <span id="s1219">In 1941, they called me to the police headquarter to register as a Jew and this is when they put on it the red letters Jewish.</span> <span id="s1220">If anybody stopped me they will know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1221">This is a second identity card because France in those years, when you move from one part of the country to another part of the country, you had to register again with the police and get a new identity card.</span> <span id="s1222">So I got an identity card in _____________ it's supposed to be in the French zone.</span> <span id="s1223">It was not occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1224">The identity card again with a red stamp with the word Jew on it.</span> <span id="s1225">This was in 1943 or the end of '42.</span> <span id="s1226">This is an identity card I received to the resistance with a false name.</span> <span id="s1227">Instead of being Federman, my name was Richard.</span> <span id="s1228">When I was stopped by the authorities, this is what I was showing.</span> <span id="s1229">And all this is false identities.</span> <span id="s1230">This is an identity card I received because I belonged to the French resistance movement and this I think is some kind of picture on this one.</span> <span id="s1231">When I came one day just when I was released from the Army -- when I came out of the Army they wanted me to have my card.</span> <span id="s1232">I didn't see any use for it, but they wanted me to have my card with a picture.</span> <span id="s1233">An identity card from the resistance.</span> <span id="s1234">I think they were making some kind of -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1235">This is to testify you know I fought in the resistance during the occupation and I'm entitled to wear a medal or whatever.</span> <span id="s1236">This picture is what I was wearing at the liberation.</span> <span id="s1237">I have an armband saying FFI and I had my gun.</span> <span id="s1238">We didn't have any uniform but this is so we could be recognized being in the resistance and other people were in the armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q.</span> <span id="s1240">This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A. 1945.</span> <span id="s1242">That's it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q. Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0338 PAGE 38</span></p></body></html>
