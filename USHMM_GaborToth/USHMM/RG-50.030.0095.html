10 years old, that period.</span> <span id="s27">So it was already before '33, because I think I was 12 years old in 1933 when Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Can you tell me about it?</span> <span id="s29">A: About Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: No, can you tell me about your first realization, the first time you recalled being associated as a Christkiller?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I cannot remember the distinct incident.</span> <span id="s32">All I know, the things usually happened during recess.</span> <span id="s33">The school was Gaudic (ph) School.</span> <span id="s34">Yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s35">Gaudic School was the name.</span> <span id="s36">And during recess, I was out with the other boys; and somebody starts the trouble, and starts calling you that.</span> <span id="s37">And I was very feisty.</span> <span id="s38">And as soon as somebody started calling me names, I was swinging.</span> <span id="s39">And there were bloody noses.</span> <span id="s40">The next thing happened, I was in the principal's office.</span> <span id="s41">Then my parents were called.</span> <span id="s42">That happened so often, I don't know anymore when the first time was.</span> <span id="s43">And my grades suffered.</span> <span id="s44">And I refused to do school work.</span> <span id="s45">And then my parents were called.</span> <span id="s46">And the teachers and the principal said, in German, (ph)."</span> <span id="s47">I cannot translate it.</span> <span id="s48">He is telling it; but lazy beyond, because I refused to work.</span> <span id="s49">I refused to.</span> <span id="s50">It became later, of course, even more pronounced after the Hitler period.</span> <span id="s51">When we had the assembly.</span> <span id="s52">We had to stand at attention and salute the flag and sing the Horst Wessel song.</span> <span id="s53">I tried not to raise my hand.</span> <span id="s54">And this led to complications and problems.</span> <span id="s55">Then I was forced to.</span> <span id="s56">It sometimes reminds me today, when I saw the conditions, when we are also forced to go through certain procedures.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: When you faced insults at school, did you try to bring the subject up with your parents or with your sister, for example?</span> <span id="s58">Did you ever talk to them about it?</span> <span id="s59">Or did you keep it to yourself?</span> <span id="s60">How were these matters touched on at home or weren't they touched on at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I think early on I must have mentioned something to my sister; but I learned early on that this was a part of growing up as a Jew and in a European country.</span> <span id="s62">In a country that has seen anti- Semitism forever.</span> <span id="s63">So it was all part of it, and you learn it, and I was not surprised by it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Your father, I believe, was a World War I veteran.</span> <span id="s65">How did he feel about Germany and how did he feel about things like this?</span> <span id="s66">Did he ever talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I don't remember talking to my father about it.</span> <span id="s68">No.</span> <span id="s69">I might have, but I don't remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">You see, until very recently, until about a year ago, I had a total memory block.</span> <span id="s71">And I went to several psychiatrists and psychologists in my home town, in Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s72">I didn't...when we were negotiating with the Germany government for restitution, loss of property, loss of education, and all that, I could not fill in all the lengthy questionnaires that I was sent by the German government; because I didn't remember the name of the school I attended, I didn't remember the name of the street I lived on.</span> <span id="s73">And if it wouldn't have been followed by a brother, I wouldn't have got a penny.</span> <span id="s74">About a year ago, I started writing about it and things started coming back more and more, but there is still some, some blocks there.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Can you remember the very first time you ever heard about Hitler, not necessarily 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">What did he mean to you very early on as a child?</span> <span id="s77">Was it ever discussed at home or amongst your friends or other Jewish families that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well, all I can tell you is that--(cough) excuse me--I should proceed that by saying that I considered myself almost a German, foremost.</span> <span id="s79">I had heard about Zionism, and we negated it.</span> <span id="s80">I was a German of the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s81">So were my parents.</span> <span id="s82">As you said, my father was a veteran of World War I. And when we heard about the Nazis, it was a passing political phenomena.</span> <span id="s83">Like many policies.</span> <span id="s84">I do remember once, I don't know when it was, some bloody street fights between a communist and the Nazis.</span> <span id="s85">And I do remember as if it was some sort of pin (ph); and several of my friends, maybe my parents, belonged to the SDP (Social Democratic Party) , which was a majority party, sent .</span> <span id="s86">And others wore the Nazi emblem, the Communist emblem, and more than once, I saw the street flights that really were something to behold as far as violence is concerned.</span> <span id="s87">Nothing to compare with today, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s88">But, it was just another party that came into power.</span> <span id="s89">I think the Jews by in large were perhaps divided into two camps - the pessimists and the optimists.</span> <span id="s90">There were some pessimists that picked up and left in the '30's.</span> <span id="s91">All our friends, my families, relatives, couldn't even conceive of leaving in the mid '30's.</span> <span id="s92">Why?</span> <span id="s93">Everybody lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s94">Your parents lived there.</span> <span id="s95">Your grandparents.</span> <span id="s96">Been there for generations who had a vital business.</span> <span id="s97">Why would anybody seriously consider leaving?</span> <span id="s98">And the Nazis developed their methods so slowly, very slowly, that at least from my perspective, whatever little I remember, there was no forewarning of what was to come.</span> <span id="s99">We look at it today with the perspective of hindsight.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: When did it first impinge on you?</span> <span id="s101">When did you first yourself notice the Nazis or feel that maybe the Nazis were affecting you.</span> <span id="s102">Not the street fights?</span> <span id="s103">But you yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I think that was the outgrowth of the Nuremberg...the Nuremberg Laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: It would help me considerably, rather than just answering my question, if you could say something like, "I remember this for me started in Europe."</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Okay, I think it was...I remember it when I was told I could no longer do certain things.</span> <span id="s107">I could no longer participate in sports, contact sports.</span> <span id="s108">Uh, soccor.</span> <span id="s109">I could no longer participate, unless the ski team--I did considerable ski racing; slalom and long distance.</span> <span id="s110">I could... It really hit me I wanted to go to the opera.</span> <span id="s111">I was no longer permitted to go to the opera.</span> <span id="s112">I saw the sign "Jews are Forbidden.</span> <span id="s113">Prohibited to Jews."</span> <span id="s114">Wherever we went, we saw more and more of the signs.</span> <span id="s115">That is when it really hit me that I was not just a German of the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s116">I was different.</span> <span id="s117">Which, until that period, it really hadn't sunk in.</span> <span id="s118">But then it did.</span> <span id="s119">So it was in the mid '30's that I realized that the vise had tightened a little bit, and we were made to stand out and we were different.</span> <span id="s120">And made to suffer for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Were you made to feel different in the street?</span> <span id="s122">You weren't allowed to go, how did people respond to you?</span> <span id="s123">Did you find it on a personal level that things were changing?</span> <span id="s124">Tell me something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, on a personal level, I felt it in school and in sports and when you wanted to participate in certain public events.</span> <span id="s126">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s127">So many areas were restricted.</span> <span id="s128">I think that is the only way I can remember it.</span> <span id="s129">I was still active in a very disciplined, highly disciplined, semi-militaristic youth organization, Jewish youth organization by the name of Scwartzefähnlein--Black Pennant [Ger: "Black Squad"].</span> <span id="s130">I joined it when I was about 8 and one half years old.</span> <span id="s131">And as I said, it was a rather militaristic pseudo-scouting organization.</span> <span id="s132">And this is when I had really my best times.</span> <span id="s133">I enjoyed life tremendously.</span> <span id="s134">And I have many, some fond memories.</span> <span id="s135">In retrospect, I am surprised that my parents let me go on a 6 weeks hike when I was 8 and one half years old.</span> <span id="s136">It was compared to scouting standards, very tough, just to get to scout.</span> <span id="s137">I believe I was let loose in the middle of of the woods at night, and find your way home.</span> <span id="s138">This sort of thing.</span> <span id="s139">And we tramped...hiked all of the way from Breslau [Pol: Wroc_aw] north to the Baltic Sea, then took a freighter around to bypass a Polish corridor, to the lake area of east of Poland--as the Polish called it--and hiked to an island where we stayed for 4 weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: This was a Jewish youth organization?</span> <span id="s141">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends at this time.</span> <span id="s143">Did they change at the time of Nuremberg, or didn't you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I am glad you asked that.</span> <span id="s145">I did have non-Jewish friends, up to about '35.</span> <span id="s146">After that, I was absolutely ostracized.</span> <span id="s147">I lost all friends I had.</span> <span id="s148">I did not exist anymore for my non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s149">They wouldn't dare to be seen with a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did they say anything to you at all?</span> <span id="s151">Did anybody ever apologize for the change?</span> <span id="s152">A: No.</span> <span id="s153">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Did you try to make contact with them or did you retreat?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, I guess in the beginning you walked up to a boy and tried to talk to him like you always did.</span> <span id="s156">And you were left standing when he turned around and walked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: After '35, were you still ?</span> <span id="s158">Did you have to give you name, and who you were, and what your father did?</span> <span id="s159">Was there any change in response then?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No.</span> <span id="s161">No.</span> <span id="s162">You see, German school was very disciplined as it was.</span> <span id="s163">and I don't when that incident happened.</span> <span id="s164">But to give an example, I don't know it was regular behavior, corporal punishment, I was very good in gym.</span> <span id="s165">As a gymnast.</span> <span id="s166">And we once did a formation in calisthenics.</span> <span id="s167">It was new to me.</span> <span id="s168">And I was bad to the kid next to me and watched what it was going to be when it was finished.</span> <span id="s169">And the teacher heard it, he walked up to me, and slapped my face and I wound up on the floor and I think that's when, perhaps, my hearing suffered somewhat.</span> <span id="s170">It is this sort of aggressive behavior by some teachers, was made perhaps more aggressive later than in the beginning, but quite frankly I don't remember exactly what happened where, when.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: When did you family start to talk about the changed situation after 1935?</span> <span id="s172">Or did they talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Was it an unmentioned subject?</span> <span id="s174">Did life just carry on?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Life carried on.</span> <span id="s176">You have to carry on.</span> <span id="s177">And especially on adverse conditions, you carry on.</span> <span id="s178">We talked about it occasionally, yes; especially since we had the matzah factory, which was bolaba (ph).</span> <span id="s179">Now it was like many synagogues.</span> <span id="s180">Not visible on the street.</span> <span id="s181">Many synagogues in Europe were in the yard behind the building, which was closed off with a iron gate, you know.</span> <span id="s182">You had to have access to it.</span> <span id="s183">And then you go through the yard, and the building was behind it.</span> <span id="s184">So it was only those people that knew; but occasionally there was some vandalism.</span> <span id="s185">But not much more.</span> <span id="s186">Surprisingly, my father, as I said, was a very nice, easy-going, mild- mannered man, who helped a lot of people.</span> <span id="s187">The factory workers that lived in the tenement houses, the apartment house that we owned in front of the factory, they adored him.</span> <span id="s188">They would do anything for him.</span> <span id="s189">He always helped them out.</span> <span id="s190">Give them money.</span> <span id="s191">So he never had any problems.</span> <span id="s192">Not even at Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Do you think his German workers felt okay about him being Jewish?</span> <span id="s194">Or were most of the workers Jewish?</span> <span id="s195">Or were they Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: All Germans.</span> <span id="s197">But I guess it was perhaps their livelihoods that they perhaps protected.</span> <span id="s198">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Do you remember anything special about... Do you remember... You said you were interested in gym.</span> <span id="s200">Do you remember the Olympic games?</span> <span id="s201">Do you remember thinking anything about the Olympic games?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: No.</span> <span id="s203">No.</span> <span id="s204">No.</span> <span id="s205">I heard about it from my wife cause she was a swimmer.</span> <span id="s206">And she is from Berlin.</span> <span id="s207">And they wanted...she also was not permitted anymore on a swim team.</span> <span id="s208">But they lived close to a Olympic stadium, and she told me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Let's move on now a couple of years.</span> <span id="s210">Let's move on to just before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s211">How were things changed from '35 to '38, as far as you were concerned?</span> <span id="s212">You were now a young man, 12 or 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s214">Well, it was about when I was 14 years old, things got very bad in school.</span> <span id="s215">I remember the principal coming in once and said, "We don't want the Jew Heppner in this school anymore.</span> <span id="s216">Out!"</span> <span id="s217">So I left school.</span> <span id="s218">When I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s219">I am a kick-out.</span> <span id="s220">I took some classes in private school, whatever; and then my mother knew somebody who owned a machine yard--industrial machinery, locomotives, like all the steam equipment.</span> <span id="s221">And everybody at that time learned a practical craft, in preparation for possible immigration.</span> <span id="s222">And I was good with my hands.</span> <span id="s223">I am almost ambidextrous.</span> <span id="s224">Actually, when I was left handed, I was forced to learn my writing with my right hand.</span> <span id="s225">So I took several courses.</span> <span id="s226">I learned welding, I learned locksmithing, I learned out to pick locks, and then I became a volunteer, (ph), that is the name for it.</span> <span id="s227">Not an apprentice, but as an apprentice with minimal pay; because we didn't need the money.</span> <span id="s228">My parents knew the owner.</span> <span id="s229">So I was working there in the yard, welding and cutting and working in the office.</span> <span id="s230">I knew how to type.</span> <span id="s231">I maintained the petty cash.</span> <span id="s232">They had a gas station; pumped gas, and learned all kind of things.</span> <span id="s233">One interesting experience I remember, after I took the course in welding, it was a fairly warm August day, I was asked to cut, with a torch, heavy steam piping.</span> <span id="s234">And I took the torch and I didn't have my overhauls and I cut off the umbrella bags, put them around my waist, took a piece of wire and fastened it, and another fella helped me turn the heavy piping while I was cutting away.</span> <span id="s235">And I smelled some smoke and the flames started shooting up and ignited the umbrella bags.</span> <span id="s236">But I had learned what to do, and I hit the ground and rolled and just lost some of my sweater and shirt and eyebrows and hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Were your fellow workers Jewish or German or German-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: The foreman of the yard, the yard foreman, was an SA man, Brown Shirt.</span> <span id="s239">Was an everyday German.</span> <span id="s240">Very business-like.</span> <span id="s241">Around the yard.</span> <span id="s242">No problems.</span> <span id="s243">I never knew if he was one of those that were more or less voluntarily had entered the Brownshirts, or not.</span> <span id="s244">Incidentally, later, Kristallnacht, he did not... Well, I will get to that later, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Let's maybe move forward to Kristallnacht itself and the staff report.</span> <span id="s246">Take me back and set the scene for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: This is the period that I really vividly remember.</span> <span id="s248">Of course, it was before the time of the jet age, before the time of instant news.</span> <span id="s249">We had to go to the movies, if we could go to the movies, and see the weekly news.</span> <span id="s250">I do remember we had a radio at home, a Blaupunkt, with a loud speaker which was fairly new and there were antennas in the form of spools and you had to carefully tune them to get a station.</span> <span id="s251">So getting news was not as easy as it was today.</span> <span id="s252">There was some rumors then, just about that time, after from Radnow (ph) or vom Rathwas assassinated, that the Nazis might look for a way to punish the Jews.</span> <span id="s253">Something was expected.</span> <span id="s254">We just didn't know what.</span> <span id="s255">And I know the night before, or during the night perhaps, I don't know when it was, I heard later in the morning my father he was gone.</span> <span id="s256">He had received a call from one of the factory workers to come to the factory.</span> <span id="s257">There was trouble there.</span> <span id="s258">Come to the factory and close it up.</span> <span id="s259">And I was at home with the maid.</span> <span id="s260">My brother by that time was married and lived someplace else with his wife and a little baby.</span> <span id="s261">And I heard some noise out front.</span> <span id="s262">We lived in a residential area in one of these big apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s263">Most middle class people, even the affluent ones, didn't own homes unless they had a villa.</span> <span id="s264">Large apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s265">We lived on the second floor.</span> <span id="s266">And I looked out and I saw a truck come up the street with SS troops, stop at one house, and I was watching.</span> <span id="s267">Go in and come out a few minutes later with some of our Jewish neighbors and push them up in the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Next house.</span> <span id="s269">Same thing.</span> <span id="s270">Then they came across to my house.</span> <span id="s271">I didn't wait for them.</span> <span id="s272">I ran to the back room, jumped out the window, got on my bike, got away.</span> <span id="s273">Then I was running around aimlessly for awhile and I was afraid of the road block and I got on the train, on a steam car, want to see what is happening.</span> <span id="s274">Where am I going to go now, where am I going to hid?</span> <span id="s275">So I got off.</span> <span id="s276">I want to see what is happening downtown.</span> <span id="s277">I was very adventure-some.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">That was my scouting nature.</span> <span id="s279">I did some crazy things.</span> <span id="s280">So I got on a street car and I could see the smoke from a distance already.</span> <span id="s281">Leaned out, I was standing on the platform.</span> <span id="s282">I could see smoke and came to the name of the place, I can't remember the name, and I saw the flames shooting out of the dome of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s283">I was just furious.</span> <span id="s284">That affected me more than perhaps anything else in all these years.</span> <span id="s285">But I remember next to me stood an old German woman and she muttered to herself, translated into English, "Oh, what a shame.</span> <span id="s286">What a beautiful building that was."</span> <span id="s287">Next to us stood a Nazi in civics and not in uniform and he reached and pulled the cord, brought the train to a stop, yanked her out just for that remark.</span> <span id="s288">Time went on and until I got close I decided from there on I am going to go to where I worked.</span> <span id="s289">That was a pretty big yard and I figured of all the places, this is perhaps fairly safe and I can hide.</span> <span id="s290">I used to be inside steam boilers, you know, cleaning them and so I figured nobody is going to find me there.</span> <span id="s291">And I got there and I came through the back entrance somehow and I saw Herr Mischelson (ph) the owner, Jewish, a friend of my mother and they had an apartment right over the office building.</span> <span id="s292">And he was walking along with a cigar.</span> <span id="s293">I said, gee, that is strange.</span> <span id="s294">Here they round up Jews and business as usual.</span> <span id="s295">So I thought I got to go in hiding.</span> <span id="s296">So I waited a moment and watched and there is a yard man, in uniform.</span> <span id="s297">And he didn't.</span> <span id="s298">Business as usual.</span> <span id="s299">He didn't turn him in.</span> <span id="s300">This was an industrial complex, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">And it was actually as I remembered there was an SS at the roundups and the SA was 1 Ernst vom Rath was a German diplomat assassinated in Paris by Hershel Grynszpan on November 7, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">involved in the night before, busting up the shop windows and all that.</span> <span id="s303">So, he didn't turn him in.</span> <span id="s304">but I didn't trust the situation.</span> <span id="s305">I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s306">So, I stayed out of sight until evening and then made my way home again.</span> <span id="s307">In the meanwhile, my father was at the factory and stayed at the factory and stayed in hiding until the next night too by one of his workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: You say the lorrie drove up.</span> <span id="s309">What sort of street was it?</span> <span id="s310">Who were the men inside it?</span> <span id="s311">Were they young?</span> <span id="s312">Were they old?</span> <span id="s313">How were they carrying on?</span> <span id="s314">What sort of street does a Jew live on?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I think the name was Wolfestrasse (ph).</span> <span id="s316">And it was a residential area.</span> <span id="s317">And I presume, it was a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s318">There were no really Jewish areas, as such.</span> <span id="s319">But I think most Jews belong to what you would call the middle class.</span> <span id="s320">Quite a few lived in an area there.</span> <span id="s321">The general area, in a south area.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Did you recognize any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: As neighbors, yes.</span> <span id="s324">Yes.</span> <span id="s325">I neglected to tell you something.</span> <span id="s326">Before I went on the train, on my bike I decided to go to my brother's house.</span> <span id="s327">I got to my brother's house, and there was my sister-in-law with the baby just about in tears.</span> <span id="s328">What had happened (end of tape this side) (phrases missing).</span> <span id="s329">There were quite a few men around there that had heard what happened the night before, and they thought of maybe going to Berlin or another city.</span> <span id="s330">They couldn't conceive that it had happened all over the country.</span> <span id="s331">It was you would have thought an isolated incident there, you see.</span> <span id="s332">We didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s333">So we thought of maybe hiding temporarily, but where.</span> <span id="s334">So we decided, well, to go home first and pack a suitcase.</span> <span id="s335">But then of course they find out, you know, you can't go in hiding.</span> <span id="s336">So all he could do was call up and report and next morning the policemen came and escorted him to the station where he found a whole group of other men under the same conditions and then they were marched through the streets to the railroad station with all the German folk standing by and hooting and hollering and seeing in the opening what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Did you see the schelshon (ph)?</span> <span id="s338">Did you see these people being marched off?</span> <span id="s339">What was happening to you that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A. I did not.</span> <span id="s341">That was the day, wait a minute, that was the next day.</span> <span id="s342">Nothing anymore.</span> <span id="s343">This roundup was primarily only this one day if I remember right.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Were you back at home?</span> <span id="s345">A: I was back at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">2 Wallstrasse?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Let me take you back just a little bit more?</span> <span id="s348">You say you decided to go to your brother and your sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s349">Set the scene for me, as you went up the stairs or into the apartment or what.</span> <span id="s350">What was the situation?</span> <span id="s351">How were you admitted?</span> <span id="s352">What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I think it was just a mess.</span> <span id="s354">It was an apartment building.</span> <span id="s355">A modern apartment building.</span> <span id="s356">And, if I remember right, the place was just torn up.</span> <span id="s357">The way it would look, you know, if you had burglars, I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How frightened was your sister-in-law?</span> <span id="s359">Did she let you in easily?</span> <span id="s360">Where was the baby?</span> <span id="s361">A: I don't know, it was... I see it, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s362">It was in a crib, in her arm at one time, earlier or later.</span> <span id="s363">I really can't reconstruct it.</span> <span id="s364">It is just too long ago.</span> <span id="s365">Some things stand in my mind; like I remember there was a scene of fire shooting out of the skeleton, what was left.</span> <span id="s366">I made a vow then.</span> <span id="s367">I was so furious and so hateful already.</span> <span id="s368">I vowed at that time I was going to fight those bastards whenever and wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Were the people standing around watching?</span> <span id="s370">Was the fire brigade there or was it just burning?</span> <span id="s371">Just tell me a little bit more about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I didn't see too much; because it was a side street, you see, and the train was going at right angle to it.</span> <span id="s373">So I saw the outline of the building, the great temple where we went to services.</span> <span id="s374">And it was a huge building, like a cathedral.</span> <span id="s375">It was a dome.</span> <span id="s376">And I just saw it for a fraction of a second.</span> <span id="s377">I think that the fire brigade was there.</span> <span id="s378">You have to protect burning buildings at least, you know.</span> <span id="s379">It was one of the buildings that was not in the back yard, but was out in the open, incidently.</span> <span id="s380">It was a big building.</span> <span id="s381">Red brick building.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What happened to your father?</span> <span id="s383">You and your father weren't rounded up?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: No.</span> <span id="s385">As far as I remember, this roundup was only very...just this one day.</span> <span id="s386">I don't know.</span> <span id="s387">My father never was caught, and I wasn't caught.</span> <span id="s388">It's too big, what happened then.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: What about your brother?</span> <span id="s390">Was your father there?</span> <span id="s391">Did you know what was happening with your brother?</span> <span id="s392">How did you find out all of that?</span> <span id="s393">How did the family respond and how did you respond?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, I am trying to think.</span> <span id="s395">1938.</span> <span id="s396">We had a get-together...we had a get-together in the evening, I think.</span> <span id="s397">My mother and my father were not on best terms.</span> <span id="s398">As a matter of fact, they were separated, but together again.</span> <span id="s399">And eventually divorced, for practical reasons.</span> <span id="s400">The only thing I do remember is that Kristallnacht was the turning point.</span> <span id="s401">That was the time when we knew that this was for real.</span> <span id="s402">No more optimism left.</span> <span id="s403">All this time before, we were questioning, "How do we get out?"</span> <span id="s404">And I think it is all important.</span> <span id="s405">You know, I get asked so often: "Why was it so difficult to get out of Germany?"</span> <span id="s406">And I tell everybody, "It is not getting out.</span> <span id="s407">It was a question that no county would let you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Tell me, if you can, can you see the scene that evening?</span> <span id="s409">What was the discussion?</span> <span id="s410">You said this was the end of optimism.</span> <span id="s411">Tell me, can you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s413">That followed after the conference of Evian, you know.</span> <span id="s414">Where are we going to go.</span> <span id="s415">I know that my brother had contacts with some consulate I think in Uruguay.</span> <span id="s416">Get visa.</span> <span id="s417">Fortunately, he had some papers.</span> <span id="s418">And we found out, I don't know exactly when, that the Gestapo made it clear that anyone that would prove to them that they would leave Germany within a specified time, they would be released from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s419">There was a second reason, also, how you could get released.</span> <span id="s420">I don't know if it is pertinent now.</span> <span id="s421">I think a title, our house title was already sold by that time, sold forcibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What do you mean by that, house sold forcibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: We had to sell it to Aryans.</span> <span id="s424">It has just come back to me that earlier, sometime in the '30's, Jews were forced to inventory all their belongings, assets, everything they owned, jewelry, and property was sold for a pittance.</span> <span id="s425">Our real estate was sold for a pittance.</span> <span id="s426">Our title was sold.</span> <span id="s427">We had no say and somebody that wanted it could buy it for next to nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: I don't understand you.</span> <span id="s429">How were you forced to sell?</span> <span id="s430">Did someone come along and say to you, sell it, or were you hard up?</span> <span id="s431">You say you were forced to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, I am trying to think because my parents were involved.</span> <span id="s433">Not I, personally.</span> <span id="s434">The way I think it worked, I vaguely remember now, if a Jew owned a store, a business, and his competitor I'd say, or anyone, would say I would like to have it, I would like to own it, could merely go to the police and say I want to buy that from that Jew, and the price was set, and that was it.</span> <span id="s435">Now if that Jew was in a concentration camp --Buchenwald, Dachau or Sachsenhausen--and the Christian buyer was fairly decent and didn't know how to run the business that he just acquired from the Jew; and the wife, let's say, came to him and said, "Do you need some help running it?"</span> <span id="s436">Or the fact is the Jew was helping him run the business, which he was required to do, then the Gestapo would immediately discharge him.</span> <span id="s437">But most of them was...could get out of the camp if the wife, daughter, whoever went to the Gestapo with proof.</span> <span id="s438">This was a crucial period.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: You say your brother was arrested.</span> <span id="s440">Did you see him?</span> <span id="s441">Tell me how did that affect the family, his actual arrest and departure?</span> <span id="s442">What flowed from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Well, we heard it from my sister-in-law and that is all I do know.</span> <span id="s444">Because, well, I was so fairly young and I was very concerned about at once things.</span> <span id="s445">And I didn't have much contact with my brother, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s447">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Let's just take ourselves back again.</span> <span id="s449">You say that you heard your brother was away and you started to talk about things.</span> <span id="s450">When did your brother, did you see your brother again, did he come out after?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s452">Yes, fortunately, he had some negotiations with, I believe, the consulate of Uruguay.</span> <span id="s453">I understand that many of the consulates took money under the table and sold visas.</span> <span id="s454">One of the problems was that our bank account were closed.</span> <span id="s455">It didn't matter how much money you owned, you could not get it out.</span> <span id="s456">The bank would give you sufficient money to live on, for daily necessities and for anything connected with emigration.</span> <span id="s457">I got, for instance, my ticket-- steamer tickets, or whatever.</span> <span id="s458">Train tickets.</span> <span id="s459">But not sufficient money to buy a visa.</span> <span id="s460">But my sister-in-law, I believe, had a..</span> <span id="s461">.</span> <span id="s462">what I would call a "letter of intent," saying that they're working on a visa, that most likely you would get the visa.</span> <span id="s463">So with that, she went to the Gestapo headquarters, and was told, "Um, yes, okay.</span> <span id="s464">We will investigate, and he will be set free."</span> <span id="s465">So I heard indirectly that one day, that he, like many others, a loud speaker... He was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s466">A loud speaker said ...called out the name of the Jews there to come to the gate.</span> <span id="s467">And certain procedures were followed; and they were given even money and a train ticket, and they were sent home.</span> <span id="s468">Ironically, the town nearest to Buchenwald is Weimar, which I had I think had some connection with the...that's where the Weimar Republic was formed.</span> <span id="s469">So he came home.</span> <span id="s470">He had survived the winter, which was cold; but since he only reported next morning, he was dressed warmly.</span> <span id="s471">So he didn't suffer the same fate as some others, you know, that didn't survive the harsh German winter.</span> <span id="s472">He would never talk about his experience there.</span> <span id="s473">Never.</span> <span id="s474">He said he couldn't.</span> <span id="s475">All I know next was that we set around the table to decide what to do now.</span> <span id="s476">I understand there was a time limit.</span> <span id="s477">What my brother and sister tried to do, they took a course...had taken a course, at one time--or maybe only afterwards, I don't remember--as butler and maid.</span> <span id="s478">Because they tried to go to England.</span> <span id="s479">And I understand England needed domestic help.</span> <span id="s480">So my sister-in-law--which I believe has never been in a kitchen, because she didn't even know how to cook an egg, because we had servants, you know--and so I found out later on, they went out to England on some estate that was owned by Jews who very rapidly found out that my brother was no butler.</span> <span id="s481">He learned how to pour the white wine and red wine; but my sister-in-law couldn't cook.</span> <span id="s482">But they helped them along and got some other job for them; until, unfortunately, my brother was then interned by Great Britain for being a German.</span> <span id="s483">As you know, one of the other ironies of politics.</span> <span id="s484">But I think the main thing that happened then... In 1978, I believe it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: [Do you mean 1938]?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: '78.</span> <span id="s487">NBC had a document[ary] drama on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s488">And I saw a preview; and I saw the family--Wiess or Weiss--sitting around a dinner table there trying to figure out what next, how to get out, and what to do.</span> <span id="s489">You know.</span> <span id="s490">I saw the scene; and something bothered me.</span> <span id="s491">And I said, "Gee, that is...is so familiar.</span> <span id="s492">And yet there is something strange that isn't right."</span> <span id="s493">Something was basically wrong with that scene, but I couldn't make out.</span> <span id="s494">But I remembered, "My God!</span> <span id="s495">That it is what happened at our home!"</span> <span id="s496">And I woke up the next night, and remembered.</span> <span id="s497">It was exactly what happened at our home, except it was in German.</span> <span id="s498">On the NBC documentary, it was in English.</span> <span id="s499">I remember the scene in German.</span> <span id="s500">I was sitting around.</span> <span id="s501">And by that time, there were rumors floating around that there was a place in China--which is the other end of the world.</span> <span id="s502">At that time, farther than the...perhaps, Mars today.</span> <span id="s503">Or perhaps the moon.</span> <span id="s504">There was a place in China that did not require a visa, and Jews could go there without a visa.</span> <span id="s505">It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s506">So my mother, who was very good business woman, she said she would investigate.</span> <span id="s507">Then I think they contacted some of the Jewish organizations; and the Jewish organizations said, "Yes, you can go there.</span> <span id="s508">But don't.</span> <span id="s509">It is an awful place.</span> <span id="s510">We would not recommend anyone to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s511">That's the name of the city.</span> <span id="s512">There is a war raging there, and you don't know if you would even be permitted to land there.</span> <span id="s513">All kind of rumors.</span> <span id="s514">And just don't."</span> <span id="s515">So my mother went to a travel agent.</span> <span id="s516">And she heard: "Yes, you can go there by boat.</span> <span id="s517">And it takes about four weeks to go there, on a luxury liner.</span> <span id="s518">Yeah, but the waiting list is 6 to 8 months.</span> <span id="s519">10 months."</span> <span id="s520">So my mother said, "You know, there must be some way of getting there faster."</span> <span id="s521">So my mother did...the travel agent had helped my mother several times.</span> <span id="s522">And she said, "You own some Impressionistic paintings, don't you?</span> <span id="s523">Well, the agent...I happen to know the agent of the Nord Deutsche Lön, the official German Steamship Agency.</span> <span id="s524">He is a collector."</span> <span id="s525">So it wasn't long afterwards we start to make the preparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">We already...I have a copy of a letter to the Gestapo to give us preference in getting all the stuff out.</span> <span id="s527">You know, you had to list and inventory how many shirts, how many shoes, how many socks--everything had to be listed.</span> <span id="s528">Get everything in preparation done.</span> <span id="s529">And my parents, my sister and brother... And my mother and I were supposed to try, at least, first to go out; and they would follow.</span> <span id="s530">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s531">My sister--by that time, as I said, she was very severely handicapped--had found a man that was also handicapped; and the two kept company.</span> <span id="s532">So she didn't want to leave him immediately.</span> <span id="s533">And my father still had to wind up some business.</span> <span id="s534">My brother was trying to go to England.</span> <span id="s535">So it was decided my mother and I was supposed to go first.</span> <span id="s536">We get a call.</span> <span id="s537">"Everything is ready.</span> <span id="s538">Can you leave in 48 hours?"</span> <span id="s539">A couple onboard the Potsdam, or going on board, or before they boarded--I am not sure which--leaving the port of Hamburg committed suicide.</span> <span id="s540">They couldn't face it.</span> <span id="s541">And the liner left with an empty cabin.</span> <span id="s542">My mother and I got the Customs people over, or what the... They had to come to our house and seal our bags, inspect them and seal them.</span> <span id="s543">We took the night express to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: No goodbyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes, there were goodbyes.</span> <span id="s546">Yes, I said goodbye to my father and my sister.</span> <span id="s547">And I knew that I would never see them again.</span> <span id="s548">My brother took us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s549">Yah, I knew it then.</span> <span id="s550">They said, "Aufwiedersehen;" but I knew we would never seem them again.</span> <span id="s551">I got a very severe nosebleed that couldn't be stopped when I said goodbye to my sister.</span> <span id="s552">I plugged it up, because the cab was waiting and we didn't want to miss the train.</span> <span id="s553">So then we got into the train.</span> <span id="s554">And through Innsbruck, and looked out the window; and there were the mountains right and left of the station, beautiful...Austria.</span> <span id="s555">And then we knew on the other side is Italy.</span> <span id="s556">We got to Austria, and come to Zolle--you know, Customs.</span> <span id="s557">Oh, before that, my mother and I were talking.</span> <span id="s558">And she confided in me that she took a second watch.</span> <span id="s559">We were permitted one ring, one watch--everything strictly regulated.</span> <span id="s560">And although I was quite...well, easy- going and adventure-some, when I heard that she had an extra watch, I just threw a fit in that compartment.</span> <span id="s561">There was another fellow sitting there, who was also heading to Shanghai I found out later.</span> <span id="s562">And I made her give me the thing; and before we got to the border, I got out of the compartment, went to a mailbox and threw the watch into the mailbox.</span> <span id="s563">And she loved that watch, and she didn't want to give it up; but I made her.</span> <span id="s564">I knew what would have happened if they would have found a second watch, you know.</span> <span id="s565">We would have headed back to Germany.</span> <span id="s566">And a good thing we did, because when we came to the border town, the control [NB: Customs] went through: "Alle Juden, Raus!"</span> <span id="s567">Every Jew had to get out.</span> <span id="s568">And with our baggage and everything, out.</span> <span id="s569">And so they started examining... Now, the baggage was sealed, fortunately.</span> <span id="s570">So they strip-searched us; and the train went on, without us.</span> <span id="s571">After we were through, we had to wait for the next train--which was one of these...not an express, but one of the slow pokes, you know, that stops at every station.</span> <span id="s572">So we got to Genoa--called Genoa?</span> <span id="s573">--fairly late at night.</span> <span id="s574">Couldn't board the boat, and boarded the next morning.</span> <span id="s575">And we realized, "My God!"</span> <span id="s576">We had the two suitcases each, and each of us had 10 marks.</span> <span id="s577">Twenty marks between us.</span> <span id="s578">The total of eight American dollars.</span> <span id="s579">Four dollars each.</span> <span id="s580">And all of a sudden, it overcame us.</span> <span id="s581">You know, all of a sudden... All my life, I [had] never worried about money.</span> <span id="s582">And my mother always played the grand dame.</span> <span id="s583">You know, she [was] fairly well off.</span> <span id="s584">And uh, you know, travelled widely, and um always had a fairly good life.</span> <span id="s585">And all of a sudden, we got to the city and we realized we had no money on us.</span> <span id="s586">Do we have enough money for a hotel?</span> <span id="s587">You know, we lived from one day to the next.</span> <span id="s588">Well, we found a place to stay [for] one night.</span> <span id="s589">We were lying in bed; and all of a sudden, an earthquake struck.</span> <span id="s590">We didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s591">We're both sitting in bed and trying to sleep.</span> <span id="s592">Uh, was a strange experience, for the first time.</span> <span id="s593">And uh next morning, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: What was a strange experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: The earthquake!</span> <span id="s596">The earth was shaking.</span> <span id="s597">That's why I remember that particular night.</span> <span id="s598">And uh next morning, we boarded the boat.</span> <span id="s599">Potsdam.</span> <span id="s600">The cabin was not first class, but was touristic- -second class.</span> <span id="s601">But it was a luxury liner.</span> <span id="s602">As we have cruises today in the old tradition and the young tradition.</span> <span id="s603">With a menu that long, and service as it is supposed to be.</span> <span id="s604">We enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Carefree days... We had "board" money.</span> <span id="s606">The bank had deposited a certain amount, because it was a German boat.</span> <span id="s607">Deposited--I forgot how much.</span> <span id="s608">We had four dollars; but we could buy several hundred marks worth--maybe even more--of anything in the ship's store.</span> <span id="s609">The first thing, I bought a camera.</span> <span id="s610">I think it was a Leica.</span> <span id="s611">I bought a very good camera with the rest of that money.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Tell me about the other passengers.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Well, there was only one passenger I do remember.</span> <span id="s614">There was another young man about my age.</span> <span id="s615">I have seen maybe a picture of him, but I forget his name and I don't know who he was.</span> <span id="s616">And I have never run into him in Shanghai anymore.</span> <span id="s617">I lost track of him.</span> <span id="s618">But there was one gentleman, extremely well dressed, who was sitting in our compartment of the train who also went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s619">He was very flamboyantly dressed, with wife and child Zahlinger (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s620">I do remember it, because he opened a store later in Shanghai and I worked for him for awhile.</span> <span id="s621">That is one of the passengers that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: What was the mood on the...on the ship?</span> <span id="s623">Was the mood cheerful?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Well, it was a mixture of cheerful... You know, you really couldn't worry much because, first of all, we had to pay out our ticket.</span> <span id="s625">I still have a copy of it.</span> <span id="s626">We had to pay for a return trip, because we did not know we were permitted to land in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s627">So you would try not to think of it.</span> <span id="s628">We knew there was nobody there; we didn't know anybody in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s629">We didn't know the language.</span> <span id="s630">I did not know the difference between Y-E-S and N-O.</span> <span id="s631">I literally did not speak a single word of English.</span> <span id="s632">I had some Latin school, which started in the fifth grade.</span> <span id="s633">I had a little bit of French.</span> <span id="s634">We got to Port Said.We had our first experience with Jewish organizations; because the British tried to prevent us from going ashore.</span> <span id="s635">God forbid we might stay!</span> <span id="s636">I got ashore.</span> <span id="s637">And uh walked around the harbor.</span> <span id="s638">A couple of Arabs approached me, tried to sell me dates.</span> <span id="s639">I had no money.</span> <span id="s640">Cigarettes, yes.</span> <span id="s641">So I traded my German cigarettes for dates, which I love.</span> <span id="s642">And then there were a couple of Jews--uh met us and asked us to come with them.</span> <span id="s643">And they guided us to a house and took us upstairs.</span> <span id="s644">It was so ramshackle that I was afraid the house would fall down.</span> <span id="s645">And I remember walking up a little stairway into a room, and there was spread out clothing.</span> <span id="s646">"If you need any clothing..." And you know, I just couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s647">Why would I need used clothing?</span> <span id="s648">Not realizing that there are ...were some people who got out with even less than I had.</span> <span id="s649">So we had a fairly carefree time.</span> <span id="s650">We got to the rest of the ports; sail on Singapore, beautiful harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Singapore, we're also met by Jews.</span> <span id="s652">The same difficulties with the British.</span> <span id="s653">But we had a valid passport, and they really couldn't make a distinction and prevent us from going ashore.</span> <span id="s654">Our boat went over [to] Kobe, Japan, where we spent a day.</span> <span id="s655">And then came a day when we steamed to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s656">Uh, the ship was...waited for a high tide in the Yangtze [NB: Chang Jiang] , in the Yangtze River.</span> <span id="s657">Then we slowly steamed into the...a tributary, the Huang- p'u [Also: Huangpu or Wangpoo] [River].</span> <span id="s658">And I remember we were all up on deck and we looked out at the right side, starboard.</span> <span id="s659">And we saw nothing but desolation.</span> <span id="s660">What we saw, without knowing it, was the suburb of Hongkou [NB: Hongkew] of Shanghai--where we would actually live later.</span> <span id="s661">But when we saw it, I think everybody was just awestruck.</span> <span id="s662">It was quite... You could see the desolation, or ruins.</span> <span id="s663">At that time, nobody had seen desolation of that type.</span> <span id="s664">Burned out buildings.</span> <span id="s665">We saw some wharfs that were sticking up.</span> <span id="s666">For some reasons, the wharfs were there along the waterfront.</span> <span id="s667">And then we came slowly to the Bund, the waterfront of the Shanghai.</span> <span id="s668">And nobody even noticed the beautiful big buildings there and what's going to happen there.</span> <span id="s669">We had thought of China--you know, typical Chinese buildings, upturned roofs, and all that.</span> <span id="s670">Philippine buildings.</span> <span id="s671">Office buildings.</span> <span id="s672">Except for this section that we were seeing there.</span> <span id="s673">And which was, I don't know what to call it.</span> <span id="s674">It was very demoralizing perhaps, seeing that.</span> <span id="s675">This was Shanghai.</span> <span id="s676">And we came; and the boat couldn't get to Jack (ph) Quay.</span> <span id="s677">We were afraid to go over and the lighter in the launch.</span> <span id="s678">When you get</span></p> <p><span id="s679">3 in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">to Shanghai, the noise hits you.</span> <span id="s681">And I can still smell the street vendors and the peanut oil.</span> <span id="s682">And it wasn't...the heat hadn't started yet, because it was March...March '39.</span> <span id="s683">So it wasn't...the heat wasn't so bad as it was later.</span> <span id="s684">And then our suitcases came.</span> <span id="s685">And what bothered...what struck us most was, there was some representatives of a committee there, greeting us.</span> <span id="s686">And uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What sort of committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Well, one of the committees that had sprung up to assist the refugees that were arriving there.</span> <span id="s689">It was formed by Shanghai --the Jews there, the Jews that had lived there already.</span> <span id="s690">There was some Jews living there from the Bolshevik Revolution, and some Sephardic Jews from India--the Sassoons and the Hardoons--and some of the others, that had organized some committees to help the arriving Jews.</span> <span id="s691">And we were just through--no customs, no nothing, no visa, no passport control.</span> <span id="s692">Nothing!</span> <span id="s693">Just was, then.</span> <span id="s694">And we were told we would be taken to a reception center.</span> <span id="s695">And we came outside the jetty there; and we already got some quick warnings.</span> <span id="s696">"Don't do this.</span> <span id="s697">Don't do that.</span> <span id="s698">Hold on to your pocketbook.</span> <span id="s699">Hold onto your money."</span> <span id="s700">And a whole list of don'ts.</span> <span id="s701">And uh there is a truck.</span> <span id="s702">"Will you get on the truck, please."</span> <span id="s703">And I found out later, a cattle truck.</span> <span id="s704">There is usually not much cattle in China.</span> <span id="s705">It's pigs.</span> <span id="s706">So we walked up that plank, on a truck.</span> <span id="s707">And it is quite a sight.</span> <span id="s708">I have a photograph of that.</span> <span id="s709">Well dressed Europeans walking up on a cattle truck, standing up there, through the narrow streets of Shanghai and taken to the Embankment Building.</span> <span id="s710">Which was office building belonging to [Sir Victor] Sassoon; which he had made a couple of floors available, which were hastily converted to receptionist area.</span> <span id="s711">So that's where there was a kind of soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s712">And I was...we landed, incidently, and we had about 75 cents left among us--my Mom and I--in American money.</span> <span id="s713">Which went a long way in China.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: How did you expect to live, with 75 cents?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: We didn't know.</span> <span id="s716">When we got there... And before that, we did not know who would greet us, if somebody would meet us, if we would have roof over our heads the next day, if we would have something to eat the next day.</span> <span id="s717">We knew nothing.</span> <span id="s718">We heard some rumors: yes, there was some Jews and there would be somebody, hopefully.</span> <span id="s719">We also...we didn't know if there was still fighting, if we would be able to land.</span> <span id="s720">We didn't hear anything from the steamship line.</span> <span id="s721">They didn't make any announcements.</span> <span id="s722">We knew nothing.</span> <span id="s723">At least, I didn't.</span> <span id="s724">Maybe some others knew more.</span> <span id="s725">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So what happened when you got to the reception center?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Well, I got some soup.</span> <span id="s728">And I was very spoiled.</span> <span id="s729">You see, we had one cooks in the hotel; obviously, we had cooks.</span> <span id="s730">I wanted a cook, I wanted this, and I don't like that.</span> <span id="s731">And I was really a spoiled brat.</span> <span id="s732">And I got a bowl of soup there that I couldn't get it down.</span> <span id="s733">And I know I took something of the 75 cents and went and bought a candy bar.</span> <span id="s734">I learned the hard way.</span> <span id="s735">I had to survive.</span> <span id="s736">I learned it, but it wasn't easy for a spoiled brat like me.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: What did you go to then?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Uh, well, we stayed there for about 2 weeks in this reception center.</span> <span id="s739">And my mother is very resourceful, as I said earlier.</span> <span id="s740">She met the director of the one of the youth committees that had sprung up.</span> <span id="s741">And found a job, very rapidly.</span> <span id="s742">They needed some help.</span> <span id="s743">There were no social workers in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s744">So she said she can do this, she can do that.</span> <span id="s745">And I guess I learned this from her.</span> <span id="s746">I bluffed my way through everything.</span> <span id="s747">And so she got a job.</span> <span id="s748">In Shanghai, money...it doesn't take much.</span> <span id="s749">You know, an American dollar would last you maybe months.</span> <span id="s750">It doesn't take much.</span> <span id="s751">So after two weeks, we found a room in a Japanese section of Hongkou, in which lived a Japanese family and a ship's captain and another refugee family.</span> <span id="s752">And uh my mother started working; and I stayed home with a flyswatter and killed flies.</span> <span id="s753">And my mother wrote a letter home to my father, complaining I am not doing anything all day long except catch flies.</span> <span id="s754">All of those crazy things I remember.</span> <span id="s755">Because I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s756">Where would I go?</span> <span id="s757">I had no job.</span> <span id="s758">I couldn't speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Your mother wrote to your father.</span> <span id="s760">Did you ever hear back?</span> <span id="s761">What happened when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yes, I have a couple of handwritten letters from my father.</span> <span id="s763">And also a Red Cross letter, later on, from my sister.</span> <span id="s764">And uh later on, got word that they were sent east; and that was the last I heard of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Where was the last that you knew your sister was?</span> <span id="s766">A: Sent east.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: From Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I don't know if it was Theresienstadt [Czech: Terezín] or where.</span> <span id="s769">I don't know.</span> <span id="s770">Never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes, my father, too.</span> <span id="s773">Never knew what happened to him, where he was sent, where he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Many things.</span> <span id="s775">I don't know.</span> <span id="s776">Never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: How did the... Did the start of the European war affect you there in Japan?</span> <span id="s778">Did that have any affect on the community or on life there?</span> <span id="s779">In '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Well, I guess um we were so concerned with surviving on a day-to-day basis, by that time it got summer.</span> <span id="s781">And the summer in Shanghai is the greatest enemy.</span> <span id="s782">Besides food, learning how to eat, learning how not to eat, that a drop of water...a drink of water can kill you.</span> <span id="s783">Oh, incidentally, very early on I developed a double-sided pneumonia--pneumonia and pleurisy-- wound up in one of those makeshift uh hospitals, a converted house.</span> <span id="s784">You know, like you see in "Emperor in the Sun."</span> <span id="s785">One of those things.</span> <span id="s786">And I also had a very high fever and there was...my mother got me there in a rickshaw.</span> <span id="s787">I almost jumped out of the rickshaw, somehow; and she must have told the coolie to keep the two legs high so I wouldn't jump out.</span> <span id="s788">Because I was delirious by that time.</span> <span id="s789">And the hospital was run by a committee.</span> <span id="s790">I know I was delirious.</span> <span id="s791">Because I remember one of the scenes where there was a room and there were all men lying around there, with practically nothing on; because you were lying, sweat was running down your body.</span> <span id="s792">And summer, the humidity is about 90-95 percent, and the humid...temperature is about that.</span> <span id="s793">So it is horrendous.</span> <span id="s794">I remember... How much is real, I don't know.</span> <span id="s795">I remember the doctor coming in with a syringe and a long needle, and giving what I found out later was a spinal--what you call a "spinal tap"--to another young man.</span> <span id="s796">And not much later he was carried out.</span> <span id="s797">And I remember the next day, the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s798">There was somebody else lying there and he was carried out.</span> <span id="s799">And I remember...I remember only a doctor coming to my bed, and I thought he had a syringe in his hand.</span> <span id="s800">And weak as I was, I remember I just about doubled up like this and kicked as hard as could right where it hurt most.</span> <span id="s801">He was just reeling... And he never came back anymore.</span> <span id="s802">Well, I survived it.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: You were saying that your mother told the coolie to keep you.</span> <span id="s804">How did the Chinese, the Japanese, react to the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s805">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Well, the Chinese did not react at all.</span> <span id="s807">You see, neither the Chinese nor the Japanese really ever had any contact with the Jews.</span> <span id="s808">Except uh they knew they were whites.</span> <span id="s809">The whites usually were the powerful class.</span> <span id="s810">Those colonial empires.</span> <span id="s811">The International Settlement.</span> <span id="s812">That is how we... That is the reason we didn't need a visa.</span> <span id="s813">The British lived there for... since 1840, or whenever it was; and the French had the French Concession.</span> <span id="s814">But they never had any contact with Jews.</span> <span id="s815">But what was strange that there was a group of whites that didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s816">Well, they had something like it from the... After the Bolshevik Revolution, the White Russians had come to Shanghai, you see.</span> <span id="s817">But still, we were poorer yet.</span> <span id="s818">So the Chinese didn't react.</span> <span id="s819">The Japanese, who were the real power in Shanghai, didn't react.</span> <span id="s820">At least, at that time.</span> <span id="s821">I lived with Japanese in one house, became very good friends, went bar hopping with them, did business with them later; and they were very correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: How did Pearl Harbor...how did the war effect what happened?</span> <span id="s823">What changes came?</span> <span id="s824">When you landed there, you got a part-time job.</span> <span id="s825">Your mother was working.</span> <span id="s826">What changes took place with the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Great, great, great changes.</span> <span id="s828">A lot had happened in between.</span> <span id="s829">Pearl Harbor--I should say between that I joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, which was a subsidiary of the British Army.</span> <span id="s830">It was founded, I believe, in 1847, after the Boxer Rebellion for the defense of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s831">And I did not join during the Jewish Corps, which was primarily Russian Jews; but a transport company.</span> <span id="s832">I was driving for armored vehicles-- lorries, things like this.</span> <span id="s833">It was very advantageous, because I could get a good meal once in awhile.</span> <span id="s834">I had a uniform.</span> <span id="s835">So I joined that.</span> <span id="s836">And I was very active in a scout group--British Boy Scout Association.</span> <span id="s837">So then I did some work, my mother was working; so we got by.</span> <span id="s838">And we knew the war would break out.</span> <span id="s839">We read the papers.</span> <span id="s840">We had English language papers.</span> <span id="s841">We had all kind of papers.</span> <span id="s842">The Jewish community really developed out of the...moved into the slums, and we built this community; until it was later on known as "Little Vienna."</span> <span id="s843">And we knew the war was coming.</span> <span id="s844">But what could we do?</span> <span id="s845">We couldn't prepare for it, except trying to get by and survive on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s846">We were fortunate we were not among the 8,000 that were in a camp.</span> <span id="s847">So we were at least in a room, and the room even had a WC--a water closet.</span> <span id="s848">Which was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Tell me about the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s850">Was the camp in Shanghai?</span> <span id="s851">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: There was several camps that were called "heime."</span> <span id="s853">"Heim"--home, euphemism for home.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">They were camps that had been established by the various committees, and then later on [by] the Joint Distribution Community, to house those destitute refugees that couldn't even afford a room or had no money coming from relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s855">And these camps were converted barracks, converted schools, where they were being fed and housed on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s856">For most of us, I think, that was a way station; because we had relatives in the United States, and we had an affidavit to come to the United States stating that we would not become a public burden if we were to come.</span> <span id="s857">But, as you know, the quota did not permit us to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Explain to me.</span> <span id="s859">You had relatives, but you ended up in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: We had relatives in Washington, D.C. And my wife, whom I met later and married later, had relatives.</span> <span id="s861">But the quota [that] was established was so small that we could not get a visa.</span> <span id="s862">So we, as well as many other thousands, regarded Shanghai as a temporary way station.</span> <span id="s863">And then after the quota number would be called, we would leave Shanghai for the United States.</span> <span id="s864">Pearl Harbor stopped it.</span> <span id="s865">On the morning of the 8th of December--the other side of the International Dateline--our window... We lived up in a little attic room, with a WC one floor below.</span> <span id="s866">Our windows almost shattered, cracked.</span> <span id="s867">That was when the Japanese blasted the British warships point blank out of the water.</span> <span id="s868">American warships surrendered.</span> <span id="s869">I knew that that was it.</span> <span id="s870">I immediately dressed in my uniform to report for duty.</span> <span id="s871">And I walked along the streets of Hongkou to get to the bridge.</span> <span id="s872">There is a bridge across the Soochow Creek, which separates Hongkou from the International Settlement--where I, incidentally, stood guard quite frequently with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s873">And this...like the British soldiers, you know; you walk up and down so many paces without pulling a muscle.</span> <span id="s874">And everybody walking across there, trying to make you laugh.</span> <span id="s875">And I tried to get there and report for duty.</span> <span id="s876">And I saw...when I got on one of the main drags I saw the columns, the Japanese columns, by the hundreds--if not thousands--marching to the International Settlement.</span> <span id="s877">And I saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s878">So I quickly turned around, went to the alley, took off my helmet, my insignia; and quickly got out of uniform and headed back.</span> <span id="s879">It would have been a disaster, you know, seeing a British soldier among the Japanese troops there.</span> <span id="s880">So things started tightening up, as far as the Japanese were concerned.</span> <span id="s881">They got a little bit more violent.</span> <span id="s882">We were under the occupation of the Imperial Japanese Naval Landing Party.</span> <span id="s883">And the Kempeitai--which was the Japanese 4 Actually, these were the Japanese secret police.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">gendarmerie--which was a brutal lot, an especially brutal lot.</span> <span id="s885">Even Japanese civilians went out of the way to not get into trouble with them.</span> <span id="s886">So things got a little tighter.</span> <span id="s887">Some businesses closed; of course, everybody was affected by that.</span> <span id="s888">Some of my friends were taken prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s889">First, they had their arm bands identifying them as British and Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Then, through the Volunteer Corps, I met a Britisher who asked me-- through another friend of mine, Pete was his name, who committed suicide, unfortunately--if I could provide him with some information occasionally.</span> <span id="s891">That took place over a period of meetings.</span> <span id="s892">Wanted to know my attitudes towards the Japanese, and everything.</span> <span id="s893">And then he said if I could help him get information; I was very eager to do so.</span> <span id="s894">And I tried.</span> <span id="s895">It would involve planting rumors; which we measured, you know--how long would it take... In a certain area you plant a rumor; how long does it take before it gets back to you.</span> <span id="s896">As to ascertain troops strengths in certain areas, which...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You were a British spy?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Unofficially, you might call it this.</span> <span id="s899">I have a..</span> <span id="s900">.</span> <span id="s901">I never received any recognition for it.</span> <span id="s902">You can't.</span> <span id="s903">But I have a medal--which the museum has, incidently--from the British Boy Scout Association for services rendered during occupation.</span> <span id="s904">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: The Japanese were allies of the Germans.</span> <span id="s906">How did they treat you as Jews?</span> <span id="s907">Did they arrest you?</span> <span id="s908">Did they subject you to any hardships as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Not until 1943.</span> <span id="s910">I didn't mention that it was to our consternation we realized we were under the Japanese--who were Axis partners.</span> <span id="s911">And as I found out later on, the Nazis tried very hard to persuade the Japanese to do with us what they did to the rest of the Jews in Europe.</span> <span id="s912">I found later on that Colonel Josef Meisinger--the Butcher of Warsaw, he was called--plus a fellow from...Puttkammer, from Bergen-Belsenand a third Nazi--whose name I can't recall right now--had a meeting with Japanese officials around 1942.</span> <span id="s913">They went to Tokyo, trying to talk to the Japanese.</span> <span id="s914">They refused.</span> <span id="s915">You see, under the oriental religions--Buddhism, Taoism, Shintoism--they really do not practice hate toward other religions.</span> <span id="s916">And there was another factor involved, why they preserved us.</span> <span id="s917">Shall I go into the story of what happened in 1904?</span> <span id="s918">During the Japanese/Russian War, under the Tsar, the Japanese, as well as the Russians, needed finances.</span> <span id="s919">They both applied for finances from the United States.</span> <span id="s920">They both went to the investment company [of] Kuhn, Loeb, and Schiff.</span> <span id="s921">Mr. [Jacob] Schiff hated the Tsar, because the Tsar was anti-semitic; but Schiff made a substantial loan to Japan, which helped Japan's war effort against Tsarist Russia.</span> <span id="s922">Incidently, Schiff later on was received by the Emperor himself, and received the Order of the Rising Sun.</span> <span id="s923">At the same time, there was 5 Baron Jesco von Puttkammer served as head of the German Information Bureau, a Nazi propaganda office, in the German Consulate in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s924">He was mistaken for a commercial attaché by one Japanese official with whom he had dealings.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">6 Officially: The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).</span></p> <p><span id="s926">some young Japanese officers that, at the border or somewhere, come across the Russian edition--was the original edition--of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, which claims Jews practically run the world and own the governments and own the banks, and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s927">They never met a Jew before.</span> <span id="s928">"Fascinating people!</span> <span id="s929">Wish we could ever meet those people, you know.</span> <span id="s930">Maybe we could utilize them.</span> <span id="s931">We have whole Manchuria they laid upon us today.</span> <span id="s932">Maybe we can resettle them in Manchuria."</span> <span id="s933">And these young officers became advanced, of course, with the Japanese government.</span> <span id="s934">And, eventually, became the Jewish experts in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s935">They...we were under their control.</span> <span id="s936">They believed every word of what they had heard.</span> <span id="s937">So they were very cautious.</span> <span id="s938">"We have to protect these people so we don't get in trouble with their relatives in England and in America."</span> <span id="s939">As a matter of fact, before the war, they persuaded the leadership of the Jewish communities to send a cable to Morgenthau,trying to stop the impending war.</span> <span id="s940">As if they had any power to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Let's move on.</span> <span id="s942">What were they actually doing to you?</span> <span id="s943">You say that things changed in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">What happened in '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Well, the pressure was so strong.</span> <span id="s946">They refused what... Meisinger had proposed three solutions: medical experiments, a camp--in a Yangtzecam, on an island--and the most plausible one was to load us all out on barge, load us on barges, tow us out to sea and scuttle the barge.</span> <span id="s947">All 18,000 of us.</span> <span id="s948">The Japanese refused.</span> <span id="s949">There was some other things that...things that leaked out.</span> <span id="s950">And the Japanese said, "We would never do anything like that."</span> <span id="s951">So I don't know really how much was resented or didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s952">It was not Tokyo.</span> <span id="s953">Because Matsuokareally went on record--I believe it was Matsuoka: "We will not harm the Jewish population."</span> <span id="s954">It was a matter of official record.</span> <span id="s955">But the Japanese didn't have to report to Tokyo on that.</span> <span id="s956">They could have done it.</span> <span id="s957">As I understand it.</span> <span id="s958">So in 1943, February 1943, they issued a proclamation that as of May 18, all stateless refugees had to assemble in approximately a square mile area, where most refugees already lived, in what was called a designated area--the euphemism for ghetto.</span> <span id="s959">Everybody living outside had to move in.</span> <span id="s960">Now, you should know that this area--about 1 square mile--was already populated by approximately 100,000 Chinese.</span> <span id="s961">So I once figured it out; it must have had at least twice the density of Manhattan.</span> <span id="s962">Uh, there were no rooms available.</span> <span id="s963">Now many of the old uh batavo (ph) had been rebuilt.</span> <span id="s964">But still, if you lived outside--my wife once with her parents lived on Bablinger Road and Hardoon Road--how do you find a room?</span> <span id="s965">Enormous prices.</span> <span id="s966">Blackmail.</span> <span id="s967">Enormous prices were demanded.</span> <span id="s968">And huge exchanges were made.</span> <span id="s969">A nice modern apartment with steam heat for a little room--no kitchen, no bath, no toilet, no WC.</span> <span id="s970">Or... So in a certain time, everybody had to move in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: [inaudible] 7 FDR's Secretary of the Treasury was Henry Morgenthau.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">8 Yotsuke Matsuoka was Japan's Foreign Minister at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: It was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s974">It was surrounded by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s975">And we were under uh volunteer service-- called the Pao Chia-- under the Japanese uh supervision.</span> <span id="s976">Self-defense, kind of self- protection.</span> <span id="s977">They wore arm bands.</span> <span id="s978">And they had to be at the ghetto exits, entrances, to guard against anybody leaving who was not authorized.</span> <span id="s979">And at that time, conditions were such that the ghetto was governed by the very brutal, sadistic Japanese named Ghoya.</span> <span id="s980">He was paranoid, he was a psychopath, and he called himself the "King of the Jews."</span> <span id="s981">He was under Kubota.Kubota was one of those officers that I mentioned earlier.</span> <span id="s982">I could talk an hour about Ghoya, what he did.</span> <span id="s983">He was so...he had such an inferior complex, he would ask you... You stood in line for a day to get a pass if you still had a job outside.</span> <span id="s984">You leave the ghetto provided you got a pass from him.</span> <span id="s985">The pass could be valid for one day or for months, up to his pleasure, for certain areas of the city.</span> <span id="s986">And you had to be back in the ghetto for a certain time of the day.</span> <span id="s987">And he started interrogating you.</span> <span id="s988">"Ah, your English too good.</span> <span id="s989">No pass."</span> <span id="s990">Or: "You don't speak English.</span> <span id="s991">No pass."</span> <span id="s992">And if he didn't like you, he would jump on the desk and slap you.</span> <span id="s993">And if it really got bad, he would send you for one night into the bunker.</span> <span id="s994">The bunker itself was a death sentence.</span> <span id="s995">One night.</span> <span id="s996">Because a bunker was full of typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Typhoid.</span> <span id="s998">If you got out of the bunker the next day, it would take about a week or two before you got ill; but every knew already you have about two weeks to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: How did you eat?</span> <span id="s1000">How was food brought in?</span> <span id="s1001">How did the ghetto survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Well, I again had a job.</span> <span id="s1003">I became a night shift supervisor in a bakery.</span> <span id="s1004">There were two bakeries that baked bread for the camps.</span> <span id="s1005">And the bakers were the old style.</span> <span id="s1006">You know, you pushed the wood in, lit the wood, and then you scrapped the wood out.</span> <span id="s1007">And I had a corps of about 12 bakers, Chinese bakers; with one supervisor, Chinese supervisor.</span> <span id="s1008">And I ran the bakery at night.</span> <span id="s1009">And part of my pay were two rolls.</span> <span id="s1010">You know, about 13 ounces; I believe what you call the French or Italian bread.</span> <span id="s1011">Nice.</span> <span id="s1012">I took it home--fresh warm bread, straight out of the oven.</span> <span id="s1013">I would share it with my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Your wife?</span> <span id="s1015">You suddenly mentioned your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1017">OK.</span> <span id="s1018">So many things happened all at once, it is hard to do it chronologically.</span> <span id="s1019">As I said, I was involved in the scouts.</span> <span id="s1020">And there was a youth group called the Chaverim, to which there was some boys, girls.</span> <span id="s1021">And there was a young rabbi who said it would be nice to get these together.</span> <span id="s1022">Our scout group, the 13th August, and the scouts were all Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s1023">So I met my future wife then, planning for a big charity ball that was held, benefit ball.</span> <span id="s1024">The ball, in a Jewish club, that was in the International Settlement, but was for the benefit of the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1025">But since we were the scouts we would, of course, preparation.</span> <span id="s1026">And I still have a picture of my best friend and I--both in tux--and my girlfriend at that time, long dress.</span> <span id="s1027">It's incongruous, I know.</span> <span id="s1028">And I also remember this event, because I made a mistake of going to 9 These were the Jewish auxiliary police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">10 Tsutomu Kubota was in charge of the Bureau of Stateless Refugees in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">the bar with a couple of friends to ask for a drink.</span> <span id="s1031">When somebody called a round of drinks, I said, "I will buy a round of drinks."</span> <span id="s1032">And it set me back one month's wages, because they were imported drinks.</span> <span id="s1033">Which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1034">And I had to quickly go and round up some money, borrow some money, to pay for the drinks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Was your wife there?</span> <span id="s1036">Tell me about this young girl you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Well, I met her in a bookstore.</span> <span id="s1038">I was selling books by that time.</span> <span id="s1039">You see, I didn't know English.</span> <span id="s1040">So, I was working first for this Mr. Zahlinger.</span> <span id="s1041">Let me start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1042">The first job I got was for a toy store.</span> <span id="s1043">Russian.</span> <span id="s1044">And I lived with a Russian family during the day, had lunch with them, and opened a branch office.</span> <span id="s1045">So I became the branch manager.</span> <span id="s1046">And I started making a little money.</span> <span id="s1047">And it was half the store; half the store was a Chinese bookstore called "Home of Books," selling English language books.</span> <span id="s1048">Pirated editions, because they did not recognize the copyright.</span> <span id="s1049">And then this business didn't go.</span> <span id="s1050">And then Mr. Zahlinger opened office furnishing company, selling oil typewriters and Monroe calculators.</span> <span id="s1051">That is how I got into office machines and computers later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Your wife came in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: And then I didn't work for Mr. Zahlinger anymore.</span> <span id="s1054">I started working for "Home of Books."</span> <span id="s1055">And there I started reading, English.</span> <span id="s1056">And I went to the movies, reading American movies with Chinese subtitles; and put two and two together.</span> <span id="s1057">And then my wife was supposed to... She worked in a Western art gallery, selling antique books--rare books.</span> <span id="s1058">And she was supposed to be on committee with me for the charity ball.</span> <span id="s1059">So that's how we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: I am a little bit worried because of where we are with the time.</span> <span id="s1061">So let...you met your wife.</span> <span id="s1062">How did you come to get married?</span> <span id="s1063">Was it a relatively short courtship?</span> <span id="s1064">Tell me something and how was the wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Very proper.</span> <span id="s1066">Because my wife's mother was very... Her upbringing was such, you know, that I wasn't even permitted to go to the movies with my wife without anybody else present.</span> <span id="s1067">I think I was already fairly well along, after knowing her for a year before I even had a chance for even the first kiss maybe.</span> <span id="s1068">So, unfortunately, my mother-in law...I think in 1942--I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1069">No, it was already the ghetto--after '43.</span> <span id="s1070">She contracted bacillary [NB: bacterial] dysentery, and died in one of these hospitals.</span> <span id="s1071">So I didn't get along with my mother; and my wife didn't get along with her father.</span> <span id="s1072">And we had been going, what you call, steady already for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1073">She had come from Berlin by the civilian railroad.</span> <span id="s1074">And her mother... And so we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s1075">The question is, where do you live?</span> <span id="s1076">And she had lived with her father and her mother in a little, very small room--with 3 couches, very narrow couches, and suitcases.</span> <span id="s1077">Nobody had any furniture there.</span> <span id="s1078">So some of our friends knew that we wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s1079">But they finally twisted her father's arm to live together with somebody else and give us this room.</span> <span id="s1080">So we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: So you lived there?</span> <span id="s1082">Tell me about the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1083">What happened at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">How did the war end for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Well, there were constant rumors.</span> <span id="s1086">We had access to a shortwave--which was sealed, but we had access to it.</span> <span id="s1087">So there were rumors.</span> <span id="s1088">And then we heard there was peace and some of the hotels weren't occupied.</span> <span id="s1089">And the police station rebelled, because it wasn't peace yet.</span> <span id="s1090">We lost a few.</span> <span id="s1091">And I also wound up on a firing squad, when I was outside the designated area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: So at the end of the war you went where?</span> <span id="s1093">A: Well, now, that's part of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well, the war finally came to an end.</span> <span id="s1096">We heard that there was.</span> <span id="s1097">The "goodwill mission" came, quote unquote.This was a group of army officers, and Manny Siegel from the Joint, that came to our ghetto area.</span> <span id="s1098">And we were told that there would be...in this group compound, in this Jewish group compound, where they raised an American Flag and had a ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">And that was the end of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: How did the war actually end for you?</span> <span id="s1101">Did you hear it on the radio?</span> <span id="s1102">Did you see planes or what?</span> <span id="s1103">How did it actually end for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: What I do remember of that period is one of the newspapers, I believe it was the 7th of August 1945, a little column from the Domi news agency--the Japanese news agency-- stating "An Atomic Bomb Was Dropped on Hiroshima.</span> <span id="s1105">No Considerable Damage Resulted."</span> <span id="s1106">Or something to that effect.</span> <span id="s1107">I don't...I am trying to find this news article; I don't quite really remember it.</span> <span id="s1108">I don't exactly remember it.</span> <span id="s1109">So we didn't know what an atomic bomb was.</span> <span id="s1110">But it came with a..</span> <span id="s1111">.</span> <span id="s1112">we saw that all the Nazi flags disappeared, the big Japanese flags disappeared.</span> <span id="s1113">The Nazis, the Japanese was still in control for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1114">They were appointed to keep control, you see.</span> <span id="s1115">Which we didn't know, but it was rather uncomfortable then.</span> <span id="s1116">But we celebrated with one can of jam that we had saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: I believed you ended up by working for the Americans.</span> <span id="s1118">Were the Americans the occupiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1120">Yes.</span> <span id="s1121">Both my wife and I, there were again rumors that the Americans were hiring and paying gold dollars.</span> <span id="s1122">American dollars called gold dollars.</span> <span id="s1123">So, by that time I spoke fairly well English already, I think.</span> <span id="s1124">And I came to a building, many people all trying to get in the same little door there.</span> <span id="s1125">And people...American soldiers with white armbands saying "MP"--I didn't know what "MP" stands for.</span> <span id="s1126">And they're trying to push through there.</span> <span id="s1127">And I also remember there came a..</span> <span id="s1128">.</span> <span id="s1129">Pat, the British contact of mine, was just released from camp.</span> <span id="s1130">He came, escorted by some MPs, through that throng.</span> <span id="s1131">And he saw me and I saw him.</span> <span id="s1132">So he 11 This was the American Rescue and Goodwill Mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">pushed his way through, and he grabbed me and got me in.</span> <span id="s1134">I was one of the first refugees to get a job.</span> <span id="s1135">I was inside there; there was a sergeant sitting there, American sergeant: "Want a job?"</span> <span id="s1136">"Sure!"</span> <span id="s1137">"What can you do?</span> <span id="s1138">Can you drive a truck?"</span> <span id="s1139">"Sure I can drive!"</span> <span id="s1140">My first job...I had a first job as check out on the wharf, heavy vehicle operator, grease monkey...</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Until finally we moved to Nanking, where I became a very high paid civilian for the United States Air Force advisory group to Chiang Kai-shek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: All this time you have had relatives in America, and you haven't been able to get here?</span> <span id="s1143">What happened?</span> <span id="s1144">When did you finally make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: After the war, we had contact with our relatives and my wife had contact with her relatives.</span> <span id="s1146">They again contacted the State Department; we contacted the consulate in Shanghai--who were was less than helpful.</span> <span id="s1147">And we just have to wait for a quota.</span> <span id="s1148">And it was only when I was in Nanking I heard I should come to the consulate.</span> <span id="s1149">And I was working rather hard for my General McConnell.</span> <span id="s1150">I had to fly on military time, on military aircraft, to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1151">And I passed everything.</span> <span id="s1152">Then came the health exam.</span> <span id="s1153">"I am sorry, you won't pass.</span> <span id="s1154">Your pulse is too fast."</span> <span id="s1155">Back to Nanking.</span> <span id="s1156">And I reported to the officers, "You will have to call me back."</span> <span id="s1157">So there was talk between General McConnell, the chief of Armed...Air Force Surgeon General, and the embassy.</span> <span id="s1158">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1159">I got a total health examination from the Surgeon General.</span> <span id="s1160">Because of the Embassy, the Army doctor.</span> <span id="s1161">"Nothing wrong with Ernie Heppner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Sorry, you have to fly back...back to Shanghai, to have your pulse rechecked."</span> <span id="s1163">This is perhaps indicative of the problems, how difficult the State Department made it for the Jew to get into the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: What did you know about your family?</span> <span id="s1165">When did you learn about the Final Solution?</span> <span id="s1166">What did you know about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: We heard before that there were some rumors coming through of what had happened in Europe, but then the first communication came from my brother to...from England.</span> <span id="s1168">His parents-in-law happened to live in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1169">So they had contacted them.</span> <span id="s1170">We had contact.</span> <span id="s1171">And we heard there was no sign of life from my father, my sister, other relatives.</span> <span id="s1172">Later friends, after a little bit you started to think about other names and about people.</span> <span id="s1173">You couldn't even talk about it because everybody had the same problem.</span> <span id="s1174">Everybody was trying to search and what happened, when did it happen, what happened?</span> <span id="s1175">You lived with that for awhile until you just, I couldn't comprehend, you couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s1176">I mean, who can comprehend it, you see, what really happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: What about your...?</span> <span id="s1178">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Let me take you back to the years in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1181">I believe you were subjected to some rather nasty bombing?</span> <span id="s1182">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Well, we felt very safe.</span> <span id="s1184">There were bombings going on all the time.</span> <span id="s1185">We could hear it in the distance.</span> <span id="s1186">We knew and heard that American forces, that the war had finally turned.</span> <span id="s1187">You see the first years, '42, '43, the war went bad for allies.</span> <span id="s1188">We were very worried.</span> <span id="s1189">Then it started to turn, and when we heard the American bombers and something you could see, our spirits rose.</span> <span id="s1190">And we felt safe because we knew that the Americans knew the location of our ghetto.</span> <span id="s1191">And besides also in the ghetto was the largest jail in the world.</span> <span id="s1192">And there were some American prisoners of war in there.</span> <span id="s1193">So we were not concerned about the attacks.</span> <span id="s1194">Then on the 17th of July, I changed shifts.</span> <span id="s1195">The day supervisor asked me to take the day shift in the bakery.</span> <span id="s1196">Which was just around the corner where I lived.</span> <span id="s1197">And I came home for lunch, I bought my two breads home, and that's not very nourishing, but it's nice, fresh bread, so I made a meal.</span> <span id="s1198">And just finished that and I was ready to go to work, and we were just married in April, you know, newly married, and my wife said to me, "Do me a favor, I have bad feelings, I have a precaution alarm.</span> <span id="s1199">Stay, stay awhile longer, would you?"</span> <span id="s1200">So I was still, I said, "Okay, I'll stay."</span> <span id="s1201">And that moment, we heard the bombers approaching.</span> <span id="s1202">And as always before, I climbed out of the window to see better.</span> <span id="s1203">Some of them were low level flights and you could even see them.</span> <span id="s1204">So I hung onto the window sill and waved to them as they passed by, except this time we were the target.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: These were American bombers you were waiving at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: B-29's.</span> <span id="s1207">Later on, I met one of the bombers.</span> <span id="s1208">We became a secondary target because the Japanese had put fuel dumps in our area, ammunition dumps, and a transmitter that directed naval communications, and Americans had to knock it out.</span> <span id="s1209">So we got hit.</span> <span id="s1210">To this day, I don't know how we got down from the attic to the ground floor.</span> <span id="s1211">Everything collapsed around us.</span> <span id="s1212">The houses were very, very flimsy built.</span> <span id="s1213">We took fairly heavy casualties and the fire started in the lane there.</span> <span id="s1214">And I was not one of the guards that had to guard the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1215">I was the assistant fire chief, so have you ever stood on top of a burning building to get a fire brigade going?</span> <span id="s1216">It is impossible.</span> <span id="s1217">But then I went back to the bakery.</span> <span id="s1218">I want to see what happened there and when I got there, this was one of the worst hit lanes.</span> <span id="s1219">There was nothing left.</span> <span id="s1220">My office was on the second floor and as usual, the foreman had laid flat on my desk and fanned himself, and he was down under the boiler and everything else.</span> <span id="s1221">And I want to see if there is still anybody alive.</span> <span id="s1222">There must have hundreds and hundreds of casualties there.</span> <span id="s1223">And I made my way to see the store room.</span> <span id="s1224">We had just gotten a load of flour.</span> <span id="s1225">And I saw two Chinese trucks roll up with Chinese soldiers, puppet soldiers.</span> <span id="s1226">So I hid to see what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">They came into the store and loaded up the flour, loaded up the flours.</span> <span id="s1228">So as they were driving off, I ran up to the truck and jumped into the truck and hid among the flour.</span> <span id="s1229">So as we rolled down through the ghetto, I saw one of my friends there.</span> <span id="s1230">And I called out to him, from the rear of the truck, what was happening.</span> <span id="s1231">"Call Wallach"--the owner of the bakery, the Russian Jew.</span> <span id="s1232">So I didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s1233">We left the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1234">But anyhow I was</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">captured and arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Why were you captured and arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Because they took the flour to the barracks, you know.</span> <span id="s1238">They found me among the flour at the rear of the truck.</span> <span id="s1239">But they didn't know what to do with me and tried to beat me up.</span> <span id="s1240">Not much happened and the next day I was released because Mr. Wallach paid $500,000 for me, in Chinese currency.</span> <span id="s1241">That must have been, maybe, $200 some dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: You were taken into a Chinese puppet barrack because you were in back of the lorrie which was stealing.</span> <span id="s1243">Then you were released.</span> <span id="s1244">Who paid the money to release you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Mr. Wallach.</span> <span id="s1246">He wanted the flour back.</span> <span id="s1247">Q: The owner of the bakery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: We got the flour, we got the flour back so we could at least furnish part of the bread for the camps.</span> <span id="s1249">See the camps were very badly off because the Joint had stopped sending money to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1250">The State Department, under the act of trading with the enemy act, you could not lawfully or legally transfer funds to the Japanese occupation in Shanghai and they didn't take a hint as I understand to route the money to other countries.</span> <span id="s1251">So these poor Jews in the camps had to get by on 3 cents per day per person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: How did you get 3 cents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I had a job.</span> <span id="s1254">I am talking about those 8,000, 9,000 that were in camps.</span> <span id="s1255">They were down to nothing.</span> <span id="s1256">Some of them didn't even have literally a shirt or trousers anymore.</span> <span id="s1257">They were walking along with burlap bags around them.</span> <span id="s1258">We lost about a total of 3,000 people out of 18,000 to the starvation, disease, heat prostration, some due to Japanese torture, malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1259">What bothers me in this whole period is that so many Jews could have left Germany, could have left the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: You said there was malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1261">Does that mean there was lawlessness as well?</span> <span id="s1262">How was the community cohering at this point?</span> <span id="s1263">Was there a sense of community still at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes, very well disciplined as a whole.</span> <span id="s1265">I do remember, I heard about one case, a lawyer--a Austrian gentleman--was caught stealing a piece of bread from somebody else in the bunk next to him.</span> <span id="s1266">And he was so embarrassed he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1267">All in all, the discipline among the community was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1268">There was practically no criminality.</span> <span id="s1269">I think during the ten year period there were two murders.</span> <span id="s1270">We governed ourselves.</span> <span id="s1271">We had our own community organization, did our own arbitration court, the right to appeal.</span> <span id="s1272">So it was really well functioned.</span> <span id="s1273">What did not function so well was the various committees.</span> <span id="s1274">They didn't have experience, until the Joint--and Ms. [Laura] Margolies there from the Joint, who was a trained social worker.</span> <span id="s1275">She arrived sometime in 1941, and then she was interned as an enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">So she had only a few scant months to really do a job.</span> <span id="s1277">But whatever she did, she did extremely effectively.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: How did most of the community that survived in Shanghai survive?</span> <span id="s1279">Was it because of the Joint?</span> <span id="s1280">Could that be true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: No, that wouldn't be fair.</span> <span id="s1282">Because the Joint, I think, sent until the war ended, I think maybe...</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">I don't have the amount.</span> <span id="s1284">Maybe $2-1/2 million.</span> <span id="s1285">But, you see, that was before Israel, before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1286">The Joint was in the business of raising money.</span> <span id="s1287">But there was no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">They didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1289">And, unfortunately, some Jews from the Shanghai Council tried to persuade and cabled back to Europe, "Do not send any more Jews here."</span> <span id="s1290">And the American government finally cabled to various other steamship agencies, tried to prevent more Jews from going to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1291">And Jewish organizations were involved in that.</span> <span id="s1292">To prevent more Jews from going to Shanghai, because there was no money there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: New Jews in Shanghai would say the same thing?</span> <span id="s1294">A: These were the old time Jews.</span> <span id="s1295">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: I believe you were arrested on one occasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Yes, it was just shortly before Pearl Harbor, fortunately.</span> <span id="s1298">We were on a scout trip on bicycles on a Sunday, came to an area outside Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1299">We had no green, we had no lawn, no trees.</span> <span id="s1300">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1301">And besides, I wanted to see what was going on around Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1302">So we had a fox hunt.</span> <span id="s1303">You know what it is.</span> <span id="s1304">Yah.</span> <span id="s1305">A fox hunt is one fellow on a bike would lead the way; and we didn't have paper.</span> <span id="s1306">Paper was very precious and hard to come by.</span> <span id="s1307">Had a handful of rice and scatter it, and the hounds would try to follow the fox and find it.</span> <span id="s1308">And we got to village where the chickens had already picked up the rice.</span> <span id="s1309">But, anyway, we finally find the fox.</span> <span id="s1310">He got into Japanese barracks area, military area.</span> <span id="s1311">And there is a Japanese guard.</span> <span id="s1312">And there is a foreigner on a bike scattering rice on the ground, which is a holy concept.</span> <span id="s1313">Symbolic.</span> <span id="s1314">Same as bread to us.</span> <span id="s1315">So he arrested him.</span> <span id="s1316">And one after another, we got in the trap until they had all of us.</span> <span id="s1317">And no communication.</span> <span id="s1318">And so we finally got on a truck, tossed on a truck; we were hustled on the truck, and driven to headquarters.</span> <span id="s1319">Behind the headquarters was a building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">One side was a building, and the other side was a rifle range.</span> <span id="s1321">Saw the targets there.</span> <span id="s1322">And there were several squads doing target practice; and they line us up there.</span> <span id="s1323">It was not a very comfortable feeling.</span> <span id="s1324">We didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1325">And knowing the Japanese, you see, you shoot first and ask questions later.</span> <span id="s1326">We are so used to seeing dead people, babies, every day in the street.</span> <span id="s1327">The life is absolutely nothing there.</span> <span id="s1328">I have seen people murdered point blank there.</span> <span id="s1329">So we started communicating, but they called some Japanese which was POWs camp.</span> <span id="s1330">Apparently from there, they came from a different area.</span> <span id="s1331">They couldn't understand our China....Chinese Kaishengka dialect.</span> <span id="s1332">So things didn't look good.</span> <span id="s1333">All of a sudden, they tried to find out who we are and what we are doing.</span> <span id="s1334">So my friend--who is in Australia now--said, "Deutschka (ph)."</span> <span id="s1335">--Deutsche, in Japanese.</span> <span id="s1336">"Deutschka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Deutschka?"</span> <span id="s1338">So everything was on hold.</span> <span id="s1339">So sometime later, the staff car came up.</span> <span id="s1340">High ranking officers jumped out.</span> <span id="s1341">And as you may know, Japanese officers are sent to Germany for training.</span> <span id="s1342">Out came two officers who spoke fair German.</span> <span id="s1343">"Who are you?</span> <span id="s1344">What are you?"</span> <span id="s1345">You try to explain fox hunt to them.</span> <span id="s1346">But we could at least tell them we are Germans.</span> <span id="s1347">We were stateless, you see.</span> <span id="s1348">As stateless, we have less right than a dog in a street.</span> <span id="s1349">They could shoot us, and nobody else would ask questions.</span> <span id="s1350">So we heard that he called an aide and talked to him; and the aide disappeared while he talked to us.</span> <span id="s1351">And the aide came back shaking his head.</span> <span id="s1352">And then he said...he let us go.</span> <span id="s1353">Promised to never come to this area again, and had to promise we would meet him and give him German lessons.</span> <span id="s1354">Later on, I found out through Pat--my British contact--he had called the German Embassy to verify who we were and nobody answered.</span> <span id="s1355">If he would have found out we are not Germans but Jews in a restricted area there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: What was the situation with your mother?</span> <span id="s1357">Did she leave with you in '47?</span> <span id="s1358">What happened to her during the war?</span> <span id="s1359">Did she keep her job all the time?</span> <span id="s1360">How did she...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: No, she kept her job until she... I had a letter from Miss Margolies of the Joint, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1362">She had to be discharged, because there were no more funds for her anymore.</span> <span id="s1363">So we had soup kitchens.</span> <span id="s1364">We lived in one part of the ghetto; and my wife lived in another part of the ghetto with her father.</span> <span id="s1365">And then I moved in there.</span> <span id="s1366">My mother also had a handcrafted fur coat, that she had done in Kraków.</span> <span id="s1367">The Polish furriers were the best in Europe.</span> <span id="s1368">And she had smuggled it across the border.</span> <span id="s1369">And she had this; and she sold this to the General Manager of Standard Oil of the Far East.</span> <span id="s1370">And we lived on that for, I think, about three years.</span> <span id="s1371">So we sold all our belongings.</span> <span id="s1372">A Parker fountain pen would become a symbol for Chinese businessmen.</span> <span id="s1373">Brought good money.</span> <span id="s1374">We sold everything down to what we just...the bare necessities, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: What did it do to you?</span> <span id="s1376">You felt German when you left?</span> <span id="s1377">Did you feel more Jewish as a result of being there?</span> <span id="s1378">How did it actually affect you, Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Well, I must say, before we emigrated, we finally didn't eat kosher anymore.</span> <span id="s1380">It wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s1381">You said, you know, this is really not the intent of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s1382">You wouldn't be any less of a Jew by not eating kosher.</span> <span id="s1383">So having solved that problem, I would say, as a whole the community became tighter knit.</span> <span id="s1384">And those Jews that were perhaps Agnostics or not religious at all--Atheists--became conscious Jews again.</span> <span id="s1385">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1386">We had holiday services with our own synagogues.</span> <span id="s1387">We had quite a few rabbis there, services, it was a very integrated Jewish life there.</span> <span id="s1388">Perhaps like a shtetl.</span> <span id="s1389">The foretaste of life in Israel in a way.</span> <span id="s1390">Very cohesive bible community; based on nothing, financially.</span> <span id="s1391">But it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Why would religious feelings become stronger?</span> <span id="s1393">Europe was in wreckage, people were refuges, what was it that was pulling people back to Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Well, I think it was adversity, to try to survive on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s1395">I think that must be it.</span> <span id="s1396">People seemed religious.</span> <span id="s1397">I think when people are on dire straits, you know, perhaps they turn to God again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Those people that you knew there, tell me what actually happened to the community?</span> <span id="s1399">What became of the community?</span> <span id="s1400">You, yourself, got to America.</span> <span id="s1401">What about the rest of the community?</span> <span id="s1402">How may died?</span> <span id="s1403">What happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Out of nearly 18,000, 3,000 died, and there was several thousand White Russians from the Bolshevick Revolutions.</span> <span id="s1405">Now the European refugee community lasted for 10 years ('38 to '48), completed disappeared.</span> <span id="s1406">A few years ago, there was one Jew left.</span> <span id="s1407">He is no more.</span> <span id="s1408">It was a civilized community.</span> <span id="s1409">with a tremendous amount of culture.</span> <span id="s1410">We had operas, operettas, plays, dramas performed.</span> <span id="s1411">It is unbelievable what the Jewish community did there.</span> <span id="s1412">It's all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Totally swallowed.</span> <span id="s1414">As you know, Mao Zedong took over in '48, '49.</span> <span id="s1415">I left in July 1947, with my mother and my wife and her father, on the troop transport.</span> <span id="s1416">And there are no traces of the Jewish community anymore, at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Where did the Jews go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Well, those that had relatives and an affidavit, of course, went to the United States.</span> <span id="s1419">Quite a few went to Australia.</span> <span id="s1420">Those that couldn't get a visa from the United States or didn't pass the very stringent health requirements went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1421">By that time Israel had gained its independence, and they went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: If you had but one statement to say about this whole period from Kristallnacht to the end of the war that you would wish to leave with somebody as to what it mean, what it did to you, what would you say?</span> <span id="s1423">What is the thing that affected you most?</span> <span id="s1424">Was it Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s1425">Was it being in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Well, I think it was a conglomerate.</span> <span id="s1427">It was, of course, Kristallnacht, seeing the temple, and seeing the free world stand by.</span> <span id="s1428">In retrospect the free world knew what was happening and didn't move a finger.</span> <span id="s1429">I saw how anti-semitism really preceded the whole Hitler period.</span> <span id="s1430">The free world must share in the responsibility of what happened to 12 million people there, 6 out of the 12 million were 6 million Jews, and the lack of help originally by the Joint Distribution Commitee that was unable to raise money and send professionals there.</span> <span id="s1431">That was unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1432">Later on, the Joint really got money back, got communication again through neutral counties, to feed the thousands of Jews there.</span> <span id="s1433">The Joint did a tremendous job.</span> <span id="s1434">I don't want to take anything away from the Joint, but the beginning, it was a disaster.</span> <span id="s1435">So what it meant to me, I think it was a school.</span> <span id="s1436">A tough school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: What would you say to people looking at this tape later on?</span> <span id="s1438">What would you, if you had the sum knowledge that this gives to you that you would wish to give youngsters who come to see it, what would you say to them?</span> <span id="s1439">Is there something you would want to say to them about what has happened to you and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Well, I think it has a meaning.</span> <span id="s1441">It is definitely of importance for the younger generation, Jews and otherwise, to know what happened, because I think we have to involve ourselves in Jewish life and in community life.</span> <span id="s1442">We have to make sure that we involve ourselves in a democratic process, especially here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1443">Because if we don't, if we are apathetic as the whole population is and the Jewish community is, we may wake up one day under a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s1444">Most of the people are turned out by politics and politicians.</span> <span id="s1445">And this is the danger that I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Mr. Heppner, thank you very much, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">[NB:
