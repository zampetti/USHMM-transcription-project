<p><span id="s57">Q: From Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Warsaw.</span> <span id="s59">Th -- I don’t know whether it was the beginning of the war, or that was a little bit later, and anyway they, for some reason they went to Moscow.</span> <span id="s60">And m-my mother’s what -- what she was doing, what she -- what she was, a -- an medical person, and they allowed her to live in Moscow, because at that time, under the Tsar, Jews were not a-allowed to live in Moscow, unless they were engineers, technicians and medical people.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s62">And what was your mother at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: She was fercherka, which is a -- a -- more than registered nurse.</span> <span id="s64">I think they have now this kind of people who work with the physicians, surgeons and so on, and they’re very close to -- they didn’t graduate as -- as doctors, but they had --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: They had a lot of training.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: And your father, what was he doing?</span> <span id="s68">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, I know that in Warsaw he had the store, a haberdashery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What are your earliest -- I know you were only there for a few years, but do you have memories from being in Moscow as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Well, one memory which I am -- I am not so sure it’s a really memory, because I was four or maybe five years old, that I was running through a corridor in the apartment, and knocking at that -- one of the doors, wanted to get in and crying, and somebody picked me up.</span> <span id="s74">And I -- later on I told my mother and she said, well you described this corridor, though I -- it was true, was long corridor, but I don’t remember the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: That’s all, you know.</span> <span id="s77">It’s the very early childhood, if I really remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s79">Do you remember the chaos of Moscow at the time of the revolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No, I don’t think I -- I re-remember that, but later on I -- I m -- read and heard --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: -- that it was a very dangerous street.</span> <span id="s83">You shouldn’t walk around.</span> <span id="s84">There is a very good book ab-about what was going on in Moscow at that time, by Jeromski, who was a writer, and -- and he wrote about the son and -- and -- and father who met ge -- ac -- accidentally that they were working together in a -- some kind of labor, slave labor or whatever.</span> <span id="s85">It wasn’t slave labor because they were free to go.</span> <span id="s86">And she -- this guy who had gi-given him a place to live, told them, don’t wander too much around Moscow, it’s a very dangerous place.</span> <span id="s87">And it was.</span> <span id="s88">It was shooting innocent people [indecipherable] somebody brought out to uncover their name, and -- and they were just shooting around the city, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Now, I understand that your father left Moscow to -- to try to get to Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you re -- do -- did you remember his leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And what were you told -- I understand later that you were told that he was -- he went to Odessa for --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: He was trying to get to Odessa, I don’t know how, what and how, because trains were not riding th -- you know, there was no schedules or anything, just a train comes in the station and you get in and you ask where -- where is it going.</span> <span id="s97">It -- it was a complete chaos and he was trying to get to Odessa, but my mother’s brother said that -- that they never seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s99">And so do you think that he left in 1918 or 1917, do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I think it probably -- se -- eight -- si -- 17 or 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I -- I have no idea, I can’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And then how long did you stay in Moscow after he had left, do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I think my mother decided to go back to Warsaw and she was looking for a way no -- down there.</span> <span id="s105">She probably found out about echelon.</span> <span id="s106">It used to be called echelon, this train.</span> <span id="s107">This was set up by -- I don’t know, it ma -- it must be later than ’18, because when Poland regained their status as -- as a -- as a country, they decided to help the Polish people to come back.</span> <span id="s108">And if you -- if you fi -- if you ever were a citizen of Poland, you could apply and look for a -- for a s -- town where it will stop.</span> <span id="s109">So probably my mother did that, find out where -- where it is.</span> <span id="s110">But before that, we went to Krasnodar, which is a town close to Caucasian mountains, where my grandparents on ma -- my mother’s side lived.</span> <span id="s111">And we went there and stayed, I d -- don’t know how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Was that nice for you to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I think it was nice, yes, it was v-very nice house with the verandas [indecipherable] and -- and there was a huge tree where our neighbor made for children to climb in, and there was a little house there, but they didn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s114">I don’t know, maybe once I was there, but was -- it was a joyful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: And my grandfather passed at the time and we started our way back --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: To Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: -- to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And your sister was born when?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: She was born in Warsaw in 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So before your parents left for --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Right, oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: -- for Moscow, obviously, right.</span> <span id="s124">Were you close with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Oh yes, very much.</span> <span id="s126">Well, you know how siblings are.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s128">And you were six years younger --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: -- right, so it’s a big -- it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, this is later years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So you went to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, we went to Warsaw by echelon, a train which stopped at Rostov.</span> <span id="s136">Rostov on -- on Don, which is dona in Polish, whatever.</span> <span id="s137">I keep forget -- Dniep -- no.</span> <span id="s138">I keep forgetting --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: -- the name of it in th -- in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What is it in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: The Dnieper.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: The Dnieper, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Right.</span> <span id="s145">And we had to cross the -- the sea from Odessa to Rostov, and the only thing I remember, I was sick on th --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: -- on this -- on the trip, yeah, that’s all I remember [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: And what are you, about five or six at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, I probably was six or seven, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: And when we came to Poland I -- I didn’t speak Polish yet, and I remember later -- later [indecipherable] in -- in school that was a poli -- teacher of Polish, and he reminded me all the time that I am -- that I am putting the -- the sentences in a way Russians put it.</span> <span id="s152">And -- and so it was kind of a long way.</span> <span id="s153">So we cou -- we came to Warsaw in ’22, I think.</span> <span id="s154">’22 [indecipherable], and I went to school, and the school was co-educational, which was a big, big st-step forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Co-educational.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Co-educational, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s159">Boys and girls together.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Unthinkable.</span> <span id="s162">And we were there for a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Was this a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: It was a private school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So your mother had a fair amount of money to be able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, she didn’t, but she started to work, and I -- I really don’t -- I don’t know how she managed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s168">And your sister went to that same school as

I hear something I understand, but I forgot once the -- I think your losing language is very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s178">And at home you spoke Polish, so w-was there Yiddish spoken at home at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q:

id="s209">That what I am saying, that I myself never felt anti-Semitism, but it used to be -- used to be for awhile in late 30’s that the national party came to -- to power, and students in the university demanded a diff -- different places for -- for Jews to sit.</span> <span id="s210">But I -- I don’t think it ever came th-through this.</span> <span id="s211">There were a lot of fights between s-students in the -- at the university, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: But before we get to the university years, tell me a little bit about growing up with a single mother, obviously, which I don’t know that wasn’t so typical at the time.</span> <span id="s213">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, it wasn’t, and well, we had the -- a helper.</span></p> <p><span

lovely.</span> <span id="s220">I am sorry I didn’t bring this photo.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: We can show the photos later.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And so it wasn’t harsh.</span> <span id="s225">I mean, we were not rich or anything, you know, that was far from there.</span> <span id="s226">But we were get -- getting along fine.</span> <span id="s227">And my grandmother -- I slept in the same room with my grandmother, and she collapsed and died of probably a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And when was that?</span> <span id="s229">That was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: That was probably late 20’s, I don’t remember exactly, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So

She did, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s235">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I did and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s238">You know how it is with -- later on I went to another school, and after that I went still to another school, Polish schools.</span> <span id="s239">And the last one I went was in different part of Warsaw, and it was kind of funny because the school was on a -- a high building, that was high probably at that time, it was nine floors or something like that, and the school was on eight and nine floor.</span> <span id="s240">And we had a different entrance because the tenants who lived in -- in the -- demanded that that will ha -- but sometimes we got out and come down the stairs of the tenants and rang the -- the -- yeah, what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Ring the bell?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Ring the bell, yeah.</span> <span id="s243">And one of the rang the bell was later on my very close friend here.</span> <span id="s244">That was her mother who opened the door, and we were already down.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And why were you moving to so many schools?</span> <span id="s246">Why were you going to so many schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Well, the second school I went from [indecipherable] it was a science school more -- more.</span> <span id="s248">And th-that was more mathematical, physical, you know, and physics and so on and I wasn’t doing too well.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, I was not very interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: In

had to take off my ar -- [indecipherable] kind of a [indecipherable] with the -- with the -- something on it, so we had to take this off and go to the movies.</span> <span id="s257">Sometimes we were caught that we shouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: You mean, you were s -- you were going [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: We were not allowed, yeah, to go in, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s261">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, because of the age, you know.</span> <span id="s263">We wanted to see the movies with Greta Garbo and si -- all those big -- and it was not allowed for a --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Why, because these were romantic movies, and you were supposed to be too -- you were too

No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s313">It was just a -- the war just --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Started

going full time, but I was still a -- a secretary for the afternoon, so -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So how many year -- if you had completed, how many years would it have taken to

Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: But he was coming to school, to some meetings you know, [indecipherable] and so on, and so I met him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So did you become friends then?</span> <span id="s330">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No, not really, no.</span> <span id="s332">He invited me to a journalism b-ball, and not any close friend, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s334">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: But we knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: But you knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Now, were you in a group of people that knew each other so you saw each other --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yeah, it was a group, mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So did you see each other with some regularity?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: -- not especially, no.</span> <span id="s344">No, when they -- when the meeting was held, and then I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: And what was it like in the university at this time, because the Nazis had taken over Germany in ’33 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah, but this has nothing to do with -- with Poland, but there was a fertile ground for anti-Semitism there.</span> <span id="s347">There is no -- no doubt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So did you start feeling somewhat fearful or apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No, I didn’t, I -- I had no idea that -- you know, Polish people never showed it, exactly.</span> <span id="s350">There were newspapers on one side, and -- and on the other side, it’s -- it was a democracy still, but the -- the national [indecipherable] there was [indecipherable] and str -- there were several factions, and the -- they were writing whatever they have in their mind, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: -- it was a de-democratic [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s353">But it -- it was a -- I think it was a fertile place to start some -- some of Hitler’s ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Wh -- when you were going to school, were you asked to sit in the back, or told to sit in the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Oh no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: It didn’t happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No, never happened, no.</span> <span id="s358">What was addressing this, it was a -- in ’36 or seven, there was some fight at the university.</span> <span id="s359">The -- the nationalists were against the -- the liberal ones, and they were just fighting among themselves and they wanted to have -- do some different -- different places to sit down.</span> <span id="s360">But I don’t think it ever came to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And you were at which university?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Warsaw University.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Warsaw University.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: But the -- the journalism was on a different place, not the -- not that the -- the building of university.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And your sister was studying at Warsaw University also?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: She did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: In di -- in journalism or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I don’t remember what she was taking in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s372">And you were living at home, both of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: At home, yeah, both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Yes, and your mother is, of course, continuing to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So, in 1939, when the Germans attacked Poland, is this a big surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Not such a big surprise, but the -- well, the -- the government was telling us absolutely something entirely different.</span> <span id="s378">That we’re strong and -- and that they have tanks made of, I don’t know, cartons or whatever.</span> <span id="s379">I-It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s380">We just couldn’t believe that -- that’s coming.</span> <span id="s381">And it came, first of September, 1939, and we heard the bombing coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s382">And then it didn’t take long.</span> <span id="s383">But of course, Warsaw was fighting through for another 20 days or something like that.</span> <span id="s384">And then they came -- they came marching the main street of Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And you remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Right.</span> <span id="s387">But before that it was a kind of a -- a -- a week or 10 days that they were free, the -- and I remember with my sister that we were walking in Warsaw ruined -- n-not ruined the way it was ruined after the uprising, but it -- it was pretty badly damaged, and one thing I remember very well, it’s -- it’s a dead horse on the street, you know.</span> <span id="s388">Some -- there were no dead people, so I saw the -- the horse there.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Just the horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: That must have been a big shock walking around under those circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Oh yeah, it was, but it was quiet, and pe -- people were shoot -- just going around, not knowing what’s going to come.</span> <span id="s393">And then they -- they get -- got in, and they marched in.</span> <span id="s394">The -- in this thoroughfare of Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And did you go and look, or could you see it from your apartment [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: No, no, nobody came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Nobody came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Nobody, no, they were empty street.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s401">So that was kind of a quiet two months, and everybody was waiting for orders -- what is -- what is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s402">And it started to happen i-in early fall, October.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: That they -- they were just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: The what?</span> <span id="s406">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: [indecipherable] word for at -- not advertising, how they say, placard.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Announcements?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: A whats?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Announcements?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Announcement, but n-not by radio, but by --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Posters?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Posters, posters, that’s right.</span> <span id="s414">That there is a typhus, and that they going to change the -- Warsaw, and the Jews have to come out and live at certain places.</span> <span id="s415">They didn’t say exactly where, but later on they did say, and w-we thought, you know, that we will just stay at home, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s416">We were told to move inside the ghett -- the ghetto didn’t exist --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: -- actually, at the time.</span> <span id="s419">And the wall didn’t go up until we were already inside.</span> <span id="s420">And the wall usually was running through the half of the street.</span> <span id="s421">So we were looking for something and we couldn’t find anyone.</span> <span id="s422">Then my -- our dentist, who lived inside of this perimeter where -- where we -- we could live too, offered us living quarters, so we decided to move there.</span> <span id="s423">It was a [indecipherable] complete [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s424">It was 1940 October.</span> <span id="s425">And we moved whatever we could, just by hand, and by a little cart which my -- my d -- my daughter’s husband found somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You mean your sister’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: My -- my sister, what -- what’d I say, daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: You said -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: I did -- never had a daughter.</span> <span id="s430">So, see how mixed up I am?</span> <span id="s431">Okay.</span> <span id="s432">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Let me ask you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Are there rumors going around?</span> <span id="s436">What are people saying to each other w-with this -- wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Just rumors.</span> <span id="s438">Rumors and posters, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Now, Chernyokov is made head of the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Right, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: -- council in October, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: -- he was, uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And what did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Well, we thought it’s probably wonderful, but we didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s445">I had the -- the first -- my ausweiss, which is a kind of a paper which shows that you are not ready for -- for deportation.</span> <span id="s446">It was from -- from Judenrat, yeah.</span> <span id="s447">And because the f -- a friend of mine -- my friend’s father belonged to the -- to the [indecipherable], and so I got this ausweiss, which nothing was worth.</span> <span id="s448">I didn’t work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: That was in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: That was in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: And what was his name?</span> <span id="s452">Your friend’s father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Jelinski, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And he was on the council with Chernyokov?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s457">So was -- when you moved into the place, what was it -- what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Well, we moved into this dentist, Anika was her name, and she let us a very large living room, and facilities -- I mean in th -- in the kitchen, and then a very tiny room for my sister and her husband.</span> <span id="s459">And my mother le -- wasn’t well at -- all of a sudden, because her first -- her first incident or ac -- or accident, happened when they bombarded Warsaw, and we were told by the -- that we should hide behind -- inside of the houses, or inside of the gates of the houses.</span> <span id="s460">And she did that, and this other -- arg -- other group, too, and she saw a little who was crying, and she gave her a candy.</span> <span id="s461">And somebody remark, you shouldn’t do that, cause there’s spies now, you’re not supposed to do it.</span> <span id="s462">And before she knew, a policeman came in and I -- I nof -- not arrested her, but took her to -- to a -- the o -- office -- police office and charged her with something, but they -- he let her go.</span> <span id="s463">She was very upset about it.</span> <span id="s464">And since then she wasn’t very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Was this the Jewish police who picked her up?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Jewish police who picked her up, or the --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: There wasn’t any Jewish police at that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: -- no.</span> <span id="s471">The f -- the Judenrat started to form po-police and so on --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: -- on -- on demand from Gestapo and Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And did you think your mother was getting depressed, or she was getting physically ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh she -- no, she -- no, she wasn’t well physically, and then depressed also, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So how old would she have been by -- around this time, do you think, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: How bo -- how what?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: How old do you think your mother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s480">Probably over 50, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Over 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: 50, yeah, or 56, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And how was your grandmother at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Does your sister get a -- get a special pass as well as you, when you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes, she did, yeah, from Judenrat, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: But you’re not working, cause there’s -- there are no workshops set up, there’s nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: -- set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: -- there’s nothing to do there.</span> <span id="s493">It was just because I knew the people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s496">Well, actually, you know what Germans were doing, they were preparing us for all this what was coming, by depressing us, that we are much less regular people than -- then the -- the other folks.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s499">I -- the -- that we are --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Not as good.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: -- not as good as -- as German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And how did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s504">I -- at this time in 40’s, and early ’41, I used to go outside to our friends who never moved from their places, counting probably on the -- the -- that -- that they didn't know [indecipherable] leaving, or they -- they knew, but they didn’t disclose that.</span> <span id="s505">And they prevailed until the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I’m talking about not the uprising in ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: -- I’m talking about the German uprising --</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: The Polish uprising in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And you were able to go in and out of the ghetto before [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes, yes, there were possibility and I -- I went several times.</span> <span id="s514">Just [indecipherable] took off the -- the band on -- on your right hand and -- and went and it was won -- wonderful.</span> <span id="s515">It’s a feeling like something very heavy [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Was it dangerous for you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Not at thi --</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: You --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: -- this time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: But you had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Unless a -- I would -- I don’t know, I probably didn’t look very much Jewish, or something.</span> <span id="s524">I didn’t have any problem.</span> <span id="s525">But it wa -- didn’t last very long, cause they closed this -- this courts.</span> <span id="s526">These were courts.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Courts?</span> <span id="s528">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s530">C-o-u-r-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: C-o-u-r-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: C-o-u-r-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So, as soon as you moved into this area that then became the -- the ghetto, the walled-in ghetto, were you put -- you had to put on an armband --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: And it was -- what was the color, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: White with blue, the David --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So this must have been also extremely strange for you, and for everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s541">But you know, there was so many things around us which were terrible.</span> <span id="s542">First of all, the change of the living quarters.</span> <span id="s543">The -- the -- the surrounding, and you know, somebody’s else house you live, and tha -- there was a lack of food.</span> <span id="s544">There was a -- our housekeeper, who used to come to our regular place where we used to live, and she brought some food from -- from reich.</span> <span id="s545">Reich was -- was anything which is -- which Germans occupied, it was called reich, r-e-i-c-h.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: And they were o-occupied [indecipherable] and -- and they -- it was m-more contact with other people, and here all of a sudden we’re cut off of everything.</span> <span id="s548">And there was nothing to -- to live by.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: So this was the least of it, having the armband, it was not -- was not as [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: The armband -- the armband worked only in -- in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s551">When you go out -- you couldn’t go out with your armband.</span> <span id="s552">Out of the ghetto you couldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Did -- did things change really immediately when you moved, so that there was much less food, water, electricity --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: No wa -- there was water.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: There was water?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah, yeah, for a long time, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s557">But food, yes, there were -- you know, the little boys were smuggling bread and all kinds of food.</span> <span id="s558">But when you paid the [indecipherable] which was the German, later on in the day, in -- lots of food came into ghetto by --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: They smuggled it.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: You know, by -- yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And then, what were they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Everything has been smuggled, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And they would sell it sort of like a black market, they would sell it so they could get --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yes, expensive, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: But you weren’t working, your mother wasn’t working, so how did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, we ha -- we had some money, and I -- wi -- we sold out a lot of th -- table sel -- silver and so on when we still were outside there, the ghetto, I went to -- to a market and sold out for whatever, flo-flour or what is -- oil or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: And how did you bring in the stuff that you bought?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, it wasn’t ghetto at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Uh-huh, so it was still [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No, it was before, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: -- that was alright.</span> <span id="s574">Before the wall was put up.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And did you go see your friends when you went out?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yes, I went to my friends, I went to a friend very far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And did they suggest --</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Well, they -- they helped us a little bit, as much as they could, but not too much.</span> <span id="s580">We actually sold out everything before we went to ghetto, and we just lived day by day.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you think when you left the ghetto, in order to sell out stuff, that at some point maybe you should [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: I didn’t go out of the ghetto to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: I don’t -- I know [indecipherable] yes, when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: That was before that, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: -- when you moved into the area that became the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Did you ever think of staying outside of that area, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Well, yes I did, but I didn't see any possibility.</span> <span id="s589">My sister could go to Brazil before we went to ghetto, when somebody gave her papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: And -- but she didn’t.</span> <span id="s592">It -- it wasn’t that -- it wasn’t yet so strong feeling that we can’t get -- that we can’t get through, you know, in -- in a few months, in a year.</span> <span id="s593">We got this bullet -- bulletin, a Polish bulletin that it will not last long an-and so on, and you know, this kind of things.</span> <span id="s594">But the real break-out was the Stalingrad offensive and that was much, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So tell -- let’s go back.</span> <span id="s596">When -- when the -- when the wall is built, do you now have this feeling of what --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: -- this is not going to end so soon.</span> <span id="s599">Something --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Right, of course.</span> <span id="s601">And we lived with this dentist friend and she had her windows turned into the place where they checking it out, the ghetto, and I looked what was go -- what’s going on.</span> <span

<p><span id="s603">Q: So it was just getting worse and worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did you now begin to see dead bodies, or was that later?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Dead body was -- was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: It was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s609">Because they ev -- every -- every community, ev -- Jewish community which were left over, they were coming to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s610">It started to be, you know, not just wars -- Warsaw citizens, but everybody else.</span> <span id="s611">And from Germany and -- and even from abroad, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So there’s a huge number of people who come into a very, very small --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Place, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: -- area.</span> <span id="s615">There’s almost 400,000 people --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: [indecipherable] becomes the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: So this must have been awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Awful.</span> <span id="s621">In --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Really chaotic --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: -- in living quarters, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: The typhus really began at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I had typhus, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s630">It was in ’42, in -- in winter and all of a sudden I became very ill, and it -- there was a -- there wasn’t an -- even doctors available, but a friend doctor came and gave me some whatever.</span> <span id="s631">I went through it with a very high fever, and if it -- it will become meningitis after the fever becomes really high.</span> <span id="s632">But I --</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: But you got through it.</span> <span id="s634">So you were living with your mother, your grandmother, your sister, and your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: No, grandmother wa-wasn’t alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Your grandmother was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s638">Grandmother was gone yeah, that was long time before.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Before you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Before we moved, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Oh, much before we moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s645">She lived until, I don’t know, ’36 or seven yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: ’36 -- ’36.</span> <span id="s647">And is your brother-in-law working, your sister working, or is no one working?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Well, he was working.</span> <span id="s649">We -- i -- you can’t -- you can’t say that --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: -- he was working.</span> <span id="s652">There was no workplace as [indecipherable] can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: There was, you know, some kind of a trading.</span> <span id="s655">You -- you had this and I give you that and then you give me I don’t know what, flour or -- or macaroni or whatever and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s656">Or you have contact with the outside, meaning the Polish, which I had, and -- and could sell something to friends and they will give you any money.</span> <span id="s657">But that was all in the beginning, in the beginning of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s659">And do you remember these self-help organizations, house committees around Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: As far as I remember, it didn’t -- it had nothing to do with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So did y -- you didn't know about s -- any soup kitchens, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, they were organized, all those kind of things, but I was out of the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: You were out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s666">And what about -- I do know that there were lots of -- there were lots of cultural activities, some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, there was, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s668">I was once only --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Once?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- in a -- in some kind of a -- a garden, you know, put up as a -- as a kind of a café or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s673">But it was only once.</span> <span id="s674">And th -- well, a lot of it is in -- pianist is a -- di-did you read that?</span> <span id="s675">Yeah, well, he has a -- a different approach to that, yeah, but I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s676">Well, it was -- you know, it was for people who really made money, and some did.</span> <span id="s677">And some had contact with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s678">They thought this will help them to -- to get out of the deportation.</span> <span id="s679">But a-at the last time, it did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s681">So as -- let’s talk between 1940, in November, when -- when the ghetto -- when the ghetto really becomes enclosed, until before the deportations, what do you begin to think about the Judenrat at this time?</span> <span id="s682">Do you -- are you -- do you think they’re doing a good job?</span> <span id="s683">Are you angry with them?</span> <span id="s684">Do you wonder what’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: About Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Well, it di -- you know, they -- they just couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s688">They were told one day they have to -- to send 10,000 Jewish men for work.</span> <span id="s689">And where would they find those 10,00 Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: And it would -- was a -- a very bad job, I should say.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yeah, they -- they couldn’t come out of it right.</span> <span id="s694">And once they were arrested, all of them, and there was a saying all over the ghetto that something bad is coming, and they were -- and they let them out in a couple of days.</span> <span id="s695">So we didn't know much about it, what was going on.</span> <span id="s696">We knew the [indecipherable] commando, which was in later years used to get people out of the houses, and march them to Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: That was a special unit, special German unit.</span> <span id="s699">And they -- they had also Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and -- and there -- that’s what they help us, and dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And dogs.</span> <span id="s701">And did you think that the Judenrat had kind of a special privileges, that they got more food, or they were more --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Maybe they had easier to get food, but I don’t think they were ever paid or -- or anything.</span> <span id="s703">I -- I have no i --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: [indecipherable] didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: -- yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I -- I -- I knew only -- the demands were very well known, that they need more and more people t-to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s710">And they -- the Judenrat couldn’t handle it, it -- it was too -- too difficult to get 10,000 people to work one day, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you hear things about an underground movement, or the political movements in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Very late, yes I had, because my -- my daught -- my sister husband, chi -- joined them for awhi -- as much as I know before I left ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: And do you know with what group he was involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No, I don’t, no.</span> <span id="s717">There were very -- as -- as far as I know, there were very few who really took part in the ghetto uprising and it was absolutely unbelievable what they have done.</span> <span id="s718">In the first day of the uprising, the Germans pulled out, it was such a strong --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: -- but of course later on it’s -- it’s [indecipherable] it was tragic.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s722">But did you -- be-before the deportations, did you know that there were political groups talking about what they should do, or what they were capable of doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yeah, well, not much, not much.</span> <span id="s724">That it -- it was chaotic at first, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: But later on when they decided to -- to -- to do that, th-there was smuggling of -- of weapons and I heard about it, I knew that exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s728">But that was not something that you were involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: When you were outside, di -- were th -- the puli -- the Catholics talking about underground or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Oh yes, yes, I heard through Stefan, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: And when did -- did -- when did you see Stefan for the first time after the occupation?</span> <span id="s733">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I came out through the courts --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: -- and I walked the -- the main street of Warsaw, [indecipherable] Koska, and I s -- I seen him, but I didn't approach him.</span> <span id="s737">It was too dangerous at that time.</span> <span id="s738">But he saw me, and he approached me, and we went for coffee and he told me about his -- his marching o -- o -- the -- you know, because there were orders and six or seven September from radio, that all able men to carry weapons should go out toward the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: And he and his colleagues left.</span> <span id="s741">And that was a walking march, cause they didn’t have any cars, nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: -- right, yeah.</span> <span id="s744">It was something somebody [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s745">And he went to Lvov, which is Lviv now.</span> <span id="s746">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s747">And they found out there is no -- no army, nothing.</span> <span id="s748">So they turned around and heard that Warsaw is completely demolished.</span> <span id="s749">And so they came back and he found out that he has to move out of th -- of his apartment where he lived, cause this part of Warsaw was given to Gestapo and other officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s751">So what was he -- when you met him, was he involved with --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: -- the underground at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yeah, at -- at first he was -- he opened a little store or whatever in books, but he didn’t -- he didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s755">So he -- he got -- he got -- he had the friend in the taxation department and she gave him a ausweiss to go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s756">And [indecipherable] the people with taxes.</span> <span id="s757">Of course, he didn’t -- there wasn’t anyone to whom he can give the taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: So he was supposed to -- there were tax collectors?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s761">There were also people collecting money for gas, for electricity, as far as I understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: I think so, but I don’t -- don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So he was supposed to collect taxes for the Polish government?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: He was supposed to -- yeah, mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And did he ever s --</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Not Polish government --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: [indecipherable] whatever</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: -- yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Was -- did he succeed?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s771">He -- he just tried to get to the certain places, and there was nobody, or they changed their address, or they not living any more, yeah.</span> <span id="s772">So that was his job, and that’s why he got the ausweiss, which let him go into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Go in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s775">So he visited his friends, his Jewish friends, and he dow -- he visited us too, and he brought sardines from Portugal, and soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Which was a very important thing.</span> <span id="s778">Kind of a -- is kind of a large --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Large soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Is kind -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So how often did he come into the ghetto, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Well, oh once a week or --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: -- something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So you would see him once a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Right.</span> <span id="s787">And he -- he told me finally in October -- think it was October, ’42 or some -- that his ausweiss is running out and if I want to come out to his apartment, I am welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: And what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I didn't think anything about it.</span> <span id="s790">Well, you know, it -- it -- well, going back it’s so difficult.</span> <span id="s791">It’s so difficult to -- to know what I’d been thinking each time, after each catastrophe.</span> <span id="s792">It -- it’s very hard to thi -- maybe I didn't think at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Maybe you just passed it by.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: [indecipherable] he said it -- uh-huh.</span> <span id="s796">Were you becoming close friends at this point, were you be -- o-or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: W-We were -- we were friends, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: You were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Or re -- I know -- I knew some people who lived with him --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: -- and that was the connection, it was -- he -- he had a -- a [indecipherable] who was Finkelstein actually.</span> <span id="s802">And they had the an-antique store in Warsaw -- I mean, before the war, and she lived there and another couple, a Polish couple live.</span> <span id="s803">The apartment was large --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: -- as -- for the -- for the Steins.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: For the Steins, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: I think what we’ll do is we’ll --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: -- stop the tape at this moment --</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: -- and continue in a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s814">This was one -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s817">Let’s talk about when you actually have a job in the Tebbins shop.</span> <span id="s818">It -- when did -- how did --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yeah, was a -- was a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: It was a job for ausweiss, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: When you got the special pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Right.</span> <span id="s824">And I don’t remember, I just went there and was told that I -- I can work there.</span> <span id="s825">And they were sewing the camouflage outside, the camouflage an-and the white part was underneath so they could, you know, in snow -- in snow, it doesn’t show.</span> <span id="s826">And I didn’t know how to sew on that, you know, sewing machine.</span> <span id="s827">So I was -- hadn’t finished some of the thing.</span> <span id="s828">And th-the hours were terrible, because it was -- I don’t remember, from eight to -- to one or two o-or from four to -- to 12 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s829">And we were fall asleep, of course, all of us.</span> <span id="s830">And we got food there, and they brought it in large kettle with soup, which wasn’t soup [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s831">There was some -- some food at the very end, so it was lucky, you know, to get the --</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: You mean at the bottom of the pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: At the bottom of the p -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s835">So did you try to wait the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Well, some did, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s837">But -- and there was bread, I think to the na -- probably now it’s a very -- very much looked after, this kind of bread which was dark -- black and you had all -- all seven grains, or eight grains, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: And -- and th -- I worked there, but th-the first time which I got into this big walk, you know, through the Warsaw to deportation that -- I wasn’t at Tebbins, I was at home, whatever I want -- went to look for some -- something, I don’t remember what.</span> <span id="s840">And I was swept out with this large crowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the middle of the road, they were just going people with children, with -- with bundles of -- of -- of food -- not food, I don’t know what, and that -- and we were going toward Meeska, toward the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed when the took out the people from the -- from the houses, they closed the gates.</span> <span id="s841">You know, that’s kind of gates what you come at 11 o’clock that used to be, and you had to wake up the -- the guy who takes care of the -- an-and give him 20 cents or whatever because you came late.</span> <span id="s842">So they were -- they were closed tight --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: You mean, outside -- the outside gates --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: -- outside, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: -- of the house, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Because the houses were -- they had that -- the gate was open over there, and you come in and walk to the right or to the left or further down where it’s called Pardvuka, which was a larger part [indecipherable] something like that, where the housekeepers were -- were cleaning the rugs from upstairs.</span> <span id="s847">A-And -- but one of -- if wi -- I recognized one of the policemen that I knew him, and he recognized me, and he showed me on the way to Umschlagplatz that one of the gates is a little bit open, not completely shut, and I followed that.</span> <span id="s848">Came out of the crowd and I thought well, I’ve nothing to lose, and sneak in the -- the -- the gate.</span> <span id="s849">And there was a lot of people there, and we waited for a couple of hours until everything calmed down, and the people who were hiding in -- in the apartments, they came out and they told us how to go to -- to different streets.</span> <span id="s850">But the streets, you know, they -- the houses were cut like alleys so you can go through one street to another without coming out on the main street.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: And so I went home and they couldn’t believe that I -- I am still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: So they were frightened because they saw all these people and they knew you were in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Oh they -- they knew nobody -- nobody came out of it, and so they were very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: What did -- what did you know about these deportations at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Oh, we know a lot, but we thought, you know, Judenrat helping to that.</span> <span id="s857">That this is all some lies.</span> <span id="s858">Those are young boys who just fled, you know, the [indecipherable] and -- and th-that’s not true, it’s -- but we started to believe that is something wrong at the end of the line.</span> <span id="s859">But a lot of people did believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: So in -- in ’42, when the deportations begin, you’ve heard stuff about Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Even before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: E-Even before.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Not trebli -- not a name --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: -- th-th-there were other names.</span> <span id="s866">There was Sobibor and there were -- th-there were -- that wasn’t the only trebli --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Treblinka was the one which took so many lives.</span> <span id="s869">That was the -- the end.</span> <span id="s870">There was no -- nobody, you know, nobody a-as far as I know nobody escaped from Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I don’t know, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Well, there was an escape later.</span> <span id="s874">There [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yeah, maybe yeah.</span> <span id="s876">Because some were left to l -- sort out the -- whatever th-the others left.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s879">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: So what did you be -- do you remember what you believed?</span> <span id="s881">After -- at the attack on Russia, there’s a lot of killing that goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s884">That the Germans are killing.</span> <span id="s885">Do you hear about those killings as the Germans are attacking Russia in ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Oh yeah, we knew about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: You do?</span> <span id="s888">And what did --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Cause we -- we had this bulletin from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Who -- who brought in the -- the bulletins.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: And we knew what was go-going on in the world, and it’s -- it was getting, you know, better, and -- but who knew when it will end?</span> <span id="s894">We -- we t -- we thought at first, you know, when we lived outside the ghetto, that this will last half a year, a year --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: -- but not five.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Well, w-we -- we just didn’t -- I -- we didn’t have time to think about it, you know?</span> <span id="s901">I-It -- it was struggling every day.</span> <span id="s902">Every day you need food, you need -- your mother is not well.</span> <span id="s903">It -- it wasn’t the -- the only -- when we got this news, it was far away, and nobody cares.</span> <span id="s904">Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s905">There was a time which I later found out, that Americans and English knew everything what is going on.</span> <span id="s906">So -- not only through Karski, there were many other people who -- who came and -- and w-were telling what was going on, not only with Jews, but with Poles.</span> <span id="s907">And nobody could believe that they’re taking those people and just putting them under gas.</span> <span id="s908">At -- at first they were just r -- large vans, which we’ve heard about it.</span> <span id="s909">No -- nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s910">It was -- it was impossible to believe.</span> <span id="s911">So everybody thought, you know, where are we going?</span> <span id="s912">But later on, it started to dawn on us that this is the end, and everybody who could -- there was building of hide-a-way kind of things.</span> <span id="s913">You have a stove and you -- behind the stove there is a room there, and the -- so i -- you put the stove at -- at the -- at the entrance, and there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s914">So these people survived.</span> <span id="s915">How they survived, it was terrible, because I was in one of those ones, and I was told that there were small children with us, and the parents knew if we hear somebody coming [indecipherable] or SS, or what -- whatever, that we ca -- we just have to smother the child.</span> <span id="s916">Yes.</span> <span id="s917">And since then, when I went to one of those because I was not at home, I was going out, and there was an alarm that Ukrainians are coming, and I didn’t go an -- any more to these hiding places, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: To this -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: But there was a lot of these hiding places, and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in ghetto, that a lot of people were safe this way.</span> <span id="s920">Oh, I -- of course, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s921">A lot of people outside the ghettos w-were saved to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: -- until the Polish uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Let me go back a little bit, to the work.</span> <span id="s925">How -- do you remember about how many people were working in that shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Well, I don’t remember exactly, but in my room there were probably 40.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: 40.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: 40.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: 40.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: But th-there were other rooms, you know, where they were working.</span> <span id="s933">Actually, they -- I must say on behalf of Tebbins that he was giving those ausweiss rather knowingly, that those people don’t know how to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s935">Including you.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Including me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So nobody trained you on the machines?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: No, I -- no, I started to -- to use the machine when I was out of there, yeah.</span> <span id="s939">So that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Was there -- were there Germans -- German officials in the shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: -- nobody, nobody.</span> <span id="s944">When the -- that -- that was kind of a relief, that was nobody there except the supervisors.</span> <span id="s945">One was called Jan -- Jahn -- Jan -- H -- J-a-h-n.</span> <span id="s946">And when I was liberated already outside in Quakenbrick where we li -- used to live for awhile at the -- with the Polish press, I saw a man on the street and I thought it was Jahn, and I told Stefan, he said, oh, you have ideas.</span> <span id="s947">I saw him another time, and I was so sure that it was Jahn, but Stefan said no, that’s probably not.</span> <span id="s948">I gave up.</span> <span id="s949">You give up on -- on the lot of things.</span> <span id="s950">When we were at the -- under the bureau [indecipherable] under the British and we occupied as part of Germany, we got the print shop for our -- our newspaper.</span> <span id="s951">And the -- the owner of the print shop was coming to those journalists, and telling them, I never was a Nazi, I never -- never had anything to do with them, and [indecipherable] a-anything, he would say.</span> <span id="s952">And they were listening just, you know.</span> <span id="s953">Nothing -- nothing happened to any of those people, and he was a Nazi, there is no -- but there were a lot of them who had to join the -- the -- the party, because of their living.</span> <span id="s954">He had very nice print shop and -- and he wanted to keep it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Wer -- were you able -- did you get something other than soup so that you -- some food that you were able to bring back to your mother and your sister and brother-in-law, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: N-No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: You couldn’t.</span> <span id="s958">And of course there was no pay, there was no -- it -- the only thing you got was food.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: No, that that I seen.</span> <span id="s960">I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: How long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: That’s -- you know, it’s difficult for me to say, I -- I -- I do-don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Months?</span> <span id="s964">Years?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: I -- until -- right -- well, maybe a few months.</span> <span id="s966">Until the moment when the -- the second Umschlagplatz happened to me, and then I stopped working, and the only food it was -- which was smuggled and w-we bought, and it was pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: So the first time you escaped deportation, you were just -- you-you’re just sort of swept along on the street.</span> <span id="s968">You never get to the Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s971">So that was probably July, do you think, ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: That was July ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: The first -- the first wave of --</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: -- the deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: 20 - something, 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: It was a -- a crowd which is difficult to explain.</span> <span id="s979">We were walking one by one, and the children didn’t cry.</span> <span id="s980">It was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s983">Nobody tried to escape.</span> <span id="s984">We were paralyzed.</span> <span id="s985">I-It was a unbelievable scene, just those dogs marching, an-and there weren’t too many Gestapo people, they called -- those are special forces -- were special forces I heard, at home.</span> <span id="s986">And at -- that what you struck by the absolutely paralyzed people walking.</span> <span id="s987">It’s -- it’s unbelievable, I -- it -- it -- the -- the way I -- I -- I looked at this Jewish policeman, I thought I know him, and he kind of made it -- eye contact to me, and I thought he showed me with his eyes the -- the next gate, which was how -- and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: So how do you explain the fact that you were not paralyzed?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s990">Some people were not, you know.</span> <span id="s991">Some people made their way probably in other gates.</span> <span id="s992">I -- I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: I guess it’s surprising that you would say it was so quiet.</span> <span id="s994">I would have expected --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: It was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s998">Maybe a -- a whimper of a -- the child or something li --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: But not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: -- but no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1001">The same was the second time when I was at Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: So now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Nobody said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s1005">So how -- how did it happen that you were at the Umschlagplatz the second time?</span> <span id="s1006">Would that have been in July again, or wa -- August [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No, no, it was -- no, it was later, it was September probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: September?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1010">And I was walking, y-you know, to get some money or food, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1011">I went to Paviar Street, and all of a sudden I see a rush of people, but not as big, not as large as the previous one, the July one.</span> <span id="s1012">And I was caught in it, and I walked with them.</span> <span id="s1013">A young woman walked with me and we exchanged some words, but not much.</span> <span id="s1014">And we went to a barrack which was -- I don’t know what it was before, you know, because it’s -- was kind of remod with table and -- and chairs.</span> <span id="s1015">And the chairs were made of steel, you know, the kind of -- something like what we use now when a lot of people come.</span> <span id="s1016">And we found a place and we sit down and waited for the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: So you’re at the Umschlagplatz you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: You’re at the Umschlagplatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: And you’re waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: And outside there was no -- no Germans inside, or maybe they were at the doors, but outside the -- were Ukrainians with dogs.</span> <span id="s1023">And that was it, it was kind of quiet, nobody talked unless whispered to somebody.</span> <span id="s1024">And I noticed that some people are going around and behind me, going to something which is open, and stairs are leading.</span> <span id="s1025">And I talked to my companion, I said, I think there is something there.</span> <span id="s1026">And she said, yes I know.</span> <span id="s1027">How do you know?</span> <span id="s1028">Somebody probably escape, but she said Ukrainians come later and shoot the people who are hiding.</span> <span id="s1029">So there is no way.</span> <span id="s1030">I said, well let’s try.</span> <span id="s1031">And she tells -- she said no, I don’t want to because I still hope that I’ll find my family.</span> <span id="s1032">I didn’t say it -- anything.</span> <span id="s1033">And she took money out of her -- you know, the -- the -- there used to be [indecipherable] which is -- they were different kind of -- there were no tights, but they were draw -- you know, yo-you draw from your corset and tie your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: -- your -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Your -- your stockings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: And she -- she -- I said, I am going.</span> <span id="s1040">And she took out money out of, you know, her stocking, and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1041">I turned around and you know that -- these iron chairs were noisy, so I tried not to make noise.</span> <span id="s1042">I got up and sl-slinked down, and went dis -- up the stairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: So did you go on the floor?</span> <span id="s1044">So you didn't stand up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: I -- I almost didn’t stand up.</span> <span id="s1046">I was just crouching, li-like this, and I walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: When I went the stairs, they were dark and when I came up, it -- it was a -- a door to some kind of a attic or -- or I don’t know what it was, and wa -- there were some furniture, sa -- some things were lying down, but it was completely dark.</span> <span id="s1049">And I went there and I -- I just sit down on the floor.</span> <span id="s1050">And it was quiet, very quiet.</span> <span id="s1051">I think I -- my heart was, of course, pounding.</span> <span id="s1052">It stopped pounding after maybe I don’t know, half an hour or so.</span> <span id="s1053">And I probably fell asleep, because what I heard the next, it was [indecipherable] of these chairs and steps and later on schnell, schnell, the Ukrainians with the dogs, and it -- it took quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1054">And I felt that people are around me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: But you didn't see anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: No, I didn’t see, because it was dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: I don’t know, they -- it was a stockroom, so some kind of a -- a -- and then I heard the train and the doors closing down.</span> <span id="s1059">And we waited.</span> <span id="s1060">I think we all fell asleep probably.</span> <span id="s1061">Kind of a early morning, we heard voices.</span> <span id="s1062">One vo-voice, or two maybe, and they said, just stay where you are, don’t move.</span> <span id="s1063">And we -- we thought what is -- but in Polish, not [indecipherable] and we thought, wa -- what is it?</span> <span id="s1064">And came there, either they were dressed like medical people or they -- they put it on, I -- I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1065">And they let us out and took us to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1066">Gave us some tea and something, and show us the way to ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: So the room that you were in w -- led into the hospital that was right next door?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Oh, no, it wasn’t very next door, but there wa -- probably was close.</span> <span id="s1069">They had the -- some kind of part in.</span> <span id="s1070">Maybe they made the -- some kind of opening in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: In the wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: In the -- no, it wasn’t the wall.</span> <span id="s1073">I-It was -- th-the long fence, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1076">Th-This kind of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: So how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I don’t know whether it was electracized, I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: -- I had -- I -- I can’t tell you because I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: So nobody came upstairs?</span> <span id="s1082">The Ukrainians didn’t come upstairs and look at the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Oh, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: And they saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: They looked in, and they left.</span> <span id="s1088">I heard the -- her-heard them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: With dogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: They came without dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Without dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Because the dogs certainly would have smelled you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Just the we -- with the weapons.</span> <span id="s1097">But they didn’t, not this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Now, do you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: What ma -- what my friends, you know, wa -- walking friend, told me that they come and shoot whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1100">But they didn’t, no.</span> <span id="s1101">I seen them putting their weapons inside and looking, but they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1103">And you didn't want to say to your friend, but you’re going to get killed and -- from this train?</span> <span id="s1104">Remember when your friend said, I don’t want to go because I’ll get shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1107">You didn’t say to her, but everybody’s going to get killed on this train [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1110">Do you have any

that decision, since you hadn’t been able to make that decision before?</span> <span id="s1232">You’re still with your family, so you must be feeling some obligation towards them.</span></p> <p><span

don’t know where she called me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: -- but at that time we didn’t have a phone.</span> <span id="s1297">She called from somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: And did you ever find out what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: And wa -- th -- were they --

--</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: No, it wasn’t a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: It wasn’t a surprise.</span> <span id="s1325">But this was -- this had not been happening, or -- or when you saw each other in the ghetto, did you both realize that there were strong feelings between --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Yeah, well there were strong feelings, yeah.</span></p>

id="s1345">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: But nothing happened when we [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1347">At that time I went for a couple of months to -- to Stefan’s parent in a different place, but nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: And his --</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Or -- or once we had to run through the kitchen entrance, run away from the same kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: And you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: -- you ran out of the apartment, or di --

Until the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: -- the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: And how -- how is the situation now in -- in -- how different from being in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1359">Did you have food, and you had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Oh, we had the food.</span> <span id="s1361">It was not too much, but we had food.</span> <span id="s1362">And I cooked and well, as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Were you a -- were you a good cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1365">I don’t know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Not yet, not yet, because Stefan always reminds me when he came and potatoes were boiling and I was asking my mother, mom, ho-how much salt, do I put salt?</span> <span id="s1368">So it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: So your living conditions were actually much better together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Of course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Did -- did you find it, I don’t know, disturbing or odd that the difference between the ghetto situation and the rest of occupied Warsaw was so different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yeah, well, it was different, yes, it was different, but th -- they suffered a lot, too, and all of a sudden, you know, comes a German outfit and rounds up several blocks and takes out people from trams and take them to -- to Germany to work, or just shoot them for no reason.</span> <span id="s1375">And some who were taking part in underground were taken out and you know, they -- they were shooting them or taking them to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1376">So they suffered, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And -- but what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: -- a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: -- di -- I imagine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: I mean, in regular circumstances, Poles suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s1381">But you can’t compare to what was happening in ghettos.</span> <span id="s1382">There is no comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1384">And do you think that the -- the Polish ca -- the Catholics that you were meeting, the non-Jews that you were meeting understood that there was such a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1386">The one I met, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Well, there were others who will come and ask for money and -- and other addresses where a -- where Jews live [indecipherable] you know, it’s -- it’s a -- it’s always a -- and it was also on the Poles side, if you find a Gestapo or SS or whatever, they find the house where Jews are hidden, they would shoot everybody or take everybody to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: So it was -- it was quite a decision to take Jews in, especially men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Why especially men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Well, they were circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Oh, oh, taking in Jewish men, uh-huh, I see what you mean, yes, right.</span> <span id="s1394">So they could be easily found out.</span> <span id="s1395">So do you think more women were -- were saved in these circumstances than men --</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: -- because it was less dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1401">Well, men usually, at the ghetto situation in the beginning and later, they choose to go east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: And that was a good idea.</span> <span id="s1404">That -- thi -- it doesn’t mean that they didn’t wind up in a gulag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: You know, for different

terrible time, terrible time, especially at the end when the uprising went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Yes, cause it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Well, we had to wait for the Red Cross to -- to make sure that we are -- be treated as -- not as bandits, but as fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: As POW -- you mean as soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: So the Red Cross came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Oh, Red Cross came in, yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: And so

Well, what were you doing in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Oh, I -- helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Just helping the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Yeah.</span></p>

nurses who could be, you know, taking care of the wounds, or -- or things like that.</span> <span id="s1437">But -- and that was the only thing I’ve been doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1439">And so the Germans actually respected the -- the Red Cross [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: The finally day there, yeah, respected and -- well, it was -- you know, it was quiet all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s1441">[indecipherable] Warsaw came out and we went also to the house which we lived in.</span> <span id="s1442">And the only thi -- we -- he

<p><span id="s1541">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1542">And -- and did other people have fairly good treatment or you don’t know how it was in the other sections of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: In this s -- this Russian section was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: We came at the end, actually, and they were just died of hunger and tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1546">And only the one who were going out of the camp, working for Germans, you know, for the out -- you know, to do things, were, you know, who were able to repair something or do any kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: So the Russians were treated the worst?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Did -- were

know any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1558">Now, when you are s -- liberated, you are disappointed that the Russians have come, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: -- not the Americans, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Very much, yeah.</span> <span id="s1562">Well, they came, you know, and they opened a food storage of Nazis.</span> <span id="s1563">There were a few Nazis killed and I -- I don’t know what they were before they came.</span> <span id="s1564">I think probably some Russians did that.</span> <span id="s1565">And -- and they came and they opened the storage with rice and who knows what, and started to feed us.</span> <span id="s1566">It wasn’t a good idea because we were not prepared for that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Well, a little bit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: But then the Russians said that if you are Polish you have to go back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: And you didn't want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: And a number of you didn't want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: And so you escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1577">At the gate --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: You’re very -- you’re very brave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1580">Not any more.</span> <span id="s1581">The gate was practu -- practically open, you know, sometimes there was a si -- th-the Russian soldiers stood.</span> <span id="s1582">But many times they gave it to Polish men to take care of the gate.</span> <span id="s1583">So I joined the -- a part of -- now this is it, a part of the two women and two Belgians, men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: They had the -- something wi-with their hands, how do you call this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: An armba -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Yeah, well, they were wounded, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Oh, you mean bandages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Bandages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1592">And we decided to -- to go.</span> <span id="s1593">I went to this guy who was guarding the gate and I told him that we will probably leave early in the morning, really early.</span> <span id="s1594">He said go ahead [indecipherable] early.</span> <span id="s1595">And -- because he had the -- to take care of the gate.</span> <span id="s1596">And we left, and we walked and walked and walked, I don’t remember how long, to Elba river -- river, there was the -- the frontier of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: -- at the time and we -- I think that we walked about four days.</span> <span id="s1599">I don’t know how many kilometers it was, I had to look at the map, still couldn’t figure out how long it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: It was a long walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: I-It was a long one.</span> <span id="s1602">We -- we just took, you know, break for the night and it -- everything was empty and things were trashed out because I think the Russians already took care of the -- of the better things and left it there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1603">There were chicken wandering around, but no sign of -- of Germans, who used to live there.</span> <span id="s1604">So we came to Elba river, and there on one side were the Russians, on the other side were -- were Americans.</span> <span id="s1605">And the Russians read what the Belgians gave them, whatever they had and -- and they just said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: To go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: To go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: So we went to Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: And I think we need to stop the tape, it’s almost --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1612">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: A lot of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1618">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: It wasn’t before so -- that so strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: The light?</span> <span id="s1623">The light feels stronger to you?</span> <span id="s1624">It’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Right now, I don’t know, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: It’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Probably sitting too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1629">When you left the camp and escaped --</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Uh-huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: -- how did you know where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Well, we’re going to Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: I’m sorry, we have to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1634">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: See, we -- we ge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: So how did you -- what do you mean you knew where you were going?</span> <span id="s1637">You lo -- you leave a ca -- this -- this camp, and you knew what direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yeah, we had a map, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Oh, you had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: -- that’s what I was wondering, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1643">Yeah, the Belgians, they had a map, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1645">And the Belgians, when they showed the papers to the Russians, what was on these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: They didn’t know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Russians didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: They didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: No.</span> <span id="s1651">Is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: They just said go, they didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: So you were pleased.</span> <span id="s1655">You went to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Yeah, we were supposed to be French or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Yeah, it’s [indecipherable] and they were impressed by that, so -- and they didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1660">And you didn't want to go back to Poland, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Why didn’t you want to go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Well, it was Communism, Stalin.</span> <span id="s1664">And for Stefan nothing to do there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: We found out in -- in meantime, you know, we were in Germany, and some colleagues came to Berlin and Stefan went there and -- and talked to them and they said oh, you should come, Stefan, you should come back, it’s a lot of work, it’s wonderful and so on.</span> <span id="s1667">And when they -- they left for a minute, they -- the wife of one of them said, Stefan, don’t come back.</span> <span id="s1668">So, we knew.</span> <span id="s1669">We knew what is coming, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1671">So, you’re at Northeim, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: And what is that -- what is that like?</span> <span id="s1674">That’s in the American zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: They -- that’s in a -- yeah, that was in American zone.</span> <span id="s1676">It was a town, I don’t know -- don’t remember what it looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: And where were you staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: I was staying in a -- a -- a kind of a camp which sorted out people, you know, where they go, what -- what they want to do, or advertise in the papers.</span> <span id="s1679">There were certain paper -- papers which were names of people who -- who are looking for someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: And that -- that’s -- that was the way they found each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: Is that how Stefan found you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: So he knew to come because he had seen this list?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: You see, the -- the a -- they had -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: So when did you really feel liberated, do you think?</span></p> <p><span

but it was a hard life after war.</span> <span id="s1875">Everything was ra-rationed.</span> <span id="s1876">I remember eggs were coming from -- from Poland and they were not e-eatable.</span> <span id="s1877">And you get just only so much meat a -- a month, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1878">And we went -- when we were living in England -- oh, we bought a house, and we were renting

were talking about this, survivors, and they were talking about opening the camps, which were -- but i-it was just news, and that’s all.</span> <span id="s1894">There was no -- no larger insight of what really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Did people ask you what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span

think it’s important that people know what people like you went through, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Well, probably is, but you know, I’m not the only one who is open to tin -- t-telling.</span> <span id="s1912">My Polish friends don’t know much about it, they -- they know that I am Jewish, but that’s all.</span> <span id="s1913">They -- I don’t think they want to listen to that.</span> <span id="s1914">And I don’t want to talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: [indecipherable] talk about, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: -- which is just wonderful.</span></p>

Novak very well, and I think they -- they just guess it, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: So, when you were with these folks, you never talked about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: About the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: About the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Well, they know everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: They know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: They know, sure.</span> <span id="s1932">Not about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Not about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Yeah.</span> <span
