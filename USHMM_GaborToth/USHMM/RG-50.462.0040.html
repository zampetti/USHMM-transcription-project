interview with Mrs. Renee Hartz, H-A-R-T-Z.</span> <span id="s3">This is February 28th, 1982, Nora Levin interviewing.</span> <span id="s4">Mrs. Hartz, can you tell me a little about the background of your parents, where they were born, and something about their life before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">RH: They were born right near Mainz.</span> <span id="s6">My mother came from Ingelheim, where the big Bayer aspirin fac-, pharmaceutical firms were, and my father came from a very small town called Hechsteim, also near Mainz.</span> <span id="s7">And his father was a cattle dealer, whole-, you know, wholesale cattle.</span> <span id="s8">And my mother’s father was in textiles, wholesale textiles, and he also had a retail store.</span> <span id="s9">My mother’s family was very well-to-do.</span> <span id="s10">And when they married, my father joined, you know, my grandfather’s, my mother’s father’s business.</span> <span id="s11">And they were quite well off, you know, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">NL: So they had a fairly comfortable life.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">RH: They had a very comfortable life.</span> <span id="s14">My mother’s family apparently had lived there for many, many generations.</span> <span id="s15">They had traced the family as far back, I think, as the 16th Century.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">NL: Would you be good enough to spell the name of the town where she came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">RH: Yes, Ingelheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NL: Oh, Ingelheim, yes, that I know.</span> <span id="s19">And your father’s town?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">RH: H-E-C-H-S-T-E-I-M.</span> <span id="s21">It’s in the Rhineland.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">NL: In the Rhineland.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">NL: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">RH: Not far from Frankfurt, on the Main River.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">NL: And their relations with non-Jewish Germans apparently were good?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">RH: Were very, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">NL: Were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">RH: Very, very good.</span> <span id="s30">As I said, you know, we were always very, very comfortable and they traded with them and they were treated with the highest regard and respected members of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">NL: Were there fairly large Jewish communities in either of these towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">RH: Yes, I bel-, well, I don’t know about Hechsteim because it’s so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NL: But Ingelheim...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">RH: But Ingelheim...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NL: Had a fairly substantial Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">RH: And so did Mainz, which was...</span></p> <p><span id="s37">NL: Mainz of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">RH: Very close, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">NL: And have they told you, did they tell you in the past about the coming dangers, the tremors of the pre-Hitler or early Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">RH: Yes, what they had told me is that at the very beginning, it was a very strange situation.</span> <span id="s41">They saw the Poles and the Russians come—this was before Hitler, you know, who came through Germany because they were persecuted in their countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">NL: This is the early ‘30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">RH: Maybe even earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">NL: Late ‘20s.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">RH: They remember when they, you know, when they were little.</span> <span id="s46">And they said—that’s how well-treated they were in Germany—they said, “These Jews must have done something wrong for being chased out of Poland or Russia.”</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">RH: And they actually, you know, didn’t feel all that sorry for them.</span> <span id="s49">That’s the irony, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">NL: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s51">They didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">RH: Of that whole era.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NL: Understand that they’d been persecuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">RH: That’s how well-accepted and well-entrenched they were in the community, that they couldn’t believe that right, you know, in the country next to them...</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NL: It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">RH: Yes, the...Poles and the Russians, you know, came and, you know, that that kind of [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">NL: Did that, did their coming disturb relations between themselves and the non-Jewish population?</span> <span id="s58">In other words, were they identified as...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">RH: I must add that in that area of Germany it was predominantly Catholic.</span> <span id="s60">And a lot of them were not Nazis, had not even joined the Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s62">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">RH: A majority of them did not.</span> <span id="s64">So it was a very unusual situation.</span> <span id="s65">In fact my mother’s brother, who was I guess very young at the time was almost, you know, enthralled with Hitler at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s66">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s69">To that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">NL: We’ll come to that of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NL: That’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">RH: So, which of course my father, this is why they left for Palestine.</span> <span id="s74">But my uncle then later, he’s the one who went to the Saar and eventually was able to save us all.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">NL: And what were some of the early signals that your parents perhaps shared with you of the coming difficulties with the rise of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">RH: Well, I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">NL: Was their business affected let’s say between ‘33 and ‘36?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">RH: They never mentioned that the business was affected but obviously, you know, the discrimination was there.</span> <span id="s79">And they had family in the larger cities, you know, whose businesses were being more affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">NL: Were being affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">RH: Even though because they were in a small village and were so well-accepted.</span> <span id="s82">You know, they weren’t personally affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">NL: They weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">RH: But all around them and everything that was happening, you know, after Hitler came to power, did scare them, so that they applied to leave even, and this is why I think my father is a survivor of sorts.</span> <span id="s85">Because his family laughed at him when he actually, you know, wanted...</span></p> <p><span id="s86">NL: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">RH: To go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s88">And they said, “Well, they’re not going to do anything to us here, you know, in Ingelheim.”</span> <span id="s89">You know, “All our friends, all our Gentile friends are never going to let this happen.</span> <span id="s90">You know, in the big city where people are so indifferent and don’t care about each other, that’s another situation.</span> <span id="s91">But you’re crazy to leave.”</span> <span id="s92">And they did leave a very comfortable life for what was then in Palestine a very rough life.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">NL: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s94">Very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s95">Meager.</span> <span id="s96">And they made this decision in ‘36 or they were thinking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">RH: Well if they left in ‘36 they must have made the decision as early as ‘34, ‘35.</span> <span id="s98">I understand it took quite some time to get the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">NL: And they were the only Jewish family from that area who made that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">RH: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">NL: Was your father, or were your parents very sophisticated politically, do you suppose, Renee?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">RH: Politically?</span> <span id="s103">No, I don’t think politically.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">NL: Because it’s extraordinary that they were alone in that determination.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">RH: But, yes, my father said, you know, “We’re not going to make it if we stay here,” and he was trying to convince his brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s106">He was one of five.</span> <span id="s107">And his parents.</span> <span id="s108">His father had died just before the war.</span> <span id="s109">He had diabetes and he died of natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">NL: But his mother was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">NL: And the rest of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">RH: And he said, you know, “Come with us,” or even once they were in Palestine they wrote and said, “It’s very hard here but at least we have a chance to survive.”</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NL: And Mother’s family also remained in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">NL: Sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">RH: She had one sister, and the brother in the Saar.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">NL: The brother in the Saar.</span> <span id="s119">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s120">RH: I have to go back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">NL: Yes, now, yes, tell us about his situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">RH: He married the...</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NL: What is his name, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">RH: Oscar Nussbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NL: Oscar Nussbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">RH: N-U-S-S-, which is my mother’s maiden name.</span> <span id="s127">I think he started to work there as a very young man.</span> <span id="s128">He must have been 18 when he went to the Saar.</span> <span id="s129">And for some reason he had, when the war broke out, that status, which was equivalent to French status.</span> <span id="s130">Now I don’t know if he was naturalized.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">NL: The war meaning WWI?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">RH: WWII.</span> <span id="s133">WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">NL: WWII.</span> <span id="s135">Wasn’t it under the League of Nations’ control?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s137">But apparently when WWII broke out it was not considered German.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">RH: And he was, all the citizens, all the people who had worked there or had work permits, I’m not sure, I don’t think he was naturalized, because that’s right, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s140">NL: Just automatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">RH: It was, automatically he was considered French, and therefore enjoyed the privileges that French Jews enjoyed, which was a lot better than German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s143">Of course.</span> <span id="s144">And so he too urged the family to leave Germany in the early days.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">RH: Yes, he tried to come, well in the early ‘30s, no, not really.</span> <span id="s146">You know, he was just working there and he never thought either that, you know, what would actually happen.</span> <span id="s147">It’s just that my father was trying to convince my mother’s parents to go to Palestine, frankly, not to stay in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">NL: Not to stay in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">NL: So, was he a Zionist, do you suppose, Renee?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">RH: They were not Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">NL: They were not Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">RH: No.</span> <span id="s156">And in fact, that’s why they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s157">You know, to them...</span></p> <p><span id="s158">NL: They didn’t have that national motivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">RH: No, they didn’t have the idealism necessary to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">NL: But why Palestine?</span> <span id="s161">Why didn’t they try to get to, say, America?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">RH: They did try.</span> <span id="s163">Not that early, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">RH: Once they decided that Palestine was not for them, they did try to, but it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NL: But in ‘36?</span> <span id="s167">Obviously Palestine seemed the best hope, even though they were not Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">RH: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">NL: Did they know any folks there?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">RH: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">NL: They, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">RH: My father had, and that’s the family I visited and who really told me the history of my father’s family because my father can’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s173">The little bit I know about his family I found out through those relatives in Pal-, in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">RH: He had about six or seven cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">RH: And there, and then his mother’s brother had...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">NL: They were early pioneers.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">RH: Moved, yes, they were early pioneers.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">RH: I mean the children were early pioneers and then they had the parents come.</span> <span id="s182">That was my father’s aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">NL: And so they urged him.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">RH: They urged him to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">NL: So that was part of the motivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">RH: And yes, that’s how, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s188">So they left in ‘36 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">RH: In ‘36, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">NL: And went straight to Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">And so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">NL: What did Father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">RH: He drove a truck, even though, you know, he was a business man eventually.</span> <span id="s195">But in Israel, of course.</span> <span id="s196">I think at first he said that he, the very first few months he sold bread on, with a, he bought a donkey or hired a donkey, I don’t know which way then, and just sold bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">NL: He just sold bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">RH: He just sold bread.</span> <span id="s199">He was just a vendor, a street vendor.</span> <span id="s200">Then he worked in a quarry, you know, and that was very hard work.</span> <span id="s201">He never had done any physical work.</span> <span id="s202">And then he drove a truck.</span> <span id="s203">You know, I guess working in the quarry led to driving a truck and carrying these stones back.</span> <span id="s204">And that’s what he did in Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s206">RH: And that’s what was available at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">NL: That was what was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">NL: And Mother, of course, was busy at home and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s210">RH: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">NL: Had...</span></p> <p><span id="s212">RH: And then became pregnant.</span> <span id="s213">And I was a twin and of course there were a lot of uprisings at the time in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">NL: The anti-Arab...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">RH: With the Arabs, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">NL: The anti-Jewish riots.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">RH: Riots.</span> <span id="s218">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">RH: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">NL: And was Haifa affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">RH: Yes, apparently so.</span> <span id="s223">They had to come...</span></p> <p><span id="s224">NL: And they went from the frying pan into the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">RH: Well not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">NL: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">RH: They did that afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">NL: They didn’t anticipate these Arab-Jewish difficulties, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">RH: No.</span> <span id="s230">No.</span> <span id="s231">I..</span> <span id="s232">.</span> <span id="s233">guess in reading about it they did start around ‘3-, well, it was always going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">NL: In the ‘20s too.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">RH: But there were some pretty severe uprisings and, just around that time, ‘36, ‘37, ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">NL: And you and your brother were born in ‘37?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">RH: I’m an only child.</span> <span id="s238">I was born in late ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">NL: But you were a twin?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">RH: I was a twin but my twin, that’s what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s241">My mother had a very difficult pregnancy and the twin died...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">NL: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s243">RH: When,...she was a girl, when she was four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">NL: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">RH: So, but the pregnancy was so difficult and, you know, they were anticipating twins, they were looking forward to it, and the loss of that other child was just too much for her.</span> <span id="s246">She said, “I can’t stay here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s247">NL: So you stayed there...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">RH: “I can’t...”</span></p> <p><span id="s249">NL: Until you were four?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">RH: No, no.</span> <span id="s251">I was less than a year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">NL: When you left Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">I was born in late ‘37 and they left late summer, ‘38, like September, ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">NL: And where did they go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">RH: That’s when they went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NL: To France.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s259">That’s when they went to Paris.</span> <span id="s260">So my uncle from the Saar by then had moved to Paris and was able to become a partner in a rainwear manufacturing firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">RH: And we...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NL: You had some relatives?</span> <span id="s264">Your parents had, well, it was your uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s265">RH: That was...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">NL: That was the anchor.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">RH: Yes, yes, he was the anchor.</span> <span id="s268">And then his wife was from the French-German border, French-German-Swiss border near Basil.</span> <span id="s269">So, you know, she was essentially, I think she was Swiss at the time, a Swiss citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">NL: And how was their life in Paris in ‘39, let’s see, ‘38?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">RH: So we arrived in ‘38, and I think my uncle gave my father some odd jobs, you know, at the rainwear factory.</span> <span id="s272">So he was able to find a job and to provide the minimum I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">NL: And life there was not so hard as it had been in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">RH: Not at the beginning.</span> <span id="s275">Well, no, not before the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s276">NL: Not before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">RH: War broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s279">Do you have any memories of...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">RH: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">NL: Paris at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">RH: I was only a year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NL: One, two.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">NL: And did your parents, have your parents told you about their experiences up to, let’s say, June of ‘40, just, it was comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">RH: Well, no, up until, no, no, the minute the war broke out, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">NL: But up until June of ‘40 they lived relatively safely?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">RH: No, no.</span> <span id="s291">When the war broke out, apparently, and that’s something my uncle couldn’t help...</span></p> <p><span id="s292">NL: You mean in September of ‘39?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">RH: In September ‘39...</span></p> <p><span id="s294">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">RH: They were sent into a camp in Colombes, in the stadium where all the non-French were taken.</span> <span id="s296">Now, I’m not sure if that was the beginning, but they always told me, “When the war broke out.”</span></p> <p><span id="s297">NL: So that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s298">RH: So it might have been closer to June.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">NL: The war against Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">RH: ‘40, after France fell, I’m pretty sure.</span> <span id="s301">They always tell me, “When the war broke out.”</span> <span id="s302">But it could have been, like you say, in June, 1940, after France fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">NL: And they weren’t able to get French citizenship then?</span></p> <p><span

the Germans.</span> <span id="s307">They left Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">NL: They left Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">NL: And where did they go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">RH: And they first went to Normandy and then to southern France, but again, the underground helped them, you know, the French underground helped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">NL: And your parents really, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">NL: So, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">RH: And after that they were thrown into this stadium with all aliens.</span> <span id="s316">And of course I doubt, I’m pretty, they’re pretty sure that a lot of Jews were sent to concentration camp that early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">NL: This was in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">RH: In Colombes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">NL: Oh, Colombes.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">RH: Stade Colombes, which is a tremendous stadium, sports stadium.</span> <span id="s321">And that’s where they gathered all the...</span></p> <p><span id="s322">NL: And this was in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">RH: In Paris, well, right outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s324">They put them all in a big stadium there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">NL: This was not the Velodrome d’Hiver?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">NL: Something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">RH: No, no, that’s a ways.</span> <span id="s329">That was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">NL: That’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s331">RH: This was not just Jews.</span> <span id="s332">All aliens were sent to this stadium and were processed.</span> <span id="s333">Now in that camp or whatever you want to call it, my father found out that he could join the French Foreign Legion and you know, wouldn’t be shipped off if he did that.</span> <span id="s334">So he did that.</span> <span id="s335">And my mother, apparently they had some money with them, and they tipped off somebody to get her out of there, and joined my aunt in Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s337">[someone enters] Good morning, how are you?</span> <span id="s338">Nice to see you.</span> <span id="s339">[talking] Excuse us for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s340">[Interview continues.]</span> <span id="s341">And did you hear from Father from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">RH: Well, my mother said she really didn’t until just before he came back from the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s343">No, she didn’t hear from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s345">RH: So she joined my aunt in Normandy.</span> <span id="s346">You know, she knew that they had gone there...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">NL: To a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">RH: To a farm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">NL: And, a farm operated by non-Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">NL: Who were helping to hide Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">NL: And do you have any memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">RH: Thinking they were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">NL: Thinking they were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">RH: Right, don’t forget that my uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">RH: You know, from the Saar...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">NL: Saar.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">RH: That had the French status.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">NL: Arranged this.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s364">And do you have any memory of that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">NL: You were...</span></p> <p><span id="s367">RH: Then they went, we all went south.</span> <span id="s368">You know, in the Free Zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">NL: How long did you stay in the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">RH: I think in Normandy, from what I understand, not very long.</span> <span id="s371">Less than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">NL: And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">RH: It was near Alençon.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">RH: And again, that’s my aunt’s family now.</span> <span id="s376">My aunt, you know, being Swiss and French had a lot of relatives in France.</span> <span id="s377">So she had a cousin in Alençon and she arranged, you know, for them to live in this farm because they were friends of theirs.</span> <span id="s378">It’s as simple as that.</span> <span id="s379">But they knew they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">NL: They did know.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">RH: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s382">No question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NL: And apparently this was being done by other foreigners for other Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">RH: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">NL: And then in what, do you suppose, it was ‘41...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">NL: That they went south...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">RH: Right, they went south.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">NL: To the so-called Free Zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">RH: Because that was the Free Zone.</span> <span id="s391">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">NL: And where, where did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s393">RH: Right near Albi.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">NL: Albi.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">RH: Actually I’m jumping ahead a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">NL: Do you want go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s399">RH: There was first Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">NL: To Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">RH: That was their first.</span> <span id="s402">And again, I think by then they had no family in Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">NL: Mother was there alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">RH: She was there with my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">NL: With your aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">RH: And again, it’s through connections, you know, that they knew they could stay and they provided.</span> <span id="s407">And I’m pretty sure this was part of the resistance network.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">NL: And where was your uncle at this point, was he in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">RH: In, no, no, no, my uncle, when I say my aunt I should say my aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">NL: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">RH: They were never separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">NL: They were never separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: But your uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s415">RH: He had, he had...</span></p> <p><span id="s416">NL: And had connections with the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s418">And he had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">NL: And money.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">RH: And the business was in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: Which was of course essential.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">RH: I just have to tell you another story about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">RH: What happened when Germany occupied?</span> <span id="s425">They took over the business.</span> <span id="s426">And they knew they were Jewish, but they were too honest.</span> <span id="s427">The other man’s name was Rothschild.</span> <span id="s428">Not the famous...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">NL: The great.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">RH: Rothschild, but his name happened to be Rothschild.</span> <span id="s431">And he said, “If you manufacture raincoats for us, for the German Army, we will not touch you.</span> <span id="s432">You will be [unclear].”</span> <span id="s433">And my uncle said, “I will have nothing to do with it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s434">NL: But imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">RH: [unclear] money.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">NL: It was a possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">RH: Well his partner did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">NL: His partner did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">RH: And you know what happened to him?</span> <span id="s440">The French shot him the day after liberation, right on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">NL: This I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">RH: So my uncle is now a very wealthy man because he took over the business after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">NL: Ah, he was able to recover it.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">RH: Oh yes, mmm hmm, and did extremely well.</span> <span id="s445">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s446">NL: There’s some vindication sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">RH: But, yes, but he was able to take out apparently some money before the Germans took it over.</span> <span id="s448">And so he had, during the war, a sum of money that he could, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NL: Dispose of.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">RH: Buy, bribe, and dispose of, which was a tremendous help to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">NL: Of course.</span> <span id="s452">Do you have any memories of the south of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s454">But now, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">NL: You were then about...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">RH: Toulouse I, I was four.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">NL: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s459">And I do remember Toulouse.</span> <span id="s460">We had a very, one room apartment.</span> <span id="s461">[tape off then on] We came to, you know, jardin d’enfants, kindergarten.</span> <span id="s462">And of course...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">NL: You were saying in Toulouse you went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">RH: Yes, I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">NL: And were there other Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">RH: In Toulouse proper?</span> <span id="s467">I know my father’s brother’s family also came down.</span> <span id="s468">And again, through my mother’s brother, you know, he was instrumental in getting them down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">NL: And then from Toulouse you went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s470">RH: Then we went into, then my father came back when...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">RH: He could only serve two years.</span> <span id="s473">So in ‘42, when all of France became occupied, he returned.</span> <span id="s474">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NL: Where had he been?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">RH: In Marakesh and Fez, in Morocco.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">NL: And how did...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">RH: He still talks about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">NL: He does?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">RH: They were the best years of his life.</span> <span id="s481">I mean, funny, you know.</span> <span id="s482">The thing is, he’s a very little man...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NL: He was not at all, he was not in danger, apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">RH: No, he didn’t feel like he was.</span> <span id="s485">He was, they were well treated and that’s where his lifetime friends came from afterwards.</span> <span id="s486">I mean there were many, many Jews, you know, in the Foreign Legion at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">NL: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">RH: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">NL: They more or less...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">RH: They each had a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">NL: Saved themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">RH: And they still tease about, yes.</span> <span id="s493">They saved themselves, that’s right.</span> <span id="s494">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">NL: What is this number, an identification?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">RH: Yes, they each had a number, but what I mean is, you know, they still tease each other about the number when they get together.</span> <span id="s497">And there were many things, and they have very fond memories of that period.</span> <span id="s498">They did crazy things, naturally.</span> <span id="s499">It was tough in the hot desert and all, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">NL: There was a camaraderie.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">RH: There was a real camaraderie, and especially with their superiors.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">NL: They were French...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">RH: They played cards together, oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">NL: And there were good relations.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">RH: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">NL: How did he find your family, since Mother had...</span></p> <p><span id="s507">RH: Well, apparently they were able to get in touch somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">NL: Some communication was possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">RH: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">NL: And then from Toulouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">RH: I think once my mother was in Toulouse, since it was a free zone.</span> <span id="s512">I think that’s when communication became possible, Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">NL: And you were saying before that you did have some playmates, Jewish playmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s515">In Toulouse, you mean, very early on?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">RH: No, I don’t recall then.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">NL: But later?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">RH: I remember going to school.</span> <span id="s520">I don’t remember having Jewish playmates, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NL: What was your impression of the school, Renee?</span> <span id="s522">Was it a happy time?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">RH: Yes, it really, you know, life was almost normal.</span> <span id="s524">And you know, I was little and we were told about Pétain.</span> <span id="s525">We were being indoctrinated, you know.</span> <span id="s526">Because the government, we under-, as little as we were.</span> <span id="s527">So when Pétain came to Toulouse, I absolutely insisted and wanted to see him.</span> <span id="s528">And my father had just returned from the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s529">And that I remember.</span> <span id="s530">He carried me on his shoulder so I could see Pétain parade through the streets of Toulouse.</span> <span id="s531">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s532">NL: Did the teacher know you were a Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">RH: And my name is not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">NL: So you didn’t feel the brunt of any of the Vichy anti-Jewish measures?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">NL: And then from Toulouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">RH: Well, and then, of course, after ‘42...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">NL: After ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">RH: We were told, my parents were told, “It’s much too dangerous to stay in a big city.</span> <span id="s542">And again through the network we were sent to a very small town, into, and that’s when the hiding period began.</span> <span id="s543">We went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">NL: What was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">RH: It was called Saint Juéry.</span> <span id="s546">It was really called Arthes, it was so small.</span> <span id="s547">A-R-, right near Saint Juér-, A-R-T-H-E-S, near Saint Juéry.</span> <span id="s548">E-S, near Saint Juéry, which was near Albi really, Saint Juéry, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">NL: And what were your memories of Arthes?</span> <span id="s550">[pronounced “Art”]</span></p> <p><span id="s551">RH: Arthes [pronounced “Ar-tez”]</span></p> <p><span id="s552">NL: Arthes.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">RH: Yes, O.K., well we had people, you know, sort of keeping an eye on us.</span> <span id="s554">They knew all about it.</span> <span id="s555">They knew that we were Jewish and they knew that we were hiding.</span> <span id="s556">They didn’t accept the full responsibility because apparently again the Resistance provided for an apartment, you know, an apartment, a one-room thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">NL: Some housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s559">And my father worked at the local factory and I went to school.</span> <span id="s560">And my mother went about her business.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">NL: Your father then had to disguise his identity too, I presume.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">RH: Oh, we had false papers, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">NL: False papers.</span> <span id="s564">And they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s565">RH: All, the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">RH: False names, false identity cards, everything was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s570">And the French helped their own Jewish people that way, giving them false papers.</span> <span id="s571">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s572">NL: So Father worked at the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">RH: So he worked under a false name and then of course there were a lot of bombardments at the time, I guess the Germans against the English, in southern France.</span> <span id="s574">I forget exactly but I think that’s who fought.</span> <span id="s575">And there were constant alerts and you know, we had to run into the fields.</span> <span id="s576">And it was also at a time where they weren’t sure whether they were going to be able to stay in this village and they had to just run from one place to another.</span> <span id="s577">Because that’s when the French police of course was, you know, looking for Jews all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">NL: Yes, they were hounding Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">RH: Right.</span> <span id="s580">And so they decided, or they were told again through, I think that was, again through the resistance, but a lot of religious movements were active and I think that was the Protestant church project, which told us that it would be better for me, you know, being so little, not always being able to [unclear] and I might talk, to put me in a convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NL: Now before we go into that, Renee, do you, did your family have any contact with the Italian police or the Italian Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">RH: Italian?</span> <span id="s583">They never mentioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">NL: Because I understand that even after all of France was occupied, there for about a year until the fall of Mussolini, the Italian police and army, who were in partial control of southern France, helped Jews and kept the Nazis at bay.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">RH: Well, they never mentioned them directly, but I do know, and I do remember people speaking only Italian in the village.</span> <span id="s586">In other words, a lot of the workers, you know, because it’s a very agricultural area, came from Italy, or were originally from Italy.</span> <span id="s587">Now, in a way...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">NL: But you don’t remember any stories...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">RH: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">NL: Of Jews being protected?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">RH: No, no.</span> <span id="s592">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s593">NL: So you must have been in another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">RH: But I do know that there were a lot of Italian-speaking people around us.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">NL: There was a large Italian occupation force there, which shared the occupation of southern France for a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">RH: I see, yes.</span> <span id="s597">And don’t forget, that was an area, and I’m absolutely convinced this is why they held such strong resistance.</span> <span id="s598">That dates back.</span> <span id="s599">That is literally in their cells, to the Albigensians and the Cathars and, you know, and the Inquisition, which, I mean these people had fought the outsider from time immemorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">NL: And they were very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">RH: They were, Yes, overwhelmingly in the resistance.</span> <span id="s602">I know that in our village just about every young man was in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">NL: It’s very valuable information.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s605">Because it’s only after the war that I realized, you know, what the French had done.</span> <span id="s606">We just thought that all French people were the way they treated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">NL: Hardly the facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">RH: Hardly.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">NL: And so, you were saying before that a Protestant group suggested that you go to a convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">RH: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">NL: And you were then...</span></p> <p><span id="s612">RH: And of course all the religious groups I think did work and try to save families.</span> <span id="s613">They did.</span> <span id="s614">And the Catholic Church, I think, did a lot also.</span> <span id="s615">And there was no problem, you know, finding a convent.</span> <span id="s616">And there were a lot of Jewish children in the convent.</span> <span id="s617">In fact it looked almost like a kidnapping.</span> <span id="s618">I mean they were told that my mother should leave me at a certain address, and a sister would come and pick me up.</span> <span id="s619">And that I remember.</span> <span id="s620">Now I don’t know if they told me, I remember that very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">NL: You were left...</span></p> <p><span id="s622">RH: Being left on the street.</span> <span id="s623">I was four-and-a-half, five?</span> <span id="s624">Under five.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">NL: And you were left on a street.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">RH: Well, my mother I guess saw the...</span></p> <p><span id="s627">NL: Nun coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">RH: The nun coming to pick me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">NL: But I mean you must have felt...</span></p> <p><span id="s630">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">NL: Thoroughly abandoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">RH: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s633">Yes.</span> <span id="s634">But she said she would come and see me Sunday, but she never told me that I wouldn’t see them for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">NL: What was the name of the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">RH: It was called Sorèze, S-O-R-È-Z-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s638">NL: This is a continuation of an interview with Mrs. Renée Hartz, side two.</span> <span id="s639">In case we missed the name of the convent, it was S-O-R-R-...</span></p> <p><span id="s640">RH: R-E-Z-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">NL: And it was in what town?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">RH: In Sorèze.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">NL: In Sorèze.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">RH: Convent de Sorèze and at the time they were, oh they couldn’t have been Carmelites because that’s a very strict sect.</span> <span id="s645">I forget, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">NL: But of course a Catholic order.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">RH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">RH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">NL: And you were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">RH: And today’s it’s only for men.</span> <span id="s652">It’s a monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">NL: A monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">NL: And there were, you were saying, a number of Jewish children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">RH: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s657">Well in fact the other French family’s children were there.</span> <span id="s658">Apparently they were all told this would be best, if you have young children.</span> <span id="s659">And then you could save yourself much more easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">NL: And can you describe your feelings at the time, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">RH: Well there they were the worst.</span> <span id="s662">I mean, well, you know, I literally, then I felt that something was terribly wrong.</span> <span id="s663">Because even before I went to the convent I was told never, never to say that I’m Jewish to anybody.</span> <span id="s664">You know, I was really indoctrinated.</span> <span id="s665">We were in a big dorm.</span> <span id="s666">I wouldn’t eat for a few days.</span> <span id="s667">You know, they, and nobody knew that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s668">Only the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s669">I didn’t know it at the time.</span> <span id="s670">I found that out later.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">NL: The nuns themselves didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">RH: The nuns themselves did not know, because the Germans apparently had bombed some convents who were hiding German children, eh, Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">NL: Jewish children.</span> <span id="s674">So only the Mother Superior...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">RH: So only the Mother Superior really knew and arranged that.</span> <span id="s676">And it was a very strict life when you come from, you know, a very warm, a small family life.</span> <span id="s677">Even though it was hectic during the war—we didn’t have much, but at least we had each other.</span> <span id="s678">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">NL: And did you underst-...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">RH: It was an orphanage.</span> <span id="s681">That’s really, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">NL: And you didn’t really understand why you were there, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">RH: I didn’t understand, but I understood enough that something must be terribly wrong for me to be there, and that I may never see my parents again.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">NL: And that Sunday came and your mother didn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">RH: Didn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s688">And so I remember, I just wouldn’t sleep nor eat and you know, and they were very harsh, not knowing why I acted that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">NL: They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">RH: They were told, the other nuns were told that we were orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">RH: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s693">NL: So they...</span></p> <p><span id="s694">RH: They were very harsh.</span> <span id="s695">They just told you, “Well, you don’t have any parents, and that’s why you’re here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s696">NL: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">RH: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">NL: And did you think that was true, or possible, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">RH: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">NL: There was no way of knowing otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">RH: There was no way...</span></p> <p><span id="s702">NL: Were there any...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">RH: Except these other friends.</span> <span id="s704">You know, that was a little reassuring because the parents of these other children were able to come one Sunday a few weeks after...</span></p> <p><span id="s705">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">RH: We had been in the convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">NL: Why do you think your parents couldn’t come?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">RH: Well because they were not French and they really didn’t want to take the risk.</span> <span id="s709">But these people were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">NL: And could they give...</span></p> <p><span id="s711">RH: French Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">NL: Your friend some news about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">RH: And of course they absolutely assured me...</span></p> <p><span id="s714">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">RH: That my parents were fine and they explained, you know, that they were in an area where they had to be very careful and let me know, you know, I was lucky to be there and, but it wasn’t much of a consolation when you’re under six years old.</span> <span id="s716">And then, little by little, you know, I became a devout Catholic.</span> <span id="s717">They taught me how to pray and how to say Mary, you know, all the prayers and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">NL: What was a typical day like, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">RH: Well, we got up very early and went to mass, I guess.</span> <span id="s720">And then we had classes.</span> <span id="s721">It was very strict.</span> <span id="s722">If we didn’t know our lessons they would hit us with a ruler on our fingers.</span> <span id="s723">You had to put out your hand like this and you got hit...but anybody.</span> <span id="s724">I mean it had nothing to do with me or, you know, just being me.</span> <span id="s725">But of course at the beginning since I couldn’t concentrate on anything, I got some pretty bad treatment.</span> <span id="s726">But it worked.</span> <span id="s727">I studied my lessons after that.</span> <span id="s728">I didn’t want to be hit over the hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">NL: And then, after lessons, more?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">RH: And then we had our meals and then we had a..</span> <span id="s731">.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">NL: Did you get enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">RH: Well, I think I didn’t really care.</span> <span id="s734">I guess I had enough.</span> <span id="s735">Because I don’t remember ever being hungry.</span> <span id="s736">I remember not wanting to eat.</span> <span id="s737">I don’t remember being hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">NL: Was there any play time?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">NL: What did they permit you to do, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">RH: Well, you know, it wasn’t a real free time.</span> <span id="s742">Somebody would take over and it was supervised games.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">NL: Supervised games.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s745">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">NL: Was there any, were there any nuns who were especially warm or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">RH: I don’t recall any one in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">NL: Whom you remember as being...</span></p> <p><span id="s749">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">NL: Protective of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NL: Did you have any contact with the Mother Superior?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">RH: No.</span> <span id="s754">No, we just saw her in passing and we were in awe, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">NL: So it was pretty austere.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">RH: Very austere and very strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">NL: And awesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">RH: Very strict.</span> <span id="s759">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">NL: And that lasted for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">RH: About a year, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">NL: With no direct contact from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">RH: Not really, except these people who came every three months, I would say.</span> <span id="s764">They told...</span></p> <p><span id="s765">NL: They couldn’t even bring messages?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">RH: They did bring some cookies and candy.</span> <span id="s767">I don’t recall any written messages, no.</span> <span id="s768">I think my parents were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">NL: They were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s772">RH: Anything in writing, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">NL: What was happening to them?</span> <span id="s774">When you finally met them, did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">RH: Well this is apparently when, you know, the French police was cracking down, you know, on the Jews.</span> <span id="s776">And that’s when they moved from one little place to another.</span> <span id="s777">But in that place in Arthes, even though it was very small, people got to know them, and ended up, you know, really protecting us.</span> <span id="s778">But there were days where, you know, they said they had to run in the fields or run in the latrines in the middle of the night or things like that.</span> <span id="s779">And in fact shortly after I came back, sure enough the police came.</span> <span id="s780">And of course that I remember very vividly because it was shortly after I came back—when I was still so scared and so happy to find them and so scared to lose them—that the police did come, and came to the community, the place where we were hidden, spoke to the lady and I could hear the whole conversation, and wanted to see my father.</span> <span id="s781">They didn’t take children or women.</span> <span id="s782">At least not...</span></p> <p><span id="s783">NL: This is the French police.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">RH: Yes, the French police.</span> <span id="s785">They were only interested in the men.</span> <span id="s786">And, but since, you know, I wasn’t really hiding, I was running around, and they just pushed the woman aside and started interrogating me.</span> <span id="s787">“Where is your father?”</span> <span id="s788">I said, “I haven’t seen him in ages.”</span> <span id="s789">Like that.</span> <span id="s790">“Which way did he go last time you saw him?”</span> <span id="s791">So I showed him a way.</span> <span id="s792">I just made up this direction.</span> <span id="s793">“But it’s so long ago you’ll never find him,” I said.</span> <span id="s794">Here, later, I found out my mother had gone in town shopping.</span> <span id="s795">She knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s796">But apparently the people in the town had found out and one man had a, people didn’t have cars then, had written his bicycle to the factory where my father worked, and told him to quickly get out of there.</span> <span id="s797">And he just ran into a field.</span> <span id="s798">And the wheat was pretty high at the time.</span> <span id="s799">He just hid there until this man told him that he seems to have gone now.</span> <span id="s800">And I could hear one man say to another, “We didn’t get a single one today.</span> <span id="s801">We’re surely gonna get fired.”</span></p> <p><span id="s802">NL: Now, why did you leave the convent after a year?</span> <span id="s803">Do you know what negotiations led to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">RH: The precise?</span> <span id="s805">No, I guess I really don’t know, and when I ask my parents they said well, they thought, you know, that things would get a little better.</span> <span id="s806">And sure enough, you know, a few days after I got back, that’s when the police came.</span> <span id="s807">We just had no way of knowing that they [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s808">NL: So this would be now ‘43, ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">RH: ‘4-, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">NL: This was still a very bad time.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">RH: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">NL: And the whole convent was then emptied out...</span></p> <p><span id="s813">RH: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">NL: When you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">RH: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">RH: It was a regular convent for orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">NL: But I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s819">RH: Only a few...</span></p> <p><span id="s820">NL: Emptied of the Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">RH: It was staggered, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">NL: Staggered.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">RH: Yes, so it wouldn’t be so obvious, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">NL: And how long, then, did you stay with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">RH: Well after that we were not separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">NL: You were not separated at all.</span> <span id="s827">So that...</span></p> <p><span id="s828">RH: Again.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">NL: That convent experience was about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">RH: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">NL: And in ‘44, in addition to this one police effort, were there others that followed?</span> <span id="s832">Do you remember, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">RH: After that, I don’t recall even though my father said they were all around but not in Arthes precisely.</span> <span id="s834">But a lot of people did not make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">NL: Oh yes, the roundups in the south of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s837">And it’s only as I said because we were lucky to get there early enough to get to know the people.</span> <span id="s838">And maybe through the networking or having had that much, so much help, from everyone in the village.</span> <span id="s839">Now those who had just arrived knew, or didn’t speak the language, you know, nobody helped them, and they didn’t make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">NL: And Father was able to go back to the factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s841">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">NL: After that one...</span></p> <p><span id="s843">RH: Well I don’t know if...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">NL: Flight or...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">RH: He stayed out for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">NL: But he, ultimately he regained his work.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s848">Yes.</span> <span id="s849">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">NL: And so this menacing kind of life, then, lasted through ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">RH: Yes, until Paris was liberated, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">NL: You weren’t able to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">NL: You did go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s856">I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">NL: And do you have any other impressions of that time that you would want to tell us about?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">RH: Well as I said, you know, the, by then, of course I was getting older.</span> <span id="s859">And I recall every night the village gathering and talking about the resistance, listening to the BBC, you know, the people who were hiding us.</span> <span id="s860">It was very, very difficult to get food.</span> <span id="s861">Again, we were very lucky because it was the countryside and people were helping us, but up to a point.</span> <span id="s862">They didn’t have much for them.</span> <span id="s863">So my mother had just about sold every piece of linen she owned, every piece of silver she owned, for food.</span> <span id="s864">You know, she, there was a bartering system in the old fashioned way.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">NL: Oh, of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">RH: And they had been kosher before the war.</span> <span id="s867">Of course they were glad to get any piece of meat.</span> <span id="s868">And they haven’t been kosher since.</span> <span id="s869">And you know, and of course it was out of the question.</span> <span id="s870">And one night, literally, we, she said, “I’m sorry, but, you know, that’s all I had.”</span> <span id="s871">She had like one or two slices of bread and it had been I guess very rough.</span> <span id="s872">It was winter time.</span> <span id="s873">They were, you know, very often in the summer and then in the good weather we were able to get the vegetables that the farmers grew in the area.</span> <span id="s874">But you know, we had no refrigerator or no way to store anything.</span> <span id="s875">So that was in the winter time.</span> <span id="s876">So I had, I knew pretty much everybody.</span> <span id="s877">I mean I’m very outgoing.</span> <span id="s878">And so I went to some people and told them that we didn’t have anything to eat, did they have anything.</span> <span id="s879">Well they were so shocked.</span> <span id="s880">And I had a little apron.</span> <span id="s881">And they said, “Of course, open your apron.”</span> <span id="s882">And I said, “And my father likes wine.”</span></p> <p><span id="s883">NL: Oh, my dear!</span></p> <p><span id="s884">RH: She gave me a bottle of wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">NL: Oh, my!</span></p> <p><span id="s886">RH: Well, when I came home with that stuff, my mother was outraged.</span> <span id="s887">She thought I had stolen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">NL: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">RH: So she said, “Where did you get it?”</span> <span id="s890">So anyway, I told her, “This lady,” you know, such and such a street.</span> <span id="s891">So she followed, I said, “I’ll go with you, and you have to return everything and I’ll apologize.”</span> <span id="s892">And this is how we got to know these wonderful people, who from that time on provided us with food and when things were rough, would hide us in their cellar.</span> <span id="s893">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s894">NL: Would you want to give us their name...</span></p> <p><span id="s895">RH: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">NL: Renée, because I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">RH: Yes, Jeanne—I may have a picture—Jeanne et Hennri.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">NL: That’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s899">RH: Jeanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">NL: J-E-A-N-N-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">RH: -N-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">NL: And H-E-N-R-I.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">RH: Yes, double n. Hennri.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">NL: Hennri.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">RH: And I forget their last name.</span> <span id="s906">Isn’t that stupid?</span> <span id="s907">I do forget their last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">RH: I always called them Jeanne et Hennri...</span></p> <p><span id="s910">NL: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s911">RH: Because, well, Fedou, F-E-D-O-U, well, see I became very friendly with their daughters, and, who were then teenagers and one was engaged and became a Fedou.</span> <span id="s912">And that’s who we kept in touch with.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">RH: Now my parents kept in touch with the older people.</span> <span id="s915">They were quite, they were in their 60s then, and probably passed away within ten years after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">NL: But they were the people who really...</span></p> <p><span id="s917">RH: But I kept in touch with the Fedous, oh yes, absolutely, from that time on.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">NL: They were peasants?</span> <span id="s919">Farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">RH: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s921">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">NL: Simple people.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">RH: They just had a very simple, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">NL: Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">RH: Yes, not very devout.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">NL: But good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s928">In fact that also was very helpful when my parents were in hiding, while I was in the convent, when they would hide sometimes in a farm, you know, in a countryside.</span> <span id="s929">When Sunday came around, my father was always worried.</span> <span id="s930">My mother didn’t mind going to church with the women, because the women always went to church.</span> <span id="s931">They just did that.</span> <span id="s932">But my

the Nazis were.</span> <span id="s950">Do you have any explanation for that, Renée, or understanding of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">RH: Well, outside of the obvious historical reason I think there is certainly an antisemitic fiber in the French, you know, which can be traced back...</span></p> <p><span id="s952">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">RH: Very far.</span> <span

which was published up until WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">NL: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">RH: There were a lot of them who were pro-Hitler before the war, and certainly in the

disposed to Jews in the south?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">RH: Well, except the two that came, you know, and that’s so personal and it might be a very isolated case.</span> <span id="s961">Those two seemed to me, you know, in my mind, and in my very young mind, and maybe distorted because of age—being so young and not being able to pass any judgment—but their heart wasn’t in it.</span> <span

a quota than actually being innately ferocious about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">NL: And so this life, this clandestine life, lasted until the liberation of Paris?</span></p> <p><span

Eclaireurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">RH: Oh, I stayed till I was 16.</span> <span id="s1247">And then I joined the WIZO, which is the Hadassah equivalent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">NL: Young women’s society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">RH: You know, youth group.</span> <span id="s1250">Yes, but there was a youth group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">NL: A youth...</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">RH: And that’s where you met young people and they had dances and socials and very close to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">NL: So, it was very easy for you, relatively, to find a Jewish milieu...</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">RH: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">NL: In which you felt at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">RH: And they were my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">NL: And they were your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">RH: As my close friends.</span> <span id="s1259">They were my close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">NL: Now, what interests me is there seems to be a paradox, in that so many non-Jews helped to save you, and the Resistance was so sympathetic and supportive, and yet in the general culture, there was a great deal of antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">NL: This is tape two, side one, continuing our interview with Mrs. Renée Hartz, February 28th, 1982, Nora Levin interviewing.</span> <span id="s1263">You were saying just now that some of your relatives had tried to come to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">NL: During what period, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">RH: I guess when they really became scared, according to my father.</span> <span id="s1267">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">NL: ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">RH: It was probably after Kristallnacht, but apparently some had tried before that and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">NL: Having affidavits, you were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">RH: Well, in our case, we had an uncle in New York, whom I met, you know, 25 years ago, and who had sent an affidavit to my parents in particular, you know, in ’39, in early ’39.</span> <span id="s1272">And the American consulate made it impossible for them to go to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">NL: What happened?</span> <span id="s1274">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">RH: Well I guess they tried to process, you know, the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">NL: He created barriers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">RH: Created barriers, and kept postponing things.</span> <span id="s1278">And, “Come back,” you know, “two weeks from now.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">NL: He was in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">NL: The consul was in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">NL: This was true, I know, of the consulates in Germany.</span> <span id="s1284">I had never heard about the American consul in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1286">But don’t forget, my father was German.</span> <span id="s1287">He was not…</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">NL: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">RH: French.</span> <span id="s1290">So I’m not sure who he went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">NL: It would still then be the German quota that would be applicable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">RH: Yes, it was the German quota.</span> <span id="s1293">He had, it was not the French quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">NL: And so there were obstacles placed in their way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">NL: And they never got the necessary papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">NL: We were speaking before about the seeming paradox of having so much antisemitism in general French society and yet the experience of great help on the part of the French Resistance.</span> <span id="s1299">And you were saying, I think, that a lot depended upon what area one lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">NL: And when you returned to Paris, did your parents move into an all Jewish or generally Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">RH: No.</span> <span id="s1303">There…</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">RH: There was no such thing in Paris.</span> <span id="s1306">You can’t possibly compare it with, you know, American cities, especially after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">NL: Jews were disbursed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">RH: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">NL: Jews were disbursed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">RH: There were very few left and there is a little Jewish quarter, but strictly for the shopping, kosher foods, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">RH: It’s called the Rue des Rosiers.</span> <span id="s1313">But Jews didn’t necessarily cluster in that area to live.</span> <span id="s1314">They came to do their shopping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">NL: So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">RH: And especially the very religious, Orthodox Jews who couldn’t find, you know, anything else in other areas of Paris.</span> <span id="s1317">But Jews always mingled with, you know, with the non-Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">RH: In their living quarters.</span> <span id="s1320">There is no such thing as a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in France, even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">NL: So are you suggesting that if your parents had moved into another area that you might not have felt the sting of antisemitism so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">RH: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">NL: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">RH: What I was saying is we were just fortunate that during the war we were in a small area of southern France…</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">RH: Who didn’t really know the word antisemitism.</span> <span id="s1327">This Hennri whom I mentioned before, and you have to understand that a French peasant is a very educated person.</span> <span id="s1328">You, I don’t think, he’s unlike any other peasant that I have encountered in my lifetime.</span> <span id="s1329">He knew his history from the Lascaux Cave on to, you know, the very latest event.</span> <span id="s1330">He was glued to his radio set, as I said, the BBC.</span> <span id="s1331">Because we didn’t have one and when we listened to the BBC it was at his house.</span> <span id="s1332">Knew absolutely every event, every historical date, you know, and every tiny detail of French history.</span> <span id="s1333">And this is true of every place, even to this day.</span> <span id="s1334">When you go to a farmhouse in France, you see a collection of history books.</span> <span id="s1335">That’s the first thing you see.</span> <span id="s1336">They just, they’re not interested in geography as much.</span> <span id="s1337">But history…</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">NL: How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">RH: I think, you know, primarily, this is their land and has been for a very, very long time.</span> <span id="s1340">They’re very proud of it and very interested in it, and they know it.</span> <span id="s1341">And they make sure that children know it.</span> <span id="s1342">And this is how it has been perpetuated.</span> <span id="s1343">So, they had never encountered in that area, they had read about it.</span> <span id="s1344">They knew the word existed.</span> <span id="s1345">But they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">NL: This is antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">RH: Antisemitism.</span> <span id="s1348">But they actually asked my father, “What exactly is it?</span> <span id="s1349">What does it mean?</span> <span id="s1350">What do they have against the Jews?</span> <span id="s1351">Just because, you know, you’re Jewish?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">NL: That’s extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1353">I mean, what about the church…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">RH: And then they had the longest discussion about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">NL: What about the…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">RH: They’re not very, you have to understand also that the average French peasant is not very religious.</span> <span id="s1357">Like I said, the husband never goes to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">RH: That’s for women.</span> <span id="s1360">That’s women’s stuff.</span> <span id="s1361">Not interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">NL: So they weren’t indoctrinated by the church then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">RH: No, no, not the peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">NL: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">RH: No.</span> <span id="s1366">And also don’t forget that it’s also in that area that the socialists stem from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">NL: I was going to ask, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">RH: Jean Jaures is right near there.</span> <span id="s1369">And you know, Carcassone area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">RH: And as I said, the Albigensians, the Cathars, way back in the 11th Century, had to fight the authorities.</span> <span id="s1372">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">NL: Yes, I remember once reading that many of the French peasants are socialists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">NL: So that it was that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">RH: Right.</span> <span id="s1377">And that area in particular overwhelmingly voted for Mitterand last year, 97%.</span> <span id="s1378">It was in all the papers.</span> <span id="s1379">That is the most majority from the vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">NL: Oh, how fortunate for your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">RH: And as I said, all the prominent socialists stem from this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">NL: And so the family that helped you so much didn’t even know the term, “antisemitism”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">RH: They didn’t even know the term.</span> <span id="s1384">They had, very few Jews really lived in that immediate area.</span> <span id="s1385">Those who did, you know, were the Jews who had lived there all their lives.</span> <span id="s1386">Darius Milhaud’s family is from Montpellier, not very far away, where much worse things went on because it’s a bigger city.</span> <span id="s1387">Like you said, where they really hounded the Jews, in that area.</span> <span id="s1388">But the Jews had lived there literally since the Middle Ages, since, you know, they were so well-accepted under, especially under the Popes of Avignon, where they were quite prosperous.</span> <span id="s1389">And a lot of the Jews descended from those families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">NL: And so to go back now to your growing up time, you went to a lycée.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">RH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">NL: And also experienced some antisemitism there, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">RH: It wasn’t overt.</span> <span id="s1394">It wasn’t, you know, really out in the open.</span> <span id="s1395">But it was definitely there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">NL: Are there such things as quotas of Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">RH: You had teachers who would return papers for instance.</span> <span id="s1398">Quotas?</span> <span id="s1399">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">NL: Yes, in other words, quotas for permissible Jewish enrollment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">RH: Not that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">NL: Not official of course, but do you suppose that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">RH: That I’ve never heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">NL: The number of Jewish students was limited, or restricted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">RH: That I’ve never heard.</span> <span id="s1406">Now after the war that wasn’t hard to do.</span> <span id="s1407">Because how many Jewish children were there left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">NL: Yes, there was such attrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">RH: So, no, I’ve never heard that.</span> <span id="s1410">But some teachers…</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">NL: Returned papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">RH: Returned papers.</span> <span id="s1413">If it was a Jewish child, without comment.</span> <span id="s1414">If it was an obviously gentile and even, or a child with a noble name, with the “de” in the name, she would get either overly complimented, I mean, she would really stop and compliment her.</span> <span id="s1415">This was a girls’ school at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">NL: And it was extended comments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">RH: And it was so obvious…</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">RH: That the girl with the name of Levy or Levi or Kahn or just never even got an acknowledgment that, you know, this paper is well-written or well-done or anything.</span> <span id="s1420">She still got the good grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">NL: But no comments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">RH: But no comments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">NL: And this was generally true…</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">RH: So that’s why I say it wasn’t really out in the open, but this was a small example of the things that would happen.</span> <span id="s1425">And the opposite was true.</span> <span id="s1426">If it was a very poor grade, again, the Jewish child wouldn’t get any reprimand, and the non-Jewish child said, “Now, someone with a name like this who’s a,” oh yeah, “with a French,” you know, “with a, such a famous French name like,” whatever the name was, “cannot possibly accept this poor grade on this paper.”</span> <span id="s1427">And this was in front of the whole classroom.</span> <span id="s1428">So it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">NL: Did you find any…</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">RH: Sort of a reverse humiliation, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">NL: Of course.</span> <span id="s1432">Were there, there were no teachers, were there no teachers, in your experience, who were even-handed, so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">RH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">NL: There were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">RH: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1436">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1437">What I’m saying is there were always one or two no matter where I was, who were obviously antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1438">It didn’t take you long to figure it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">NL: And you gr…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">RH: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1441">A lot were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">NL: A lot of them were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">RH: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s1444">Especially in education in France.</span> <span id="s1445">You know, you always have the fights between the priests and the school teacher.</span> <span id="s1446">That’s a classical theme, even, because it’s so true in literature, in French literature.</span> <span id="s1447">Very amusing books have been written.</span> <span id="s1448">I don’t know if you remember the Don Camillo series, with Fernand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">RH: He was the priest, and you know, because the teacher is so often left leaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">NL: Anti-clerical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">RH: Anti-clerical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">NL: And socialist also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">RH: And leaning to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">NL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">RH: And socialist.</span> <span id="s1459">And it’s not communist.</span> <span id="s1460">And then you have the mayor.</span> <span id="s1461">Oh, the mayor is the communist.</span> <span id="s1462">The teacher is the socialist.</span> <span id="s1463">And it may sound like a stereotype, but this is so true in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">NL: And you stayed at the lycée for three years?</span> <span id="s1465">And so…</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">RH: Oh, longer than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">NL: Longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">RH: Five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">NL: Five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">NL: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">RH: And then I went to the Sorbonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">NL: And then to the Sorbonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">NL: And you studied, you majored there in French literature?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">RH: And then studied, not really.</span> <span id="s1477">Oddly enough I majored in natural science, biochemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1480">I sort of backed into teaching French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">NL: And what were your experiences as a Jew at the Sorbonne?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">RH: Again, as I said before, some professors were known to be antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1483">So, if you didn’t have a Jewish name, you know, fine.</span> <span id="s1484">But they actually flunked some Jewish students.</span> <span id="s1485">Very few.</span> <span id="s1486">But there were those who were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">NL: And again, most of your intimate friends were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1489">Yes.</span> <span id="s1490">By then I, as I said, I’d become very active, you know.</span> <span id="s1491">After the Scouts it was the youth group and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">NL: WIZO.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">RH: And the WIZO, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">NL: And your parents during those years didn’t have any plans to leave France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">NL: They felt rooted there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">NL: And…</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">RH: And quite comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">NL: Comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">RH: And again, thanks to my uncle, my father was able to get into a parallel branch.</span> <span id="s1502">A brother-in-law opened another branch in the rainwear.</span> <span id="s1503">And of course, I don’t know if you’re interested of my parents going back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">NL: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1505">When did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">RH: Well, they had to do it when they heard that they were eligible for reparation money, under Adenauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">NL: Excuse me, but could we just spend a minute on the point we raised before, that is about this, the time that your parents learned that their own families had perished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">RH: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">NL: And then we’ll come to the visit to Germany.</span> <span id="s1510">Was it in the ‘40s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">RH: It was just so, the reaction was so strong to me that in my mind I only remember the reaction.</span> <span id="s1512">I have absolutely no idea whether it was still, I think it was before we moved to Paris.</span> <span id="s1513">I’m pretty sure.</span> <span id="s1514">Maybe you can help me with that, but I guess I forgot to ask.</span> <span id="s1515">I could ask them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">NL: Well I don’t think you want to rake that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">RH: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">NL: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">RH: I try to avoid it.</span> <span id="s1520">But, you know, my father had an idea because he had written to the village and, you know, no Jews were left and by then word was getting around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">NL: Had he or Mother gotten any word from their folks...</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">RH: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">NL: In the late ‘30s, early ‘40’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">RH: Before the war, I believe, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">NL: Some mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1527">And then of course in Palestine and then, and when they were in Paris, yes.</span> <span id="s1528">But during the war, no.</span> <span id="s1529">So that they really don’t know the details of their [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">NL: They could get those details from Yad Vashem, if ever they express any interest.</span> <span id="s1531">And I can give you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1533">Well I was there last summer and just went to the computer which gives you information about the town and I just punched in Mainz, not Ingelheim.</span> <span id="s1534">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">NL: Did you get any information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">RH: Yes, I got a lot of information, but not so much as to how the Jews were arrested during World War II.</span> <span id="s1537">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">NL: Well we’ll, we can talk about that after the tape, Renée.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">NL: And so when did Mother and Father decide to go to Germany?</span> <span id="s1541">Oh, yes, when they heard, you know, that they were entitled to reparations.</span> <span id="s1542">Of course, they had a lot of proof, unlike the Russian and the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1543">They did take a German-Jewish lawyer in Paris and he said the best thing really would be to go back and try to get some of the records from the town house.</span> <span id="s1544">I mean he would do it but, you know, he was very busy and there weren’t that many in Paris.</span> <span id="s1545">I think they were all of a sudden overburdened.</span> <span id="s1546">So, it must have been in the early ‘50s.</span> <span id="s1547">And when they went back to the town, people were overwhelmed with joy.</span> <span id="s1548">They couldn’t have been, you know, better received, even though my father was very bitter.</span> <span id="s1549">And he was invited at the people’s houses.</span> <span id="s1550">You know, people who had been their friends before the war.</span> <span id="s1551">And they gave back, they apparently after the rest of the family was arrested and, of course, I believe they took the possessions and kindly returned them to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">NL: The...</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">RH: You know, they had all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">NL: Livestock?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">RH: Livestock, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">NL: And his property...</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">RH: Yeah, it was scattered throughout the village, but they did...</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">NL: The did make...</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">RH: They did recuperate quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1560">Jewelry...</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">RH: There were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">NL: Some records?</span> <span id="s1564">China?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">RH: Records, objets d’art, you know, we had china.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">NL: And the house was still standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">RH: And the house, yes, in Hechsteim I think it was taken over by some municipal building because my father’s family had, as I said, more or less a sort of farm, a small farm.</span> <span id="s1568">They were in the cattle business.</span> <span id="s1569">And the same with my mother’s house.</span> <span id="s1570">Somebody lived in that house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">NL: And returned it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">RH: I know that they got paid for their house so, you know, they were, they hadn’t taken it over.</span> <span id="s1573">It was assigned to them by the authorities after the war.</span> <span id="s1574">And after long, you know, legal negotiations.</span> <span id="s1575">So that, what I’m saying is, they really weren’t truly, they weren’t Nazis in those towns, even though my parents say, you know, “You all say that, but you know you were Nazis.”</span> <span id="s1576">You know, they’re not ashamed to tell them, that even though you claim you weren’t, you didn’t help us very much.</span> <span id="s1577">But they reluctantly, I think some of them reluctantly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">NL: Cooperated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">RH: Cooperated or were in the army, even though they claim they weren’t.</span> <span id="s1580">My parents don’t believe them all.</span> <span id="s1581">But they certainly were very, very kind to them.</span> <span id="s1582">And to this day they go back once in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">NL: They do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">RH: Since my father had lost his father, you know, before the war, so he has a tomb there.</span> <span id="s1585">And my mother’s father had remarried, so her first mother, her real mother really, the one who perished is her step-mother, I mean the one who was in Theresienstadt is her step-mother.</span> <span id="s1586">Her real mother had died when she was nine, from an infection.</span> <span id="s1587">So, you know, she had a tomb there.</span> <span id="s1588">So they go back and again people are extremely nice.</span> <span id="s1589">These are now, you know, children of, and grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">NL: Grandchildren, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">RH: And they’re always invited at the mayor’s house.</span> <span id="s1592">And you know, and get a very, very warm reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">NL: Did any other Jewish families survive from those towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">RH: Yeah, well, only because they either went to Argentina, survive?</span> <span id="s1595">Not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">NL: Not, not in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">RH: Not the war, not in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">NL: Not in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">RH: And the ones who had left, in Argentina or in the States or Australia or...no.</span> <span id="s1600">Those who had, who stayed in, none of those have still survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">NL: And your coming to America, of course, is connected with your engagement and marriage to Harry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">RH: Right.</span> <span id="s1603">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">NL: Were you married in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">RH: We were married here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">NL: You were married here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1608">This uncle who had sent my father an affidavit before the war, you know, also said, “Any time you want to come,” any one of us, or all three of us; we always had an open invitation.</span> <span id="s1609">So I finally took him up on it and came.</span> <span id="s1610">Because when I came over it was ‘58.</span> <span id="s1611">You still needed an affidavit and a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">NL: You came just for a visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">RH: Yes, I just came for a visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">RH: But you still needed a lot of papers.</span> <span id="s1616">So I took him up on it, and I had met Harry the year before in Paris very briefly.</span> <span id="s1617">And we just saw each other again.</span> <span id="s1618">I really came for, to visit my family in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">RH: And that’s how I saw him again.</span> <span id="s1621">And we became engaged.</span> <span id="s1622">And being an only child, it was a very tough decision.</span> <span id="s1623">Luckily I was very young.</span> <span id="s1624">And maybe, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">NL: That made it possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">RH: A little more adventurous.</span> <span id="s1627">And I just went ahead and did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">NL: Oh, it must have been so hard for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1630">Because the Algerian War was going on in France at the time, and the conditions weren’t the best in France.</span> <span id="s1631">And after everything they went through and now my mother felt maybe it’s not the worst thing to be in the States, you see?</span> <span id="s1632">This I think in their mind helped them, even though it was extremely hard being an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">NL: Another migration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">RH: And that was before the jet age, you know, when boat crossings were cheaper than plane crossings.</span> <span id="s1635">So it was literally half a world away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">NL: But, of course, you see each other...</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">RH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">NL: Quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">RH: Almost every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">NL: Almost every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">RH: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1642">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">NL: Renée, before we end, are there some words you would like to say to the new generation, young people who will be studying the Holocaust, who may be listening to the tape?</span> <span id="s1644">Do you have any thoughts or messages you’d like to convey to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">RH: Well, unfortunately, if you’re Jewish, whether you want to recognize it or not, you will always be earmarked as such.</span> <span id="s1646">[noise; tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">NL: Yes, you were saying whether one is Jewish, whether one thinks about oneself as being Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">RH: Yes, or not, you have to be forever vigilant, because so many Jews in Europe, and especially German and French Jews, were so well-integrated, were not religious, considered themselves, you know, French and German before being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1649">And yet when this event happened, this is, they perished just like, they had to fight and you know, many, many of them of course perished because they were Jewish even though they felt at the time that this was strictly secondary.</span> <span id="s1650">That’s number one.</span> <span id="s1651">And the reason I put that as number one is when I first came over, so many of Harry’s friends said that, “I’m an American first, and I’m a Jew second; therefore, you know, Israel or whatever, and Jewish causes is fine and I’ll support them, and I’ll give them money.”</span> <span id="s1652">But that to me is ludicrous and self-defeating.</span> <span id="s1653">You really have to be extremely vigilant at all times.</span> <span id="s1654">And for that matter, you know, if it happens to the Jews it can ha-, and it happened to the Armenians.</span> <span id="s1655">It can happen to anybody, whoever you are.</span> <span id="s1656">And you must just teach the lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">NL: To accept one’s identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">RH: And accept one’s identity but also be sympathetic to your fellow man, so that an absolute erratic, irrational man, you know, like Hitler, shouldn’t come to power.</span> <span id="s1659">So I have mixed feelings about the Civil Liberties Union.</span> <span id="s1660">I know that today in France, and in Germany, I believe—correct me if I’m wrong—they have outlawed Nazi parties, neo-Nazi parties.</span> <span id="s1661">I mean, they make an exception.</span> <span id="s1662">That’s where democracy stops.</span> <span id="s1663">I mean there are certain things that you just cannot allow to go on.</span> <span id="s1664">And that’s one of them.</span> <span id="s1665">And maybe conditions are different here, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1666">Enough, I think.</span> <span id="s1667">But American history, I do know it intellectually.</span> <span id="s1668">I’m not sure I have a gut feeling about it, like some of you do, that maybe you can allow these things to happen and not have to worry, but I can’t imagine that you do.</span> <span id="s1669">I can’t imagine that you can paint swastikas all over the walls and just say, “Oh, well, it’s just a prank.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">NL: I agree with you wholly.</span> <span id="s1671">I myself have given up my membership in the ACLU some fifteen years back because I couldn’t square that with what I know about recent history.</span> <span id="s1672">Any other thoughts, Renée?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">RH: Well, you know, obviously the children of today are learning this period of history through this wonderful medium, not just through books and films.</span> <span id="s1674">And they’re lucky enough to still have survivors around.</span> <span id="s1675">But they have to make sure that their children in turn will know, because when you know the history of antisemitism, it’s just so scary that you have to make sure that every person must do their utmost not to let it happen again.</span> <span id="s1676">And I would agree with Begin, “Never again,” I hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">NL: Thank you very much, Renée.</span></p> <p><span
