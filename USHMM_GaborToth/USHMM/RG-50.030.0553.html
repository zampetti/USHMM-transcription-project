id="s17">A: Yes, my name is Ellen Kaidanow, that’s my married name, and I was born in 1936, in June s – June 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: And I was born in Poland, which is now the Ukraine, and the name of my city is Dubno, d-u-b-n-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s21">So, how old were you at the time of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: At the time I probably was like seven years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And your family consisted of how many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes, we were a family of five, I had three sisters, I was the middle daughter, and my father was – name was Joseph, or Jossul in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s25">My mother’s name was Esther.</span> <span id="s26">And I had a sister by the name of Pearl.</span> <span id="s27">I was the middle child, my name was Shifra in Yiddish, and then I had a younger sister that was Bella.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you attended a school at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, I never went.</span> <span id="s30">I-I was supposed to – I remember that I was supposed to go that year to school when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s31">So I never actually went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Were your other sisters on –</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: The older sister must have gone to school, but I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: But I’m sure she did, because she was much older.</span> <span id="s36">Like, I was closer to the younger one, you know, and there was probably quite a few difference between the older and myself and my younger sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And how – how many years are there in between your sisters and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I – I don’t know, you know, I’m just sort of imagining that sh – the older one must have been like at least three years older, because I remember her – you know, being that I was little, I thought she was big.</span> <span id="s39">But the truth is, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s40">And the younger sister was wa – not too – too much younger than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Okay, so wh-what do you remember about the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: About the home life I don’t remember too much.</span> <span id="s43">We lived in a very beautiful street by the name of Panienska.</span> <span id="s44">And I know that the fi – people who know anything about Dubno, and if you tell them Panienska street, they know that that was a very beautiful street.</span> <span id="s45">My parents had like a little – I would say they called it a kiosk, like they was having candy and things like that.</span> <span id="s46">So my parents were hardly at home.</span> <span id="s47">But they had one of – a – a – a Christian, actually a Ukrainian woman by the name of Lerna(ph), and she was raising us.</span> <span id="s48">She was really more like my mother – like a mother to me than my own mother, because she was always with the girls, my mother was busy in the store.</span> <span id="s49">So, I loved her very much, and she loved the children.</span> <span id="s50">She was very devoted person to us.</span> <span id="s51">And in fact, she was the one that saved me, at the end.</span> <span id="s52">So, too much about the life before that, I don’t remember too much.</span> <span id="s53">But I do remember when the Germans came in, and I’ll never forget one of my cousins came and they said, you know, you have to leave your home, and we have to all move to a ghetto, which was a Dubno ghetto.</span> <span id="s54">And then wi – all of – the whole family, like my mo – I remember my grandmother was there and my father’s brother also lived there, and they had many children, like at least four or five children.</span> <span id="s55">But I don’t remember, you know, their ages or their names, I hardly remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: So they were all gather at the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: And – and they – we were all in the ghetto, and la –</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s59">Ah – hah – sorry, just have a quick question, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: How did you know that – I mean, you were seven years old, how did you know that this was the Germans?</span> <span id="s62">Did you also see local people involved in gathering Jewish people and taking them to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, to tell you the truth, I didn’t see Germans until I was in the ghetto, and then I did see Germans.</span> <span id="s64">They used to come every once in awhile, they would say – you know, they used to call it an oblava(ph), which means like – you know, they would decide that they would – gonna come into the ghetto, and let’s say, whoever was outside, they would kill.</span> <span id="s65">And I do remember seeing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you recognize them in their uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Uniforms, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s69">Were they a different color than other people?</span> <span id="s70">Was –</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, it was the German uniforms –</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: It was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I remember their hats, it was like a greenish uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: And, you know, people would alert us, so, the Germans are coming, so we used to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So, the ghetto, how many people of your family do you – do you recall more or less?</span> <span id="s79">I mean, a – yo-you just mentioned that you met there your aunts and –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, yes, there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: – cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: – well, I – as I said, I don’t – I know he had a wife, and I know we had cousins, I don’t remember how many and how old they were.</span> <span id="s83">But, you know, I know we lived in the si – all th – all in the same house, you know, in – in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s84">And in the ghetto, I don’t know, I remember playing like outside a little bit with, you know, other kids.</span> <span id="s85">And – and then I also remember that m-my uncle and my father, they made like a hiding place.</span> <span id="s86">They called it a schron, which means like an underground bunker, I would say a bunker.</span> <span id="s87">And whenever there was rumors that the Germans are coming, or that the end was gonna come or whatever, we used to hide in that place.</span> <span id="s88">And once it was over, everybody came out.</span> <span id="s89">So I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And was it only your sisters and you that hid there, or was also the other –</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, e-everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: – cousins, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Okay, so others as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s99">So, what happened afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: What happened afterwards, of course you know the life in the ghetto was a – pretty miserable.</span> <span id="s101">I remember even I – I – I’ll never forget that one day we were outside and the Germans came, and I remember they took like a little kid, and they threw them in the barrel of water, like rainwater, you know, the barrels used to collect rainwater?</span> <span id="s102">And that image stayed with me for a long time.</span> <span id="s103">But what happened is, towards the end, I remembered also again, people came – well, first of all, you know my father was in touch with le -- Lerna(ph), that’s the nanny that I was telling you about.</span> <span id="s104">And what happened was, the ghetto was built by Jews, and they were built by planks, you know, there were planks?</span> <span id="s105">And they like left one plank open, and she used to come and ge – bring us food.</span> <span id="s106">And one time she actually came and said that she wanted to take me, and you know, to save me, and – and – and so on.</span> <span id="s107">And she did take me out of the ghetto, I don’t remember how, but I remember that my father was like crying when I left.</span> <span id="s108">And in the middle of the night, she took me to her place where she lived, not too far away from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Do you know why – why you, and maybe not your younger sister, or your other sister, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s111">I always wondered.</span> <span id="s112">I always wondered.</span> <span id="s113">That’s something that I always, always have in mind, why me, you know?</span> <span id="s114">But I think that what happened, that it was circumstances, because we – yeah, I don’t – I don’t know really why.</span> <span id="s115">But the first time that she took me out, in the middle of the night, I sort of got – got scared, you know, that I’m away from my parents, so I came back by myself, I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How old were you still?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I’m maybe seven years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Seven, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: And I came back and I still remember that at the ghetto gate, they used to have Jewish, I don’t know, I want to call them policemen, but guards, let’s say guards.</span> <span id="s120">And I still remember that one of them said, look at her, she’s coming from the outside and she didn’t bring anything.</span> <span id="s121">Cause all I did was, you know, just come home.</span> <span id="s122">And this Lerna(ph), who was the one that, you know, I was with, woke up in the morning and I was gone, and she was like really panicky.</span> <span id="s123">So she came to the ghetto and she said to my father, I don’t know what happened, I don’t have the child.</span> <span id="s124">And he said, don’t worry, she’s here.</span> <span id="s125">So that’s – I remained in the ghetto with my family, until the very end when they announced an akcja – an akcja mean – meant that they were liquidating the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: This was in – was it years later, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Well, we were occupied in ’41, and this must have been, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s128">To – to tell you the truth, I don’t know exactly whether it was a year or two later.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Whatever the ghetto, you know, that probably could be documented.</span> <span id="s131">But I do remember that somebody came to my father and said, listen, Lerna(ph) is at the gate, you know, because we were all gated in.</span> <span id="s132">It’s not like today’s gated communities, yeah.</span> <span id="s133">And they said, you know, if you have a – a child, just, you know, throw her out, like bring her out.</span> <span id="s134">So I remembered like they picked me up physically and brought me to the gate.</span> <span id="s135">By that time the Germans were already – they were on their way to come to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s136">And she was waiting for me, she took me by the hand like this, and we started walking, just walking.</span> <span id="s137">And I – I don’t know, I was just very pliable, I guess, and this time I just went with her.</span> <span id="s138">And in fact, on the way – on the way, as we were walking, we were caught by the Ukrainian police, and we were taken into a pla – a room, and I remember sitting with her, just like today, like she was sitting and I was sitting.</span> <span id="s139">And the policeman was called away for some reason.</span> <span id="s140">There was a woman scrubbing the floor and she said, what are you sitting here?</span> <span id="s141">Go.</span> <span id="s142">He’s not here, get out of here.</span> <span id="s143">And so she took me again by the hand and she – we walked out of there, which was again a miracle, I guess in Jewish you would say bashert.</span> <span id="s144">And we just walked and walked and walked until we hitchhiked.</span> <span id="s145">We hitchhiked, and she had a brother that lived on a farm, I don’t know how many kilometers away, because I have no idea of things like this.</span> <span id="s146">We came to her brother, and I remember she put me up like in a part where, you know, nobody could see me.</span> <span id="s147">And I was there for maybe a week or so, I don’t know how long either, because I have no – I had no perception of time whatsoever.</span> <span id="s148">And after awhile the brother said to her, listen, you can’t stay here, because if they discover that you have a Jewess here, then you know what’s gonna happen, we’re all gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s149">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Just a quick question again, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, that al –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Was this the house of her brother or were you in – in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s153">Was this a house, a farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: It was a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: It was a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Definitely a farm.</span> <span id="s157">I’m – he lived there, you know, with his wife, I guess, and – and her mother was still alive, I remember that.</span> <span id="s158">You know, an older woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So, were you allowed to go into all the rooms inside the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No, I – I was just like – they used to say, like an apprivichik(ph), I don’t know how to explain it, but they had like a wooden stove, and then on top used to be like warm, you know?</span> <span id="s161">And I remember s – being there, like cooped up, you know, hidden.</span> <span id="s162">And so she said, you know what?</span> <span id="s163">I’ll go back and I’ll see, because you know, she didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s164">So I remember she went away for a day or so, whatever, I don’t know how long it took.</span> <span id="s165">And when she came back she said, I can’t take her back because nobody’s there any more, they’re all killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So she went back to look for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: She went back to the family, to the ghetto, and the ghetto by that time was completely liquidated, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s168">So she came back and then she had another sister that lived also on a farm, but the farm was called the a houtur(ph) which means that it was isolated.</span> <span id="s169">It was like the farm, and then it was nobody all around, you know, not too many people around.</span> <span id="s170">So we stayed with that sister for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s171">And I don’t know what I was doing, I remember going out with the cows, or with the horses and you know, li – she had one son, and it was very good to me.</span> <span id="s172">I would – never had any suffering, I never had – I was never hungry, because on a farm, you know?</span> <span id="s173">And this woman, Lerna(ph) who took me, she was like crazy about me, and I loved her so much, that she was everything to me, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And I was very lucky, because I was beloved by her, so I didn’t feel – I didn’t feel like, you know, like I was trash and something like that.</span> <span id="s176">And I don’t know how long we stayed there.</span> <span id="s177">We stayed there for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s178">And then she had another sister by the name of Anya, and she lived in the city, which was not any more the city of Dubno, but it was called Rovna.</span> <span id="s179">Was Rovna, let’s see, what was it?</span> <span id="s180">No, not Rovna.</span> <span id="s181">I – I have to think of the name.</span> <span id="s182">In Russian it was called Krasnoarmiisk.</span> <span id="s183">But really, it was Radziwiłłów, you know, and th – when the Russians were there because it was constantly Russian, Polish, German, Russian.</span> <span id="s184">So it was Radziwiłłów.</span> <span id="s185">And there we had an apartment, and I lived with Lerna(ph) and her sister Anya.</span> <span id="s186">And in fact, you know, when the Russians came, they – the bombings were there and we were like in a – sort of in a bunker hiding from the bombs, and her sister was hit with the shrapnel in her arm; I was sitting right next to her.</span> <span id="s187">And I remember there was a certain flower on the table, that for years afterwards I couldn’t – cause the mingling with the blood and everything, I couldn’t smell those flowers, you know, like every time I s – had those flowers, I s – like nauseous.</span> <span id="s188">And you know, during the time, I can’t like tell you everything.</span> <span id="s189">The way I went to church, and you know, wearing the cross and I used to play with the kids, and some of the kids said that I’m a – a – a Jewess, you know, and she denied it because she said that I was her child, that’s how I survived, as a child of Lerna(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Were you – were you then raised as a Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes, but at night she used to remind me, because she was so wonderful that I can’t even begin to tell you.</span> <span id="s194">And I didn't want to – I – be – be reminded that I’m Jewish, I really didn’t want to, you know, but at night she kept saying to me, you know, I don’t remember if she talked Jewish to me or something, couple of words, whatever.</span> <span id="s195">But yes, I was running around as a Christian girl.</span> <span id="s196">And – and, you know, so then after the war, when – not – it wasn’t really after the war, it was just a time when our town was liberated.</span> <span id="s197">So I had an uncle, my father’s brother, his wife and their son, they were saved in Russia and they lived in Siberia.</span> <span id="s198">So, they had written to our town, if there’s anybody left from – my maiden name was Leviatin(ph) – Lev -- Leviatin(ph), but you know, you have to s – in English it’s Leviatin(ph).</span> <span id="s199">So she had written to somebody, I don’t know to whom, and they said they think that one child was left.</span> <span id="s200">And on that score, she came all the way from Siberia, and she met me.</span> <span id="s201">I was at that time running like to school, and she met me on the street, and she said, oh my God, you know, I’m – I’m Janyet(ph), her name was Janyet(ph), and – and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: She was their sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: She was my aunt through marriage.</span> <span id="s204">Her husband and my father were brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: And I ran away from her.</span> <span id="s207">I said, I’m not Jewish, I’m a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s208">I’m – I – I’m a devoted – I even remember, because she reminded me.</span> <span id="s209">I didn’t remember that, but she reminded me afterwards that I said, I’m – you know, like an – in Russian I said, I’m a steeron(ph) kryinka(ph), which means that I’m a devoted Ukrainian, and I ran away from her.</span> <span id="s210">But she persisted and she came back and – and she took me back with her.</span> <span id="s211">And Lerna(ph) said the only reason she’s giving me up is because she fi – felt that I would have a better life with them than with her, because they could give me papers and pencils and I could be educated, whereas she hardly had anything.</span> <span id="s212">So, my aunt took me, and she took me back to Siberia, to her.</span> <span id="s213">And I was devastated.</span> <span id="s214">To leave Lerna(ph) was like worse than when I left my parents, because, I mean, she was everything to me.</span> <span id="s215">And – and I stayed with them, and then when the Russians said that, you know, Polish citizens can go back, we all went back to – first to – was, you know a – a trip from Russia almost took a month, I remember.</span> <span id="s216">And we came to Poland, Lódz, and then from there to Czechoslovakia, from Czechoslovakia to Germany, and at that time we were in a DP camp which was called Bad Reichenhall.</span> <span id="s217">And that was in Germany.</span> <span id="s218">And there we stayed for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s219">And then my aunt, for whatever reason, she had a sister in the United States, so she said – you know, there was an orphanage called preen – preenum(ph) kindsai(ph) in Germany.</span> <span id="s220">And she decided to send me and her son, her own son Victor, as my brother to this camp, because she wanted us to come to u – the United States, where she had a sister.</span> <span id="s221">But unbeknownst to us – so we were in that camp for about a year, and finally, you know, our quota came through and I came to the United States on a boat called General Black, with my cousin, who was my bra – you know, like my brother.</span> <span id="s222">And when we got to the United States we discovered that the aunt who was supposed to be like everything to us, prepare a house for us and money and you know, all the things and take us in and blah, blah, blah, but she died away – she died three weeks before we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And – and she – they didn’t want to let us know, you know?</span> <span id="s225">So, they had a daughter by berni – by the name of Bernice, she was sic – all of 16 years old, she was the one that took us, both myself and my cousin, my – Victor.</span> <span id="s226">And they lived in Freeport, Long Island at the time.</span> <span id="s227">Her f – their father was very busy, and it’s funny – irony that he also had the – like a candy store, so he was busy night and day.</span> <span id="s228">And we remained with these – with this cousin, and you know, with all kinds of troubles.</span> <span id="s229">I mean, she liked me, she didn’t like him, he had to go live someplace else.</span> <span id="s230">But eight months later, my – the same aunt, Anya and uncle, my father’s brother, came to the u – finally came to the United States, and we sort of became a family again, whole again, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: With Victor?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: With Victor, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: You remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: And by that time, actually Bernice’s father, by the name of Norman, he got us an apartment in the Bronx, and they registered me to school, to high school.</span> <span id="s237">I don’t know, I – I think I lied about my age, cause my cousin was there, so I wanted to be in the high school too, and I don’t know, they accepted me, don’t ask me how, because I really did not have any education whatsoever.</span> <span id="s238">How I pulled through, I don’t know, but I did graduate high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: You know roughly how old you were at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: When – when I came here to the States, I was like 12 and a half or 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s242">So six years of suffering, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Six years, roughly six years of suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Moving in – from one place to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Oh yeah, right, definitely.</span> <span id="s248">I mean, and you know, I can’t tell you everything.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, like, when I was with Lerna(ph), you know, we – I used to go to funerals.</span> <span id="s250">Now I think back of it, because you know, you don’t think about those things.</span> <span id="s251">I remember going to wakes, you know, because the kids used to have – on a grenade, they would si – go on the grenade at – after the war, even, and blown up and then I used to have like nightmares, you know?</span> <span id="s252">Nothing, so then I – you know, went here to school, in – in the Bronx, Taft High School, I graduated, and right after that I met my husband, we got married.</span> <span id="s253">He was taken into the army after we got married, I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s254">So, my son was like – you know, we got an apartment, I was alone for nine months.</span> <span id="s255">When he came back, my son was nine months old, and he was actually born in an army hospital in – where was it?</span> <span id="s256">On Staten Island, Governor’s Island, you know.</span> <span id="s257">And I – you know, I mean, you can’t tell everything, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: – you can imagine my feelings.</span> <span id="s260">I used to go to the army doctors, and I didn't know anything about children, cause I was never around children, I never knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s261">And I mean, crying like Niagara Falls every single day.</span> <span id="s262">And I don’t know, somehow you survive, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Were you afraid that something would happen to him, when he left to the war?</span> <span id="s264">Or when he was enlisted?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: You – you mean my husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s267">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Well, na – yeah, well what happened was, we tried to postpone his service.</span> <span id="s269">We used to go to congressmen, and to the rabbi and everything to say that, you know, I’m alone and I’m with child and I can’t be without him, but nothing helped.</span> <span id="s270">But the judge delayed it so that he was just away nine months.</span> <span id="s271">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s272">Because by the time they process the papers and everything – he was stationed someplace in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: When he came back, my son was already nine months old.</span> <span id="s275">And I don’t know, slowly but surely, I mean, there’s other things, you know.</span> <span id="s276">When we got married we lived in a one room apartment by other people, and you know, it’s – all these things are – I don’t know how important they are to this conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Everything is important.</span> <span id="s278">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well, you know.</span> <span id="s280">So, I lived with one family, and – and she was very mean to us, so we moved out and we lived with another family, and then finally we got our own apartment.</span> <span id="s281">And the other story is that, miraculously, I found my mother’s sister here in the States.</span> <span id="s282">It’s not that I found her.</span> <span id="s283">I remembered something, that there’s an aunt in the United States, but I did not know her name, I didn’t know – you know, New York, number one.</span> <span id="s284">There was no way for me to find out anything.</span> <span id="s285">But one of our landsmen, who came from our town, it was just this crazy, crazy thing.</span> <span id="s286">He was walking on Pitkin Avenue, and he was looking for somebody else.</span> <span id="s287">So they – he wa – went into a tobacco shop, and he was looking for a Mr. Guyer(ph).</span> <span id="s288">So he went in and he asked him whether he’s related to other Guyers(ph) from – that were in Israel.</span> <span id="s289">So he said no, but then he asked him, where do you come from?</span> <span id="s290">And he said, I come from Dubno.</span> <span id="s291">And he said, you know, I have a niece that comes from Dubno, too.</span> <span id="s292">And the niece turned out to be my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s293">And she came, she really saved my life, because when I was all alone with my son, I didn't know anything about raising the kid.</span> <span id="s294">And she came and she stayed with me, and she helped me, you know, to tell me what to do and, you know, how to feed him and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s295">And you know, from that time on, we – we sort of picked ourselves up.</span> <span id="s296">He came back and he worked in a bakery, then he had this own bakery, and that’s – that’s a – I’d – I think it’s like – more or less, in short, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: A short history.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: An amazing – an amazing story, really.</span> <span id="s300">During your –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Oh, the other thing that I wanted to tell you, which I think is very important, because after our city was liberated, my mother had, you know, given a few things to a Czech woman, because I was like very peculiar, I had to sit in my own seat and I had my own chair and all that, and I wouldn’t eat unless it’s my own spoon.</span> <span id="s302">So, when she – Lerna(ph), the one that saved me, came to this Czech woman, and she wanted to say – to get some things that my mother left with her.</span> <span id="s303">She said, you better get out of here, or I’m gonna say that you have a chi – a – a Jewess with you.</span> <span id="s304">But the only thing that she did give me is the spoon, like a soup spoon, which I have to this day.</span> <span id="s305">And I don’t know if you want to ask me anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s307">I’d like to know if you ever went back to Dubno?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You’ve never been back.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, I never went back, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: And wha – did you ever hear again from Lerna(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: So this – from Le-Lerna(ph)?</span> <span id="s313">Since I married, forever, I’ve been sending her money and packages and we – I have beautiful letters from her, beautiful.</span> <span id="s314">And, you know, I was like – you know, we ourselves were very poor, I couldn’t take her here, so I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s315">But we – I have a lot of correspondence with her, and we helped her as much as possible, and I have pictures of her.</span> <span id="s316">And what happened, she, of course, eventually passed away.</span> <span id="s317">And her sister Anya, with whom I lived towards the end of the war, the one that was hit on the shrapnel, when Lerna(ph) died, I became her surrogate, more or less, you know, sending her things.</span> <span id="s318">And now that she was passed away, I’m – to this day, in fact I have now a package again to send to her daughter.</span> <span id="s319">And the daughter lives in Lviv – Lvov, the u – the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s320">And she just called me the other day, so I’ve always been sending money, packages, and I’ve always been in touch with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I have one last –</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: The only thing that I didn’t do, and I really regret it, I guess maybe it’s not too late, she was a Righteous Gentile and I somehow never went to Yad Vashem to report that.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Well, you can still do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah, I was gonna say that I could still do that.</span> <span id="s327">But, you know, being – we were young, we were s – you know, struggling ourselves, raising the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Under such circumstances, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: And I wasn’t – you know, I wasn’t such a big hero, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s330">Like, I don’t know, we just neglected it, I guess.</span> <span id="s331">But I didn’t neglect her.</span> <span id="s332">I just neglected to, you know, make it – and I never talked about it, now fi – finally we talk about it.</span> <span id="s333">I never talked to my children, I have three children, six grandchildren, and I din – I did not like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s334">But I think now, sort of, I don’t know, it’s amaze – I’m amazed myself that I’m even talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Thank you so much for sharing this with us.</span> <span id="s336">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: You’re welcome.</span></p>
