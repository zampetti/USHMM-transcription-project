side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">GB: ...Bernstein, and I'm here with Malvina Gerlich Eisner, in Philadelphia, at the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, on April the 22nd, 1985.</span> <span id="s3">And I am here to hear the story of Malvina Gerlich Eisner.</span> <span id="s4">Malvina, tell me something about your early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">ME: I was born in a small town, rather a hamlet, called Svidnicka [on northern border of Czechoslovakia, south then east from Krakow, Poland].</span> <span id="s6">Since there was very...</span></p> <p><span id="s7">GB: Where is this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">ME: It is in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s9">It is in Slovakia, Slovakia, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">GB: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">ME: I was born in August, 1924.</span> <span id="s12">Since this little hamlet had only a one-room school house, and my par-, grandparents on my father's side lived in a large town, at the age of six I went to live with my grandparents in order to be able to go to a better public school than was available in our town.</span> <span id="s13">And I used to come only home for holidays and summer vacations.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">GB: Where was this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">ME: The name of the town was Bardjov.</span> <span id="s16">It was a very lovely town, with a nice Jewish population.</span> <span id="s17">Forty percent of the town were Jewish.</span> <span id="s18">It was, there was a spa near this town, and the town itself was an old historic town.</span> <span id="s19">It had a beautiful square with a museum in it, and a beautiful church, a Gothic church, and a park, and it had a moat around it from the wars yet, so they could close the drawbridges when the enemies attacked.</span> <span id="s20">Anyway, that's where I spent most of my childhood years, and lived there most of my life, before concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">GB: Was this school that you attended at your grandparents' town, was it a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">ME: It was a public school, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">GB: Did you have...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">ME: Public school and Junior High School...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">GB: High school?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">ME: That's what I attended there.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">GB: Did you have any Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">ME: Yes.</span> <span id="s29">There was an after, it was called Bes Yaacov, it was at the very beginning when Bes Yaacov developed in Poland, that gradually girls used to get a Jewish education more than before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">GB: They don't usually, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">ME: Yes.</span> <span id="s32">And I did attend an after school Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s33">GB: What...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">ME: Jewish lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">GB: What trade was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">ME: My father, my moth-, my father was from Bardjov, and his name was Moses Gerlich, Moshe Aaron Gerlich.</span> <span id="s37">And he married my mother.</span> <span id="s38">Her name was Rachel Spira.</span> <span id="s39">And she lived in the small town.</span> <span id="s40">And when she got married, she was given the business, and this was so to speak her dowry.</span> <span id="s41">And my father went to live...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">GB: What kind of business was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">ME: It was a grocery store--a general store, which was usually...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">GB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">ME: The Jewish occupation in those days, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">GB: Did your, you had sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">ME: Yes.</span> <span id="s48">I was the second of nine children.</span> <span id="s49">But, of course at that time, I was, when I went to concentration camp I was only seventeen years old, and my youngest sister was three years old.</span> <span id="s50">Nobody returned, because I did not go with them together.</span> <span id="s51">I was at that time when the raids started--in Czechoslovakia they took the girls first--in 1942.</span> <span id="s52">First they took the girls, later on the families.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">GB: You were still, you were still going, up till 1942 you were leading a normal life, going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">ME: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">GB: Tell me what...</span></p> <p><span id="s56">ME: I finished school in 1938.</span> <span id="s57">Then I went home, and I stayed at home about a year or two.</span> <span id="s58">I can't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s59">And then most of the girls used to learn to sew, because sewing was a very important...</span></p> <p><span id="s60">GB: Occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">ME: Not the occupation...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">GB: Craft?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">ME: It was a very important thing to, simply to the survivor, because there were no ready-made things to be gotten in those days.</span> <span id="s64">So everybody had to learn to sew in order to be able to make things for themselves.</span> <span id="s65">It was a very practical thing...</span></p> <p><span id="s66">GB: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s67">ME: Let's put it this way, yes.</span> <span id="s68">And once girls learned to sew, whether they used it or not later on, and some of my friends with whom I went to school also learned to sew at the same time.</span> <span id="s69">That's why I went back to this town where my grandparents lived.</span> <span id="s70">And at that time, I had finished my cour-, my sewing course.</span> <span id="s71">I was beginning to earn money already, by doing some sewing to earn money, because in 1940, or maybe a little bit even before, the Jewish, some of the Jewish businesses were taken away.</span> <span id="s72">And my father lost his business--my father lost his business.</span> <span id="s73">It was taken away from him and given to a Gentile man.</span> <span id="s74">And life was beginning to be very difficult, because we were a large family--regardless large or small--but certainly it was much harder with a larger family.</span> <span id="s75">And I stayed in the city, and I was sewing on consignment for somebody and earning some money.</span> <span id="s76">And during that period, which was 1941, that was in 1941, they were beginning to talk about many Polish--we were living very close to the Polish border--and Polish Jews used to smuggle through the border, to escape what was happening in Poland.</span> <span id="s77">And they used to come to the town where I lived.</span> <span id="s78">And they used to tell these terrible stories, which was very hard to believe, that they were real.</span> <span id="s79">And somehow some people, they were far sighted enough and they, if they had a great deal of information, you know, from other sources, and they did believe it, and they did make some provisions and some did emigrate, especially those who could afford it.</span> <span id="s80">But some rich ones also remained around and did eventually end up in Death camps...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">GB: Did you get any, much information about the war and what, what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">ME: Well, I remember there was one young man who came to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s83">He brought them regards from an uncle, like my grandmother's brother lived in Poland, and he knew them.</span> <span id="s84">And he brought regards, and he told us that he escaped, and the terrible things were happening.</span> <span id="s85">They were taking people to these labor camps, and they were torturing them terribly, and people were dying.</span> <span id="s86">But somehow you felt it was another country.</span> <span id="s87">Perhaps it will not reach here.</span> <span id="s88">And it was just too horrible to think that it might, and people felt rather helpless, and they didn't know how to, how to deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">GB: When did you feel the effects of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">ME: Well, as I said before, life was becoming very hard economically, because it was very hard to make a living, so you struggled very much.</span> <span id="s91">But of course, I was sixteen years old then, so no matter what, I could not feel it as intensely as an adult would, because when you are young, you don't have the understanding and the maturity.</span> <span id="s92">And you just, you just think it cannot happen, because I remember the worst thing that I used to know about that could happen to people was when my parents or grandparents used to talk about the First World War.</span> <span id="s93">And that seemed something very far removed, that happened in the past and cannot happen again.</span> <span id="s94">And, of course, this was much worse, and it was in, in my time.</span> <span id="s95">However, it was hard to relate to it.</span> <span id="s96">And, therefore, we were like, we knew that something bad was happening, but we somehow did not feel it yet, literally, on our skin, you know.</span> <span id="s97">And then, this was in the Spring of '42, they said that they are going to round up the girls.</span> <span id="s98">I don't remember that it was from age thirteen or fourteen, up to twenty or so, just the girls.</span> <span id="s99">And I remember I wanted to go home to be with my family, but my parents wrote to me, "Do not come home, because they will take you immediately."</span> <span id="s100">Because they knew who I was, how old I was, and I was eligible for this transport.</span> <span id="s101">And they said, "You stay where you are."</span> <span id="s102">And sure enough, after Passover in '42, in our town there lived a man by the name of Lurie.</span> <span id="s103">And he was a, an Orthodox man, but he had a great deal of, he had contact with the authorities, and he was a very influential person.</span> <span id="s104">And he accomplished that it was declared that our town had an epidemic, and that's why they cannot deport the girls.</span> <span id="s105">Like, he got a postponement.</span> <span id="s106">So that during that time some of the girls hid, and I also did hide.</span> <span id="s107">There were some, what do you call it, when they went looking from house to house?</span> <span id="s108">I forget...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">GB: Search.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">ME: Searches, yes.</span> <span id="s111">And they found some, and some didn't, they did not find.</span> <span id="s112">And, no, after the epidemic period was passed, that's when they made these searches.</span> <span id="s113">Yes.</span> <span id="s114">And I was hidden with a cousin of mine on our attic, and I remember we heard them searching downstairs, and somehow they did not open that particular door.</span> <span id="s115">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s116">And we did not go with that particular transport, which was about April, or early May, the first transport in '42, yes.</span> <span id="s117">After that there was some reprieve, and then they started to make all kinds of, give out all kinds of rules and verdicts.</span> <span id="s118">So you have to bring in your jewelry.</span> <span id="s119">You have to start preparing yourself, because everybody is going to be resettled in a different area, and start preparing for that, and start packing, and how much you can take, and what you can take.</span> <span id="s120">And all this was happening while I was with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s121">But I could not go home, because, as soon as I would have come home, they would have taken me away.</span> <span id="s122">So they felt, why should I go sooner than I have to, or maybe perhaps I can hide or in some way escape.</span> <span id="s123">Then, before Shavuos--this was happening between Passover and Shavuos--and before Shavuos, I think it was, then it was, became very definite.</span> <span id="s124">There were orders given out, and there were placards all over town.</span> <span id="s125">Everybody should prepare himself, pack their things, and be ready for deportation, for...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">GB: Resettlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">ME: Resettlement, yes.</span> <span id="s128">Did I mention that I had eight, four sisters and four brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">GB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">ME: I would like to...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">GB: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s132">Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">ME: I would like that to be in, in the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">GB: I asked you.</span> <span id="s135">You said you were number...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">ME: I was second child.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">GB: Second child.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">ME: Yes, of nine.</span> <span id="s139">So, actually eight perished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">GB: Eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">ME: Eight of them, yes.</span> <span id="s142">I had a..</span> <span id="s143">.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">GB: There was one...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">ME: I am the only one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">GB: Only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">ME: Only one left.</span> <span id="s148">There were nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">GB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">ME: O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">GB: So you had eight siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">ME: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">GB: Your older...</span></p> <p><span id="s154">ME: My older brother...</span></p> <p><span id="s155">GB: Brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">ME: Did not survive, no.</span> <span id="s157">They all went together to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">GB: I, I wanted to know...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">ME: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">GB: Was your older sibling a boy or girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">ME: A boy.</span> <span id="s162">A boy.</span> <span id="s163">There were four boys and four girls.</span> <span id="s164">I was the fifth girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">GB: [pause] You remained in, with your grandparents...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">ME: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">GB: And you did not return...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">ME: I did not return.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">GB: You were told that you, you had to pack up your belongings...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">ME: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">GB: Because you were gonna be...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">ME: Everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">GB: And how long before you were asked to be resettled?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">ME: That was soon after Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">GB: Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">ME: Yeah, these, these orders came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">GB: And you--and where did they take you?</span> <span id="s178">Did they take you together with your sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">ME: No.</span> <span id="s180">I did...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">GB: Where were the...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">ME: I never did go back, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s183">GB: Oh, your...</span></p> <p><span id="s184">ME: I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">GB: Sisters and brothers remained...</span></p> <p><span id="s186">ME: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">GB: With your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">ME: I never did go back, and I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">GB: The time was 1942 when you remained with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">ME: Yeah, yeah, I mean earlier...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">GB: What about your grandparents...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">ME: Because I had been them...</span></p> <p><span id="s193">GB: Did you go, did you go away with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">ME: No.</span> <span id="s195">I--at that time we started to think, some people were going into hiding, younger people.</span> <span id="s196">And I had a cousin and two male cousins.</span> <span id="s197">And they said they would like to go into the woods to hide.</span> <span id="s198">And they said we should go along.</span> <span id="s199">And everything was so, you do what you want, you know?</span> <span id="s200">You didn't know what was right and what was wrong.</span> <span id="s201">And we decided to go.</span> <span id="s202">We packed our baggage, you know, whatever we took along, a blanket, and some clothing, and, of course, food.</span> <span id="s203">And one evening we just walked out and went to the woods, the four of us.</span> <span id="s204">That was before Shavuos.</span> <span id="s205">And while we were in the woods, we created some kind of a shelter for ourselves.</span> <span id="s206">You know, between the trees, the branches.</span> <span id="s207">And one day a peasant came around, and he knew why we were hiding, because they all knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s208">And we gave him some money, and we told him to go to the town.</span> <span id="s209">And I told him to go to see a friend of mine whose father was a dentist.</span> <span id="s210">And they had a, one of those exceptions that made you legal.</span> <span id="s211">You know, he was necessary...</span></p> <p><span id="s212">GB: Like a pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">ME: Yeah.</span> <span id="s214">He was important for the welfare of the town or whatever it is, as a dentist.</span> <span id="s215">And I wrote a note to her, and I told her where I was.</span> <span id="s216">And I told her in the note if she wants to send us something with this man, and to let me know what's happening.</span> <span id="s217">And then he came back.</span> <span id="s218">I think he brought us some food.</span> <span id="s219">And he brought me a note, and the note said that my grandparents were deported meanwhile--I mean, the whole town was more or less vacated, except for some exceptions--and also that my parents went through the town, because the train, the railroad, went through that town, and I don't remember whether she said that she saw them, or somebody knows that, they probably asked for me, or my father asked for his parents.</span> <span id="s220">So they knew that they did go through that, through Bardjov, towards the point where they concentrated all these people, in Czechoslovakia first.</span> <span id="s221">[pause] Soon after this man kept coming, and he was menacing--you know, he kept asking us for money...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">GB: More money.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">ME: Yeah.</span> <span id="s224">Eventually things just reached a, [calling someone: "Gita!"</span> <span id="s225">Tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s226">GB: All right.</span> <span id="s227">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s228">Your parents went through the town, so you knew that they were transported somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">ME: And they did find out at that time that I am in hiding.</span> <span id="s230">And they were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">GB: Oh, your parents knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">ME: Well, people came to the train from the town, and they gave these people maybe some food or something.</span> <span id="s233">And my parents inquired about me, and they were told that I am in hiding.</span> <span id="s234">And I heard, afterwards, you know, that they were very happy about it, that perhaps I am going to be saved.</span> <span id="s235">You know, it was, and also I remember, I have a cousin who is in Israel.</span> <span id="s236">Her name is Leah Weiss.</span> <span id="s237">And she told me that when they were taking her, my parents, my maternal grandmother was still alive, and she was with them.</span> <span id="s238">And as they were traveling through that other town, she was, she was in her 90's.</span> <span id="s239">But she was telling them very quietly that, "Miriam is in hiding."</span> <span id="s240">And she was, she was alert enough to know that that was good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">GB: Your name was Miriam...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">ME: Yeah, Miriam.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">GB: Actually, so you changed Miriam.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">ME: That's my Hebrew name...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">GB: Yeah, Hebrew name.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">ME: But Malvina was my formal name, in my papers, yes.</span> <span id="s247">And she was very happy to tell people that I am being hidden.</span> <span id="s248">She understood what the situation was in her own way.</span> <span id="s249">Also, O.K., I don't know if this belongs here.</span> <span id="s250">I just will mention it now.</span> <span id="s251">After the war, when I did come back to my hometown, because I needed some legal papers--that's why I did return--and the peasants said, "Oh, when your parents were taken, your father said, 'Whatever you see is happening to us, will happen to you.'"</span> <span id="s252">This is what my father said to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">GB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">ME: That you will be punished for what you are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">GB: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s256">What was the relationship with the non-Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">ME: It was pretty good.</span> <span id="s258">My father was a very wise man, and he was a good man, and he understood, he was a good human being.</span> <span id="s259">And when people were in need, he helped them.</span> <span id="s260">He was not the type of a man that some people represent the Jewish characters as taking advantage of the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s261">He was in business.</span> <span id="s262">He wanted to make a living.</span> <span id="s263">But if people came to him for help, sometimes he...</span></p> <p><span id="s264">GB: He would...</span></p> <p><span id="s265">ME: He would...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">GB: Put out a helping hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">ME: He did put out a helping hand, to lend them money when he, and he gave them on credit, rather, whatever was necessary, until, you know, these peasants lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s268">Sometimes they said, "When my cow will have a calf, and I will sell it, I'll have money."</span> <span id="s269">And he gave them credit on that account, so that they did appreciate it.</span> <span id="s270">However, once the...</span></p> <p><span id="s271">GB: Things got tough...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">ME: The climate was the way it became, everybody's hostility came out.</span> <span id="s273">And even if it wasn't there, it was stimulated, and everybody reacted to it.</span> <span id="s274">So, they did respect him.</span> <span id="s275">I don't know if they loved him.</span> <span id="s276">I don't know if there is such a thing, you know, but they said, "When you are in trouble and you need help, you can go to Moshka," they called him Moses, you know, "and you can, he will give you a helping hand."</span></p> <p><span id="s277">GB: How long did you remain in, remain in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">ME: Not very long.</span> <span id="s279">Something like three weeks.</span> <span id="s280">And then this man kept coming, and asking us for money.</span> <span id="s281">And I don't think they had any.</span> <span id="s282">And we were afraid that he was going to report us.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">GB: How many of you...</span></p> <p><span id="s284">ME: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">GB: How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">ME: Two, two boys and two girls.</span> <span id="s287">Yeah.</span> <span id="s288">And we felt we weren't safe anymore, because he was menacing, and we knew he was going to report us.</span> <span id="s289">So we just, one evening we picked ourselves up and we left.</span> <span id="s290">And we returned to my grandparents' apartment, which was sealed on the outside, but we went in through the windows.</span> <span id="s291">And we just lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">GB: In hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">ME: In hiding.</span> <span id="s294">We could not, we did not go out during the day.</span> <span id="s295">And in that same yard there, there were a few apartments.</span> <span id="s296">And one apartment was occupied by people who had permission to stay, so that sometimes if we needed something, they helped us out, and also we used to go out and get some food, and we knew it will not last long.</span> <span id="s297">And a friend of mine, who had this exception that they could remain, she also helped us, you know.</span> <span id="s298">She occasionally brought us some food.</span> <span id="s299">And we were living in a kind of waiting state, you know, because we knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s300">GB: In limbo.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">ME: Somehow, yes, in limbo.</span> <span id="s302">We knew that it cannot go on too long the way it was, unless you made other plans and went further, and went to Hungary or other things, but somehow, I wasn't sophisticated enough, you know.</span> <span id="s303">This, one of those people was the one who came from Poland, and he wanted to escape.</span> <span id="s304">He said the best thing would be to go to Hungary, to continue.</span> <span id="s305">But, somehow he never did that, and we never did it.</span> <span id="s306">And one evening, the other young man, he was climbing over a fence, and when you saw somebody climbing over a fence, it was immediately suspicious.</span> <span id="s307">And somebody saw him, a Gentile man saw him, and he told the police.</span> <span id="s308">And shortly after that the police came.</span> <span id="s309">It was one evening, and they came into the apartment and they took us all to the local prison.</span> <span id="s310">And in the morning we were taken to a central point.</span> <span id="s311">And from there we were taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">GB: This was when, in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">ME: This was 1942, in June.</span> <span id="s314">[pause] And from then on...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">GB: You remained in Auschwitz for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">ME: I was in Auschwitz from 1942 till the end, till October, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">GB: '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">ME: '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">GB: What was your...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">ME: Occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">GB: Living arrangement?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">ME: [chuckles] Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">GB: What was your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">ME: Well, at the beginning it was like everybody else's, and later on...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">GB: Describe it, you describe, for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">ME: We went out, you know, immediately you were changed.</span> <span id="s327">Like I remembered when I came in, there were some of the girls there with whom I went to school.</span> <span id="s328">And I, of course, I hardly recognized them, because everybody was transformed, with the haircut and, at that point they were already emaciated.</span> <span id="s329">And I, when I heard about one classmate who had died already, this was like three months later, it was still a normal reaction, because I had just come from a normal, more or less normal environment, so that the emotions were not numb yet.</span> <span id="s330">But, as things were happening, you were in shock, and you, you did not have too much time to think.</span> <span id="s331">You just had to act upon all the orders that were constantly being given to you by the Germans.</span> <span id="s332">And, of course, the hair was cut and everything was taken away, and you were put on, you put on the clothes that they gave you...</span></p> <p><span id="s333">GB: What was your daily routine?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">ME: And at that time we went out every morning, and they are doing some grading, what you call, like they were digging up hills and making things level, leveling things.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">GB: Rakes, and raking?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">ME: You know, yeah.</span> <span id="s337">It was, it was, with a shovel.</span> <span id="s338">It was work.</span> <span id="s339">It accomplished something.</span> <span id="s340">But it was hard.</span> <span id="s341">And we had to march for a long time to reach those places.</span> <span id="s342">At the beginning, it was fine because one still had one’s health and energy, but soon everything started to catch up with you.</span> <span id="s343">Your feet became irritated from the, at the beginning they left us the shoes, and once the shoes went, you wore wooden shoes or whatever you found.</span> <span id="s344">And infections developed immediately, and then very little food, and slowly, slowly it affected your health.</span> <span id="s345">And we came to Auschwitz, and soon after, maybe four or five weeks after, they moved us to Birkenau, because this was getting too crowded.</span> <span id="s346">And Birkenau wasn't too far from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s347">It was closer to the area where the crematorias were.</span> <span id="s348">When we came to Birkenau, it was used, supposedly, for some soldier prisoners or something.</span> <span id="s349">It used to be some type of a camp before.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">GB: Prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">ME: Prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s352">From, from old times.</span> <span id="s353">I don't know, because it was these...</span></p> <p><span id="s354">GB: They had, the barracks existed before?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">ME: The barracks existed with these bunk beds, you know, not beds, like...</span></p> <p><span id="s356">GB: Cots?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">ME: Just bunks, bunks built into the walls, separations, bunks, separations, bunks, you know.</span> <span id="s358">And we were placed in these.</span> <span id="s359">And compared to Auschwitz where we came from, this was terrible.</span> <span id="s360">Auschwitz was a country club because you had running water in each block.</span> <span id="s361">So when you came home you could wash yourself, and also you had water to drink.</span> <span id="s362">But here it was very hard to reach the water, and the luxuries got far away, you know, to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s363">And the, the rooms themselves were horrible, and dirty, and dusty, and immediately typhus broke out full force, and everybody became sick.</span> <span id="s364">I did not become sick yet, and one day, usually everybody, people used to group together.</span> <span id="s365">You found your own kind, so to speak, that you, first of all it was Slovakian girls who spoke the same language, and also to whom you felt more, you could relate better, you know.</span> <span id="s366">And we were a group of girls.</span> <span id="s367">And one day someone told us they are looking for a group, they want to form a Kommando.</span> <span id="s368">Everybody was a Kommando.</span> <span id="s369">Each group, whatever they did, they were a Kommando.</span> <span id="s370">And they want to form a certain Kommando.</span> <span id="s371">And, we said, "What kind of a Kommando is this?"</span></p> <p><span id="s372">GB: And, whose suggestion was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">ME: This came from, from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">GB: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">ME: Sometimes it wasn't from the Germans, but one of the German inmates who were in charge.</span> <span id="s376">And they want to form a Kommando.</span> <span id="s377">And the Kommando was to, LeichenKommando it was called.</span> <span id="s378">Leiche is corpse.</span> <span id="s379">Leiche is a corpse, in German.</span> <span id="s380">And they want to form this LeichenKommando to pick up the corpses from the streets, you know, from the, and bring them to one area.</span> <span id="s381">So we said, "What a job," you know, after all, we never saw a corpse in our lives.</span> <span id="s382">And we were all 17 years old.</span> <span id="s383">And, but they told us that if you do this job, you will have enough [to someone else: "Yes, Gita?"</span> <span id="s384">tape off then on]--they said the advantages, if we take this, if we do this work, we will have plenty of food.</span> <span id="s385">We do not have to march, we do not have to stand Zählappell.</span> <span id="s386">Zählappell is roll call, which was, in itself, a murderous thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">GB: Why, because, what happened at roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">ME: Because you had to stand from three o’clock to six o’clock till they counted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">GB: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">ME: You were not yesterday at the program?</span> <span id="s391">There was one thing on roll call.</span> <span id="s392">It was excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">GB: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">ME: It was excellent.</span> <span id="s395">I wish I had a copy of it.</span> <span id="s396">Becau-, it was done by a poet, Peppercorn or something like that is his name.</span> <span id="s397">And, you had to stand and stand and stand.</span> <span id="s398">By the time you were ready to march you were half dead, you know, from standing.</span> <span id="s399">O.K., it wasn't so cold at that time, but when the winter came, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s400">So we do not have to stand Zählappell.</span> <span id="s401">We can have more food.</span> <span id="s402">And we don't have to march out to work.</span> <span id="s403">We can sleep longer.</span> <span id="s404">So we said, "Well, why can't we do it?</span> <span id="s405">If we won't do it, somebody else will do it.</span> <span id="s406">Let's try it."</span> <span id="s407">And all the, the whole, this whole group, I think, were about eighteen or maybe twenty girls.</span> <span id="s408">And we said, "O.K." And, this was the group, and we had certain, what do you call them, ca-, like then you when you take somebody on a..</span> <span id="s409">.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">GB: Stretcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">ME: Stretcher, so to speak.</span> <span id="s412">And every time, you know, a corpse was lying around, we just had to come and pick it up, and put it in a certain area until they took it away, you know, took them away.</span> <span id="s413">Of course it was very terrible at the beginning.</span> <span id="s414">And then you just did it automatically.</span> <span id="s415">Because things were happening all the time.</span> <span id="s416">You just became very...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">GB: Callous.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">ME: Callous.</span> <span id="s419">You did not think.</span> <span id="s420">You just did what you had to do, and your main objective was to have as little com-, as much comfort, or as little comfort as possible--not to be too tired, not to be too hungry, not to be too cold.</span> <span id="s421">And that's about it.</span> <span id="s422">And, unfortunately, it was a very busy job, because people were just falling like flies.</span> <span id="s423">Suddenly it was, the people were dying in such masses, in such, that it could not be handled with...</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s425">GB: ...Selection...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">ME: Meaning that they...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">GB: As a rule they cut out, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">ME: They, they weeded out everything and everybody who, who looked like...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">GB: At roll call...</span></p> <p><span id="s430">ME: They can't function.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">GB: They do this at roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">ME: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s433">They made a selection.</span> <span id="s434">This is, this was called a selection.</span> <span id="s435">They got all the people out, and they went through them and looked who looked whether they can still go, or if there is anything to be got out of them.</span> <span id="s436">Otherwise, be removed, so that suddenly the camp was almost empty.</span> <span id="s437">So one morning our Kapo, who was in charge of us, told us that they have to make this Kommando smaller because there aren't so many corpses anymore, so they don't need so many workers.</span> <span id="s438">So I was one of those who lost a job.</span> <span id="s439">The irony of it, I was crying, because I and...</span></p> <p><span id="s440">GB: Because you got cut...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">ME: Some other, and some other people could not do this work anymore, because there weren't enough corpses.</span> <span id="s442">But why it was so terrible is because it was, it was maybe October or November.</span> <span id="s443">It was getting very cold, and, of course, Poland is very cold, you know, it's European winters, European fall.</span> <span id="s444">It was getting rainy and muddy...</span></p> <p><span id="s445">GB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">ME: And very, very miserable in every way.</span> <span id="s447">And suddenly I have to start getting up at three o’clock in the morning, stand Zählappell, and march out into the, into work.</span> <span id="s448">And then I became sick also.</span> <span id="s449">I also caught typhus.</span> <span id="s450">And as I was working every day, the, those girls who remained on the job told me, "When you come home every day, stop here.</span> <span id="s451">Perhaps there will be something else available, so maybe you could get another job."</span> <span id="s452">And this is what I used to do.</span> <span id="s453">I envied them so that they could have the job, and have their comforts, and I was getting weaker every day.</span> <span id="s454">And I was really like about to fall apart.</span> <span id="s455">And one day when I came home they told me, "Tomorrow morning hurry quickly after the Zählappell and come to this particular spot, because they are going to organize a certain Kommando, a new Kommando."</span> <span id="s456">We didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s457">And sure enough, in the morning--I couldn't sleep all night--in the morning I couldn't wait till it was over.</span> <span id="s458">And how am I going to get over to that place, because it was like at the other end of the camp.</span> <span id="s459">And the mud was very deep, and sticky, and the, the camp was full of ditches, because in order for the water to run off.</span> <span id="s460">And if somebody fell into a ditch, nobody could pull you out, because nobody had the strength to pull you out, so that was the end of you.</span> <span id="s461">And I remember hurrying to get to that place in time.</span> <span id="s462">And this Kapo who was in charge was the same that was in charge of the other group, when I was working.</span> <span id="s463">And she recognized me.</span> <span id="s464">And she picked one, this one, this one, and she said, "Und du," "and you."</span> <span id="s465">And I was picked for this new job.</span> <span id="s466">And this new job was called EssKommando.</span> <span id="s467">EssKommando means FoodKommando.</span> <span id="s468">Essen is to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">GB: Eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">ME: Yeah.</span> <span id="s471">And our job was, it was a group of about 20 or 25--I don't remember--and our job was to take a wagon, and bring the food from the kitchen to the sick, sick blocks.</span> <span id="s472">There were a few sick blocks.</span> <span id="s473">And that was also good, because it was, you didn't have to get up early, you know.</span> <span id="s474">You had enough, you had a little more food.</span> <span id="s475">And more or less the same conditions as in the other group.</span> <span id="s476">So, which was very good, but I..</span> <span id="s477">.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">GB: So you didn't have to stand roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">ME: No, no roll call.</span> <span id="s480">So, it was fine, and I, I was beginning to feel stronger, because I had a little more food, and I had a little more rest.</span> <span id="s481">And one day, as we are pushing the wagon from the kitchen, I suddenly had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s482">Because everybody was suffering from diarrhea all the time, more or less.</span> <span id="s483">And, I said this to the group, and they said, "Oh, you are just lazy.</span> <span id="s484">You don't want to push the wagon."</span> <span id="s485">I said, "Well, believe me or not, I'm going."</span> <span id="s486">And I did go to the bathroom, and when I come back, I see the wagon is standing in the middle of the road and nobody's by the wagon.</span> <span id="s487">I couldn't figure out what happened.</span> <span id="s488">So I ran to my block to find out what happened.</span> <span id="s489">So the, the Block Ältester from our block where I lived says to me--she was a Jewish inmate--"You are here?</span> <span id="s490">Go and hide fast."</span> <span id="s491">Because I looked terrible.</span> <span id="s492">She said, "They just made a selection, and they took everybody to the selection.</span> <span id="s493">And that whole bunch from the wagon was also taken to the selection."</span> <span id="s494">And I hadn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">GB: When you say selection, when you, when you say that, what does that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">ME: It means they put the people, they tell them to, to go to a certain place, and they select who should come, and who should go, and who should stay.</span> <span id="s497">They select.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">GB: Did you know where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">ME: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s500">We were so close to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s501">We could see everything.</span> <span id="s502">I mean, this was, I mean it was the first year, but we knew already what was happening.</span> <span id="s503">We knew immediately what was happening over there.</span> <span id="s504">And, and I hid.</span> <span id="s505">I did not move out of the block, till some of the girls came back.</span> <span id="s506">From that whole group, maybe eight came back.</span> <span id="s507">All the others were taken.</span> <span id="s508">And, this is where you...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">GB: Who were in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">ME: Mmm hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">GB: You, you say that, you indicated that may-, some of them were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">ME: Oh, no, they were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">GB: All Jewish.</span> <span id="s514">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">ME: Those were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">GB: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">ME: Those were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s518">But, when you're talking about what made you survive--luck, chance, faith...</span></p> <p><span id="s519">GB: Faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">ME: God, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">GB: God.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">ME: Everybody gives it a different name.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">GB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">ME: But these were chains of circumstances that made you survive.</span> <span id="s525">Otherwise, there was no way.</span> <span id="s526">First it was one job, then it was the other job...</span></p> <p><span id="s527">GB: There was no rhyme nor reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">ME: No.</span> <span id="s529">Then it was my going away at the right time, being at the right, in the right place at the right time.</span> <span id="s530">And when I came back, I looked more sick than any of those girls.</span> <span id="s531">Mostly, because I had just finished typhoid, and I was skin and bones, hardly was able to walk, but I could push along with everybody else.</span> <span id="s532">And when they came back, they said, "This is what they meant," and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s533">Then, later on--I don't remember what happened to this EssKommando.</span> <span id="s534">But another Kommando was created, and this was called SchmutzKommando.</span> <span id="s535">SchmutzKommando meant, Schmutz, you know what Schmutz [dirt, filth] means?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">GB: Cleaning...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">ME: Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">GB: Cleaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">ME: But it was, it was a fun job, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">GB: Oh, a fun job [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s541">ME: Really, really, considering how things were there, it was a fun job.</span> <span id="s542">Our job was to walk around, around the sick blocks.</span> <span id="s543">We were six girls, and we used to go in twos.</span> <span id="s544">We used to have like a pail and a stick, and we used to pick up the paper around the block, you know, to make it look like this is a, a country club, you know, [chuckling] it's very clean and very neat.</span> <span id="s545">This was the job, and it was one of the best jobs, because it was very easy--no strain--with all the other advantages.</span> <span id="s546">You know, no Zählappell, no roll call, more food, and the environment, you know, you just had your friends and you’re with the same group.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">GB: Freedom, sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">ME: And nobody else came in...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">GB: Sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s550">ME: Yes.</span> <span id="s551">And that's when I became very sick.</span> <span id="s552">While I was in the SchmutzKommando, I suddenly became extremely weak, and I could not walk.</span> <span id="s553">And there was a doctor from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s554">Her name was Emma, and some of the girls called her to come and examine me.</span> <span id="s555">And she said I have pleurisy and pneumonia and I'm not going to last long.</span> <span id="s556">And, I found out what's happening, so the other girls--I didn't go out to work--the other girls just covered for me, and I stayed in.</span> <span id="s557">And I had a friend who came from this same area where I lived, from the small town.</span> <span id="s558">And she was, we were kind of friendly, and she worked in the place called Rotkäppchen [Little Red Riding Hood] or Canada, where all the food, all the stuff that was brought.</span> <span id="s559">When the people came in, they had to leave everything there, and they did the sorting of those things.</span> <span id="s560">And they always smuggled something into the camp.</span> <span id="s561">And she, when she used to come home from work every day, she used to come in and bring me something.</span> <span id="s562">And those days, I remember the, that was already, let's see, I can't remember, it was the Spring of '43, Spring of '43.</span> <span id="s563">And she came, and she always brought me something, some food, some little delicacy from these transports, I remember, like olives.</span> <span id="s564">I'd never eaten olives, because olives, you know, Czechoslovakia is not a country, a tropical country, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">GB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">ME: And Halva she brought me.</span> <span id="s567">Little things.</span> <span id="s568">And gradually, you know, from rest and a little more food, I, I did recuperate, yes.</span> <span id="s569">And then Passover came.</span> <span id="s570">I remember Passover distinctly because there was one woman in our group--she was from Krakow--her name is, her name was Frau Orleans.</span> <span id="s571">And she was one of the first women to, who started the Bes Yaacov movement in the girls' schools in Poland.</span> <span id="s572">She was a very educated person.</span> <span id="s573">And she was like a, like a den mother so to speak.</span> <span id="s574">She was very, a very good influence on us.</span> <span id="s575">And Passover came, and we knew it was Passover.</span> <span id="s576">And she made a seder [Passover evening home service].</span> <span id="s577">We made a seder in our corner.</span> <span id="s578">And we did not eat bread all eight days.</span> <span id="s579">We organized potatoes, and we cooked them, you know, we had various means, and we tried to avoid bread.</span> <span id="s580">And, that, that was the last Passover I re-, the first Passover and the last one I remember.</span> <span id="s581">Later on I don't, I don't remember the Passovers, because there were two mores, you know, two more of them while in camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s582">And, O.K., I should go faster I guess.</span> <span id="s583">O.K., you want to ask...</span></p> <p><span id="s584">GB: Tell me, while you were in the camp, did you know what was happening as far as the war was concerned.</span> <span id="s585">And that in '41, did you hear that the United States entered the war?</span> <span id="s586">When did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">ME: I, I, we knew very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">GB: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">ME: We just was wondering what the outside knows about us.</span> <span id="s590">This was our interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">GB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">ME: And we knew that planes were flying, and nobody, nobody cared to...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">GB: You didn't know what was happening?</span> <span id="s594">You didn't know what was happening to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">ME: Well, people did come in, you know, from, there were always new transports, you know.</span> <span id="s596">And they did tell things.</span> <span id="s597">But we were so involved, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s598">GB: In your own...</span></p> <p><span id="s599">ME: We were just interested how does it affect us?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">GB: Were you, you were not involved in any resistance activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">ME: I was not.</span> <span id="s602">I was not.</span> <span id="s603">After this time, we were transported to another camp, and I was in Brzezinka when the Hungarian transports started to come.</span> <span id="s604">It was all Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">GB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">ME: And we were Birkenau, Brzezinka.</span> <span id="s607">Birkenau is Brzezinka, it's the same thing.</span> <span id="s608">One is Polish, one is German.</span> <span id="s609">It's, Birke means "the white trees" that...</span></p> <p><span id="s610">GB: Birch.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">ME: Birch.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">GB: Birch trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">ME: It was a birch palace or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">GB: Where, I mean under what circumstances were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">ME: I was in Auschwitz, and we worked in the sauna where the transports, the Hungarian transports came.</span> <span id="s616">I was cutting hair.</span> <span id="s617">This was my job, before I left Auschwitz, cutting hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">GB: Cutting hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">ME: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">GB: And that was another job that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">ME: Yeah, that was a very good job also.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">GB: After picking up the...</span></p> <p><span id="s623">ME: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">GB: Trash.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">ME: That was the next one.</span> <span id="s626">Working in the disinfecting center and also cutting hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">GB: When you recovered from...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">ME: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">GB: Did you go back to your job in...</span></p> <p><span id="s630">ME: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">GB: The Schmutz job?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">ME: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">GB: And then you, then you got another job...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">ME: Then later the whole group of us was sent back to the sauna.</span> <span id="s635">The sauna was where they, bathing, you know, and disinfecting clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">GB: More people were coming in all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">ME: Oh yes, constantly, constantly...</span></p> <p><span id="s638">GB: More people coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">ME: New people constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">GB: More people coming?</span> <span id="s641">In and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">ME: In, coming...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">GB: In, and, out.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">ME: Well, in was one way, and out was the last way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">GB: Out was the other, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">ME: And then later on they took this very group we are working in the sauna, and they transferred us to Brzezinka.</span> <span id="s647">Well, when the Hungarian transports started to come in '44, full force, and very many, and we were working also in the sauna, cutting hair and doing things like that.</span> <span id="s648">At the end of '44, towards September, October, they said that our group is going to be sent some place.</span> <span id="s649">Now we did not believe they will send us some place, because we were as close to the crematoria as from here to that hall there, whatever you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">GB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">ME: I could not believe they will let us live.</span> <span id="s652">And they changed, we used to wear civilian clothes while we were working in the sauna.</span> <span id="s653">They put on us the striped things on us.</span> <span id="s654">They told us to take some things with us, and they put us in a bus, and they took us away.</span> <span id="s655">And we did not believe that we are going to see the sun again.</span> <span id="s656">And they took us to Hindenburg.</span> <span id="s657">Hindenburg was a..</span> <span id="s658">.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">GB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">ME: Small town, and ammunition factories were around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">GB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">ME: And that's where we were.</span> <span id="s663">That's where they took us.</span> <span id="s664">And this Tauber, who was an S.S. man, he was in charge of that camp.</span> <span id="s665">And he looked at our numbers, and he could tell from our numbers that we were very early comers.</span> <span id="s666">And he gave us the compliment of saying, "Ihr seit doch von den Alten."</span> <span id="s667">"You are from the old ones, from the early ones."</span> <span id="s668">And we made it up till now.</span> <span id="s669">And he gave us jobs inside, you know, like Stubendienst, [room service] which was like you take care of the rooms and things, a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s670">And we stayed in that camp November, December, and January.</span> <span id="s671">The Russians started to move in, and suddenly they told us, "You have to take everything."</span> <span id="s672">And they emptied the food, gave us as much as there was, you know, bread and whatever to take along.</span> <span id="s673">And we started marching--in the, you know, in January, in the deep of the winter, till we reach--And we marched about two days, and then we reached a certain place where they put us in boxcars, you know, in the, in a train with boxcars.</span> <span id="s674">And they packed in, it was--you always hear about these things, and that's exactly how it was--till we came to a certain camp.</span> <span id="s675">After riding for, I don't know whether it was days or a week or more, till we came to a certain place where they let us out, and they fed us, and then again into the boxcars till we reached Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s676">That was the last stop, Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s677">And, Bergen-Belsen was at that time, the last thing, you know, they concentrated as many people there as possible, because as the Russian front was moving east, not, wait, westward, they kept moving the people westward.</span> <span id="s678">And they could not care of those so many people, and food was getting scarcer and scarcer.</span> <span id="s679">And they said that the last few days that they are going to, to feed everybody poisoned soup in order to finish off everybody.</span> <span id="s680">But, whether they were too late for it, or they did not have time to do it, whatever the reason was, the English came in on April the 15th, and then when we were liberated, and that was the end of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s681">GB: Do you have any bitterness?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">ME: Bitterness is a very mild term, heh.</span> <span id="s683">It's, em, [pause]...</span></p> <p><span id="s684">GB: You were able to...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">ME: I, I can...</span></p> <p><span id="s686">GB: To renew your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">ME: I can say one thing, that we preserved our humanity...</span></p> <p><span id="s688">GB: From your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">ME: Remarkably, all those girls that I was with, we were just as human as, as when we went in...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">GB: As you went in...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">ME: Perhaps more human, because we became even more sensitive.</span> <span id="s692">And we know how easy it is to be, easy it is to become dehumanized.</span> <span id="s693">It is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s694">And I think the important thing is to really nurture your humanity, because it's very brittle, and it can just disappear very easily, under very little provocation.</span> <span id="s695">Certainly we had enough provocation and, to become dehumanized, but that was the only thing I feel that we can be proud of from this experience, because brutality brutalizes, and we certainly did not become brutal.</span> <span id="s696">That's the last thing we became.</span> <span id="s697">We just became more understanding, and we know what a human being is capable of, if, if we do not look out, for ourselves and for others.</span> <span id="s698">I would just like to mention the names of my siblings [weeping].</span></p> <p><span id="s699">GB: Your siblings, your sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">ME: Yes.</span> <span id="s701">My oldest brother, Moshe, eh Avraham Shlomo, Yesoa Yehoshua, David, and Myer Ze’ev, and my sisters Esther, Sara, Fayga, and Chaya Rayza.</span> <span id="s702">On my mother's side, there were some cousins left, and I have two aunts in America and one aunt that survived in Europe.</span> <span id="s703">However, at this point they are all gone.</span> <span id="s704">However, on my father's side, nobody survived, because my father had only one sister, and she was, she perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s705">And I want to mention the name of my grandfather on my father's side, Menachem Mendel, and my grandmother Ziesel, who had two sisters, Brocha--who lost her husband in the First World War, and she remained with one daughter, Sara, who lived with my grandmother--and another sister of my grandmother, Leah, who was blind, and who also lived with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s706">She took care of all of them.</span> <span id="s707">And I think they were very special people, very strong characters, and good human beings.</span></p></body></html>
