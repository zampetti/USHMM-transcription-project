id="s93">Of course, it was no picnic.</span> <span id="s94">You could imagine.</span> <span id="s95">One Jewish girl with so much Polish children.</span> <span id="s96">But we took it, because we were staying there.</span> <span id="s97">Didn't have no alternative.</span> <span id="s98">And then when we moved away, we...only me, my father and mother remained...and we moved away to

know from nothing.</span> <span id="s121">She didn't...she couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s122">She was just constantly by the machines.</span> <span id="s123">Of course, we helped her out a lot.</span> <span id="s124">As much as we could.</span> <span id="s125">And that was life in Vengrov.</span> <span id="s126">And when we wanted to see the family, we used to go out of the house and go to other streets...on other streets.</span> <span id="s127">Everybody lived in the same neighborhood.</span> <span id="s128">Because we were in different neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span

entertainments.</span> <span id="s146">We made ourself entertainments, you know.</span> <span id="s147">And that was the life.</span> <span id="s148">Like in a small city.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Were you very interested in Zionist thought or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, I was in the...mostly in the Ha-shomer.</span> <span id="s151">We were going to

id="s159">We learned all kind of Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s160">And that was, you know, we spent the time.</span> <span id="s161">It was like entertainment time and literature, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s162">That what it was the mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did you have much information about what was happening in Germany with Hitler...before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Before the war?</span> <span id="s165">No.</span> <span id="s166">I didn't...we didn't know nothing about it.</span> <span id="s167">We couldn't even imagine to think that something is gonna happen.</span> <span id="s168">In those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Early on, didn't a lot of refugees from other towns come to Vengrov, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Not, not too many.</span> <span id="s171">Not too many, no.</span> <span id="s172">They remained like, also on, in little...I don't know if you'll know it.</span> <span id="s173">In little farms.</span> <span id="s174">But not...they didn't have farms but they had the houses, like on the farms.</span> <span id="s175">And they used to come, like I said before, they used to come to the city to buy, you know, food...more delicate things, you know.</span> <span id="s176">And than that was it.</span> <span id="s177">And the rest they would...they used to come in by horse and wagon, of course, because it was 12 kilometers to come to that city.</span> <span id="s178">And all around the things.</span> <span id="s179">But it wasn't too many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s180">You could count them on the fingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">01:09:40</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Do you remember the day that the war started in Vengrov?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I don't remember the date of the day.</span> <span id="s184">What I remember, it was...when they came in to Vengrov, it was just before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s185">I think, if I'm not mistaken, it was like a week before Rosh Hashanah they came in.</span> <span id="s186">And it took them not too long to start taking out the Jews.</span> <span id="s187">Yom Kippur they...they...how to say?</span> <span id="s188">They took us around...they took us around, all around.</span> <span id="s189">And we were all in shul,this I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s190">We were all in shul, my whole family.</span> <span id="s191">And of course the other people were there.</span> <span id="s192">And one of my brother came in and announced...it was in a different room ...and he announced that people we already in it.</span> <span id="s193">That means we were closed around, we couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s194">That was it.</span> <span id="s195">They came in and they taken us and we gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s196">And that what it is.</span> <span id="s197">That was Yom Kippur, about two o'clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s199">About two o'clock, yeah.</span> <span id="s200">Just when we took a rest, you know, from, from praying.</span> <span id="s201">And of course, people got very nervous.</span> <span id="s202">And they didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s203">Should we stay yet in the shul or should we start going into the places to hide or...they didn't know what... what we, can we do?</span> <span id="s204">Because we were already in their hands.</span> <span id="s205">We couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s206">The whole city was like you take a, a wire and you put it around that they can't escape.</span> <span id="s207">Anyway, we wait...we finish there until the last prayer.</span> <span id="s208">And we went home.</span> <span id="s209">We went 5 synagogue, house of prayer and gathering (Hebrew) home by rushing home.</span> <span id="s210">A lot of people got hurt, because they didn't let us go.</span> <span id="s211">They didn't ...don't go here, and don't go there.</span> <span id="s212">And you weren't allowed to have lights.</span> <span id="s213">Was no lights.</span> <span id="s214">We didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s215">And we went into the houses.</span> <span id="s216">Of course, the dinner was...no dinner, you could imagine.</span> <span id="s217">But we were sitting and praying and talking between the family, you know.</span> <span id="s218">And we were talking, how can we get all together to be in one place and to keep...keep together.</span> <span id="s219">But I took my mother.</span> <span id="s220">My father wasn't alive already.</span> <span id="s221">My father was dead already.</span> <span id="s222">Because of them.</span> <span id="s223">They killed him.</span> <span id="s224">It happened that one day...</span></p> <p><span id="s225">01:12:36</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How did they kill him?</span> <span id="s227">A: Can I say it in between?</span> <span id="s228">Q: You can say it right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: He went about a week before Rosh Hashanah...he went to shul.</span> <span id="s230">He had a habit early in the morning to go there for prayer.</span> <span id="s231">And it was not easy.</span> <span id="s232">It was far away from us.</span> <span id="s233">From where we were living.</span> <span id="s234">It was early in the morning...in those times, then when they came in right away...that you weren't allowed to be in the evening in the street.</span> <span id="s235">And you weren't allowed to be the early in the morning in the street.</span> <span id="s236">They had certain hours.</span> <span id="s237">You probably know about it.</span> <span id="s238">And they caught him coming back already.</span> <span id="s239">It must have been about 7, 7:30.</span> <span id="s240">Because it was after the morning prayer.</span> <span id="s241">And they beat him up.</span> <span id="s242">But they wanted to cut his beard.</span> <span id="s243">He had a beautiful beard like you see in the, in the picture.</span> <span id="s244">And he didn't let himself.</span> <span id="s245">So that's when they told me...I was the only one that was with them, because the rest of the people were in Vengrov.</span> <span id="s246">There in the thing.</span> <span id="s247">That was in Vengrov.</span> <span id="s248">So he didn't let cut him the beard.</span> <span id="s249">So they threw him down on the floor and they beat him up terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: You were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I, I wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: But my brothers went...they told my brothers that your father has been beaten up.</span> <span id="s254">Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) and the rest of the brothers, they were alive yet.</span> <span id="s255">Because they only came in a couple weeks before.</span> <span id="s256">And my older brother went and he took him home.</span> <span id="s257">And he got sick since then.</span> <span id="s258">He was very sick for a long time.</span> <span id="s259">And then he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: All right.</span> <span id="s261">So we were talking about, on Yom Kippur, how you were talking with the family and trying to figure out what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: What to do.</span> <span id="s263">Where to go, where to hide.</span> <span id="s264">So everybody went in a different place to hide.</span> <span id="s265">Of course, my father wasn't alive already.</span> <span id="s266">We buried him.</span> <span id="s267">And only my mother.</span> <span id="s268">So I had to watch after my mother.</span> <span id="s269">She was an elderly woman and she didn't...she couldn't take care on herself.</span> <span id="s270">And she couldn't walk too good.</span> <span id="s271">So I took her with me where I was hiding.</span> <span id="s272">In the same building where we were living.</span> <span id="s273">We went on the roof.</span> <span id="s274">On the attic...not on the roof.</span> <span id="s275">On the attic there, there was a place.</span> <span id="s276">They called it the boidemor whatever you....</span> <span id="s277">And there was a lot of boxes and clothing ...what people throw out, you know, to give away.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">01:15:31 So I, I, took her to one box and I covered her up with the certain clothes.</span> <span id="s279">And I went in another place like...not far from her.</span> <span id="s280">Not to be together...one for us to be alive.</span> <span id="s281">And we survived, a couple days there on the roof.</span> <span id="s282">We took with us the...whatever was to eat in the house.</span> <span id="s283">What we had from before, prepared.</span> <span id="s284">And we had there...while we were sitting on the attic there.</span> <span id="s285">Finally, they, they stopped going for the Jews to take them there...to take them in one place.</span> <span id="s286">So we went out...and I was remaining in the, in the apartment where I used to live.</span> <span id="s287">It was on the top of our apartment.</span> <span id="s288">On the attic.</span> <span id="s289">But my mother said that..."I want to go to Schlomo (ph)"...that was the oldest son.</span> <span id="s290">The oldest brother.</span> <span id="s291">He's in the picture.</span> <span id="s292">"I want to go up to him."</span> <span id="s293">And it was very far to go to him.</span> <span id="s294">It was to the...about 10 blocks to go over or maybe more.</span> <span id="s295">Just approximately.</span> <span id="s296">But she went.</span> <span id="s297">She went and they killed her there on the place.</span> <span id="s298">They caught her there, in the alley.</span> <span id="s299">It was alleys to go into the buildings.</span> <span id="s300">So they caught her and they killed her there.</span> <span id="s301">We didn't know the funeral.</span> <span id="s302">We didn't know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">We didn't know it.</span> <span id="s304">We only know that they took her to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s305">But where in the cemetery, what, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s306">There's no cemetery anyway there, anymore.</span> <span id="s307">And that was the living after this.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: So were you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I was only alone, left over, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: And what did you do next?</span> <span id="s311">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: They were still there and they start...then it came the time that they took out the people to kill.</span> <span id="s313">To go to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: All at one time or were there regular...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: It was regular living but it was no living, you know.</span> <span id="s316">During the war, it was no living.</span> <span id="s317">It was, it was torture.</span> <span id="s318">We went from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s319">Also...while I'm talking I'm reminding myself...when the bombs start to come in, we went into a neighborhood not far from that farm where we used to live before the war.</span> <span id="s320">We knew some people.</span> <span id="s321">And they took us in.</span> <span id="s322">And we were there...sorry... They took us in for a couple days.</span> <span id="s323">They put us in the basement</span></p> <p><span id="s324">6 attic (Yiddish) because the soldiers were only more in the cities, in the bigger cities.</span> <span id="s325">Not so much on the farm and those neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s326">We were there a couple days.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">01:18:37</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Who's "we"?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Some other people, Jews.</span> <span id="s330">They were living there in that, on that farm.</span> <span id="s331">And it was maybe about five or six families, that's all.</span> <span id="s332">Not too many.</span> <span id="s333">So when we came back...when we came back to the city, to Vengrov, they start taking people to work...the Germans...for working.</span> <span id="s334">Digging...telling us to make the...put in water pipes or other pipes, you know.</span> <span id="s335">So everybody started running again.</span> <span id="s336">Not everybody was able to do this work.</span> <span id="s337">And we heard of it...you know, rumors were going around that whoever they took and they couldn't work, they threw them in and...like he said...they killed them.</span> <span id="s338">So I..</span> <span id="s339">.</span> <span id="s340">in between, I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Somebody you had known for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I didn't know him too much.</span> <span id="s343">I mean not too long.</span> <span id="s344">Maybe I knew him about six, seven months.</span> <span id="s345">He was from a different city.</span> <span id="s346">He was from Siedlce.</span> <span id="s347">I don't know if you have an idea.</span> <span id="s348">I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: This was a strange time to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, it was no wedding.</span> <span id="s351">We just...we got married.</span> <span id="s352">As a matter of fact, my oldest brother gave us Khupe and Kdu'shn.You know what Khupe and Kdu'shn means?</span> <span id="s353">He gave ...the ceremony.</span> <span id="s354">Just the ceremony.</span> <span id="s355">And we kept on being there but they...we couldn't stay in our city too long, because they start taking out people to work.</span> <span id="s356">They send them in all kind of places to work.</span> <span id="s357">And he used to do a little business, back and forth.</span> <span id="s358">From Vengrov, with my... you know, to Siedlce.</span> <span id="s359">Being that my brothers were in this business...leather business...we started...you know, you should make a little living, you know.</span> <span id="s360">So he started to buy leather.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Not make...not finished leather.</span> <span id="s362">Finished leather ...but just the leather.</span> <span id="s363">And transferred to Siedlce.</span> <span id="s364">And that's the way he sell them there.</span> <span id="s365">As a matter of fact, a brother of mine took him in, in that business.</span> <span id="s366">So when it got so bad...and his family was there.</span> <span id="s367">And they had a big house.</span> <span id="s368">So he wanted me to come there.</span> <span id="s369">Because they already had taken out the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">01:21:19 There was not too, not too much people in that city... Siedlce.</span> <span id="s371">There was 30, 40 miles from Vengrov.</span> <span id="s372">So they said it gonna be, he...they...he had heard it whenever they took out the people to kill them or to burn them or to take them to the gas chambers, they said he's never gonna come again.</span> <span id="s373">And people ran away to woods, to all kinds of places.</span> <span id="s374">So I went to 7 wedding canopy and prayer; wedlock (Hebrew/Yiddish) Siedlce.</span> <span id="s375">But it was not true.</span> <span id="s376">Because when he killed...then he went to different people and he find out... I mean the Germans...he came back to the same people.</span> <span id="s377">The ones that they came back, they were hiding.</span> <span id="s378">Came back to their city.</span> <span id="s379">And he start taking out again.</span> <span id="s380">So he came back to his...to Siedlce.</span> <span id="s381">And I was staying there with him.</span> <span id="s382">Then they came to Vengrov.</span> <span id="s383">And they took out from Vengrov again.</span> <span id="s384">So I escaped in the woods.</span> <span id="s385">I was in the woods a couple days.</span> <span id="s386">Every shot was a Jew falling.</span> <span id="s387">Right near me.</span> <span id="s388">They didn't...I don't know how that they seen me...they didn't see me, I don't know.</span> <span id="s389">Because the shots, you heard them so near from you that you could know that it wasn't too far.</span> <span id="s390">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s391">Well, anyway, that's how we went through until they came back and they start taking out again the Jews.</span> <span id="s392">From Vengrov.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So you went to the woods.</span> <span id="s394">Did you come back to Vengrov?</span> <span id="s395">A: From the woods, I came back to the...yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You were with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No.</span> <span id="s398">I wasn't that time with my husband.</span> <span id="s399">When they start taking out again, they took me to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s400">From Vengrov.</span> <span id="s401">I went to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Just so that I understand this.</span> <span id="s403">The Germans came in, in several different round-ups... A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s404">And twice they came into the same cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: And in between, some people like yourself had gotten out to the woods.</span> <span id="s406">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: But some of you went back...</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Some...when we came back...when they said it's quieter now and we could come back, we came back.</span> <span id="s409">So meanwhile, we were all hiding.</span> <span id="s410">He went to the same city when nobody was there.</span> <span id="s411">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s412">Then when...</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: What happened the day they came in to take you...to transport you to Treblinka?</span> <span id="s414">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: When we went away...when I was in Siedlce, they...they used to...the same thing like in Vengrov.</span> <span id="s416">They used to take coming in the morning and take out some people to work for them.</span> <span id="s417">Also digging and, you know, those tunnels and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s418">For water or for whatever, the pipes to put in.</span> <span id="s419">They took people to work.</span> <span id="s420">And they took me also to work.</span> <span id="s421">And I remained there.</span> <span id="s422">I remained there and then when they start again to take out from Siedlce they took me from there.</span> <span id="s423">Me and his family kenem.</span> <span id="s424">I don't know where his family was, but I was constantly with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">01:24:49</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s428">The people got prepared...when they went into the train they got prepared with all kind of etches with....</span> <span id="s429">With all kind of things.</span> <span id="s430">They knew what people are doing, that they open up doors and they screaming "Escape," because the doors are open.</span> <span id="s431">I heard...my husband was yelling to me "Norma, leave.</span> <span id="s432">Scream.</span> <span id="s433">Go out.</span> <span id="s434">The doors are open."</span> <span id="s435">So I went out.</span> <span id="s436">In between I went out, I lost him.</span> <span id="s437">I lost...I knew where to go from Siedlce because from the farm where we used to live was not too far to go there.</span> <span id="s438">To the, to the train.</span> <span id="s439">So I knew, I knew, where I am and what place I, what section I am.</span> <span id="s440">So I went back to the wood.</span> <span id="s441">Near a farm, which it was never Jews there.</span> <span id="s442">Just...I knew people...like I said, my mother was a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s443">And we had work to do for them.</span> <span id="s444">I was doing with my mother, the work.</span> <span id="s445">And I remember that one of the Polish people...we were very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s446">They were very good to us.</span> <span id="s447">I said "I'm going to her.</span> <span id="s448">Maybe she'll hide me."</span> <span id="s449">But they were afraid for themself.</span> <span id="s450">So while I was going with her, I knew that I'm getting lost.</span> <span id="s451">I'm not...I'm not in the same place, it was the place but it was not that way to go to her, maybe.</span> <span id="s452">It was the other way.</span> <span id="s453">So I turn in the other side of the way.</span> <span id="s454">While I'm walking, I meet a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s455">And I said to her, in Polish, "Hello"...whatever in Polish is..."Dzien Dobry."</span> <span id="s456">And I ask her "Maybe you know"...I ask her from where she is.</span> <span id="s457">And she says...she mentioned the place, the name where that...where I'm looking for that woman.</span> <span id="s458">She didn't have a husband, her husband died.</span> <span id="s459">She had two daughters with her.</span> <span id="s460">So I asked her in Polish "Maybe you know Pani"..."Pani" means "Mrs."...where Pani Biernotska (ph) lives."</span> <span id="s461">She looks at me and looks at me and she says "Of course I know.</span> <span id="s462">That's my mother."</span> <span id="s463">I wasn't too happy.</span> <span id="s464">Because she had boys...only boys.</span> <span id="s465">Four boys.</span> <span id="s466">And they belonged to the AK.And I was going to find out that it's her mother, I wasn't so happy about it.</span> <span id="s467">I figured I'm afraid already, but I went.</span> <span id="s468">She took me overnight.</span> <span id="s469">She put me in a hiding place...in a shed there.</span> <span id="s470">And the next day she came in and she said to me...she cried for me.</span> <span id="s471">I could see her tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">01:27:52 "I'm sorry that I have to tell you to leave."</span> <span id="s473">I says "What, Mrs., we, we knew each other so many years, you were a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s474">Why do you telling me to leave?"</span> <span id="s475">She says "Look.</span> <span id="s476">First of all, you know what's going on.</span> <span id="s477">If they find you, I'll be killed and my children will be killed."</span> <span id="s478">So I said to her "Why should they find me by you?</span> <span id="s479">You're near to the field.</span> <span id="s480">They</span></p> <p><span id="s481">8 know (Yiddish) 9 Armia Krajowa (Home Army): One of the underground military organizations in occupied Poland; it existed from the fall of 1939 until January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">going around more, you know, inside the farms.</span> <span id="s483">Inside the people."</span> <span id="s484">She says "My daughters have boyfriends.</span> <span id="s485">German boyfriends.</span> <span id="s486">And they constantly by me.</span> <span id="s487">And they going around with dogs."</span> <span id="s488">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s489">They were going around with dogs to find Jewish people.</span> <span id="s490">I went...I went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: You're completely alone now?</span> <span id="s492">A: I'm alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: You didn't...did you see your husband get shot or...</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span> <span id="s495">He jumped and I jumped when we...we got right away separated.</span> <span id="s496">Because he was in...he was in a different place.</span> <span id="s497">Not in a different place.</span> <span id="s498">He was like in the train by the end and I maybe was in the middle.</span> <span id="s499">All I heard is "Norma, leave.</span> <span id="s500">Jump.</span> <span id="s501">Run.</span> <span id="s502">Jump."</span> <span id="s503">But I imagine... because if he would be alive he would find me or he would let himself know where I am.</span> <span id="s504">He knew, where I coming and he knew where I am going.</span> <span id="s505">But I never found him.</span> <span id="s506">And that remained.</span> <span id="s507">I never found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: We need to change the tape.</span> <span id="s509">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s510">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s511">02:00:38</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: When you were put on this train, you had, did you have any idea where it was heading?</span> <span id="s513">A: I know that people are going to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Because they started taking out Vengrov, when I was in Vengrov and then they went to Siedlce, and then they came back to Vengrov and they went back to Siedlce, I told you before, they kept going back and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: But how did you know Treblinka was the final destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: All the people from Vengrov, they went to Treblinka, which I know.</span> <span id="s518">Then when I went to Siedlce they said they going to Treblinka too.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Who said they were going...</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: People, people, people Jewish people find out where they going.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Oh, ok, I just don't, I didn't know how they found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Well you in contact with Jewish people...where you going, where this going...we going to Treblinka, we only know about Treblinka that time.</span> <span id="s523">I don't know if Auschwitz was later...</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: The reason I'm asking you is because since the people who went to Treblinka never left Treblinka, how did you get information about...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: There were some people left over.</span> <span id="s526">They were hiding.</span> <span id="s527">And they came back.</span> <span id="s528">I told you, they came back to the city.</span> <span id="s529">Because they said also the same.</span> <span id="s530">People said, "Oh, sizh shein gevorin.</span> <span id="s531">"They took out the people is not coming back, but they still came back for the rest of them.</span> <span id="s532">They knew that people were hiding and they coming back to the house.</span> <span id="s533">They knew.</span> <span id="s534">They were smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">10 It happened already.</span> <span id="s536">(Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So how long were you on the train and when did you jump?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Like I said, we went in the train maybe towards the evening.</span> <span id="s539">Like four o'clock...something like.</span> <span id="s540">It was no mind that time to keep minds of watches, of times or when you going or when you coming.</span> <span id="s541">You didn't know what's doing with you.</span> <span id="s542">You went.</span> <span id="s543">But the only thing that I remember distinctly that it must have been about two o'clock midnight when we start jumping because it took them time to work by the doors, to open them up.</span> <span id="s544">They had all kind of instruments to open up the doors.</span> <span id="s545">People in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Were there German guards on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s548">They had...not in...I don't know if they were...they probably did not have guards in the train.</span> <span id="s549">But they had guards outside.</span> <span id="s550">They had like...they, maybe they stood on the steps on the train outside, you know.</span> <span id="s551">Because they kept on killing whoever jumped.</span> <span id="s552">Whoever they caught jumping, they killed them right away, running out from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: They didn't see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Probably, because otherwise I wouldn't be alive.</span> <span id="s555">02:03:36</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: So...all right.</span> <span id="s557">You're all alone.</span> <span id="s558">You've had to leave this Polish woman's house.</span> <span id="s559">What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: What do I do?</span> <span id="s561">So I..</span> <span id="s562">.</span> <span id="s563">I go to another farm.</span> <span id="s564">And I have another woman...a Polish woman...and I go to her.</span> <span id="s565">And I, I thought that one of my brothers was not a well man.</span> <span id="s566">And he knew...in that place I went to, they had a farm.</span> <span id="s567">It wasn't really a farm...considered part of a farm.</span> <span id="s568">I knew that my brother is very familiar with that man.</span> <span id="s569">They had...he had a restaurant.</span> <span id="s570">He had a big restaurant and he was a very rich man.</span> <span id="s571">And he killed a lot of pigs, you know, meat.</span> <span id="s572">He had ...he was allowed to have liquor.</span> <span id="s573">But I knew also from that first woman from the farm I met...what I told you...she told me that she knows from good sources that one of my brother is alive.</span> <span id="s574">And I..</span> <span id="s575">.</span> <span id="s576">she told me the name so I knew that he's familiar with that man from the restaurant.</span> <span id="s577">Maybe he knows something, and maybe I could find that brother of mine.</span> <span id="s578">That was Christmastime.</span> <span id="s579">I don't remember it was a week before Christmas or a day before Christmas.</span> <span id="s580">This I don't know.</span> <span id="s581">But I know that I went there.</span> <span id="s582">Barefooted.</span> <span id="s583">In the snow in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Is this 1942 or...</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: '43.</span> <span id="s587">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I went there.</span> <span id="s589">I came in...that was the city where we used to live.</span> <span id="s590">The farm where we used to live but out of the farm, like on the field.</span> <span id="s591">I went there, I came in and there was a lot of Germans in the store.</span> <span id="s592">Not in the restaurant where they serve, but in the store.</span> <span id="s593">You know, to order something or buy something.</span> <span id="s594">And I also recognized somebody.</span> <span id="s595">One of my sisters...I don't know if this is interested to you.</span> <span id="s596">One of my sister...a friend...is there and I recognized his wife.</span> <span id="s597">But when I came in to her, I didn't come in straight right to her.</span> <span id="s598">I couldn't go in because I had to go in through that store.</span> <span id="s599">From the restaurant...to the restaurant store.</span> <span id="s600">So I couldn't because the Germans were sitting.</span> <span id="s601">It must have been about six o'clock.</span> <span id="s602">Dark...it was dark already.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">02:06:29 But when I came in, there was a corridor with a big...you know, big doors to close that place.</span> <span id="s604">So I went...it was just like this.</span> <span id="s605">You see?</span> <span id="s606">The door...this is the door, and I'm here.</span> <span id="s607">It's closed here.</span> <span id="s608">And I'm standing closed behind that door.</span> <span id="s609">Because I'm afraid to go into the store because the Germans are there.</span> <span id="s610">And I recognize that man, and I knew...she knew that he gave up Jewish people for a pound of sugar.</span> <span id="s611">That was a neighbor of ours.</span> <span id="s612">A best friend of my sister's.</span> <span id="s613">While I was standing, standing here...I'll never forget that, that picture.</span> <span id="s614">While I'm standing here, the owner's wife was passing by to the room where they served the people, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s615">And I..</span> <span id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s618">I'm shivering and I want, I want her to know that I'm here.</span> <span id="s619">So I said in Polish, "Pani Pocinska (ph)."</span> <span id="s620">And she recognized my voice.</span> <span id="s621">After so many years we weren't there.</span> <span id="s622">Maybe for 10, 15 years, she recognized my voice.</span> <span id="s623">She says, "Norma?"</span> <span id="s624">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s625">She says, "Shhh."</span> <span id="s626">So she went in and closed all the lights.</span> <span id="s627">The lights were supposed to be on, I think, only to eight or seven o'clock.</span> <span id="s628">I think until seven o'clock.</span> <span id="s629">To seven o'clock, I think the light was supposed to be only.</span> <span id="s630">She closed the light in the store and she closed the light where the people were sitting and eating, where I told you before, the, in the room.</span> <span id="s631">And she came back to me, she took me and she put me under the bed.</span> <span id="s632">She was very good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Didn't anybody wonder why the lights went off?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I'm telling you, it wasn't allowed to have lights a certain time.</span> <span id="s635">A certain time.</span> <span id="s636">I think it was seven...seven or eight.</span> <span id="s637">No, it must be at...when it got dark, you, you weren't allowed to have lights.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: So the Germans couldn't see in.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s640">When it got dark on the streets, the...there was no lights on the street.</span> <span id="s641">I mean, the time is when it gets dark so there weren't allowed to be lights.</span> <span id="s642">Not only in the restaurant, but even in the house you had to cover up the lights.</span> <span id="s643">Anyway, she took me in and pushed me in under the bed...under her daughter's bed.</span> <span id="s644">She had that one daughter.</span> <span id="s645">And then when they went away, she took me into the kitchen, where she gave me to eat.</span> <span id="s646">And I said to her, "Where's your husband?"</span> <span id="s647">And she says, "My husband's not here."</span> <span id="s648">She knew that I wanna stay.</span> <span id="s649">I says, "So where is he?"</span> <span id="s650">She says he's...he produced his own, let's say...how to say it?</span> <span id="s651">The Polish...the Polish food.</span> <span id="s652">Sausages, kielbasa...you know what kielbasa is?</span> <span id="s653">All kind of, of this Polish meat preserves.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">02:09:45 She, he did...he had a special place like where they don't cook it but they...they roast it or something, you know.</span> <span id="s655">They smoke it.</span> <span id="s656">They smoke it.</span> <span id="s657">They had a place where they smoking it.</span> <span id="s658">He had a separate place in the yard where he had a room and they smoked it.</span> <span id="s659">So she told me he's there with the workers.</span> <span id="s660">So she says, "Why do you need him?"</span> <span id="s661">I says, "I would like to talk to Pan Pocinski (ph)".</span> <span id="s662">Mr. Pocinski (ph).</span> <span id="s663">And she says, "He'll be coming in late."</span> <span id="s664">I says, "When is he gonna finish?"</span> <span id="s665">She says, "Oh, about twelve, one o'clock."</span> <span id="s666">And I wanted to know from her.</span> <span id="s667">I figured if she'll tell me that anybody's living yet in Vengrov, maybe they were hidden somewhere and now it's quiet, they came back.</span> <span id="s668">So I wanted to know if he know about it...something.</span> <span id="s669">If he knows about it, maybe I'll go to Vengrov.</span> <span id="s670">Back.</span> <span id="s671">Coming from...jumping from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s672">Anyway, I waited and I asked her, "Maybe you know something.</span> <span id="s673">I heard that a brother of mine, my brother, Fishel (ph)... he's in the picture...is alive."</span> <span id="s674">"Maybe you know where he is."</span> <span id="s675">"Oh, no, we don't know."</span> <span id="s676">She right away told me this.</span> <span id="s677">"We don't know; we never saw him."</span> <span id="s678">I said, "Maybe Pan Pocinski (ph) know."</span> <span id="s679">Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Pocinski (ph).</span> <span id="s681">She says, "I doubt" ...in Polish..."I doubt that he knows."</span> <span id="s682">She did...she...I don't know.</span> <span id="s683">I think she was afraid of him, that maybe he wouldn't want me to know.</span> <span id="s684">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s685">So anyway, that remained.</span> <span id="s686">I was there between seven and eight 'til about one o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s687">By one o'clock he came in.</span> <span id="s688">Meanwhile, I ate and I kept on saying if nobody's alive for me...if Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) and Schlomo (ph)... everybody went to Treblinka, they're not alive...what do I have to live?</span> <span id="s689">I have no money, I have no clothes on me.</span> <span id="s690">What do I have to live?</span> <span id="s691">Winter, cold, barefooted.</span> <span id="s692">I'm going to Vengrov.</span> <span id="s693">"Oh," she says, "they're going to kill you on the way."</span> <span id="s694">That's what she told me.</span> <span id="s695">"They going to kill you on the way, because they"...they was...I read about place that they kept on hiding and looking for Jews there.</span> <span id="s696">And on the way, you know, it was like woods.</span> <span id="s697">She says, "You wouldn't go there.</span> <span id="s698">They gonna kill you right away."</span> <span id="s699">And I kept on saying to her, "So what am I supposed to do?"</span> <span id="s700">Make her notice that maybe she'll keep me.</span> <span id="s701">And meanwhile he came in, one o'clock in the morning he came in.</span> <span id="s702">And the same thing, drink with him and this and that.</span> <span id="s703">So I says, "Look, I'm not in the mood.</span> <span id="s704">I ate.</span> <span id="s705">Your wife gave me to eat."</span> <span id="s706">And she put me in all kind of things in the pockets in the coat.</span> <span id="s707">But I had food to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">02:12:45 She thought maybe I will go.</span> <span id="s709">And he stopped me again.</span> <span id="s710">I said, "Do you know where Fishel (ph) is?"</span> <span id="s711">Fil (ph).</span> <span id="s712">He says, "No, I don't know Fil (ph).</span> <span id="s713">I didn't see him since the war started."</span> <span id="s714">But I heard a lot of rumors that he was...he was, in between the time that you could do some business, he was afraid for the Polish money.</span> <span id="s715">That they gonna discontinue the Polish money, so he wanted the change for American dollars.</span> <span id="s716">So my brother used to change him.</span> <span id="s717">Come and take the money, change them in the city for gold.</span> <span id="s718">Gold, gold pieces.</span> <span id="s719">American money.</span> <span id="s720">American gold.</span> <span id="s721">So I had the idea that he does this with him and he knew, but he didn't want to admit to me.</span> <span id="s722">And I was afraid to tell him that.</span> <span id="s723">You saw him and he...you probably know about him, maybe you heard about him.</span> <span id="s724">Everything went like, not noticing for sure, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s725">Finally, he gave in.</span> <span id="s726">But that, that picture, you should have seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Finally, he gave in.</span> <span id="s728">He says to me this way...he holds my hand and he says to me, "You really want to see him."</span> <span id="s729">You know, in Polish it has a little more meaning, more...more picture, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s730">"You really want to see him."</span> <span id="s731">And I said to him in Polish...I answered him, "Pan Pocinski (ph), do you think that that's the only one left, and I don't want to see him?"</span> <span id="s732">He let my hand go.</span> <span id="s733">And he said, he said something to her which I don't remember even...it's like a wink, with the eyes.</span> <span id="s734">And he took me by the hand and he takes me in that room where it was the dining room.</span> <span id="s735">Where the people used to eat.</span> <span id="s736">And on the way going to him, I had to go through that place, the corridor where I was hidden behind the door.</span> <span id="s737">The door from the first coming in.</span> <span id="s738">And he said to me on the way, "Don't tell me that you want to be with him."</span> <span id="s739">So and...that tell me that maybe he has a small place somewhere he is hiding him and he can't make the place bigger for somebody else, or something.</span> <span id="s740">But I knew in me that he wouldn't let me go.</span> <span id="s741">He took me in and my brother was laying on the floor.</span> <span id="s742">A little pillow and a little stool with a little blanket to cover himself up.</span> <span id="s743">He was sleeping.</span> <span id="s744">He said...he woke him up.</span> <span id="s745">He woke him up and he noticed that he's worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">02:15:49 So I remember distinctly what he said to him.</span> <span id="s747">"What's the matter, they by you?"</span> <span id="s748">In Polish.</span> <span id="s749">That means that the Germans came into him in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s750">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s751">He was doing things where he wasn't allowed to do and my brother knew it.</span> <span id="s752">He was killing too much pigs.</span> <span id="s753">He was, he had rationing...he had tickets, so much he's allowed to kill.</span> <span id="s754">But he was doing more.</span> <span id="s755">And my brother knew about it and everybody knew that he's killing too much in the place.</span> <span id="s756">Anyway, so he woke him up and my brother said to him he probably knew that maybe it was before I came also the same story...somebody...he came in and woke him up and he threw him.</span> <span id="s757">He made in the corner of the room...he took out four boards and he made a tunnel.</span> <span id="s758">He was outside constantly.</span> <span id="s759">Like during the daytime, and he slept outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">You know, in the room.</span> <span id="s761">But God forbid if they came in, if he knew that they here and maybe they'll come in, he shoveled him in, in that tunnel.</span> <span id="s762">You know, he made that tunnel there and he covered our back with the boards, he didn't make the boards separate, he made like a door from the boards.</span> <span id="s763">And on the, on the door was a machine, a Singer's machine, a sewing machine to demonstrate that nothing is there, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s764">So he pushed him in there.</span> <span id="s765">So that's why he asked him, "What's the matter, they here?"</span> <span id="s766">My brother asked him, "What's the matter, they here?"</span> <span id="s767">He says, "No, your sister is here."</span> <span id="s768">He was, you know, sleepy and he didn't know...he couldn't believe, because the train who went to Treblinka with those people from Siedlce the second time wasn't too far.</span> <span id="s769">They went in...they went through our, our farm.</span> <span id="s770">So he knew that it was another train going into Treblinka.</span> <span id="s771">So he was very scared.</span> <span id="s772">He didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s773">A sister surviving yet, from that train?</span> <span id="s774">Well, anyway, I was there the rest of the couple of hours was still dark, the nighttime.</span> <span id="s775">And then he came in about nine o'clock in the morning and he said to me, "So what do you intend to do, Norma?</span> <span id="s776">Your brother is gonna stay here.</span> <span id="s777">I would not throw him out.</span> <span id="s778">What's gonna be with you?"</span></p> <p><span id="s779">02:18:35 And I'm speechless.</span> <span id="s780">What can I tell him?</span> <span id="s781">I says, "Look, Pan Pocinski (ph), whatever you decide is good with me."</span> <span id="s782">That means whatever he wants to do with me, let him do.</span> <span id="s783">I'm in his hands now.</span> <span id="s784">I can't go to Vengrov and I can't stay here, so what am I gonna do?</span> <span id="s785">He wants to kill me, let him kill me.</span> <span id="s786">He says, "Look, I'll take in more shovels, we make the tunnel bigger and you stay with your brother as long as I'm alive."</span> <span id="s787">And that was that.</span> <span id="s788">But being...I told you in the beginning, my brother was a sick man.</span> <span id="s789">He got sick because he was...right in the beginning he was in the woods and he got sick on the kidneys.</span> <span id="s790">So he says, "You gonna stay together with him as long as I live and as long as I can do something for you."</span> <span id="s791">Because he was very friendly with our family and that's it.</span> <span id="s792">So they went...we stay in there for about four months together with my brother.</span> <span id="s793">If anything happens, we went into that bunker.</span> <span id="s794">Took off the machine and then we went in and put back the machine on.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: What did you do in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: In the daytime, we were out.</span> <span id="s797">We were in the, in the room.</span> <span id="s798">Q: You're working or...</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Well, what kind of work?</span> <span id="s800">We were sitting and looking out.</span> <span id="s801">The windows was closed with thick curtains that the outside shouldn't, we saw outside, but the outside couldn't see us, you know.</span> <span id="s802">So we were sitting and watching, we were reading, my brother was praying.</span> <span id="s803">We had praying book.</span> <span id="s804">I remember like now that it was before Passover, because that everything happens in the winter time.</span> <span id="s805">She said to my brother, "I know that it's the meaning, you have to eat matzo.</span> <span id="s806">You're not allowed to eat bread."</span> <span id="s807">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s808">So she, they had a oven, so she had...she made the oven and she gave him flour.</span> <span id="s809">And I made the dough and we baked matzos.</span> <span id="s810">We baked a couple, a couple pound, about five pound flour.</span> <span id="s811">The meaning from the matzo, for Passover.</span> <span id="s812">And then my brother got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s813">And I don't know if I should tell you that she wanted...they wanted to save us.</span> <span id="s814">They wanted so much to save us.</span> <span id="s815">When he got very, very sick already, she went away to Sokolow...that's nearer than Siedlce...to a city which she had a doctor.</span> <span id="s816">Very, you know ...probably everybody who has a doctor is very close to the doctor.</span> <span id="s817">And she said a lie to him, to the doctor, that my brother..."My father is such a sick man that I can't even bring him to you."</span></p> <p><span id="s818">02:21:39 But I..</span> <span id="s819">.</span> <span id="s820">she took a bottle of his phena (ph) medication, prescription, and she said, "I want that prescription again.</span> <span id="s821">They don't want to give me no medications from that prescription because it's already overdue."</span> <span id="s822">The time, you know, when the prescription ...like six months later, or whatever later.</span> <span id="s823">And the doctor was supposed...that's what she told us.</span> <span id="s824">The doctor said, "You don't have a, a father.</span> <span id="s825">Your father's not sick.</span> <span id="s826">You having a Jew there."</span> <span id="s827">And while he said there that you have a Jew, she escaped from him.</span> <span id="s828">And she came back home and she told us this.</span> <span id="s829">She told me, not him.</span> <span id="s830">And a couple weeks later, he died.</span> <span id="s831">And I buried him.</span> <span id="s832">I don't know if he's still there, but I buried him with my bare hands.</span> <span id="s833">He made the cave.</span> <span id="s834">He made the cave, and I buried him, my brother, there.</span> <span id="s835">That was a orchard behind the, the building.</span> <span id="s836">Behind the house was a orchard.</span> <span id="s837">So I don't know this, but she told me this story that they asked him, "In case something happens, where do you want to be buried?"</span> <span id="s838">So he told them, "Bury me under that and that tree, a pear tree."</span> <span id="s839">So that was the pear tree where he was buried.</span> <span id="s840">I used to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So now you're all alone...</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Now I'm all alone and I have nobody in Vengrov.</span> <span id="s843">Meanwhile, in between that time, they took out my two brothers.</span> <span id="s844">Two brothers were remained with...they had those business that I told you.</span> <span id="s845">They kept him such a long time.</span> <span id="s846">They had to teach him the business.</span> <span id="s847">They taught him the business and they took out everything, all the letters, all the valuable things and the machines, and they took them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s848">The reason why I'm telling you this, that then I heard when that man was working there by the glasses, what I mention before, my husband said it's not true.</span> <span id="s849">What he have to... what was pushing him to say that he said that he wants those two people to help him because it's too much work for him?</span> <span id="s850">He was sorting the glasses that the people took off, like my husband told you, that everything went in place, pants and underwear, that's separate.</span> <span id="s851">And this separate, and glasses separate, whatever gold separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Everything went separates places.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: This is a man separating clothes in Treblinka?</span> <span id="s854">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">02:24:23</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s858">So anyway, that's what I heard.</span> <span id="s859">He told me, that man who died, Reizman (ph), that he went over to somebody, the highest rank, and he told them that Moishe (ph) and Mendel (ph) is here, and I would like maybe you could give him help, because it's too much for me to do.</span> <span id="s860">And it's a lot of people came in there and a lot of people wearing glasses, so maybe they could help me.</span> <span id="s861">So they put him the same day in the fire.</span> <span id="s862">So that's what I know, I know while I was running around from one place to the other that Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) is not alive.</span> <span id="s863">And I have nobody.</span> <span id="s864">And that was the, the thing.</span> <span id="s865">But I also then find out...in, in that town I live through the...I was there 'til the last minute we got liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: At this restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: At this restaurant, I was there.</span> <span id="s868">I was there 'til I got liberated.</span> <span id="s869">But when I got liberated, I went to Vengrov.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: So you were, so you were at this home, this restaurant, for how long, do you think?</span> <span id="s871">Totally?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: About a year.</span> <span id="s873">Maybe more.</span> <span id="s874">Like I told you before, it was no time, not time, time we had plenty.</span> <span id="s875">We didn't have a lot to do with ourselves.</span> <span id="s876">But was nothing in the mind to remember what day it is and what time it is or what month it is.</span> <span id="s877">Who was thinking about it?</span> <span id="s878">We were want that the day should go faster, maybe we'll live through this, this trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Now when were you liberated, and by whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I was liberated by Russians.</span> <span id="s881">When I went away to Siedlce and when everything finished and the war finished, I went back to Vengrov.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: No, but, but when you were liberated by Russians, did you actually see Russians or you just knew the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s884">I was in the woods, like I said, again...</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Oh, you weren't in this house with the restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I went away from there to Vengrov near...there was near woods there.</span> <span id="s887">So I was there.</span> <span id="s888">But still the Russians, Germans were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Oh, I thought you stayed in the house until liberation.</span> <span id="s890">I'm sorry, I'm very confused.</span> <span id="s891">It's my fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: I was staying in that house 'til the liberation, 'til the Germans left.</span> <span id="s893">It was still Germans, and we were still afraid of them.</span> <span id="s894">The Germans were there and the Russians start to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">02:27:13 But I went in, in the woods, and from the woods I went in somebody what I knew to also where they live in a farm there, their own farm.</span> <span id="s896">And he went out, there was shooting around right away.</span> <span id="s897">The Russians were shooting to the Germans and the Germans were shooting to the Russians the airplanes were running.</span> <span id="s898">So one fellow came in, a young man came in and he kept on yelling, "The Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s899">The Russians are coming."</span> <span id="s900">So I jumped out from the (undecipherable), where the Russians are.</span> <span id="s901">That the Russians...we liberated, the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s902">They took it over.</span> <span id="s903">Meanwhile, I was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: By...</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: By the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Unintentionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Unintentionally.</span> <span id="s908">Of course.</span> <span id="s909">Because I was running where the Russians.</span> <span id="s910">Q: Why did you ever leave the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: They were afraid.</span> <span id="s912">And I was...I can't say that I, I felt that, that maybe they gonna be killed or something, but I couldn't have in me that because of me they should be killed.</span> <span id="s913">They wanted the good for me and for my brother.</span> <span id="s914">Why should they be killed because of me?</span> <span id="s915">They killed them anyway.</span> <span id="s916">They killed them anyway...her and him.</span> <span id="s917">One day they came in, they came in to eat breakfast at the restaurant and they served them and when they went to the buffet to pay, they ask how much they want.</span> <span id="s918">And they told him how much he want...the bill is.</span> <span id="s919">They took out the gun, they killed them both.</span> <span id="s920">The daughter was in the church, so she remained alive.</span> <span id="s921">She's still alive, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: So here in the woods, you got shot by a mistaken bullet... A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s923">No, I got shot when...by the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: By the...when the...we went out, like I said.</span> <span id="s926">We went out to look at the Russians and the Germans are fighting in the air.</span> <span id="s927">They shooting.</span> <span id="s928">So we went out to look, we wanted that the Russians should come in because we knew that that's the way it's gonna finish and maybe we'll be liberated.</span> <span id="s929">So while we were running around outside, I got shot here.</span> <span id="s930">I don't know if it's still there, because it's a long time.</span> <span id="s931">It wasn't a big wound.</span> <span id="s932">It healed itself.</span> <span id="s933">And that...I never found my husband.</span> <span id="s934">Then I went back to Vengrov.</span> <span id="s935">I was back and forth.</span> <span id="s936">And he came from his city.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Did you feel that you were finally free?</span> <span id="s938">Was this...I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s939">We have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s940">02:30:00 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s941">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s942">03:00:36</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: You went back to Vengrov after you were liberated...</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: After I was liberated, I was hiding by, hiding by, before we were liberated and I went away to that good friend of ours, we were a month in a shack where they keeping...how do they say hay in English?</span> <span id="s945">Hay?</span> <span id="s946">Do you know what hay means?</span> <span id="s947">What they feeding the horses and the cows.</span> <span id="s948">They take out...the grass dries out and they, they put it back in the shack.</span> <span id="s949">They have it for the winter for the cows and the horses.</span> <span id="s950">So we went into...one place the farmer didn't know that we were there, we hiding there.</span> <span id="s951">But then he find us and he kept us for a little while.</span> <span id="s952">We paid him.</span> <span id="s953">When my brother died, he had gold pieces, which he was supposed to give to him, you know, like I said.</span> <span id="s954">Changing the money.</span> <span id="s955">So of course I had it with me.</span> <span id="s956">So we went in...I met...as a matter of fact, not that I met.</span> <span id="s957">That same woman, she was a good and very friendly to us...with the two daughters...the first one.</span> <span id="s958">She told me that there was some boys in this-and this-city going around the...you know, people used to go around at night and beg for bread or potato or something.</span> <span id="s959">So they probably used to come to her, too.</span> <span id="s960">She knew them.</span> <span id="s961">They weren't too far from her living.</span> <span id="s962">So she told me that if you want, I could tell those boys...there's one woman with them in Siedlce with a husband...so maybe you could connect with them and not being alone.</span> <span id="s963">So I was a couple of months with them, before the liberation.</span> <span id="s964">So that's what I know her, she was, she was so good.</span> <span id="s965">They were afraid for themself and I don't blame them.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: After liberation, you first went back to Vengrov?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: After I was liberated, the next day I went to Vengrov.</span> <span id="s968">Q: What did you find there?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">03:03:02</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Coming in, coming into the city, I met a man.</span> <span id="s971">I didn't recognize him.</span> <span id="s972">I know him, because he was a customer by my brother's.</span> <span id="s973">He was...he get orders for the shoes but he had to make the bottoms.</span> <span id="s974">So my brother made the tops and he made the bottoms.</span> <span id="s975">So he recognized me.</span> <span id="s976">One of the brothers that he say they burned him.</span> <span id="s977">Mendel (ph).</span> <span id="s978">He said to me, "You know that Mendel's (ph) daughter is alive?"</span> <span id="s979">He had two sons and one daughter.</span> <span id="s980">I don't know how he knows.</span> <span id="s981">I never asked him how he knows.</span> <span id="s982">You had to be careful with everything, you understand this.</span> <span id="s983">But I asked him, "Where?</span> <span id="s984">Where is she?"</span> <span id="s985">So he told us that he heard...he didn't want to say that he knows for sure...he heard that she's with this-and-this people which they used to live in the same section where my brother lived.</span> <span id="s986">So my brother gave away the rest what he possessed, with some money probably, I'm sure of it.</span> <span id="s987">Because they wouldn't keep that money, that he should save that daughter.</span> <span id="s988">The sons were killed in Treblinka, two sons.</span> <span id="s989">So they kept her and she's alive.</span> <span id="s990">The reason why she is alive is, when I got connected with my sister, I told her that my brother Mendel's (ph) daughter is alive and she...</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Your sister in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: In America, sure.</span> <span id="s993">I didn't have another sister.</span> <span id="s994">And here in this country they had clubs, or whatever they call it, where they used to go out...what do you call it?</span> <span id="s995">I forgot how to call it.</span> <span id="s996">They had people where they, they used to take out people...Polish...take out children from Polish people.</span> <span id="s997">You probably heard about it, right?</span> <span id="s998">Did you?</span> <span id="s999">No, you were too young to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1000">They used to have, you know, agencies where they used to go out to Europe to take out Jewish children from Polish people, where they survived there.</span> <span id="s1001">So my sister find out, while she knew that her brother's, that my brother's child is alive, the daughter, she knew about it.</span> <span id="s1002">And they had somebody who, he was a little bit macher.You know, to go to Europe to take out the children from Polish people.</span> <span id="s1003">So he got in touch with them.</span> <span id="s1004">My sister then got in touch with them, through him and they took her away from her.</span> <span id="s1005">They went there probably with an airplane.</span> <span id="s1006">Otherwise, they didn't go, they didn't have any other communications to go to Europe, from America to Europe.</span> <span id="s1007">They came with an airplane and they...she didn't want to give it to her, give away to her.</span> <span id="s1008">She had one daughter, too, that woman.</span> <span id="s1009">The Polish woman.</span> <span id="s1010">So she said...she didn't have even an idea what a dollar is ...how much a dollar is.</span> <span id="s1011">So she said she wants thousand dollar.</span> <span id="s1012">Thousand dollar, she wants thousand dollars so they gave her thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s1013">She said thousand dollars, they gave her thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s1014">The, the girl, the daughter, took care on that...on my niece.</span> <span id="s1015">I showed her to you, my niece.</span> <span id="s1016">So while they took...and they took her first probably, they knew how to go on with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">03:06:49 They took her first on the plane and they ran away.</span> <span id="s1018">So she was acquainted with a lot of Germans.</span> <span id="s1019">She used to live with a lot of Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s1020">She was one of those nice girls.</span> <span id="s1021">So she connected a soldier, a German, and they took her...they ran away to stop the plane but they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">(William Schneidermann interjects.)</span> <span id="s1023">They were still Germans.</span> <span id="s1024">They are living, they were living, what are you talking?</span> <span id="s1025">They were still living while when they took her away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Ok, so what did you do next?</span> <span id="s1027">You're in the town...did the town look the same to you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: What I did next, I didn't have money because I paid out all my money to that farmer where they kept me, you know.</span> <span id="s1029">And he also told me that some family...I never knew that this... they carried the same name.</span> <span id="s1030">Second name.</span> <span id="s1031">But I never knew that they really family, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">But they had the same name.</span> <span id="s1033">So when he told me that my brother's daughter is alive and she's this-and-this people, he also told me, "You have some cousins, they survived.</span> <span id="s1034">They 11 someone who arranges things, has connections (Yiddish) here."</span> <span id="s1035">And they were in the leather business.</span> <span id="s1036">Just the leather business they were handling.</span> <span id="s1037">So I figured, cousins.</span> <span id="s1038">They say that I'm a cousin.</span> <span id="s1039">So I'll try to go in there.</span> <span id="s1040">So I went in there and we were cousins.</span> <span id="s1041">But I was like a maid to them.</span> <span id="s1042">I had to wash, I had to cook, I had to clean to have food.</span> <span id="s1043">And that was the rest of my life, until...</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Until what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: I met...I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: You met who?</span> <span id="s1047">He's not in

got acquainted with that family.</span> <span id="s1055">There was a..</span> <span id="s1056">.</span> <span id="s1057">practically the whole family survived.</span> <span id="s1058">Two girls, and brothers?</span> <span id="s1059">What was it?</span> <span id="s1060">The ketzalach.Three brothers and two girls.</span> <span id="s1061">I know there were two girls.</span> <span id="s1062">Three brothers and two girls were in the family.</span> <span id="s1063">And they weren't, like he said to you before from the big workers they didn't know, they were rich people, you know.</span> <span id="s1064">They used to have a maid.</span> <span id="s1065">So I was the maid.</span> <span id="s1066">And that came to the end, until I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">03:09:37</span></p>
