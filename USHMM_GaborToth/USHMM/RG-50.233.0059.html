pay the fare, he was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Interviewer: That’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s228">Do you know if he ever thought of bringing over the rest of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Katalin: No, because a lot of family was over there in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Interviewer: And he couldn’t bring them over, he couldn’t afford to?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Katalin: No.</span> <span id="s232">They couldn’t afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Interviewer: How did he pay the fare, I wonder, of the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Katalin: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s235">Maybe they had already the money from their father what he sent to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Interviewer: So we’re talking about Jacob Katz, your second husband’s father, who visited several times in the 1920s?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Katalin: Maybe 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Interviewer: But in the 1930s, he probably did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Katalin: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s240">Maybe he sent them money to her daughters to come over.</span> <span id="s241">You see that when he came to America he saved money and then sent back to Hungary for her daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Interviewer: All right.</span> <span id="s243">Did your husband ever talk about his mother’s side of the family at all?</span> <span id="s244">Do you know anything about the mother’s side of the family?</span></p> <p><span

doesn’t have to go to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s681">But he had to go twice a week to the police station, and tell them that I am here because he couldn’t leave the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Interviewer: Let’s backtrack a little bit.</span> <span id="s683">Between 1935 and 1940, when all the Jewish men in the village, how many people would you say lived in this

id="s698">Katalin: Yes.</span> <span id="s699">But we didn’t have enough, for example, tobaccos, no sugars.</span> <span id="s700">We couldn’t get it because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s701">They didn’t let us buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Interviewer: Was there anything else besides tobacco and sugar?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Katalin: Yes.</span> <span id="s704">A lot
