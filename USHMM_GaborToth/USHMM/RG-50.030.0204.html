small place, small town...uh...near what was at that time before the first world war...uh...the Austrian/Russian boarder because that part of Poland was...uh...in the Austria...Austria...I think they called it Austria/Hungarian empire.</span> <span id="s12">Austria/Hungarian I don't know how...how you would say that in English really.</span> <span id="s13">Uh...And the grandparents also came from very close to that place.</span> <span id="s14">They lived there til the outbreak of the first world war, 1914, when my father was indoctrinated into the Austrian Army and Mother...uh...who at that time was pregnant with my older sister, Leah and we called her Toni...uh...fled from that area...took her mother along ”by the name of Freda and...uh...fled to Vienna.</span> <span id="s15">My oldest sister was born on the way in Hungary.</span> <span id="s16">Uh...Ever since then until they had to escape from Vienna after the Nazis came in in 1938,...uh... we lived...we lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s17">As a matter of fact, as far as I know we lived in the same house until the last 2 or 3 months of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s19">Tell me...uh...please a little bit about your father's occupation.</span> <span id="s20">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: After my father was demobilized from the army...uh...he... uh... built up a..</span> <span id="s22">.</span> <span id="s23">uh... wine business and over a period of 20 years he built it into a very substantial wine wholesale business.</span> <span id="s24">Uh...finally, we had...uh...large cellars in the...I think it was in the 18th District in ”I....I remember the place very well.</span> <span id="s25">It is a magnificent large court yard with chestnut trees...uh...three offices...uh...and extensive underground cellars.</span> <span id="s26">At least I was very impressive by the fact that they were...uh....uh...barrels of wine higher than I was, which wasn't very difficult.</span> <span id="s27">I wasn't very tall at the time, but they were about the height of a man.</span> <span id="s28">And...uh...there were rows and rows of them.</span> <span id="s29">And there was an escalator going down...uh...along which I guess they were transferring the barrels into bottles and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s30">And he supplied mainly restaurants and hotels.</span> <span id="s31">Some of the wine we also imported from other countries, like Yugoslavia and I expect Hungary and so on.</span> <span id="s32">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: You as a child!</span> <span id="s34">Tell me a little bit about your childhood.</span> <span id="s35">Did you go to school?</span> <span id="s36">Did you have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">Well, uh...first of all, what I..</span> <span id="s39">.</span> <span id="s40">I have to say something in general about the nature of my memories.</span> <span id="s41">Uh...the Nazi period stretches across...uh...the landscape of my memories of my mind almost like a Chinese war.</span> <span id="s42">You can...there are chinks here and there.</span> <span id="s43">You can look through them.</span> <span id="s44">You can catch a glimpse of some of the things that happened beyond the war...before it, but...uh...this...this huge war has cast a long shadow, both backwards and forwards, and really dominates the landscape.</span> <span id="s45">But I do remember some of the things.</span> <span id="s46">Uh...We were substantially a middle class family.</span> <span id="s47">As I say, we always lived in the same house in which really means a street of front gardens.</span> <span id="s48">Each apartment house had little front gardens.</span> <span id="s49">I remember vividly these were beautiful gardens with...uh...flower beds...uh...carnations, forget me naught, roses...uh...and huge lilies.</span> <span id="s50">This was lilies I believe.</span> <span id="s51">Uh...The house itself...uh...uh...was really properly built.</span> <span id="s52">You know, in...in Vienna, you had houses that were built for centuries...uh...marble and...and brass and...and oak to us and so on and so forth, absolutely beautifully fitted out.</span> <span id="s53">Uh...At first we lived on the third floor and then we moved down stairs to a mezzanine, which is a kind of half floor.</span> <span id="s54">It's almost on the level of the second floor as they would call it here because the ground floor is called the first floor in...in...in America.</span> <span id="s55">Uh...We always had as far...as long as I remember it any way, live in maids.</span> <span id="s56">These were generally girls who came from the country and...uh...Mother...uh... was a very...uh... friendly and compassionate person.</span> <span id="s57">She was always... always busy in the house, mainly on cooking which was at that time a task that...that took up a good part of the day.</span> <span id="s58">Uh...The house was sparkling.</span> <span id="s59">Uh...I was a bookworm.</span> <span id="s60">I remember lying on my belly on the floor and seeing my reflection in the linoleum.</span> <span id="s61">Uh...I was lost in books.</span> <span id="s62">Uh...But I also had friends out in the streets and...uh...used to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with those little marbles which at that time were clay, glossy clay balls.</span> <span id="s63">As a matter of fact, some were glass, but I liked the clay better because they were so beautifully colored.</span> <span id="s64">Uh...I do remember vividly.</span> <span id="s65">Now before...before I come to the elementary school, I want to say that there were two...uh...facts that I vividly recall.</span> <span id="s66">First of all, I had a rather strict father.</span> <span id="s67">And that was very much in accordance with the fashion of the times.</span> <span id="s68">These were patriotic figures.</span> <span id="s69">And I loved him very much.</span> <span id="s70">I remember the intense joy that I had when I heard the... his key grating in the lock.</span> <span id="s71">I knew it was my father's key.</span> <span id="s72">And I knew more or less what time he would come home.</span> <span id="s73">Mother was a very affectionate woman.</span> <span id="s74">I am afraid that she...uh...she spoiled me.</span> <span id="s75">She was over-protective.</span> <span id="s76">She was always hovering over me when I was eating.</span> <span id="s77">The side effect, of course, was that I became the worst eater in Europe.</span> <span id="s78">I mean it just came to a point that I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or milk or whatever and not feel sick.</span> <span id="s79">I was a very, very bad eater.</span> <span id="s80">Yal.</span> <span id="s81">So that...that...that was...that was a strong memory.</span> <span id="s82">Uh...Somehow...uh...I was very much of a dreamer.</span> <span id="s83">Books were my world of escape.</span> <span id="s84">And I managed to enter this world and close the door behind me and live in it for a long time.</span> <span id="s85">Elementary school was just around the corner.</span> <span id="s86">Uh...Well around the corner.</span> <span id="s87">It was in a part of the street called, oddly enough, means beautiful street.</span> <span id="s88">It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that street, but the elementary school was called at the time.</span> <span id="s89">And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very independent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing.</span> <span id="s90">As I said, I was over-protected, and...uh...it was difficult for me to separate myself from home and go to school in the first place.</span> <span id="s91">But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the principal of the school, I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can see his friendly face.</span> <span id="s92">He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe.</span> <span id="s93">Uh...so he spoke a perfect German.</span> <span id="s94">I suspect that he might even have been born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s95">But, of course, you know, the Austrian empire at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated.</span> <span id="s96">At that time when I was born and Czechoslavakia was already an independent country.</span> <span id="s97">But before that it was part of the empire.</span> <span id="s98">Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me whom I loved more, my mother or him.</span> <span id="s99">I was intensely embarrassed.</span> <span id="s100">I'm telling this story to show that...uh...uh...Vienna was a place of mixed emotions for me.</span> <span id="s101">Anti-Semitism was endemic in Vienna but there were loving persons, of course.</span> <span id="s102">There were individuals who and I did experience affection and love from some of them.</span> <span id="s103">As a matter of fact, when he asked me this question, the door opened and Mother came in.</span> <span id="s104">(Laughter) So that just adds to my embarrassment.</span> <span id="s105">(Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one.</span> <span id="s106">Subsequently, we had a..</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">a teacher by the name of Kanote.</span> <span id="s109">Uh...and...uh...she also singled me out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students because I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody.</span> <span id="s110">I am today for instance Professor at Rutgers University and...uh...I am very much guided by...uh...maybe this experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students.</span> <span id="s111">I like all the kids there.</span> <span id="s112">Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets.</span> <span id="s113">I was the Jewish.</span> <span id="s114">The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who is the son of policeman.</span> <span id="s115">I remember all these things so.</span> <span id="s116">.</span> <span id="s117">so.</span> <span id="s118">.</span> <span id="s119">so vividly.</span> <span id="s120">Uh...The reason I mention this again was to show you a little bit of the atmosphere there.</span> <span id="s121">Uh...And I remember one occasion when...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt going with a..</span> <span id="s122">.</span> <span id="s123">with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class.</span> <span id="s124">And she asked me to monitor the class.</span> <span id="s125">And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of rowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned about myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that in....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways of controlling myself, of being in...in complete possession of myself and consequently of the situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s126">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Let's talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Right...Well.</span> <span id="s129">.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: When the Nazis came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">At that time...uh...that was, of course, I believe...uh... the date was the 11th of March, 1938.</span> <span id="s133">And...uh...We had at that time a live-in maid by the name of Fritzi Shumberger.</span> <span id="s134">The reason I mention her was she did play a little bit of a role afterwards and also she had a little emblem on her lapel.</span> <span id="s135">It was .</span> <span id="s136">It was...uh...in the shape of a boot, and subsequently we learned that it was the emblem of the leading Nazis.</span> <span id="s137">I say illegal because before the Nazis marched in, the Nazi party was not legal in Austria.</span> <span id="s138">However, personally, she was not...uh...hostile to us and I don't think that she behaved badly when all is said and done.</span> <span id="s139">Uh...I do remember the speech of Shoosnick who was at that time Chancellor, ” Chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I was...I was in that apartment...in our apartment in 186 204.</span> <span id="s142">That was the first apartment on the left side...uh...as you came into the house and stepped up quite a number of steps.</span> <span id="s143">Uh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do recall...uh...some of the words he said.</span> <span id="s144">I believe he said To the death with red, white red, which is the color of the Austrian flag.</span> <span id="s145">Red, white, red.</span> <span id="s146">Uh...At least my memory tells me that he said the things that he said.</span> <span id="s147">And...uh...Fritzi Shumberger, that maid, and my brother next to me (clearing throat) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s148">Guess I'll have to drink something.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: (Drinking water) Uh...My brother Leo.</span> <span id="s151">He was the next oldest.</span> <span id="s152">I was the youngest in a family of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most of the time.</span> <span id="s153">And...and what separated me from the next one was a period of 6 years, very substantial.</span> <span id="s154">But the other three...uh...were only separated in terms of 2 years and there was... So really there were two families.</span> <span id="s155">It was they and I. I always regarded myself as an outsider and I expect it was because of that large separation of time.</span> <span id="s156">Anyway, Leo was there and Fritzi and she said something, "Oh wonderful and so on and so forth."</span> <span id="s157">Uh...Because obviously, I think she was going out with somebody who was a Nazi and they...they were very joyful about Hitler coming in.</span> <span id="s158">As a matter of fact, many Austrians were....uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s160">I'm confused.</span> <span id="s161">Who was joyful.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Fritzi Shumberger, our... our maid was very joyful about it and many Austrians were.</span> <span id="s163">In any case...uh...and my brother remarked...he made some kind of...uh...negative remark about it, saying that...uh...,you know, there may not be that much reason to be happy.</span> <span id="s164">I..</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">In any case...I do...I do remember that.</span> <span id="s167">I also remember the next day looking out.</span> <span id="s168">First of all, there were...there were bombers going...coming overhead.</span> <span id="s169">Hugh, hugh...uh...machines, droning and very low, almost...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the tops of the houses.</span> <span id="s170">Black, black planes.</span> <span id="s171">They looked black to me or maybe that's just a psychological memory.</span> <span id="s172">Uh...And every house was draped with a spastic of flags.</span> <span id="s173">Every house!</span> <span id="s174">And these were hugh flags.</span> <span id="s175">I am talking about apartment houses, five floors.</span> <span id="s176">And these were flags that...that went from the roof right almost down to the...to the sidewalk and I should imagine that...uh...there was a very active, highly organized Nazi underground movement.</span> <span id="s177">And they distributed all these these flags over night.</span> <span id="s178">Also, there were many Nazis in all the houses.</span> <span id="s179">There was a substantial proportion of Austrians and Nazis.</span> <span id="s180">Austria has always...uh... managed to portray itself only as the victim and I have to say most emphatically...and I don't want to be unjust to the many people in Austria who were good people and kind people...but there was a large population of haters in Austria.</span> <span id="s181">And I don't think there was a single country in the world that embraced Hitler so fervently as the Austrian nation.</span> <span id="s182">And those of us who were there know it, experienced it.</span> <span id="s183">Uh...I do remember that...uh...somehow or other I managed to either to allow my mother to go out or slip...I probably slipped out.</span> <span id="s184">And I went pretty far afield because I found myself...uh...and this was probably not on the first week.</span> <span id="s185">It was probably some weeks after the entry.</span> <span id="s186">But it was a time when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in a procession.</span> <span id="s187">I remember him...I remember him standing in a motor car, standing upright.</span> <span id="s188">It was an open...uh... car.</span> <span id="s189">And the sidewalks were thronged with people.</span> <span id="s190">I mean there was just one mass of people all waving and shouting and...and...and jubilant.</span> <span id="s191">Uh...There was an ecstasy of joy.</span> <span id="s192">And I was standing there very quietly observing this.</span> <span id="s193">Uh...At that time...uh...people who knew you before suddenly didn't know you.</span> <span id="s194">(Clearing throat) In our apartment house, we had...uh...there were quite a number of Jewish families in our apartment house.</span> <span id="s195">Uh...There were not many Gentile families, but I think... There were probably...it was probably half half.</span> <span id="s196">There might have been three or four...of two I know definitely that they were Nazis.</span> <span id="s197">Uh...One was called Garla, and he will appear later on because he tried to blackmail my father and caused his arrest.</span> <span id="s198">Uh...and the other one was Sargi, and this Sargi, you know, there was this special story there because they are...there was daughter and two sons.</span> <span id="s199">The two sons had been friends of my brothers.</span> <span id="s200">But the friendship, I think had already more or less fizzled out...uh...uh...maybe a year or two before the Nazis came, but...uh...actually entered, but obviously, it was probably on the side of their becoming Nazis.</span> <span id="s201">One was called Franz and the other Willi.</span> <span id="s202">Willi Sargi became an SS man, and Franz Sargi became an SR man.</span> <span id="s203">Uh...And it's...they...they never personally undertook any action against us, these people.</span> <span id="s204">And as a matter of fact, the daughter...I don't know her name...who was working...uh...as probably some secretary in the police headquarters, local police headquarters, was helpful to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I don't recall the exact circumstances.</span> <span id="s207">I think it probably was...it might have been connected with the arrest of my father.</span> <span id="s208">I am going to talk about it a little later on.</span> <span id="s209">But I know that my mother went...uh...to her and I seem to remember that when she came back that she said some nice things about...about her.</span> <span id="s210">But I don't remember the exact circumstances.</span> <span id="s211">I wasn't even told exactly what happened at that time.</span> <span id="s212">Uh...If I can stop a moment here because I have a sense that there was something happening...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Can you hold...hold the tape a minute?</span> <span id="s214">Is that what you what you would like to do.</span> <span id="s215">H</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Can you stop the tape a minute.</span> <span id="s218">Tell me when it's on Bonnie.</span> <span id="s219">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: One of the things that...that I remember vividly...uh...was, of course, the fact that...uh...shortly after...uh...the annexation...uh...we had to stay there.</span> <span id="s221">And there was a..</span> <span id="s222">.</span> <span id="s223">some obvious peculiar about celebrating festival of freedom of liberation.</span> <span id="s224">And I do remember my father sitting there at the table and saying...uh...that he really didn't have the heart to do it.</span> <span id="s225">But we decided that we do it anyway.</span> <span id="s226">And I..</span> <span id="s227">.</span> <span id="s228">I am sure it was the hardest and most difficult that we ever had.</span> <span id="s229">Just because it is a festival of liberation, and...uh...I don't need to tell you how we felt at that time.</span> <span id="s230">Uh...One of the...I had mentioned...I had mentioned...uh...Incidently I mentioned Willi Sargi, and I just want to add to this that...and it's strange how sometimes little things...uh...become memories that...that stand out way and beyond the significance.</span> <span id="s231">Because my...my sister, Leah, and we actually always called her Toni for some reason so I am going to refer to her as Toni.</span> <span id="s232">Uh...She had managed to blot out most of the things that happened at the time, but one thing she...she remembers vividly and she's told me about it two or three times.</span> <span id="s233">I mean whenever she mentions that, I can feel it...the strong emotions tied up with it, and it's a little thing.</span> <span id="s234">She remembers herself walking into the house one day and Willi Sargi, that...that fellow who had been friends of...uh...my family, of my brothers and possibly her too, was walking ahead and he opened the door and he closed it right in her face.</span> <span id="s235">It's such a little thing, but it will live with her as long as she lives.</span> <span id="s236">And so I say memories are strange things because so many more horrendous things happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s237">Uh...At that time, I was going to...the ” • gymnasium.</span> <span id="s238">That was a Jewish High School.</span> <span id="s239">A very, very good high school.</span> <span id="s240">One of the two best in Vienna.</span> <span id="s241">Uh...And they had a very select...uh...cadre of...uh... teachers.</span> <span id="s242">One of them was a pretty woman poetist and...uh..., of course, at that time, you know, the curriculum and the standards of education are very high.</span> <span id="s243">That school closed its door in... after I graduated...uh... in 1938.</span> <span id="s244">It closed its door for good for over 50 years.</span> <span id="s245">I think they only recently reopened again, last year or so I think I've heard.</span> <span id="s246">And I remember that...uh...when we...uh... left...uh.</span> <span id="s247">.</span> <span id="s248">on the last day of school...uh...and there was a group of boys waiting outside to beat us up, but...uh...that was...that was the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s249">Uh...I had two brothers...uh...the oldest by the name of Gabe.</span> <span id="s250">He left for the United States...uh... early in 1938.</span> <span id="s251">He missed most of the...uh... Nazi period.</span> <span id="s252">I think he left...uh...uh...in the early summer, late spring or early summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: How did he get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: We have...a part of my mother's family is American...had settled in America...uh...a generation or two ago.</span> <span id="s255">And they sent us affidavits and...uh...Gabe was the first one able to make use of it.</span> <span id="s256">So he went straight...uh...you know, as a important little passenger on the ship, he could close the door and luckily he missed...uh... most of the terrible things...uh...that happened afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Why did the rest of you not go with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Well, ...uh...it took time.</span> <span id="s259">Affidavits, you know, affidavits, the processing and everything...uh...wasn't such a simple and easy matter.</span> <span id="s260">It took...uh...it took father almost a year...uh...to get out...uh...for instance.</span> <span id="s261">Uh...Leo...Leo was the second one who left, but...but his...uh...exodus was fraught with difficulties.</span> <span id="s262">In the first place, in summer he tried to escape over the border into France and he went with a friend by the name of .</span> <span id="s263">And...uh...he was caught by the French police and returned.</span> <span id="s264">And...uh...since...since my brother was...he was a very handsome fellow and quite a personality I would say...uh... He had no difficulty with the German border police and there were some SR SS men there.</span> <span id="s265">Uh...He had no problem whatsoever and they just let him go.</span> <span id="s266">Yal.</span> <span id="s267">And he returned to Vienna.</span> <span id="s268">And I..</span> <span id="s269">.</span> <span id="s270">I still remember him coming up the street.</span> <span id="s271">I happened to be outside, and he was tanned and he...he...he looked so wonderful, like somebody who came from the mountain already or something like that.</span> <span id="s272">Uh...Shortly after that, he...uh...he went again.</span> <span id="s273">He escaped by Italy and by illegal ship...uh...to Palestine.</span> <span id="s274">So he got into Palestine, it was probably late summer of 1938, and when war broke out...uh... early in 1940 in Germany he volunteered.</span> <span id="s275">And he fought through all the campaigns...uh...so...uh...in North Africa and...uh... practically the whole length of Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: With which army?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: He was...uh...with the British army, the RASC.</span> <span id="s278">I think he was first in the Palestine corps.</span> <span id="s279">There was...there was, in fact,...he was involved in a very significant rescue mission of Jews...uh...in northern Italy who were held captive by the Gestapo and...uh...the group of...uh...Jewish soldiers...uh... I don't know that they were in command of the whole group or only of that particular transport of that particular truck...uh...crossed-through the German border at the time and there was only a local armistice, a local armistice between the commanders and the Germans were still armed.</span> <span id="s280">And they went right up to that particular headquarter, and the Gestapo had fled at that time.</span> <span id="s281">And they took all over a 100 Jews back to...to Rome.</span> <span id="s282">I have to say, however, that my brother told me about this only once and that is when I saw him for the first time in 1953.</span> <span id="s283">Uh...That is...uh... practically 15 years after...uh...the Nazi invasion or Nazi annexation out of Austria.</span> <span id="s284">And we had a long talk in Israel.</span> <span id="s285">He told me once about it and never talked about it again and...uh...now that I have a chance, I am going to try to get historical documentation because my brother was...uh... a rather quiet and extremely restrained sort of person and he...he's never mentioned it again.</span> <span id="s286">And I think it was a significant...was a very significant...uh... episode.</span> <span id="s287">As a matter of fact he told me that when they came back to Rome, he formed...uh... the American Army and said that he instructions from British Headquarters that here was a group of people who had to be taken care of and...uh...they...they were obviously people in very poor condition of health.</span> <span id="s288">Yal.</span> <span id="s289">So he surrended them...he surrended them to...to the Americans and he said to them when...when they first arrived and the Jews saw them, something fell underneath and said they were angels.</span> <span id="s290">....school.</span> <span id="s291">My parents registered me in a..</span> <span id="s292">.</span> <span id="s293">in a training course for carpenters.</span> <span id="s294">There were a number of different (clearing throat) vocational courses being given under the auspices of...uh...the Coltis Commander, which was the Jewish...uh...uh...organization, the Organization of Jewry in Vienna.</span> <span id="s295">And I guess the idea was (a) since I would have to leave and they tried to send me out as early possible because obviously every day was.</span> <span id="s296">.</span> <span id="s297">uh...I was threatened there...uh...to get me out of harm's way, to get me away from the apartment which was a trap and also to give some qualifications, some sort of another.</span> <span id="s298">And...uh... I remember...and I am going a little ahead and I will afterwards go backward, but I am going a little ahead of time because I remember on the day of the Kristallnacht which I believed was the 9th to the 11th of November, 1938.</span> <span id="s299">I was in that carpentry workshop and there was a call on the telephone and the manager of the shop...uh... went to the phone and listened very seriously and then he turned to us and said, "There is some action on the way and you will be safer at home."</span> <span id="s300">I am going to talk abut this in detail a little later on because there was lots of things that happened in between.</span> <span id="s301">And I want to talk about them now.</span> <span id="s302">Uh...First of all,...uh...a..</span> <span id="s303">.</span> <span id="s304">a number of times...uh...the Nazis came to our place, to our apartment.</span> <span id="s305">They came to our apartment.</span> <span id="s306">They weren't exactly break-ins, but they weren't exactly visits either because these people came and.</span> <span id="s307">.</span> <span id="s308">uh... they didn't bother to ring the bell or knock on the door.</span> <span id="s309">They...they generally beat on the door with their boats so we knew exactly what kind of gentlemen were waiting out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Do you need some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s312">Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: I must really sound very hoarse here.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: That's fine.</span> <span id="s315">Take your time.</span> <span id="s316">Take some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Uh...I remember a number of these occasions.</span> <span id="s318">I think I happened to have been present at practically every one of them cause I was mostly at home except when I was in that carpentry workshop later on.</span> <span id="s319">Uh...On one occasion they came and...uh...they asked for my father.</span> <span id="s320">And my father was a very sick man at that time.</span> <span id="s321">At the sight of what happened...uh...Of course, as I said, the business was Aryonized.</span> <span id="s322">He lost the business and, consequently, in his mind he lost the...uh...the very reason for existence.</span> <span id="s323">He lost the structure of his life.</span> <span id="s324">Uh...He...uh...became so sick that every day he had attacks that he simply...uh... fell unconscious.</span> <span id="s325">He became unconscious.</span> <span id="s326">I remember he did the blood drained from his face.</span> <span id="s327">His face became ashen.</span> <span id="s328">He sank back and for about 10, 15 minutes he was as if dead.</span> <span id="s329">And then he always recovered.</span> <span id="s330">And that happened day after day, day after day, day after day.</span> <span id="s331">Yal.</span> <span id="s332">You can imagine what kind of impact it had on me.</span> <span id="s333">At least it's difficult to imagine, really difficult to imagine.</span> <span id="s334">Uh...I later on, I subsequently learned (clearing throat) from a sister that these were epileptic attacks.</span> <span id="s335">He had developed epilepsy.</span> <span id="s336">I didn't even know that at the time.</span> <span id="s337">Uh...his...hair, which had always been blond, turned gray in a week.</span> <span id="s338">So, and he had always had heart trouble and so on.</span> <span id="s339">So when the Nazis came on one occasions, this was , I heard my mother say, "Why don't you take me.</span> <span id="s340">He's a..</span> <span id="s341">.</span> <span id="s342">he's a very sick man.</span> <span id="s343">He has a very sick heart.</span> <span id="s344">Why don't you take me instead?"</span> <span id="s345">And the Nazi looked at her.</span> <span id="s346">There were two of them.</span> <span id="s347">And one said, you know, "Lock your door.</span> <span id="s348">We are going to say that nobody is home.</span> <span id="s349">And don't open for anybody."</span> <span id="s350">And they left.</span> <span id="s351">On another occasion, and I am mentioning the little...the little visit at first.</span> <span id="s352">On another occasion...uh...they came and they asked for...if there were any males around, any men.</span> <span id="s353">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s354">And...uh...I always looked about 5 years younger.</span> <span id="s355">That was as a result of eating so badly I guess.</span> <span id="s356">And it was really what saved me from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s357">(Clearing throat) Because he looked at me and he thought I was about 10, and I was really 14.</span> <span id="s358">(Laughter) He didn't even bother to say anything.</span> <span id="s359">He just turned around.</span> <span id="s360">It's like...uh...throwing a little fish back, you know, and left.</span> <span id="s361">That was the second visit.</span> <span id="s362">The third one, and I don't know whether I have the order correctly because memories are strange.</span> <span id="s363">You remember things vividly, but you don't always remember the order in which they happened.</span> <span id="s364">Uh...About at least 3 or 4, this SR man came to our apartment in and I remember at that time, this...this must have been before mid-summer because I was still in school.</span> <span id="s365">I remember I was in school because I had visited a friend by the name of Amile Krueger.</span> <span id="s366">He was a genius in mathematics and I was excellent in Latin, the Classics and Literature, so we used to help each other.</span> <span id="s367">And I was visiting his place and came home and as I knocked on the door, either the moment I knocked on the door or just a little before I heard noises in the apartment and knew they were not noises from my family.</span> <span id="s368">I still remember I was rooted by fear, and I had an immediate impulse for flight.</span> <span id="s369">But whether it was solidarity or fear or whatever it was or the swiftness with which things happen, I didn't turn...turn away, and the door opened and instead of my mother, there was this giant man.</span> <span id="s370">And I was pulled in somehow...uh...and there was my father, mother and myself.</span> <span id="s371">My sister was married at the time and she had a separate apartment, not too far from us.</span> <span id="s372">And there was Fritzi Shaumberger, our maid, and they made us stand against the wall.</span> <span id="s373">I was in the which is...uh...the...uh.</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">the foyer, the lobby, you know.</span> <span id="s376">It's a sort of L shape, very long L shaped room.</span> <span id="s377">They made us stand against the wall by the corner window and one of them shouted, Where's the gold?</span> <span id="s378">Where've you hidden the gold?"</span> <span id="s379">These were very primitive people.</span> <span id="s380">Yal.</span> <span id="s381">They must have thought we were Fort Knox or something.</span> <span id="s382">I mean, gold.</span> <span id="s383">I know my mother had a wedding ring, but...uh...hidden gold, buried it.</span> <span id="s384">Uh...My father said, "We have no gold."</span> <span id="s385">So they stood us against the wall.</span> <span id="s386">They took out their pistols and they put the pistol on our chest.</span> <span id="s387">It was father, mother and myself.</span> <span id="s388">And father said to them...and Fritzi Shumberger, the maid, was standing in the doorway of the kitchen and watching... What could she do really?</span> <span id="s389">And father said, "Why don't you shoot us?"</span> <span id="s390">And I am quoting almost verbatim.</span> <span id="s391">He said, "I'd rather you shoot us straight away than have this insult and...uh...indignity, you know, without end."</span> <span id="s392">And actually that...that...that...uh...brings up another memory in my mind.</span> <span id="s393">They didn't shoot us.</span> <span id="s394">Uh...They...at that time apparently didn't have the authority to do that.</span> <span id="s395">Or possibly they were still after the gold and you can't get gold from dead Jews, whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s396">And they took my father away.</span> <span id="s397">They took him to our business.</span> <span id="s398">At that time it was still in our possession in the district, and my brother, Leo, was still there at the time.</span> <span id="s399">And I remember Leo had some money somewhere on an inside pocket, but he said he had no money.</span> <span id="s400">You see we needed that money desperately because...uh...there was no business anymore and we knew that without money, we won't be able to get out.</span> <span id="s401">So...uh...they didn't find the money on him.</span> <span id="s402">We were always walking on a tight rope.</span> <span id="s403">Yal.</span> <span id="s404">Whether the arrested father at the time or not, I do not know.</span> <span id="s405">I know Father was arrested at least twice.</span> <span id="s406">But...uh...my mother and I were locked into the kitchen after they left.</span> <span id="s407">And they left this SR man to guard us.</span> <span id="s408">This marshall of people, you know, these heroic figures, the Aryonrosher...superman in their imagination.</span> <span id="s409">I had learned to be contemptuous of anti-Semites and I will come back to this...uh...afterwards, but in any case, I was a very, restless, impatient sort of person and I had inherited a little bit of the temper from my father.</span> <span id="s410">And all the time that temper was rising within me and remember I was a book worm.</span> <span id="s411">It was never clear when I left the world of reality and walked over into a world of imagination.</span> <span id="s412">Yal.</span> <span id="s413">In the world of imagination, I was just a I mean I..</span> <span id="s414">.</span> <span id="s415">So eventually, I got so fed up, I got so angry in the kitchen I said to my mother, "I have to do homework and they prevent me from doing the homework and I am going to...to...uh...take them to task over this."</span> <span id="s416">And I don't know if my mother tried to restrain me, but, you know, what could she do.</span> <span id="s417">I went out and I confronted this Nazi and said, "You know that I am supposed to do my homework.</span> <span id="s418">I am supposed to bring it in tomorrow and if I can't do it because of you, you will come with me tomorrow and you will come to the teacher.</span> <span id="s419">Yal.</span> <span id="s420">And you tell her whose responsible for this.</span> <span id="s421">Yal."</span> <span id="s422">He didn't know how to cope with this.</span> <span id="s423">And...and this is where my memory ends.</span> <span id="s424">I really do not know what happened, you know.</span> <span id="s425">He didn't beat me up.</span> <span id="s426">That is for sure because I would have remembered that.</span> <span id="s427">Yal.</span> <span id="s428">But whether I was allowed to do the homework or whether they pushed me inside again or what, I..</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">I do not recall.</span> <span id="s431">That...that was one visit.</span> <span id="s432">Uh...Our flat...our apartment was...was broken in on another occasion.</span> <span id="s433">We don't know who did it.</span> <span id="s434">I should imagine it was done really by so-called ”in court• officials because...uh...the apartment was sealed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s435">And...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: What do you mean it was sealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: It was sealed.</span> <span id="s438">Sealed by Gestapos.</span> <span id="s439">We were not allowed to enter again.</span> <span id="s440">It was just sealed.</span> <span id="s441">It was put under seal, lock and seal.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Where did you go to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I..</span> <span id="s444">.</span> <span id="s445">I..</span> <span id="s446">.</span> <span id="s447">I'll tell you that.</span> <span id="s448">Probably...Actually...we actually went to our sister.</span> <span id="s449">If my sister hadn't been there, well, I guess we still had a..</span> <span id="s450">.</span> <span id="s451">I still had a aunt.</span> <span id="s452">They had a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s453">But we...we lived with our sister for the...for the last 2 or 3 months...uh... Uh...What happened there was that I had...whatever money we had left...I don't know whether at that time we had already lost the business or not, but in any case, there was little business and people wouldn't pay us anyway even if we supplied.</span> <span id="s454">Uh...So we had no money coming in and so we had a substantial business but you know as a businessman, we weren't that rich.</span> <span id="s455">We had some money left to pay for expenses to move out or what, but whatever money we had left was our lifeline for escape.</span> <span id="s456">And I had become extremely adept at hiding things and at finding things.</span> <span id="s457">And the reason why I had become adept was that, as I told you, I was a book worm and I would read through libraries.</span> <span id="s458">I mean literally shelf after shelf cause I remember my mother would take me to a worker's library in this, I believe they called them, you know.</span> <span id="s459">The Social Democrats built wonderful apartment buildings in Vienna.</span> <span id="s460">They...they become quite well renowned.</span> <span id="s461">And they had libraries there and health clinics and...uh...kindergarten and gardens inside.</span> <span id="s462">It was really a splendid world.</span> <span id="s463">Yal.</span> <span id="s464">And they had these libraries, and my mother would take me there and for me this was a paradise.</span> <span id="s465">And actually as I remember, they were really little rooms, but the glorious thing was there was these bookcases and they were stacked with books from the floor to the ceiling and I knew that each book was a world.</span> <span id="s466">And it just entranced me.</span> <span id="s467">Yal.</span> <span id="s468">And I would read indiscriminately, but they were mostly good books.</span> <span id="s469">They were...at home also we had, our saloon was stacked.</span> <span id="s470">We had all the classics.</span> <span id="s471">At that time we had paperbacks also the crown books they were called.</span> <span id="s472">That was before the Penguins.</span> <span id="s473">And I knew all the classics and I knew the Russians and the French, the dossiers and all these people.</span> <span id="s474">But my mother used to hide books from me that were classics even because they were too serious.</span> <span id="s475">For instance,...uh...and what an innocent world it was at the time, for instance...uh...and , Crime and Punishment.</span> <span id="s476">I am mentioning this because it later on plays actually a role.</span> <span id="s477">However, there was no place they could hide a book that I didn't find.</span> <span id="s478">And...uh...the most peculiar place that my mother found was the stove pipe, you know, in the saloon and I found that too because I always...I put myself in her place.</span> <span id="s479">Now where...where would I hide something.</span> <span id="s480">A book...a book isn't such a small object you see.</span> <span id="s481">So I became extremely skilled in nosing out things, where they might be hidden, and hiding things.</span> <span id="s482">And I was the person consequently selected...you see how negative qualities become virtues in a world that's gone crazy...to hide whatever money we had left.</span> <span id="s483">And what I did, and that was just before our apartment was ransacked and sealed, was...uh...we had these brass beds which had hollow legs and you could unscrew the...uh...the wheels.</span> <span id="s484">So I stuffed some money up there in the legs and then we had curtain rods that were also brass.</span> <span id="s485">Hugh things!</span> <span id="s486">And I stuffed some money there.</span> <span id="s487">Actually, you could only get them out with very, very long thin stick.</span> <span id="s488">Yal.</span> <span id="s489">The Nazis, however, who were never book worms, never learned...uh...to learn to look.</span> <span id="s490">.</span> <span id="s491">to look for things (laughter), you know, in those little hollow hiding places.</span> <span id="s492">And they never found the money.</span> <span id="s493">Now, then the apartment, after the apartment was sealed, and we were ordered...and we had no money... Yal.</span> <span id="s494">We were literally penniless.</span> <span id="s495">So one day, Mother took me to the Gestapo headquarters...Central City...It was in the hotel.</span> <span id="s496">I forgotten the name of the hotel.</span> <span id="s497">And I want to explain to you exactly what happened because I vividly remember every moment of it.</span> <span id="s498">And, of course, she had me by the arm, you know, and we walked in and there was this...this splendid lobby.</span> <span id="s499">And there were people standing around.</span> <span id="s500">I don't whether they wore uniforms or not, but there were people in there.</span> <span id="s501">It was a lovely place, and there was a spiral staircase to the right and at the foot of the staircase was a soldier.</span> <span id="s502">I believe he was a soldier and not a SR man.</span> <span id="s503">He might have been a SR man, but I seemed to remember he was a soldier.</span> <span id="s504">(Clearing throat) Sorry.</span> <span id="s505">And he had a rifle there with a bayonet, a naked bayonet planted in...uh...the...uh...what you call that?</span> <span id="s506">...the...uh... on top of the rifle planted there.</span> <span id="s507">And as we came in, he jumped mother and he saw a woman with...with a child there and he immediately decided we're Jewish and he shot at something like .</span> <span id="s508">They used this expression.</span> <span id="s509">It's like is like sow.</span> <span id="s510">It's a female pig, you know.</span> <span id="s511">And they combined it with...with the term Jew.</span> <span id="s512">And for them that was the way to call us.</span> <span id="s513">And he...he...he advanced the rifle into a ready position and that's another heroic measure...here's a woman with a child.</span> <span id="s514">Yal.</span> <span id="s515">And he made some kind of threatening movement, and my mother brushed by him as if he didn't exist.</span> <span id="s516">Yal.</span> <span id="s517">Totally ignored him.</span> <span id="s518">And he was an attack dog who...who had not been instructed how to deal with a situation like that.</span> <span id="s519">And this is what happened sometimes in those situations.</span> <span id="s520">If you were really plucky or if you were desperate to the point that you didn't care...uh...sometimes you overwhelmed them.</span> <span id="s521">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s522">But you had to have some presence in that control.</span> <span id="s523">As I said something that I learned in school early.</span> <span id="s524">However, it didn't stand...it didn't help me in this situation because when we came in I was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s525">It was, of course, a mixture of embarrassment and fear, but I honestly think it was about 90 percent or 80 percent embarrassment.</span> <span id="s526">I was a very shy youngster, and here everybody was looking at us.</span> <span id="s527">And I was pulling at my mother's arms...let's get out of here, you know.</span> <span id="s528">I was so ashamed.</span> <span id="s529">Yal.</span> <span id="s530">Just to be in the center of attraction, even if it hadn't been for...even it had been for purposes.</span> <span id="s531">But my mother let me go.</span> <span id="s532">I ran out of the hotel, but I was sufficiently able to see her, to watch her go up the staircase.</span> <span id="s533">Well, my mother came out of this hotel with the key to our apartment.</span> <span id="s534">You have seen her photograph.</span> <span id="s535">She was a very impressive person and somehow when no matter who, like the Nazi, the SR man...the underling who came, and who must have had a spark of humanity in his mind and who left without doing any harm to us and even cautioned us to lock up and not open to anybody.</span> <span id="s536">And here...this Gestapo officials of high rank, because they were the officials in the headquarters and they gave her the keys.</span> <span id="s537">But they gave her the key for 24 hours...24 hours or 48 hours.</span> <span id="s538">I think 24 hours.</span> <span id="s539">It was enough for us to go in, take the money out that we had there and so make it possible for us to survive.</span> <span id="s540">That was the second substantial visit.</span> <span id="s541">It was really not a visit.</span> <span id="s542">It was...uh...say...it was really a break-in to our apartment.</span> <span id="s543">Subsequently, of course, she returned the key.</span> <span id="s544">Uh...Now...Now I want to...to...to go back or to go forward rather to speak about the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s546">Could we hold it?</span> <span id="s547">If you're moving to there, we're about ready to change tapes, so let's do that at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Right.</span> <span id="s549">Okay.</span> <span id="s550">Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You can take some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s554">We're back.</span> <span id="s555">You were going to take it up with Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s557">Uh...Yal.</span> <span id="s558">Just before I go to Kristallnacht, there's something really significant I have to mention.</span> <span id="s559">As I said, Father...Father was a broken man because....uh...he had lost his business.</span> <span id="s560">Essentially, he had lost, in his eyes, his role.</span> <span id="s561">His role was that of protector.</span> <span id="s562">And now he couldn't protect us.</span> <span id="s563">Mother, on the other hand, had gained a role because she had to do everything she had done before and more.</span> <span id="s564">And she was always...uh...a housewife, a house person.</span> <span id="s565">So Mother became stronger but Father just broke.</span> <span id="s566">And Father wanted to die.</span> <span id="s567">He...he wanted...he wanted...as a matter of fact, he really wanted that all of us should commit suicide.</span> <span id="s568">And...and not only, and as I told you before, that he lost consciousness...uh...every day and it was really a death that he wished.</span> <span id="s569">He wanted us all to die.</span> <span id="s570">He wanted that all of us should commit suicide.</span> <span id="s571">It was the only way out that...that he saw possible.</span> <span id="s572">And every time that a Jewish family that we knew had chosen this path...had committed suicide... In one case I remember he was talking abut the family that went out to the cemetery and they committed suicide at the grave site, probably of their parents.</span> <span id="s573">He came home and he said, "What a wonderful thing these people did.</span> <span id="s574">We should do the same thing."</span> <span id="s575">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: How did your mother respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: My mother very quietly...uh...I..</span> <span id="s578">.</span> <span id="s579">I..</span> <span id="s580">.</span> <span id="s581">I don't even remember her saying anything.</span> <span id="s582">She just didn't accept his advice.</span> <span id="s583">Yes.</span> <span id="s584">But all the time what had happened inside of me was in situations like this...uh...something grows up between you and your world, the world outside.</span> <span id="s585">It's...it's that wall that I talked about before, which had started to build up and you can really only survive at a very, very significant price.</span> <span id="s586">And the price is...uh...that you detach yourself from your emotions and when you lose your emotions...when you lose your connection with your feeling, you essentially become...uh...an automated...you essentially become a sort of person drained of vitality because you don't want to experience what is happening around you, so you can't experience anything.</span> <span id="s587">Uh...And once that happens...it isn't something...it's not like shoes you can put on and take off...and actually it sometimes lasts in some ways a life time.</span> <span id="s588">Not in that horrendous form, but I will explain to you later how I emerged from all this into England.</span> <span id="s589">But it certainly...uh...helps you escape and...uh... Unfortunately, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s590">The world didn't know how to cope with this psychological situation at the time so they thought you got out of it.</span> <span id="s591">Let's forget it.</span> <span id="s592">And that is essentially what happen, except you may forget it, but it doesn't forget you and...uh...it just goes on living within you.</span> <span id="s593">Alright.</span> <span id="s594">Uh...The Kristallnacht and its generally known that...uh...what triggered it was...uh...the assignation by a young Jewish boy...I think his name was...uh...Green...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Greenspan.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Greenspan.</span> <span id="s597">Yal.</span> <span id="s598">Who had...uh....shot...uh... some German official at the Paris...the Germany Embassy in Paris by the name of ” •.</span> <span id="s599">Because...uh...they had...uh...I believe killed his parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Don't worry about that.</span> <span id="s601">What happened...Where were you at Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s603">Uh...I was on Kristallnacht, actually that day I was...I was in the carpentry workshop.</span> <span id="s604">And...uh...I mentioned before the telephone call came so when the manager of the workshop took the call and turned to us and said, "Look.</span> <span id="s605">There is something going on in town.</span> <span id="s606">You'll be better off at home."</span> <span id="s607">We knew immediately what...what is going to be.</span> <span id="s608">We packed our...our stuff and...uh...we...uh... went...went home.</span> <span id="s609">I remember...I had forgotten where this ...this carpentry workshop was, but I should imagine by the appearance of the...uh...the neighborhood because I was waiting for a train.</span> <span id="s610">I took a train, but I know what kind of...uh... streets we went through.</span> <span id="s611">Uh...It seemed to have been the inner city which is an unusual place for a workshop because these were splendid buildings.</span> <span id="s612">And I remember standing...you see the...the...the trains in Vienna had an open platform...uh...either at...at the rear end so you could easily jump on and off and you could be standing there.</span> <span id="s613">And I was standing along side.</span> <span id="s614">It was close to me.</span> <span id="s615">There was an elegant couple and, you know, in those times when people were elegant, they were elegant.</span> <span id="s616">There was a very attractive lady and she was dressed in a beautiful silk dress it seemed to me, and a gentlemen and she was looking at the newspaper and seeing something and she turned to the man and said, "Look at this terrible things they're doing to the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s617">Surely, this couldn't happen here."</span> <span id="s618">I remember those words because...uh...first of all, there are a lot of... Really, the only words I remember from that...from that period actually spoken because within a few seconds or a few minutes or moments or very short time after that, we passed a side street.</span> <span id="s619">The train went on a side street and there was this magnificent temple in flames.</span> <span id="s620">And there was a Jew in costume with a long beard.</span> <span id="s621">Obviously he must have been praying in the synagogue and he was running and there was a crowd running after him and he was like one of those you know, in the classic books that I was reading.</span> <span id="s622">Uh...with a poem by Sheller about a Kraut chasing something or other.</span> <span id="s623">And you flash by.</span> <span id="s624">I mean the train, you know, how long does it take.</span> <span id="s625">It was just a. And it was an ironic commentary on what that lady said...uh.</span> <span id="s626">.</span> <span id="s627">to the man.</span> <span id="s628">I remember coming home, which was actually the apartment of my sister and...uh...there I knocked on the door and you must...and you must...uh...not remember because you don't know of this, but bear in mind that these were heavy reinforced doors with not only massive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plywood that is used now, but genuine oak or something like, but also...uh...uh...steel bars inside.</span> <span id="s629">There's a whole...there's a whole steel door inside.</span> <span id="s630">So these were fortresses.</span> <span id="s631">I don't know why they were fortresses because there were very few thefts there.</span> <span id="s632">But nonetheless, at least before the Nazis, in which case these were really thefts, but...uh...these...these doors were difficult to break down.</span> <span id="s633">When I came home they very cautiously opened the door.</span> <span id="s634">My...I found there my...my...my mother, my sister and her baby.</span> <span id="s635">Her baby was...uh...only about 2 months old at the time.</span> <span id="s636">Rose was born in August 1938.</span> <span id="s637">So I can...I can position this in time because I..</span> <span id="s638">.</span> <span id="s639">she was born in August 1938.</span> <span id="s640">I left on the 18th of December 38.</span> <span id="s641">Of course, it's the Kristallnacht, 11th of November.</span> <span id="s642">Well, I knew that before.</span> <span id="s643">So...uh...she was 2 months...2 months old.</span> <span id="s644">And Father wasn't there.</span> <span id="s645">I believe he must have been arrested.</span> <span id="s646">And...uh...my brother-in-law had been arrested.</span> <span id="s647">My...my sister says that happened on the morning of the Kristallnacht, but at any rate I know that he was...uh...sent to Dachau and he was in Dachau in fact over...over half a year.</span> <span id="s648">Uh...How he got out of it alive, but...uh.</span> <span id="s649">.</span> <span id="s650">and he went through terrible time there.</span> <span id="s651">In any case, when I came home, something strange happened.</span> <span id="s652">I mean I was always the youngster, the kid and so on.</span> <span id="s653">And now I..</span> <span id="s654">.</span> <span id="s655">I was the only man.</span> <span id="s656">And I don't know whether this is some genetics or the biology of relatives, I just...I..</span> <span id="s657">.</span> <span id="s658">the diffident, the shy, the book worm and so on, assumed control quite naturally and I said, "If somebody comes, we won't open the door.</span> <span id="s659">We just don't open."</span> <span id="s660">And this...well, my sister was always a person...my sister was not a person who was very assertive.</span> <span id="s661">In any case, she would have taken a rather quiet role in the background.</span> <span id="s662">But my mother was a very courageous person.</span> <span id="s663">But I think as a result of all that had happened...of what happened to Father...of the fact that both of them were arrested, she became...she was very quiet and she just accepted...uh...my suggestion without any demurring.</span> <span id="s664">Well, we didn't have to wait long.</span> <span id="s665">Shortly after, it was before lunch time, we heard these...uh... very well known...uh... boots beating on the door and they weren't just beating on the door, generally accompanied by shouts...open up this that and so on.</span> <span id="s666">We didn't open.</span> <span id="s667">And I think probably...I have gone through some different phases in my life, but this must have been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the kitchen and so as not to be seen from outside or so we were on the fifth floor, but the house was built around the court yard and you could have looked in from the opposite wing.</span> <span id="s668">So we had to stand pressed against the wall.</span> <span id="s669">And my sister had to put her hand on the mouth of the baby.</span> <span id="s670">It was a 2 month old baby.</span> <span id="s671">And always be afraid that either she might stifle her inadvertently or that the baby would cry.</span> <span id="s672">And here these men were battering on the door and you know, with the jack boots you can subject a door to some treatment and it went on, it seemed to me, for an eternity.</span> <span id="s673">And what went through my mind was the scene of in Crime and Punishment.</span> <span id="s674">was a criminal.</span> <span id="s675">Yal.</span> <span id="s676">But nonetheless, it was a scene of the most...and they were standing there in, I believe in the kitchen, after having committed the deed, and they hear some...some steps going up and then the door rattling and he is afraid that the lock might...might open up because...uh...this...uh...was just some...some kind of...uh... what do you call it in English?</span> <span id="s677">It's...uh...we call it a..</span> <span id="s678">It wasn't...it wasn't locked with a key, but it was locked with some...some kind of mechanical device.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Yal.</span> <span id="s680">I know what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Uh...And that scene flashed through my mind because I was always living half in the book and half outside.</span> <span id="s682">And then we...and we could hear everything that was going on outside and then...uh...one man said to the other...apparently, he was the leader of the group.</span> <span id="s683">He said to the other, "or whatever the name was, Go down and fetch a crow bar."</span> <span id="s684">And this fellow went down.</span> <span id="s685">And, of course, our...way back...uh...was closed.</span> <span id="s686">We couldn't open.</span> <span id="s687">They would have thrown us out the window.</span> <span id="s688">At that moment, the door from a neighboring apartment opened and there was a woman... I had never spoken to her.</span> <span id="s689">Mother had never spoken to her.</span> <span id="s690">I don't know whether my daughter knew her.</span> <span id="s691">She was a Gentile obviously.</span> <span id="s692">And she said, "You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago.</span> <span id="s693">You're wasting your time"...or words to that effect.</span> <span id="s694">You could hear everything in that apartment.</span> <span id="s695">You could hear things through the door.</span> <span id="s696">And they went away.</span> <span id="s697">And in the afternoon, they came back.</span> <span id="s698">And, of course, I had said, "Look.</span> <span id="s699">They come back in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s700">We open immediately.</span> <span id="s701">I don't want to go through this again."</span> <span id="s702">Yal.</span> <span id="s703">So when they came, we opened straight away.</span> <span id="s704">But I, you know, my temper was...was sort of moving up, you know, again and I decided that I was going to sit at...uh... the coffee table in the saloon...uh...drinking a cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there as if...uh... I couldn't care a damn about what was going on, just to show my disdain, you understand.</span> <span id="s705">I thought that this would make a significant impression.</span> <span id="s706">I was really, you know, half serious, half child...uh.</span> <span id="s707">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s708">And they came in and my sister had...uh...a side porch, you know with sliding glass doors and she displayed all kinds of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain, crystal...uh...the things that you got for our wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort.</span> <span id="s709">And, of course, they were after it.</span> <span id="s710">And one of the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who had never handled doors like this tried to open and he sort of fumbled around and he couldn't figure out how this...this door opened.</span> <span id="s711">Yal.</span> <span id="s712">Because the only door probably that he...he got to know was the door on hinges.</span> <span id="s713">And I could see him sort of...I could almost read his mind...and holding his foot, his leg up in order to kick the door in, and I jumped up.</span> <span id="s714">Yal.</span> <span id="s715">And confronted him as much as I could confront him.</span> <span id="s716">I mean my head was probably the height of his breast bone.</span> <span id="s717">And I said you know...and I again remember the words verbatim...there are two ways of opening this door.</span> <span id="s718">I said, "One is you lift your leg and kick it in like that, and I just imitated what he was doing, and the other one is like this and I put out one little finger and I just made the door open.</span> <span id="s719">And don't you think that's a better way.</span> <span id="s720">And I looked him in the face and he looked back and no words were exchanged...no further word was exchanged between us.</span> <span id="s721">And, of course, they packed all the stuff up and took it away and walked out.</span> <span id="s722">And that was another visit.</span> <span id="s723">It was the most terrible because of what happened in the morning and that could have easily ended up, as I say, with our flying out of the window.</span> <span id="s724">Uh...If you don't mind, a few things occur to me.</span> <span id="s725">I want to go back to them.</span> <span id="s726">First of all (clearing throat), there was first of all two...two personal encounters and...uh...that I think of.</span> <span id="s727">Uh...I had...I told you before that I had...I had learned in some way that in certain critical situations I could face up to things and somehow assert control.</span> <span id="s728">It was almost a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...some measure of certainty that I had at the time.</span> <span id="s729">Some...some voice that came to me from outside myself.</span> <span id="s730">And I remember that one of the times it happened was even before the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s731">Uh...It was winter time and I was dressed...uh...in a very nice winter coat.</span> <span id="s732">It was a new coat.</span> <span id="s733">with a herringbone and a velvet collar.</span> <span id="s734">And here was a much bigger boat but ragged, obviously from very poor circumstances who came up and our steps met at the corner and I knew that he wasn't going to shake my hands.</span> <span id="s735">I realized that he was gonna beat me up.</span> <span id="s736">And I always had empathy for the underdog.</span> <span id="s737">I had a very, very strong empathy.</span> <span id="s738">I had really always a strong heart for poor people, for animals, for all things of that sort, and I felt ashamed actually of my...of our circumstances.</span> <span id="s739">Even so, God knows,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with normally books, you know, or games of skills.</span> <span id="s740">They never bought me a model set because I might break my leg or something, which I probably would have (chuckle) if they bought me one.</span> <span id="s741">But I always had that...that feeling that...uh...I felt uncomfortable of having more than somebody else and so I didn't have to fake anything.</span> <span id="s742">I..</span> <span id="s743">.</span> <span id="s744">I really had an understanding for him and a feeling for him.</span> <span id="s745">And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear because it took the place of fear.</span> <span id="s746">It was...it was the feeling that possessed me.</span> <span id="s747">And I said to him...uh..."You know, I want...uh...there's something I want to tell you."</span> <span id="s748">And I said it in a way that...uh...somehow or other seemed to engage him, seemed to engage his interest.</span> <span id="s749">I was listening and I told him about the fact that I wanted to go to Palestine and that many of us, even those of us who come from so-called...uh...homes that were more affluent really wanted to choose this life for ourselves and that I understand where he came from and understand his circumstances that...that many of...of friends of mine, people I know have chosen a life of work on the land, hard work.</span> <span id="s750">Yal.</span> <span id="s751">And there wasn't really as much difference between us as might appear.</span> <span id="s752">And that I wasn't responsible for the fact that...that he was poor and that he was in difficult circumstances and we almost became friendly and they told...he told me about the fact that his father was beating him up and so on and so forth and, you know, his father was a drunkard.</span> <span id="s753">But I will never forget the words that he said to me at the end and the words were...and this was a poor, maybe semi-literate, ragged youth, maybe a year before the Nazis came...I would say about... He says, "You know, Hitler is going to come here and then I am sorry...I am going to be sorry for all of you."</span> <span id="s754">And these are words that I have forgotten easily.</span> <span id="s755">That was one encounter.</span> <span id="s756">The other one was already under the...under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s757">I was...uh...I think walking home at the time and...it was and it was the place where our shul was, the little synagogue.</span> <span id="s758">Uh...There were sitting in the front pew.</span> <span id="s759">My father incidentally was the vice-president of the other group, which is...which was a Zionist philanthropic organization.</span> <span id="s760">And my father was very active in public affairs and as a philanthropist, something that once saved him from the Nazis because I remember in a procession...procession that came by, and I was sort of listening at the window, and somebody was shouting, "Let's take old Schmeltzer," and...uh...somebody else said, "Oh, leave him.</span> <span id="s761">At least he helps his own kind."</span> <span id="s762">So strange things happened...uh...even in those times.</span> <span id="s763">There was this shul in the and I was not far away.</span> <span id="s764">As a matter of fact, midway up that street, in the where our shul was.</span> <span id="s765">Our shul was at the corner of the where we lived in this.</span> <span id="s766">Midway up there was a restaurant at that time.</span> <span id="s767">And as I was walking... probably...I don't remember exactly whether I was walking home or walking away from...at any rate I suddenly was surrounded by something like a dozen boys.</span> <span id="s768">It was like a ring around me.</span> <span id="s769">And there were closing in on me.</span> <span id="s770">And it was clear that they were going to beat me up.</span> <span id="s771">All of them!</span> <span id="s772">Together!</span> <span id="s773">And again that particular sense came over me that allowed me to detach myself from my personal circumstance and take on another voice.</span> <span id="s774">It was almost as if I was reading a book.</span> <span id="s775">And imagination has its place at times.</span> <span id="s776">And I said to them...I..</span> <span id="s777">.</span> <span id="s778">I raised my hand because I realized you know, I have to do something that attracts attention...I raised my hand at the time and said, "Look.</span> <span id="s779">Before you beat me up, I have something interesting to tell you.</span> <span id="s780">And, of course, you know, rich boy...I mean...everybody is curious...I mean no matter what.</span> <span id="s781">I said, You know, what's happening here.</span> <span id="s782">There's a dozen of you Gentiles, Christians who want to beat up one of me, one Jew.</span> <span id="s783">Now what are you doing there.</span> <span id="s784">You're really declaring that one Jew is as good as 12 of you."</span> <span id="s785">And that...that sort of...that sort of made them look up.</span> <span id="s786">Yal.</span> <span id="s787">And I said, "I am going to tell the Nazi party about it and, you see, they'll be very angry at you."</span> <span id="s788">(Laughter) God knows where this came from.</span> <span id="s789">Yal.</span> <span id="s790">It's really absolutely absurd.</span> <span id="s791">It's ridiculous, but it somehow engaged their attention and they started to discuss this matter amongst each other.</span> <span id="s792">(Laughter) Because they were as little...uh...learning.</span> <span id="s793">They had just...they picked up anti-Semitism probably from early childhood because it was endemic in Austria.</span> <span id="s794">And as they were discussing things, a little gap opened.</span> <span id="s795">They...you know, at one point they drew apart.</span> <span id="s796">It was just enough for me to flee through and I ran.</span> <span id="s797">At that time the person who held the world's record in long distance running was a fellow called …I think I outran him.</span> <span id="s798">I ran so fast up, away from our home, up the to which was a parallel street, a very, very magnificent.</span> <span id="s799">Well, it's a very lively vital street that led up to the ticket of the I over took a train and remember I told you they had these open platforms and I jumped up and there weren't sufficiently close to me.</span> <span id="s800">I mean they couldn't overtake me and they couldn't get on the train and so I got away that particular time.</span> <span id="s801">Now I had mentioned something about shuls.</span> <span id="s802">I want to go back to this because something else comes up in my mind.</span> <span id="s803">A year before I had Bar Mitzvah and I remember standing in front of the mirror in our L-shaped hall, the one that I described to you before.</span> <span id="s804">My mother plunked some kind of blue hat on me which almost blotted my face out.</span> <span id="s805">I had this little round face you know, and I was frightened out of my wits, and I was led to...uh...the shul almost like a calf to slaughter and I had to give this long you know which was half in Hebrew and half in German and these...these were long affairs and you had to know them by heart.</span> <span id="s806">It took at least half an hour or later.</span> <span id="s807">Yal.</span> <span id="s808">You studied it for it months.</span> <span id="s809">And I remember (clearing throat) I stood there and I looked at the people and the shul was full of people and my heart sank.</span> <span id="s810">This was definitely not a moment of control.</span> <span id="s811">And my voice said bye bye, just took leave of me and when I opened my voice...my mouth, almost no voice came out.</span> <span id="s812">Yal.</span> <span id="s813">And my teacher, Hebrew teacher...his name was Daft, D A F T..</span> <span id="s814">.</span> <span id="s815">was a young, modern man actually.</span> <span id="s816">He sat behind me and he leaned forward at this point and he said to me, "You know, if Mussolini can do it, you can do it."</span> <span id="s817">I mean, again, outrageous statement, but this man understood something in me because I got so enraged at the fact that this is doing something and I can't doing it....Yal...that I completely forgot myself and I delivered a splendid oratory and everybody was weeping and the last one who wasn't weeping was my sister and I considered this as a personal affront.</span> <span id="s818">And then I sort of focused my look.</span> <span id="s819">I beamed it at her like a lazer beam and I said one or two sentences as I glazed and then she started weeping.</span> <span id="s820">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s821">And then our...our family doctor, Frye, he was crying too.</span> <span id="s822">Everybody was crying (laughter) in that synagogue.</span> <span id="s823">Now, I..</span> <span id="s824">.</span> <span id="s825">I mention this because Daft, who was my teacher, under the Nazi unfortunately something very tragic befell of him...befell him.</span> <span id="s826">One day his wife came to my mother and she was literally wringing her hands and said she doesn't know what to do because her husband had simply become mad.</span> <span id="s827">He picked up a knife.</span> <span id="s828">He said that she wanted to poison him.</span> <span id="s829">She was afraid of her life.</span> <span id="s830">She was afraid to go to the authorities.</span> <span id="s831">And...here you had a world of madness inside in response to madness outside...uh... It was literally a world where all the controls, all the dams broke.</span> <span id="s832">Uh...And I don't really know what happened.</span> <span id="s833">But I do know that I once visited his place.</span> <span id="s834">That was in the good times before my Bar Mitzvah and I was so impressed by the stacks of books he had and there was and I read the title of every one....</span></p> <p><span id="s835">END OF TAPE 2, SIDE 2 service people of medical who were guarding the prisoners inside.</span> <span id="s836">And they were outside.</span> <span id="s837">And inside were hundreds of German prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s838">And these were giants.</span> <span id="s839">They were sailors.</span> <span id="s840">They were apparently caught...uh...you know either on the ships or whatever.</span> <span id="s841">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s842">Here was a group of 30, 40 young Jewish school children, all from whatever happened in Europe and...uh...I think...I don't want to be adamant about it.</span> <span id="s843">I seemed to remember there was swastika flags inside.</span> <span id="s844">Yal.</span> <span id="s845">But I am not going to sign that underwriting.</span> <span id="s846">Uh...Certainly, there was.</span> <span id="s847">.</span> <span id="s848">uh.</span> <span id="s849">.</span> <span id="s850">a planned Nazi atmosphere also.</span> <span id="s851">Yal.</span> <span id="s852">There were no demonstrations against us.</span> <span id="s853">It was just enough to see these fellows around and we in the midst.</span> <span id="s854">There were only 30, 40 of us and we were children.</span> <span id="s855">.</span> <span id="s856">very young boys of 16.</span> <span id="s857">None was older than 16.</span> <span id="s858">There were only a few Polish among them.</span> <span id="s859">Then what happened was... we were about 2 or 3 months in that camp.</span> <span id="s860">What happened was that some of us were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s861">Now I wasn't Orthodox myself, but some of us were Orthodox, and they were strictly kosher, and they would not eat a non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s862">And there was no provision for non-kosher food, and we all declared solidarity with those who were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s863">So they wouldn't eat non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s864">We didn't eat non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s865">The result of it we were all starving and we were literally starving because...uh...all you could eat was cheese...uh...when...when it was served.</span> <span id="s866">And I remember the mostly seemed to serve meat which we couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s867">Yal.</span> <span id="s868">And I ate plenty of toast with jam because I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s869">I was very partial to toast and jam, must have eaten so much I couldn't stand it anymore.</span> <span id="s870">But we were literally starving and in the end became so...uh...drained of strength...uh...that sometimes...sometimes we were lying out there on the grass and we couldn't even...hardly could get up.</span> <span id="s871">We were really that much weakened.</span> <span id="s872">I remember the Polish lad that was...I told you about this man, this , who become a friend of mine, was giving us daily lectures and he had extensive knowledge in various areas.</span> <span id="s873">And I remember in biology in particular, biology and literature and history and politics.</span> <span id="s874">These were his main subjects...and in psychology.</span> <span id="s875">And this man was so well read that through the three months he could give us daily lectures of 2 or 3 hours every day...Yal...and really have us riveted.</span> <span id="s876">And...and through this camp, there passed different groups.</span> <span id="s877">Someones, there was a group of Jewish adults and of a group of Italian adults.</span> <span id="s878">I remember the Italian were so different from the Germans.</span> <span id="s879">They transformed the...the camp into a soccer stadium.</span> <span id="s880">Yal.</span> <span id="s881">You know, I..</span> <span id="s882">.</span> <span id="s883">I later make friends with Italians.</span> <span id="s884">I love these people.</span> <span id="s885">I mean they are just so human.</span> <span id="s886">Prison or no prison, they were kicking that ball around.</span> <span id="s887">Yal.</span> <span id="s888">So different from the very...and I am not saying this against the German as such, but they were very solemn and stodgy.</span> <span id="s889">Yal.</span> <span id="s890">There was no note of joy.</span> <span id="s891">Nothing...nothing to remember.</span> <span id="s892">One thing was they all...a lot of them carved things.</span> <span id="s893">They were wonderful at carving things.</span> <span id="s894">They made little sailing boats that you could push through the neck of a bottle you know.</span> <span id="s895">And I watched that and they carved pipes with all kinds of...uh...legendary monsters with shaped faces on them.</span> <span id="s896">One day, one of the Nazis there...uh...was named Putsy Humstanker.</span> <span id="s897">Now I am saying this from just hearing about it.</span> <span id="s898">But Putsy Humstanker, I was told was a friend of Hitler's.</span> <span id="s899">How he had gotten himself...uh...captured or what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s900">And...and I was told that he was...he was a fellow who played piano, entertained with Hitler's piano and so on.</span> <span id="s901">Putsy Humstanker came to us one afternoon drunk and he said, "Look.</span> <span id="s902">The Germans are plotting to get rid of you.</span> <span id="s903">And I am your friend."</span> <span id="s904">Yal.</span> <span id="s905">Such friends I can do without, but...we weren't.</span> <span id="s906">So, we couldn't look to the British where we could say.</span> <span id="s907">They weren't...I mean they were outside.</span> <span id="s908">Uh...We armed ourselves with clubs, this, that and the other and sit guards at night, but you know in a sense maybe because we were young and maybe because...well, we were the way we were...We would betroy slogans on our hearts and...and then and Hebrew...uh...slogans...and so on.</span> <span id="s909">We did not allow the fact that we were really just a tiny group in this German sea.</span> <span id="s910">To the tourist to anyway.</span> <span id="s911">But nonetheless, there were difficult times and don't forget this was just about the time that France fell in May.</span> <span id="s912">I remember...I remember one day that we lying outside.</span> <span id="s913">It was also a day of marvelous summer, blue skies, so radiant.</span> <span id="s914">And not far away from us, there was a..</span> <span id="s915">.</span> <span id="s916">a military...uh...Yal... a military...uh...airport and I saw some riding from there and it was so close by that they skimmed over us.</span> <span id="s917">I was lying there with some others and we were looking up in the sky and there was these planes.</span> <span id="s918">There were so close you could see the heads of the pilots.</span> <span id="s919">And we could see the scarves flying up and the German bombers were up there...up deep in the sky up above.</span> <span id="s920">We could hear them them droning.</span> <span id="s921">And those marvelous youngsters were flying straight at them.</span> <span id="s922">Yal.</span> <span id="s923">It's...You know, war is a terrible thing, but I have to admit it's one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen.</span> <span id="s924">And to see those silver planes.</span> <span id="s925">I mean if you detach yourself from the horror and to see afterwards the denotations blossoming like great yellow, red flowers and then parachuting and then when the planes burst, there was a deeper color and then, the parachutes coming down like thistles.</span> <span id="s926">Yal.</span> <span id="s927">That was an unforgettable sight.</span> <span id="s928">I..</span> <span id="s929">.</span> <span id="s930">I felt very, very proud of those fighters that went up, and I am not a military person.</span> <span id="s931">But, in any case, as I said to go back or to go forward, France fell and the Germans became very cocky, very arrogant.</span> <span id="s932">And some of them threw their finger across the throat when they passed us.</span> <span id="s933">Yal.</span> <span id="s934">And I don't know what our feelings were at the time, frankly.</span> <span id="s935">I think so many things had happened to us in the beginning that suddenly, I didn't...I didn't function too much emotionally.</span> <span id="s936">Yal.</span> <span id="s937">Uh...And suddenly, one day they decided to evacuate us to send us either to Canada or Australia.</span> <span id="s938">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s939">And we were...uh...meant to go on a certain ship.</span> <span id="s940">I believe the name was Andora Star.</span> <span id="s941">Somehow that name stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s942">I always associated it with that particular situation.</span> <span id="s943">And all the Germans...uh... in our camp were sent on the Andora Star and there were some Jewish people, including a brother of my brother-in-law, from other camps.</span> <span id="s944">He was interned too, of course, who was in the Andora Star.</span> <span id="s945">Now we were taken off maybe a day or two before embarkation because...uh...Jewish...the Jewish Federation it.</span> <span id="s946">All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the home office, with the war office, this that and the other thing.</span> <span id="s947">Look...what...this...our Jewish with the… They are boys.</span> <span id="s948">What you want to send them to Canada or Australia for with Germans.</span> <span id="s949">They took us off the last moment.</span> <span id="s950">You know what happened to the Andora Star.</span> <span id="s951">It was torpedoed.</span> <span id="s952">My brother-in-law's brother was killed among the others and later on when I was in again in another place called… I met one of the rare Jewish survivors of that ship incidentally so I..</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">so I..</span> <span id="s955">.</span> <span id="s956">I know the story all around.</span> <span id="s957">And what he told me was that when the ship was torpedoed, the Jews were down in the steerage.</span> <span id="s958">I mean they were down, and the Germans and the British were up and they were close to...and they...they took possession of all the lifeboats and the Jews were not allowed into the life boats and he was swimming along and he said he must have been in the water a hour or so.</span> <span id="s959">You can't measure time in that condition.</span> <span id="s960">And he was almost losing his last ounce of strength, just couldn't go on and there was this life boat near him and he managed to swim up to it and stretch out his hand and get hold of it.</span> <span id="s961">And I have to say this ironic episode that happened was that a British person...a British, one of the mates of the ship, said, "Sorry, old boy.</span> <span id="s962">You know, full up.</span> <span id="s963">This is not the last boat."</span> <span id="s964">And the Germans said, "Oh, let the poor bastard on."</span> <span id="s965">And they pulled him up and so he was saved.</span> <span id="s966">Yal.</span> <span id="s967">And I think he must have been one of the very, very, very rare Jewish survivors from the Andora Star.</span> <span id="s968">And there was another occasion when death was just moving past me as if he didn't know me...or didn't know me or didn't really want to know me...uh...and...and...and many...many other people have stories of this kind.</span> <span id="s969">And those of us who escaped...uh... many of us had many escapes before you could finally get away.</span> <span id="s970">That takes us up to...uh...beyond...beyond the Andora Star and the return to...to internment to Lensfield.</span> <span id="s971">No...We didn't return.</span> <span id="s972">They didn't take us out, of course.</span> <span id="s973">We remained in Lensfield, but shortly afterwards...uh...we were finally released and I remember the commandant of the camp wept.</span> <span id="s974">Uh.</span> <span id="s975">.</span> <span id="s976">There were a number of sterling British figures I have to say.</span> <span id="s977">Uh...As I told...as I told you, Britain is one of the countries I have warm affection.</span> <span id="s978">It's not that everybody was a saint, but you make an overall appraisal of a nation, of a civilization and in England I loved them and my...my brother in Palestine did not.</span> <span id="s979">He saw...he saw the British from another...another angle, but I have to say that I experienced them in their own country and there are some just lovely, marvelous...uh...persons there and the general tone is...is...is just lot more civilized than the one I encountered generally in Austria.</span> <span id="s980">I have to say that.</span> <span id="s981">Very different.</span> <span id="s982">Now...uh...uh...there was another officer there in the internment camp.</span> <span id="s983">We called him Auntie.</span> <span id="s984">We called him Auntie because he was such a passionately devoted soul.</span> <span id="s985">He was such a lovely man.</span> <span id="s986">Out of his own pockets, he would buy us things...socks and undergarments and stuff.</span> <span id="s987">He was another one who cried when we left.</span> <span id="s988">Yal.</span> <span id="s989">He was a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s990">Now...Don't...don't think that every British was like this, but you don't need to meet that many persons and they do leave...uh...a strong...uh...impression behind them.</span> <span id="s991">Yal.</span> <span id="s992">They sort of light the way.</span> <span id="s993">It's almost as if fate...uh...has decided well, you know, you've gone through this, that and the other.</span> <span id="s994">We'll send you a little light.</span> <span id="s995">Yal.</span> <span id="s996">So afterwards, when I got out of the internment...uh...there was an episode and here I am not absolutely certain about the...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events, but I know that my sister was evacuated to Spalding and I managed to be there.</span> <span id="s997">I managed to be for a few months there, working the land, because I was then at the time on the war essential work order.</span> <span id="s998">Uh...just to be close to her and I managed to survive some bombing attacks that practically pulled the house down over us because the Germans mistook Spalding for which was a nearby railroad station, you know.</span> <span id="s999">And they bombed...they released all the bombs on Spalding.</span> <span id="s1000">Uh...Amongst other things...uh...they destroyed the zoo and killed a lot of animals there.</span> <span id="s1001">Uh...After that I..</span> <span id="s1002">.</span> <span id="s1003">I was in...uh...I was in London for some time and I can't date that.</span> <span id="s1004">I know that I worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s1005">I know that I..</span> <span id="s1006">.</span> <span id="s1007">uh...I thought up ways of speeding up production by a multiple of 2 or 3 by...because there were more machines there than...than people.</span> <span id="s1008">And I worked out a mathematical system whereby you could keep 3 or 4 machines in operation, you know, only attended by l person.</span> <span id="s1009">And you could do it faultlessly.</span> <span id="s1010">It wasn't even difficult.</span> <span id="s1011">However, I was watched by the supervisor.</span> <span id="s1012">You know it is very strange, you know.</span> <span id="s1013">And incidentally, I had a similar encounter because not everybody in Britain was giving their best for the war effort obviously, but many did and many were very heroic.</span> <span id="s1014">So again, humanity and with all its...but...uh...there was another occasion in Spalding.</span> <span id="s1015">In Spalding...uh...I worked for a period of time in the sugar refinery near the laboratory and...uh...I had...uh...another encounter of a similar nature where I wanted to be a little more productive than a certain person, a certain woman and...uh... She then...She became so angry with me because she...because I was in the laboratory...I was supposed to be testing the molasses in the various stages of preparation as to be come to refinement.</span> <span id="s1016">And she spread the story about me that I was a German spy.</span> <span id="s1017">But unfortunately...fortunately, rather, she was known as a liar.</span> <span id="s1018">Nobody paid any credence to her.</span> <span id="s1019">Uh...I was also in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s1020">So that was a very intense time.</span> <span id="s1021">I was also in Cambridge at some time...uh...but this was after I had gotten to... I returned to... It was in...That was a place around... You know… the great...uh...I am making and liquor making and so on.</span> <span id="s1022">And we...we were living there in really terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s1023">The difference between and was difference between night and day...day and night rather because was an unsanitary camp.</span> <span id="s1024">It had been condemned by the British.</span> <span id="s1025">It had no facilities, no toilet facilities even and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1026">And we worked like slaves on the land.</span> <span id="s1027">I was there for about half a year.</span> <span id="s1028">Uh...I eventually left and I went to Cambridge.</span> <span id="s1029">I was followed by some of the...uh...at that time, a friend of mine, my alter ego almost and he went to Cambridge and...uh...I had the childish idea that I only needed to go to Cambridge and all universities would open their door and say, "Herr Schmeltzer, you know, now you are here.</span> <span id="s1030">Why didn't you come earlier?</span> <span id="s1031">You see, we have just the place for you."</span> <span id="s1032">Well, I ended up as a gardener in College.</span> <span id="s1033">(Laughter) And I have to tell you it's...it's a really amusing little tale because at that time I was preparing...I was on one of my studies.</span> <span id="s1034">You see, in...in Vienna because my parents' forced me to study.</span> <span id="s1035">I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s1036">But once I had left and I wasn't under constraint, I felt that what I most passionately wanted in life was to study.</span> <span id="s1037">Yal.</span> <span id="s1038">I always read intensively and extensively, you understand.</span> <span id="s1039">Now I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s1040">So I thought going to Cambridge somehow or other was all you needed to do and say here I am and that's it.</span> <span id="s1041">Well, as I say, I became a gardener and I..</span> <span id="s1042">.</span> <span id="s1043">I am ashamed to say I used part of my time actually for study purposes.</span> <span id="s1044">What I did was that I..</span> <span id="s1045">.</span> <span id="s1046">I organized the study plan to two areas.</span> <span id="s1047">Uh...the...uh...liberal art things if you like, languages and literature and that kind of stuff and grammar, I had this little notebook that I could hold in the palm of my hand.</span> <span id="s1048">Mathematics and other things...mathematics I would rake out and smooth out a plot of land, you know, and I would...I would draw geometric figures and so on on the land and work them out.</span> <span id="s1049">And then I would enter them in a little notebook.</span> <span id="s1050">But it turned out that the which were an administrative group of they were looking behind the window sills you know in the stately buildings and they were observing this strange person who was drawing figures in the soil, you understand.</span> <span id="s1051">And they couldn't figure out what it was I was actually doing, but it seemed to occupy me for an enormously length of periods of time and I seemed to be absolutely obsessed with it.</span> <span id="s1052">So I was eventually called there and the words that...that I..</span> <span id="s1053">.</span> <span id="s1054">that they said to me were, you know, we have observed you over a period of time and...uh...frankly, most of the time you seemed to be scratching things in the ground or looking at the palm of your hand.</span> <span id="s1055">We couldn't figure out what it is you are doing, but you didn't do enough work so I am afraid we have to fire you.</span> <span id="s1056">So I drew myself up to...and I am not very enormous length at the time...I said, "I am really ashamed of you because this is supposed to be an intellectual...uh... institution and...uh...I can tell you that I am probably more intelligent than any of the students you have, but they have lots more money than I have and if you were really an institution of learning and not of money, you would say, "Look.</span> <span id="s1057">We really want you here as a student, but obviously you don't know anything about things of that sort.</span> <span id="s1058">Good Day."</span> <span id="s1059">And I walked out.</span> <span id="s1060">And afterwards I was really kind of...I was almost trembling because I wasn't...I wasn't cock sure at all.</span> <span id="s1061">Yal.</span> <span id="s1062">I think it was...it was part of my general nature.</span> <span id="s1063">Anger that was kind of spilling out, you know.</span> <span id="s1064">In retrospect...uh...there was very little...they... they... they...that they could do about it.</span> <span id="s1065">I guess they were only acting according to their best understanding of the way the world worked.</span> <span id="s1066">And I was little...a bit outside the scheme of things.</span> <span id="s1067">So after Cambridge I thought...I almost...almost was 18.</span> <span id="s1068">I wanted to volunteer to be a fighter pilot.</span> <span id="s1069">Maybe this period of the planes flying over...also the fact...the fact that I..</span> <span id="s1070">.</span> <span id="s1071">I just wanted to...to...I wanted revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: May I..</span> <span id="s1073">.</span> <span id="s1074">We have 10 minutes left on this tape, so what I am going to suggest we do is if you can encapsulate what happened to you and tell us what happened because I want to bring you...uh...to where we had discussed earlier.</span> <span id="s1075">I want to bring you to after the war in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s1077">Yal.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1082">Uh... Because it doesn't take too long time.</span> <span id="s1083">The fact of the matter is that I..</span> <span id="s1084">.</span> <span id="s1085">volunteered as a fighter pilot and...uh...I went through medical examination.</span> <span id="s1086">There were examinations and they seemed to work out well, but I did get a letter eventually...sorry they couldn't take me.</span> <span id="s1087">They didn't take any at the time.</span> <span id="s1088">And I wasn't called an...I was an Austrian Jew.</span> <span id="s1089">Austria was an enemy.</span> <span id="s1090">So in England I was an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1091">I was an enemy.</span> <span id="s1092">In Austria I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1093">I fell between the cracks.</span> <span id="s1094">Uh...At that time I could have volunteered for the corps, but I wasn't going to be in a service corps.</span> <span id="s1095">I want to be in a fighting unit.</span> <span id="s1096">I thought...again, here my childish naiveté came through...that if I..</span> <span id="s1097">.</span> <span id="s1098">that the moment they allowed us to.</span> <span id="s1099">.</span> <span id="s1100">to...volunteer to join a..</span> <span id="s1101">.</span> <span id="s1102">a combat unit...uh...I would be allowed to join my brother.</span> <span id="s1103">It was again a strong urge that I had to join...and I always worshiped...I really worshipped my brother even so he sometimes beat me up.</span> <span id="s1104">I have to say that.</span> <span id="s1105">But he was a great person.</span> <span id="s1106">He was really one of the heroes in my life.</span> <span id="s1107">And there are not many of them.</span> <span id="s1108">maybe, in retrospect, was the great hero, but Leo of my family was not among them.</span> <span id="s1109">And I had the feeling...somebody told me, one of the person recruitment said to me, "Yes, you...you volunteer and we'll send you wherever you want to go."</span> <span id="s1110">I believed it.</span> <span id="s1111">Of course (laugh), you see, the moment we were allowed to volunteer for the combat unit...I volunteered and I was...uh...accepted.</span> <span id="s1112">That...it took some time because I only joined in the early 43 I believe it.</span> <span id="s1113">It wasn't 43 for sure.</span> <span id="s1114">I don't have the date on me exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Where were you sent?</span> <span id="s1116">Where were you sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Well, first of all we went through 16...16 weeks of training.</span> <span id="s1118">You know there was 6 weeks and then 10 weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: We don't have the time.</span> <span id="s1120">After training, where were you sent after training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: I was...I was sent to a mountain unit, the... I think it was the 52nd Division and I am quoting from my memory and...uh...this was a division that was essentially stationed in the northern mountains of Scotland where the snow and ice conditions are at least where we went into training, not where the general camp was.</span> <span id="s1122">It approximated the conditions in the Arctic Circle.</span> <span id="s1123">Uh...And I contracted a very severe condition.</span> <span id="s1124">We...we slept in snow and sometimes it was even worse when we went below the snow line.</span> <span id="s1125">And we slept literally in icy water.</span> <span id="s1126">And...and we went out for training sometimes for 2 weeks at a stretch, 10 days to 2 weeks at a stretch.</span> <span id="s1127">I might sleep about, at most, an hour a night til you woke up in the icy water.</span> <span id="s1128">You only slept out of exhaustion.</span> <span id="s1129">I contracted a fairly serious arthritic condition, you know, with pain the swollen limbs and so on.</span> <span id="s1130">And eventually...uh...this...uh... went on for about 2 years.</span> <span id="s1131">Essentially I understood that we are stationed there to...uh...in case there was a German attack from Norway...from Northern Europe, you know, to protect his flank.</span> <span id="s1132">Eventually this unit was sent off...uh...2 or 3 weeks before Dunkirk...not Dunkirk... That happened before, of course...

This was a really marvelous raincoat, and the first thing that I did was to go to Hyde park and again it was beautiful summer.</span> <span id="s1168">At least this was a summery day.</span> <span id="s1169">And so I didn't need to put the raincoat on, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">I had it over my arm.</span> <span id="s1171">And there in Hyde Park, if you have ever been there, there's a lake there, a boating lake.</span> <span id="s1172">And I put my rain...rain coat simply on...on the bench and then walked away from it and walked to the lake to look at the boats and then I remembered I had a raincoat.</span> <span id="s1173">So I returned to the bench and I didn't have a raincoat anymore.</span> <span id="s1174">Uh...It was the shortest person ever was and there was a fellow near there who said, Oh you...you are the owner of the raincoat.</span> <span id="s1175">Well, I have got to tell you, there was a prostitute here and she saw the raincoat and just picked it up and walked away with it.</span> <span id="s1176">So...uh...I have to say, here was...here was...uh...the legacy to the government of the British Army, you know.</span> <span id="s1177">But, at least, at least, it was good for one person.</span> <span id="s1178">Let us.</span> <span id="s1179">I just want to assume that she was a needy person and she really needed that raincoat.</span> <span id="s1180">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: You met your family after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: I..</span> <span id="s1183">.</span> <span id="s1184">Yal.</span> <span id="s1185">After...after the war essentially I..</span> <span id="s1186">.</span> <span id="s1187">I managed...I went into the Polytechnic...
