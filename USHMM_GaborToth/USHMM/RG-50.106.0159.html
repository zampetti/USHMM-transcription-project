like?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I had no other comparison with other hometowns, most of my relatives lived in towns about that size.</span> <span id="s29">This population was about 10,000 - 500 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Was it a commercial area or an industrial area?</span> <span id="s31">Agricultural area?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Around it were coal mines.</span> <span id="s33">It was a coal mining area.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What were the relationships like between the Jews and their Christian neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Well, I was 12 when I left and all my immediate friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s36">However, I attended a Catholic convent school, as all Jewish kids did.</span> <span id="s37">We had -- because that was the best school.</span> <span id="s38">We were perfectly content, got along.</span> <span id="s39">My parents never -- the parents never thought that Catholicism will affect us in any way.</span> <span id="s40">And every period there was a 10 minute pause for prayer when everybody got on their knees and prayed, with the exception of the Jewish and the Lutheran children.</span> <span id="s41">We didn't have to do that, we just sat and did our own thing and our -- the rabbi and the other priests came once or twice a week for religious lessons, and that was given after school, in the school area.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Was your family religiously observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: They were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s44">There was only one shul in our city and that was

id="s50">A: Probably Pesach was my favorite.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Was the time that most relatives were able to get together.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did your family have a long history in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: In that town and surrounding towns, my parents, my husband’s parents lived in that area, if not in that town, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, before 1919, before the Warsaw pact, it was Austria-Hungary.</span> <span id="s55">That’s why my mother [indecipherable] Hungarian, and so is my father -- my hus -- no, his is actually German, but th-tha -- that same cit -- that same area in 1938 -- in 1918, sorry, after the Warsaw pact it was -- became part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s56">And Czechoslovakia was very -- not anti-Semitic, it was very liberal those few years from 1918 to 1938.</span> <span id="s57">In ’38 that area became Hungary.</span> <span id="s58">That very same area was divided by Hitler, even though Hitler had not invaded Hungary til ’44.</span> <span id="s59">That -- they divided Bohemia, Slovakia and Moravia and -- and which part of it was given to Russia, this part was given to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s60">So we were living, you know, in hu -- the other part was given to Hungary, and we lived at that time, from ’38 to ’39 til we came in Hungary with the Czech border, you see.</span> <span id="s61">And that was one of the reasons I always came [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Had your father ever served in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: When you were a child did you experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: None.</span> <span id="s66">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: When you were little, what kinds of things did you do for fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Well, I have three daughters and eight grandchildren.</span> <span id="s69">I could say that [indecipherable] the same, I couldn’t think of anything that was different.</span> <span id="s70">We played with toys, we played with each other, we played tag, we -- the toy thing was, I think worldwide except, you know, I didn’t have the electronic stuff that they had.</span> <span id="s71">But everything else, I think was played the same way as here.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: When you were a little girl, what did you think you’d be when you grew up?</span> <span id="s73">A: What did I what?</span> <span id="s74">Want to be?</span> <span id="s75">I really did not delve into the future at that time because things were beginning to be uncertain even though in Europe it was believed that children should be seen and not heard.</span> <span id="s76">There wasn’t much information given to us in terms of the political situation.</span> <span id="s77">Not just me but people -- kids of my generation.</span> <span id="s78">But the uncertainty, the possibility of the uncertainty coming was in the air and it was -- it was like -- felt that this is not going to be forever the way it is and kids my age didn’t plan for the future at all.</span> <span id="s79">And the other thing is that 90 percent of my contemporaries were single children because their parents were convinced that there’ll be another war, and they didn’t want to raise any more, you know.</span> <span id="s80">After the first World War, they thought that they did not want to raise any more children for awhile.</span> <span id="s81">And in the little town that I lived, I ca -- I couldn’t count on my two hands the number of families where they had more than one child.</span> <span id="s82">And ask that -- you know, not just my parents, but everybody was willing to admit that.</span> <span id="s83">They don’t want to -- they saw another war coming without anything, at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: When you look back on your childhood, do you have some favorite memory, or some favorite memories that you’d like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: It was a very happy childhood I had.</span> <span id="s86">I -- I -- I belonged to a -- the upper middle class.</span> <span id="s87">I -- I wouldn’t call us that rich, although I don’t even know what rich meant, because all my friends had a maid, a nanny and a gardener and all these people -- there was nothing that I ever ne-needed materially.</span> <span id="s88">I had two parents that were very devoted.</span> <span id="s89">My father took me for a walk every day to the park.</span> <span id="s90">My mother did something else with me every day.</span> <span id="s91">I had the grandparents and I had the -- lots of relatives in different cities.</span> <span id="s92">Now it’s very small, but in different cities that were able to visit on weekends and on holidays and things like that.</span> <span id="s93">My parents had, I don’t know, between seven and 10 siblings, both of them, and they all had families.</span> <span id="s94">So getting together with them probably was the most enjoyable time, because they were just very warm, and very affectionate and very -- I -- it -- it -- it’s an amazing way to look back, that I didn’t have anything bad happening to me, or you know, there’s some people that they were called a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s95">Didn’t even happen to me, it did not.</span> <span id="s96">And I don’t think my parents, you know, cloistered me.</span> <span id="s97">We had some Christian neighbors that were -- the kids were my age and we played with them [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Can you remember when things started to change for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: My father was a very perceptive person who did not finish anything, not even elementary school.</span> <span id="s100">And the stories trickling out of the concentration camp -- not -- I me -- the ghettos, actually, because that wasn’t then, were trickling down to central Europe and he beli -- ga -- he began to believe them and he discuss it with his siblings, and everybody laughed at him.</span> <span id="s101">He had a brother who was a doctor who said, I picked every brick in this house and they’re not going to come and touch me, and I was very good to the mayor and I treated everybody free.</span> <span id="s102">And we had -- they ha -- we had one uncle, he had -- my father had a brother here, who was going to send a visa to anybody who wanted to come.</span> <span id="s103">The only one who wanted to come is my father.</span> <span id="s104">And that was like by mid-30’s, and they send him a visa and my father said, if I go by -- without me and my mother, we’ll never see each other again.</span> <span id="s105">Which everybody else thought was crazy, but it was a true fact.</span> <span id="s106">We never would have seen.</span> <span id="s107">He said, I don’t care if we -- how long we wait, we wait until we get a visa for everybody.</span> <span id="s108">And then that took, again, time, and we might have to wait a long time.</span> <span id="s109">What made our passage possible, in 1939 August 3rd, which was the last American ship that left the harbor, was the fact that in 1938 Hitler gave this part of Slovakia to Hungary.</span> <span id="s110">We were Slovak nationals in a Hungarian quota.</span> <span id="s111">If -- we had -- let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s112">Every country had a quota of how many are permitted, right?</span> <span id="s113">When we were in Czechoslovakia the quota was this long, very long.</span> <span id="s114">Then -- now all of a sudden we’re Czech nationals and we are now part of Hungary.</span> <span id="s115">Now, in the Hungarian embassy the Czech quota was very small, because there weren’t that many Czech Nationals now in one year moved there.</span> <span id="s116">So our luck was that that par -- Hitler gave that part to Hungary and there was a Hungarian officer in -- working in the American embassy who told my father the following; if you sell everything, buy yourself three ship tickets an-and -- and train tickets to Vienna, I’ll take your visa and put it on top.</span> <span id="s117">And everybody again in the family thought my father was crazy, and he -- the only thing that happened to him, he was taken to a labor camp, for eight months we didn’t hear about him.</span> <span id="s118">Then he came out of the labor camp, he got in touch with this employee and he sold whatever he could and brought three tickets from LaHavre to New York, and three train tickets from Budapest to LaHavre.</span> <span id="s119">And we left on August third and in September the war was [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: I’m going to have you go back an-and give me some more details on -- on some of what you just told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: How much did you know -- I realize you just told me that your parents didn’t speak politics in front of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: But how much did you know about what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Tell me more about your father going to this labor camp.</span> <span id="s127">On -- on what charges was he taken, or when was he taken --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: It was -- people were lined up, the -- a police order comes on a bullhorn that everybody between 25 and 45, let’s say, line up.</span> <span id="s129">And they line up and they don’t tell them wh-what, where, they left without coming back.</span> <span id="s130">And just a couple of weeks later we got a postcard from him, where he was located, and he was working on the road, a labor camp.</span> <span id="s131">And there was no way of knowing where or how to bring him back or something.</span> <span id="s132">He came back on his own after about eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: A-And this was a labor camp, not a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: But you mentioned that he had heard about concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Not [indecipherable] ghettos, because the concentration camps did not get done til about 1941.</span> <span id="s137">But tr-trickling information was coming from the ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What was the state of your father’s health when he came back from the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: He was pretty -- he was pretty good.</span> <span id="s140">He felt that they worked many hours, but they got enough food, and he was very healthy.</span> <span id="s141">My recollection was that his health was not affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: You talked about the political changes and how Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the changes.</span> <span id="s143">How did the relations between you and your Christian neighbors change, if they changed, once the political landscape changed?</span> <span id="s144">A: Well, you s -- you -- it was a double change, you see, it was a political change and a religious change at the time.</span> <span id="s145">When the -- when the Hungarians invaded our area, the bullhorns went by saying, if anybody is caught speaking hungari -- Czech, they’ll be killed or they’ll be put in prison.</span> <span id="s146">Now, I’m 11 and a half years old, and a -- a -- I immediately forgot all Czech.</span> <span id="s147">I mean, it was a very frightening thing to constantly being told that.</span> <span id="s148">Czech this -- you know, you went to Czech school, you had Czech friends, you -- you had to forget that.</span> <span id="s149">The Hungarians are very nationalistic -- were very nationalistic at that point.</span> <span id="s150">And the -- the friendship that -- that I had with kids that were Christian cooled off, but they didn't die completely.</span> <span id="s151">Those that lived like in the same yo -- like our little apartment house, with the same backyard coming th -- we saw them, but even as a child I remember there was some cooling off.</span> <span id="s152">But, you know, the real thing in Hungary happened in ’44 when Eichmann invite -- invaded Hungary.</span> <span id="s153">But there was a [indecipherable] party, which was a -- there wa -- in Slovakia there was a -- a big anti-Semitic party an-and also in Hungary there.</span> <span id="s154">All these parties made it ready and easy for him to march in because they were prepared years ahead.</span> <span id="s155">A form of the Nazi party in these countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How did they know who in the population was Jewish and who wasn’t?</span> <span id="s157">You said your father didn’t have the full beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: He had no beard.</span> <span id="s159">Well, if you go on the third floor of the museum you’ll see how they knew.</span> <span id="s160">Every city had a city hall and when you were born your religion was put on your birth certificate.</span> <span id="s161">And it was very easy for the Germans to look at the birth certificate and see, because that was there.</span> <span id="s162">The only people who escaped that is people in large cities where they -- it was easy for them to move, you know, they just didn’t stay with the -- but a little town like mine, everybody knew who was Jewish and those who didn’t ratted on each other and -- but it was all recording in the -- in the city hall of who was Jewish and who was not.</span> <span id="s163">And in large cities the other thing they did is that they made the men undress cause every Jew was circumcised and there were no Christians that were circumcised for health reasons at that time.</span> <span id="s164">So if people were in doubt, or if they felt the soldiers that they were -- somebody was escaping, they would make them get undressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: When the political situation changed, how much of that did you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: How much what?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: How much did you understand of the political changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about the kinds of arrangements that were made for you to leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Wa -- from the United States came the visa and a letter stating that we will not be a burden for the state, that my uncle will take of us financially and food-wise and put us up and things like that.</span> <span id="s171">And i-in Europe what we did is that we said -- w-we sold everything, gave it to this one man in the embassy and some other things that we had, we just gave it up, to relatives.</span> <span id="s172">I remember a bathtub, which was a big deal, we had a -- an American bathroom and we gave sa -- the tub to some relatives and they gave it away.</span> <span id="s173">But I was miserable, because I blamed my parents for taking me away from my friends, you see.</span> <span id="s174">There’s no way that they were willing to explain to me that this -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s175">Far as I knew I did not know why we were coming.</span> <span id="s176">And I could have understood because I mean, after all, I was almost 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: S -- your family gave away most of their possessions, but what -- what could your family take with them and what could you take with you when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: My father was a very honest man, he was given all sorts of advice, to put money in the lining of his coat and everything.</span> <span id="s179">And my father said that if an officer will look at him, he will get red, and he couldn’t get away with anything like -- he just doesn’t want to start life in the United States with hidden money or hidden any kind of -- any kind -- anything hidden.</span> <span id="s180">We bought nothing that was of -- of value.</span> <span id="s181">We bought my mo -- from my mother’s trousseau I have two or three tablecloth that have her initials that must be close to a hundred years old, which my grandchildren love.</span> <span id="s182">We bought some photographs, not much.</span> <span id="s183">There was a limit on how much you can -- you can, you know, wa -- in terms of weight.</span> <span id="s184">Don’t forget, this was the last ship.</span> <span id="s185">I don’t know whether they knew it was, but they knew it was nik -- close to the last ship coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s186">And, you know, I have no recollection of what I brought.</span> <span id="s187">It -- it must have been a doll, cause I was very fond of a doll that -- that came.</span> <span id="s188">But for a long time I felt that there was nothing I want to get attached to, because you don’t know when it’s going to go away.</span> <span id="s189">I did not become attached to anything material.</span> <span id="s190">Even now I feel that material things are replaceable.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: What did you most regret leaving behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: My relatives and my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Were you able to say goodbye to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes, we were able to say goodbye to them.</span> <span id="s195">Very sad, but we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Tell me about actually leaving your hometown and this journey over to LaHavre.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: We took a train from this little town and we had to change someplace, I forgot.</span> <span id="s198">This -- the vet -- the worst part of it was that we went through Vienna where there was an hour and a half stopover, and that was the first time I saw the SS troops.</span> <span id="s199">And they came with guns and very, very -- their demeanor was wa -- was very scary, even [indecipherable] I think afterwards, but to a kid, when they asked for your passport and your luggage and what they went through, was very much like, you know, at that point I thought this must be a concentration camp what they do.</span> <span id="s200">Course I realized later that that was not so.</span> <span id="s201">But for me at that time, it was probably the scariest -- no, it was not the scariest.</span> <span id="s202">Can I go back to something that was scary?</span> <span id="s203">Okay.</span> <span id="s204">When this happened that this ar -- little area -- Czechoslovakia was like this, it was big here, then it was Moravia, and Slovakia got thinner and then it was Putka Pascaoush which went to Russia.</span> <span id="s205">Slovakia was, let’s say, a thin piece like this, okay?</span> <span id="s206">And this was given to Hungary.</span> <span id="s207">And the emp -- the other half was given to Poland.</span> <span id="s208">This narrow country known as Slovakia.</span> <span id="s209">Half went to Poland and half went to Hungary.</span> <span id="s210">The Poles were very upset that these Jews were being thrown over the border for them to take care of.</span> <span id="s211">Most of them were Hassidic and very, very religious.</span> <span id="s212">So they packed up these Hassidic Jews and their wives and children, got them out of Poland and threw them across the border to slo -- back to Slovakia and to -- the Slovakia that was a -- Hungary at that point.</span> <span id="s213">This was a Friday night, and they separated the men, the children and the things, and they did these -- put these men on the square and with a large scissors they just started to cut off their beards and their payas.</span> <span id="s214">And there was shrieking all night.</span> <span id="s215">And by morning the trucks took them away, probably [indecipherable] I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s216">But it was a terribly nightmare-ish thing for a kid to see, the reaction of these people that on Friday night the beards were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s217">And in the museum on the second floor, I found a picture of this cutting of the beard of a number of people and I went up to the [indecipherable] archives, and it was not our town, but it was some place like 15 miles away that it occurred, so it must have occurred in more than one area.</span> <span id="s218">And I consider myself very lucky because this is the only thing that I personally witnessed on our -- during -- during the entire time I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Did you fear for your own safety at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: My parents were on both side of me, and I did not fear -- I didn’t feel I belonged to that group that was being attacked.</span> <span id="s221">Somehow or other I felt, well nobody has a beard in my family and they’re not tha -- and they’re not do that to us.</span> <span id="s222">I didn't see anybody taken from my immediate family as we were on that train or on the boat or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How old were you when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: And what were your expectations of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s227">I really did not know.</span> <span id="s228">To go back, there was a nun in the convent where we lived who spent 27 years in the United States and I took lessons with her.</span> <span id="s229">So when I came my parents thought I would speak English well, which I really didn’t do that well, and I was put in high school, first grade.</span> <span id="s230">And I learned very quickly on the bus with kids that were going from my neighborhood to high school, and I picked up English pretty fast, it wasn’t hard for me.</span> <span id="s231">I did very well in high school.</span> <span id="s232">I -- I was put in -- in th -- they used to have repor -- programs, handwritten and a principal came in about two months in a class, in a Spanish class and said to the teacher that Miss Reichman belongs to speech, this is an error here, S-P, she should have been in speech instead of Spanish.</span> <span id="s233">And the teacher said, you can’t take her away, she’s my best student.</span> <span id="s234">So I stayed in Spanish and I learned Spanish and I got in the honors program in that high school, Julia Richmond High School, which was associated with Hunter and Brooklyn College, and in re -- I -- I enjoyed high school very much because to me it was like a new world, and I -- I guess when you excel in school so unexpectedly and make friends -- there was only ra -- ba -- one bad experience in high school.</span> <span id="s235">There was more than one, it sort of comes back.</span> <span id="s236">I-I’m not doing this very sequentially, is that okay?</span> <span id="s237">Okay.</span> <span id="s238">My clothing was a problem, because that was a real sore thumb.</span> <span id="s239">I stood out at that point anyway, it was very different, the clothes, even though I had lovely clothes because my mother designed my clothes and she had all this fabulous material.</span> <span id="s240">When my parents came out they didn’t speak English well at all, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s241">And an uncle of mine died and left my father a thousand dollars, and my father decided to buy a business for a thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s242">So they bought a business, a rooming house for 19,000 dollars, a thousand down, and they rented rooms in this rooming house and we had an apartment on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s243">And in this -- and then there wasn’t -- they didn’t make enough money or anything, it was somehow or other, somebody in the family advised that my mother should go with -- they should go to work as a couple for a year and put some money away.</span> <span id="s244">My mother became a maid and my father became a butler someplace, and I stayed with this one uncle who sent us the affidavit.</span> <span id="s245">Now, my father was the type of person that he did not ever take a glass of water for himself.</span> <span id="s246">If he wanted a glass of water he went to the restaurant, ordered a cup of coffee and they gave him some water.</span> <span id="s247">He never did anything by himself.</span> <span id="s248">And he did this and he -- they took this job, they worked 18 hours a day, the two of them.</span> <span id="s249">They made 20 dollars or 25 dollars a month and when they had enough money with that thousand dollars, that’s when they left and they bought this -- this rooming house.</span> <span id="s250">But while I was -- while they were working as a maid and a butler, the daughter of that family and I went to the same high school.</span> <span id="s251">And she got a gang together and she -- they teased my clothes tremendously.</span> <span id="s252">And I had like two or three very unpleasant things about this particular clique that was just -- I now notice, I teach, how much nicer children are to the Asian children and things like that.</span> <span id="s253">My generation it was the opposite, or anyhow in New York where I was.</span> <span id="s254">It may be because of where I lived, but they made absolutely my life miserable with my clothes and my accent, my a -- a -- at that point I was not yet excelling and I was very, very unhappy and I didn’t want to complain to my parents cause I knew they were doing this, they had to work at what they were doing.</span> <span id="s255">And eventually, and I can’t think of time-wise except that maybe it was in two years, they got -- they bought this business and -- and then I was able to somehow or other make my own friends and I got on the honor roll at school, at this country school and things like that and I got out of this circle of people who were teasing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: We’re going to pause and change tapes.</span> <span id="s257">Just one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Susan Berlin.</span> <span id="s260">This is tape number one, side B. And you had just told me about some of the difficulties you were having with transitioning to the United States.</span> <span id="s261">You were talking about this clique.</span> <span id="s262">Was -- was that a form of anti-foreign sentiment, did you think, or was it just that you were not part of their clique?</span> <span id="s263">Did you -- did you have any anti-foreign experiences when you first came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well, I know that teenagers tend to be mean anyway, and they can do the things that some of these girls were doing, but to me they were very specific.</span> <span id="s265">Number one they said -- you know, they were -- made fun of the fact that my parents worked for her as a maid and a butler and that made me an inferior person.</span> <span id="s266">And the second thing that they were cliquish about is my clothes and my accent.</span> <span id="s267">I had an accent when I came first.</span> <span id="s268">However, the beauty of all that was that I never did take speech and every English teacher, including my college English teacher didn’t believe that I wasn’t born here, so somehow I overcame that.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: There is one thing that I wanted to ask you that we kind of glossed over.</span> <span id="s270">When you first arrived in the United States, what were your first impressions of this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Terrified.</span> <span id="s272">I was born -- I was -- I lived all my life in this little town.</span> <span id="s273">I have -- I have not seen a street light until I went visiting some f -- some relatives in Hungary [indecipherable] we didn’t even have street light.</span> <span id="s274">New York is terrifying, you know, the first time you just walk around in it.</span> <span id="s275">And I lived with an aunt and an uncle who had no children, which didn’t have -- didn’t add to the point that I wasn’t handled properly in many times.</span> <span id="s276">You know, they just said here’s a quarter, go to the movies when I couldn’t -- when I had, you know, when I had problems.</span> <span id="s277">Everything was very difficult.</span> <span id="s278">For instance, the food tasted -- tasted soapy.</span> <span id="s279">I felt that the Coke tasted like they had mixed it with soap and I felt that -- and my parents didn’t, this was only me.</span> <span id="s280">I felt that a lot of the food was so strange to my palate, and it all tasted of soap.</span> <span id="s281">And I’m sure th -- I know that this was psychological.</span> <span id="s282">And it appeared very, very difficult at that point because of all the other problems with being a teenager and then you know, starting to go with boys -- not go with boys, but let’s say if I was invited to a sweet 16 party I didn’t know how to act.</span> <span id="s283">I -- I always said the wrong things and I did the wrong things and it took me a very long time to arise from this backward little girl, only child who lived in a town who knew only the things that everybody else did of the same, you know, socially we all did the same thing.</span> <span id="s284">I mean, nobody went to a dance without the other and it was a much closer knit group that I was with, and I had to overcome that.</span> <span id="s285">And that was a very, very hard, for many years.</span> <span id="s286">But then, you know, towards the end of high school I was -- I got more into it.</span> <span id="s287">I got into Brooklyn College, which -- a free school which was a big deal for me and I did not want to go to Hunter.</span> <span id="s288">I could not stand the fact that Julia Richmond was four years all girls.</span> <span id="s289">And I just said I’ll travel anyplace to go with -- just see boys.</span> <span id="s290">And then in Brooklyn College I excelled pretty well.</span> <span id="s291">And a German professor of mine said, would you like to apply for a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania?</span> <span id="s292">I said I don’t want to because my parents can’t afford it.</span> <span id="s293">They can’t afford Columbia either, but they know I want to get a Masters and they said they’ll take the loan.</span> <span id="s294">And he said, just for fun, don’t tell your parents.</span> <span id="s295">If it happens, it happens, just we’re going to put you in for a full-time scholarship.</span> <span id="s296">You will -- anyhow, I got this scholarship, which Brooklyn College was just thrilled, cause I was the first girl -- you know, that used to be an all boys school -- the first girl and the first Jewish girl, they combined two [indecipherable] got a full time scholarship to Columbia for a year.</span> <span id="s297">Full Masters, food, this -- tuition and everything else.</span> <span id="s298">And at that point my father knew how big this was, but he still said to me, you know, I can get that money for Columbia and I would so much rather you went anyhow.</span> <span id="s299">Y-You couldn’t talk me out of it.</span> <span id="s300">My yi -- my mother worked [indecipherable] look much better on my record if I go to Columbia -- I mean, to the University of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s301">So I went to the University of Pennsylvania and that was a blast.</span> <span id="s302">I really in -- it was a very difficult school.</span> <span id="s303">But first, in several classes when I raised my hand, especially English or philosophy and I opened my mouth, the professor would say, you’re one of those that came from a city college [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s304">And my education just came through in many ways the professors saw that my background was very, very good and you know, we all, those of us who came from city colleges were very pleased with what we had as a background.</span> <span id="s305">And the university [indecipherable] was very nice, it was a great school and I got my Masters there and I wanted to teach, and when I finished I couldn’t find a job because the veterans were coming home and they got preference to all teaching job.</span> <span id="s306">That was in ’47.</span> <span id="s307">So I have a friend who got a job in Washington, a psychologist working for the police department, and sh-she’s my best friend actually, and she said to me, I’ll find you a job.</span> <span id="s308">Anyhow, two days later she sent me a telegram, I got a interview for you in a place and she said, don’t get scared of the name, it’s called the Army Intelligence Map Service and they’re looking for people with languages.</span> <span id="s309">So she set up this interview and I came down and they were very impressed with my degree, I have a Masters and they hired me on the basis of my Hungarian language, nothing else, none of my other thing, but they’re very short on Hungarian.</span> <span id="s310">So I worked there in Map Service from ’47.</span> <span id="s311">I met my husband there, my -- and we got married in 1950.</span> <span id="s312">And I worked until 1952 when I had my first child.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: I’m goin -- I’m going to take you back to high school for a little while first.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s316">You mentioned that you would do things in high school, you would -- you’d go to parties and you would do the wrong thing.</span> <span id="s317">What do you mean you would do the wrong thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Well, I didn’t know when it was appropriate to kiss or not to kiss and they spin the bottle and things like that that were totally Greek to me.</span> <span id="s319">And then when I wouldn’t kiss anybody then I was made fun of.</span> <span id="s320">You know, this etiquette that you grow up with as to how you act at a party is something that, you know, with time I picked up, but it took a long time, and nobody was nice enough or honest enough to show me how to, you know, how to do this slowly and properly, or fast and improperly.</span> <span id="s321">It was like Greek to me because I was very little when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: You had told me about this clique that really tormented you and then you said you -- you began to make some of your own friends.</span> <span id="s323">Who were some of your friends?</span> <span id="s324">When you found people that were of a mind that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: The girls that were -- I found on the bus.</span> <span id="s326">You see, this girl that taunted me lived in the fancy section of Park Avenue, she was never on the bus and everything.</span> <span id="s327">But they we -- I lived on the East Side and they -- then I saw a lot of the same kids on the bus and they were kind enough to talk to me and I talked to them and then we met for coffee on Saturday or go to the movies.</span> <span id="s328">And they seemed to have been all in the neighborhood where I wa -- we had -- where I was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Were they Jewish, or were they foreign?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s331">I didn’t have one non-Jewish friend except in college.</span> <span id="s332">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: When did you finish high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I finished high school in 1933 -- nine -- 40 -- ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: I’m going to take you back just a few years.</span> <span id="s336">When you first came to this country, were you able to stay in touch with family and friends that you left behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, very soon the mail just did not go through at all.</span> <span id="s338">We didn’t receive.</span> <span id="s339">We had no idea who was alive or who was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: In those first years when you were in this country, the war had started in Europe, how much did you know about what was going on over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s342">I think the first notices, you know, this Polish diplomat tried to bring information to Roosevelt, but he was never publicized.</span> <span id="s343">And there were rumors coming around but we all called it rumors because we didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s344">The first time that the whole family and my circle knew about it is in ’45 when they started to show the films.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: During the war did your parents ever talk about the political situation in Europe?</span> <span id="s346">A: Very little until I wa -- until I was m-much older, 16 - 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Do you remember any of those conversations with your parents during the war?</span> <span id="s348">A: No.</span> <span id="s349">But I know that it was late because I have grandchildren and I have taken my 11 year old to the Holocaust and she completely understands what’s going on, and th -- what went on and children ha -- well, maybe now they have a deeper perception, but we did not know.</span> <span id="s350">We -- our parents sheltered us t-to an extent that o -- I ma -- I now feel I would have understood if I had been told earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: You took your grandchildren to the Holocaust Museum, I’ll ask you about your children and grandchildren in -- in a little while.</span> <span id="s352">I also wanted to -- to ask you if your level of religious observance changed when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s354">Yeah, I -- I didn’t want to bring up myself.</span> <span id="s355">I was raised in an Orthodox home [indecipherable] I became more Reformed, I would say, when we came here and we be -- joined the Reform Temple and [indecipherable] like that.</span> <span id="s356">But my mother had a kosher house.</span> <span id="s357">When the pictures about Germany came back, the skeletons and everything, and I saw my relatives in all those photographs, I became an atheist, but a true atheist.</span> <span id="s358">I began to talk to God about the fact that how could you let something like this happen.</span> <span id="s359">And any amount that I listened to Elie Wiesel or anybody else that it wasn’t God’s fault, I felt that God could have intervened.</span> <span id="s360">And as time went on I felt this was a very difficult life, to be an atheist if you were not always an atheist.</span> <span id="s361">And I thought about that too and I felt very guilty about the fact that I survived with my parents.</span> <span id="s362">Why?</span> <span id="s363">Wh -- I sa -- I -- in order for me to stop being an atheist I had to find out why I survived.</span> <span id="s364">I had to have a mission to survive because so many great people died.</span> <span id="s365">And I found my mission, an-and it might be a true -- a fiction of my imagination but it worked for me, that when my first child was born and I looked at her and I said, I know why I survived, because I know that through her and my other children, Judaism will continue forever.</span> <span id="s366">And I took this very seriously and I have three wonderful Jewish daughters, who believe very strongly.</span> <span id="s367">Who know everything about the Holocaust there is to know, even more than I do sometimes I think.</span> <span id="s368">And who strongly I have, y-you know, educated them in the fact that I ha -- believe that I am only surviving because to me, they will carry on Judaism.</span> <span id="s369">And I don’t mean banging your head Judaism, I mean just Judaism philosophy, in principle and in -- as far as they want to carry it, religious.</span> <span id="s370">They were all Bar Mitzvahed and Bat Mitzvahed, my children, my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s371">I decided to take each one of them to Israel after they were Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s372">When my oldest one became 13, Rabin was killed and we decided it wasn’t safe to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s373">So we went to France instead, it was a wonderful trip and ever since any of them become Bar Mitzvahed or Bat Mitzvahed, they take a trip, but it has to be safe by me and her parents and Israel has not yet been safe.</span> <span id="s374">One of my major dreams is that I take all of them to Israel for a week, to [indecipherable] and I’ve been there three or four times with my husband.</span> <span id="s375">And I still have this dream of taking my very big family to Israel, but I don’t think that that’s in the cards, and realistically I don’t feel that politically it’s going to happen, that it’s safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: You -- you’ve jumped many years ahead of me, I have to bring you back.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s378">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Can you give me a little insight into what was going on in your family with your parents and -- and their feelings and their anxieties, their worries, how you were feeling during the 40’s when the war was raging.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: If they did, they never communicated to me, no.</span> <span id="s383">They -- that generation did not go into fi -- I don’t think my parents were different.</span> <span id="s384">They were not very much into feelings of the children.</span> <span id="s385">Th-Th-They were raised that the children have to sort of go with the flow and -- and -- and -- and just accept the feelings as the parents said it, not have different of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: What were their feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: They didn't even talk about that.</span> <span id="s388">We had very little meaningful conversations.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: And how were they supporting themselves in the 1940’s, the first half of the 40’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Well, at first th -- I told you that they became a butler and a maid and then they got this thousand dollars and they bought this apartment house.</span> <span id="s391">Now, I just want to say one thing which probably has nothing to do with this, except they bought -- the apartment house -- the rooming house was 19,000 dollars and they had a thousand dollars cash, they put it down.</span> <span id="s392">And then they lived there, my mother and father and I went to college, they stayed there until my father died and then my mother moved into an apartment and then she moved here to Washington the last 12 years of her life.</span> <span id="s393">And she had a friend who sol -- who sent her a newspaper clipping that that 19,000 dollar house was sold for one million, to show how the real estate market had gone in 50 years in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Do you remember Pearl Harbor?</span> <span id="s395">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: What was that experience like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Well, I just came home from Hebrew school and we were having lunch when my father put the radio on and he came back and it was very scary.</span> <span id="s398">I felt that -- an-and again, my par -- my father and I talked very little about it, but he felt that the world was in -- is in a bad spot.</span> <span id="s399">That at the ti -- it was very dangerous to be attacked by the Japanese.</span> <span id="s400">But the stress was still on Hitler, that’s the worst thing [indecipherable], but that’s -- was his connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What changes do you remember from among your friends and just the general American population after Pearl Harbor?</span> <span id="s402">What memories do you have of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Well, there was rationings that I remember.</span> <span id="s404">We didn’t have a car, so it wasn’t -- there was a food rationing.</span> <span id="s405">There was, you know, stamp licking and sometime some things you did with -- with thread, or balls, or some kind of something.</span> <span id="s406">Something connected with the war effort on a voluntary basis.</span> <span id="s407">And very much -- everybody was very much in favor of -- of the atomic bomb, of my generation.</span> <span id="s408">And my children’s generation feel it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s409">And you know, we talk about that a lot, even though it -- it -- it -- and I think that that’s also common.</span> <span id="s410">They weren’t alive then and I think it was a very important way to save American lives.</span> <span id="s411">There wasn’t any other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Do you remember the media coverage of the war during the war, or in the immediate post-war period?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Of Europe?</span> <span id="s414">Well, it was very hard for me to ascertain, you know, what -- what really happened.</span> <span id="s415">It was a -- a -- I thought it was -- it showed very realistic things and what I saw after the war, I don’t think that the media exaggerated.</span> <span id="s416">I think that the media showed the European war pretty much of how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: When did you feel like you really were acclimated to American life and that you kind of fit in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: When I became a citizen, I think that was the real time and the -- it was one of these group things that we were -- you go in and you -- you -- you are sworn in by a judge.</span> <span id="s419">When a judge called me over into his chamber and said, I see you received a free American education and you received a Masters degree and I’m going to have to ask you questions, I’m not going to pass you with the -- with the group.</span> <span id="s420">And I said okay, and American history was one of my favorite subjects anyway.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t recall -- but he was very specific on dates, things that really were not that important to remember, I felt.</span> <span id="s422">But I happened to have taken it recently and I answered everything very -- I answered all his questions, and he said to me that he was very proud that I knew American history.</span> <span id="s423">And he said, what I did with me he does with all American -- with young people.</span> <span id="s424">He feels that if you get a college education you should be able to know something about American history.</span> <span id="s425">And a -- and I agree with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: When was that?</span> <span id="s428">I believe I was 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: What attempts did your parents make to find family and friends after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: We used every possible -- I -- if you know -- I’m sure you know HIAS is probably the primary organization a-and we went -- and then we found one or two relatives that -- distant relatives, like second or third cousins, alive.</span> <span id="s431">We wrote to them to see whether they knew of anybody and we ended up with one first cousin of mine in Israel, one in Czechoslovakia and one in Hungary, and a few second cousins out of over a hundred, there were over a hundred relatives.</span> <span id="s432">And these searches went periodically, you know, several locations and several ways.</span> <span id="s433">And also some stories were -- they were in Auschwitz and through a fence they recognized the relative and then that relative never came out.</span> <span id="s434">Very little, very, very little.</span> <span id="s435">And you know, they -- they just -- in our Temple, every -- th-the name of how many relatives died in the Holocaust and mine and my husband’s is the longest.</span> <span id="s436">Which is not a credit, but it just shows how many of my relatives died.</span> <span id="s437">And -- and that continued a very long idea of guilt.</span> <span id="s438">Even though I felt that through my children and grandchildren I will perpetuate this wonderful Judaism, that I wish -- there’s no full explanation of why they died.</span> <span id="s439">It wasn’t -- I don’t believe it was for Israel, or for me.</span> <span id="s440">I don’t believe that it was only man’s choice.</span> <span id="s441">I believe that there’s nobody that really knows.</span> <span id="s442">And I don’t want to ponder that because if I do I can go nuts, frankly, you know.</span> <span id="s443">Th-The real pondering on that, if you want to have a specific answer, there’s no answer to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did you follow the war crimes trials after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: To some extent.</span> <span id="s446">The Nuremberg Trials yes, to some extent.</span> <span id="s447">They were very lenient, I thought.</span> <span id="s448">My husband’s a lawyer and he tried to follow it more.</span> <span id="s449">They -- they should have been dealt with much stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Did you follow the debate in the U.N. regarding the partition of Palestine?</span> <span id="s451">A: That’s an emotional issue.</span> <span id="s452">That’s -- y-you know, it’s -- I’m at the stage with, right now that when an Arab speaks, I turn the television off.</span> <span id="s453">Now, I admit this -- not -- my grandchildren tried to talk me out of this, but I -- it’s the -- it -- we should learn more about Islam.</span> <span id="s454">I said, well, do you think that anybody suggested that we should learn more about Hitler?</span> <span id="s455">That Hitler would have been better to the Jews if we knew more about it?</span> <span id="s456">No, we knew everything of course, cause he wrote in Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s457">I don’t believe I want to learn about Islam, I don’t want to understand about Islam, because I basically feel they all want to kill anybody who is not a Moslem.</span> <span id="s458">And -- and a religion like that, believing in a God to kill everybody else who doesn’t believe your religion, I don’t want to understand, because it -- it can’t be a good god to do that.</span> <span id="s459">And I just turn my mind away from that because I feel that I either want to cry or I want to scream about that.</span> <span id="s460">See, you weren’t -- you weren't there, having it -- it ha -- all has to do with your background.</span> <span id="s461">Having gone through the Holocaust you have an entirely different political view about Israel, about the future.</span> <span id="s462">I do not believe that in 10 generation of Arab, they will change their mind about not wanting to put all the Jews in the sea.</span> <span id="s463">I think they’ll remain exactly the same way.</span> <span id="s464">They want this little land with all the oil, having oil and [indecipherable] all around.</span> <span id="s465">It’s not logical, it’s not reasonable, and it is emotionally very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: What are your memories of the birth of the state of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Dancing in the street.</span> <span id="s468">That we all went downtown, we went to Times Square and every kind of celebration in private homes, and at the embassies all over.</span> <span id="s469">I have one cousin who came over on a ship like the Exodus, saved from a concentration camp and was able to get away like that, became a male nurse in Israel and -- because somebody told him that’s the only way you’re going to get food.</span> <span id="s470">Get into -- get -- start working in a hospital where they have food.</span> <span id="s471">And he studied, he became a male nurse and he met his wife there [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Tell me how you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: My husband was working in the same agency on a different job, ma -- my -- the title of my position was Army Intelligence Research Analyst.</span> <span id="s474">And I had this fabulous job of reading articles and stuff in Hungarian, letters, and then summarizing them and saying this might pertain to something, maybe a railroad station or something like that.</span> <span id="s475">But there were hundreds of magazines that had -- they had -- they were just junk, it had nothing to do with politics.</span> <span id="s476">And I -- my husband’s title in that office was -- he was the lia -- liaison representative of the Army Map Service of the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s477">But he worked between the Pentagon and this -- the Army Map Service.</span> <span id="s478">And he was the [indecipherable] -- oh, I was at a dance on a Saturday night at the Jewish Community Center and he was there.</span> <span id="s479">I was there with a girlfriend, he was there with a boy friend.</span> <span id="s480">And I said to my girlfriend, that boy works with me.</span> <span id="s481">So she said, go over.</span> <span id="s482">I said, I don’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s483">Anyhow, she went over and she says, my girlfriend says you work in the same office.</span> <span id="s484">Anyhow we started to talk, and then that’s how we got started to go out together.</span> <span id="s485">And one of the reasons our marriage works is he was born in Vienna, he came in 1941 and I think that many of our backgrounds are very, very similar and we don’t have some of the difficulties that people of different philosophies have, and we have less disagreements on major issues on some of -- you know, on some of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: You -- you mentioned your children.</span> <span id="s487">Can you tell me their names and just a little bit about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s489">My oldest daughter is Debbie and she is a special education teacher that she --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: An airplane is --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: They’re not supposed to do that.</span> <span id="s492">There’s no airplanes around Washington.</span> <span id="s493">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s494">It’s here.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Let’s pause until this passes.</span> <span id="s496">[tape break] Okay, we’re back, that plane has stopped buzzing us.</span> <span id="s497">You were telling me about your daughter Debbie.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yes, her name is Debbie, she’s a teacher and she specializes in special -- in -- in children who come from non-English speaking homes.</span> <span id="s499">She has two classes, one in the morning, a whole [indecipherable] one in the afternoon, first grade.</span> <span id="s500">And they have special program devised specifically for children who come from non-English speaking homes.</span> <span id="s501">And you want me to tell you about the other children, or the family of [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s502">Okay, she’s married to a guy who is an accountant and they have two children, one of them is Rachel, she’s in second year college, and Jossy who is a senior in high school.</span> <span id="s503">And then my middle daughter’s name is Lisa and she lives in California, in Clearwood, right outside -- it’s right outside of L.A..</span> <span id="s504">And she is a CEO of a national corporation for Parents Anonymous, which is an organization that deals with parents, hopefully before they strike children.</span> <span id="s505">In -- in other words, they feel they are going to and they have these meetings and help parents.</span> <span id="s506">And now, she took it over when it was dying and now she -- it’s in every state, and that she gets grants from Congress and also from toy companies like Mattel to -- to work their program.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: I’m going to interrupt you so I can change the tape.</span> <span id="s508">One moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: -- uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Susan Berlin.</span> <span id="s512">This is tape number two, side A. And you were telling me about your second daughter and her work in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Okay, she is the CEO of an organization called Parents Anonymous and they work with children, parents and different people, and -- in helping them before they become violent.</span> <span id="s514">And she has -- sh -- there’s a chapter in every city -- in every state now, and she has -- her husband’s a professor at UCLA, he teaches Latin American economics.</span> <span id="s515">And they have two children, one of them is 16 and one of them is six.</span> <span id="s516">And my youngest daughter is Cindy, and she’s a lawyer and her husband is a psychiatric social worker.</span> <span id="s517">And she has two children, one of them 14 and one of them 11.</span> <span id="s518">And she works for a -- a Wall Street law firm, the seventh largest in the -- in the United States, the name of which I never, never remember.</span> <span id="s519">But she just retired from there cause tha -- she was working 60 hours, and she got a new job with a giant corporation as the labor -- labor policy director and the ethics committee chairman.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: What did you tell your children about your childhood experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Well, you know, they -- they were very happy to listen to any kind of stories that I -- I tried to tell them the funny ones that were, you know, more humorous than otherwise, but sometimes they just want me to tell them about anything.</span> <span id="s522">How was school, how was -- how was this and how was that and how we celebrated certain holidays.</span> <span id="s523">They were very -- they’re very much interested in my past and my husband’s past.</span> <span id="s524">I -- I can’t think of anything specific.</span> <span id="s525">I must say to you that they want to hear -- they want to know everything and if I told this, it’s say it again, they really want to hear everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: While I was changing the tape you told me about some advice you gave your daughters.</span> <span id="s527">Would you please repeat that so that we record that?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: When they were still in high school and we would discuss careers very often, I had this notion that a lot of people, my friends, were being fired and I asked -- I told them that the most important thing I think, after liking what you do, is not to depend someone else for a job, but to -- to be able to hang up your shingle, you know, I was thinking of law or medicine, something where you can be in business for yourself.</span> <span id="s529">And not to depend on a man to support you.</span> <span id="s530">And you know, after awhile she said, well we know, we know that already, Ma, you don’t want us -- i-it’s not -- not that I didn't want them to get married, I just didn't want them to depend solely, because people in my generation, they did that.</span> <span id="s531">They were very unsuccessful.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You were in this country during some very turbulent -- turbulent times, and you were raising children in some very stressful times.</span> <span id="s533">I’d like you if you could to reflect on some of the events that you witnessed in this country, and let’s -- let’s start with the Cold War, and perhaps even the Cuban missile crisis.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Wa -- what’s the last one you asked me?</span> <span id="s535">The co --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Cu-Cuban missile crisis.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Oh, the Cuban missile crisis.</span> <span id="s538">The Cuban missile crisis was very -- my -- my husband is a tremendous -- a historian by hobby, and wi -- and he -- he likes nothing else, and with the kids too, we talked all the time about politics.</span> <span id="s539">And the Cuban missile crisis was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s540">Everybody felt that we were on the brink of something very, very serious happening and we would present our view and our fear of the insecurities and we -- we would let them talk.</span> <span id="s541">And even though it was an unlikely situation, they each knew that they had an opinion, you know, to -- to give in terms of their political views, that of course Daddy was arch-conservative and they were arch-liberal, etcetera, etcetera, and I tell you, there was one -- my middle daughter was the most liberal one, she went on all the marches and the school about wearing slacks when you weren’t supposed to and she got expelled and he was really upset with her.</span> <span id="s542">And she overheard a conversation that my husband and I had where he compared her to Patty Hearst, I don’t know if you remember it.</span> <span id="s543">And she overheard that conversation and she came in and she was very upset.</span> <span id="s544">And I said to my husband, that was the wrong example, it was tha -- it took us months and months for her -- for us to try to -- you know, she went on every march, to Lincoln Memorial and everything, and -- a-and she was sick one day, I had to go on a march for her.</span> <span id="s545">But I felt that it was something very sincere in her and I did not feel it was bad.</span> <span id="s546">I don’t think it was extreme and I was more tolerant of her, which made a good combination with my husband.</span> <span id="s547">He was not as tolerant, he just felt she was much too -- much, much too liberal about taking chan -- he was very upset when she got expelled for 24 hours about marching, about wearing pants, which is so stupid when you think about it.</span> <span id="s548">And she was the one that really st -- was way out to the left among the three of them, and the other two were more or less in the middle.</span> <span id="s549">But no matter what came up in politics, we discuss it at every dinner table, and after dinner and -- and we had a friend from New York who came and visited at one dinner and he said, I would give my right arm if my family would be willing to talk about politics so much.</span> <span id="s550">So my husband said, you know, it’s -- they got so used to it because we talked about it like other people talk about coffee and tea, we talk about what happens in politics, there’s so much part of our daily living an-and he’s very much into that, that I think the kids became part -- interested in that.</span> <span id="s551">And even now they talk on the telephone with California [indecipherable] about anything that happens over there, my kids want to talk to him about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: How about the Civil Rights movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: The Civil Rights movement was a -- something that, again, it was some -- my -- my kids marched, all of them, at all ages.</span> <span id="s554">What was -- the one that was 12 and she was marching in mothers against abor -- for abortion and -- and like that, and I said to her, do you know what it is that you’re marching for?</span> <span id="s555">And you know, at 12 she explained to me very clearly, and I said to my husband, I -- I think it’s wonderful that she is so knowledgeable and everything, but at 12 I would be happier if she was playing with Barbie basically.</span> <span id="s556">There’s such a long period that she has to worry about this particular problem in our -- which will not go away, and a -- all that.</span> <span id="s557">But most of my -- my kids, my family were just -- partook in the marches.</span> <span id="s558">I was less of a marcher.</span> <span id="s559">I was a marcher in philosophy, but not in act.</span> <span id="s560">But they all marched.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: But how did you, as a Holocaust survivor, see this civil -- Civil Rights issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Well, I think it was very important for them to have the -- th-the -- our Civil Rights were terrible.</span> <span id="s563">The conditions of blacks in this country was shocking to me when I -- I -- I -- first of all, I never saw a black person until I came here, so that whole even visual concept was brand new to me.</span> <span id="s564">And there was no class like the black class in Europe, it was entirely different.</span> <span id="s565">But, you know, you’re reading about Jefferson and Sally ha -- y-you just can’t believe the hypocrisy of the -- o-of all classes of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: You made reference to one of your children marching.</span> <span id="s567">How -- how about the sex -- sexual revolution?</span> <span id="s568">You were raising daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: You know, I don’t -- how -- how do you define that?</span> <span id="s570">I don’t remember going through that very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: It was, you know, they were very liberal from day one, and I-I -- as they were growing up, and I just thought that all the girls now were -- you know, certain things existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: On a more serious note, the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s575">The museum had a speaker who caught Eichmann and he was the most fabulous speaker, wa -- th-the guy that looked this short, and white hair, of course it looked very different, and the judge was here and they held a [indecipherable] they -- they tel -- told the story how they caught him, which was fabulous.</span> <span id="s576">Eichmann was especial painful to us because he was the chief architect of the Hungarian Jews, and I think it was fabulous that after all those years they were able to catch him and bring him back and bring him to trial.</span> <span id="s577">And he didn’t deserve a trial like he got, he got a ver -- a very, very fair trial.</span> <span id="s578">And he should have been burning in hell for a long time for what he did.</span> <span id="s579">I don’t think that the trials are equal to the crimes at all.</span> <span id="s580">That’s again personal, I guess.</span> <span id="s581">You know, you -- you can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: How about the Korean War and the war in Vietnam?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Well, I must say that I did not feel with the young people, I felt very much -- well, the Vietnamese war was a terrible mistake, I felt, because the French lost.</span> <span id="s584">They were there for 25 years and they s -- couldn’t do it and they said to us, don’t go in.</span> <span id="s585">And I felt that that was a very logical advice.</span> <span id="s586">How can you go in in an area where you don’t know the terrain, you don’t know anything about -- I think it was a lost war before it started.</span> <span id="s587">And the Korean War, I must tell you I’m not familiar enough to give a [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: How about the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, Junior?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Well, I don’t see how anybody can but feel very s -- deep sadness about that.</span> <span id="s590">I think that Kennedy had the potential of bringing something very great to this country in terms of inspiring young people, and -- and the fact that so many assassinations happen shows this country is very gun -- although the -- Kennedy said no, you can’t protect anybody.</span> <span id="s591">That’s what he himself said.</span> <span id="s592">You can’t protect a president a hundred percent.</span> <span id="s593">Nevertheless, no one has as many assassinations as we do.</span> <span id="s594">And the role that guns play here is tremendous and it’s very fearful and it’s scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: When your kids were growing up were you a stay at home mom, or did you continue to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I -- I stayed at home because I noticed very early that when they came home from school they were ready to talk about certain things and at eight o’clock they were not.</span> <span id="s597">So I decided to quit my job, although they were willing to take me back to the Army Map Service cause there are so few Hungarian speaking people, on a part time basis, which at that point was in the 50’s, it wasn’t that common.</span> <span id="s598">And I decided to stay home.</span> <span id="s599">And my -- my oldest daughter Debbie began to draw very nicely and she came home one day and she said, Mommy, the teacher said that the sun is here, th-th-the -- the house is here and the -- this -- the sun isn’t always on the right hand side.</span> <span id="s600">I tried to tell the teacher sometimes it’s in the middle, when I’m walking.</span> <span id="s601">Teacher didn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s602">So I decided to study art at that point because I saw that my kid had something that that teacher never learned, a methodology.</span> <span id="s603">And I liked to draw when I was a kid, and ev -- everything else.</span> <span id="s604">And I took a la -- a few art courses and then I studied with Jack [indecipherable] who is a local Washington colorist.</span> <span id="s605">And I decided to go to st -- to teach art.</span> <span id="s606">Now, at that point, art was not taught in every school, and they didn’t have any art teachers.</span> <span id="s607">The only way they could hire me was through resource teacher job and I -- and they started me with [indecipherable], and places where they didn’t even have pencils.</span> <span id="s608">The school in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s609">And I started to teach art to children that actually never even had a pencil to draw with, and they were just thrilled with it.</span> <span id="s610">And I devised a method and I started to teach kindergarten through sixth grade.</span> <span id="s611">I -- I liked that age because th -- in that kindergarten you can do a lot with -- take them out and look at the trees and you show them the bark and feel the bark.</span> <span id="s612">And it was just my own ideas.</span> <span id="s613">And I began to teach un -- for -- until I retired, I guess, in 1968 and was in the school system, some -- in two or three schools, sometimes.</span> <span id="s614">But in addition to that, I worked at Camp Louise.</span> <span id="s615">I don’t know if you know where that is.</span> <span id="s616">I was the head of their craft department, but then I wanted to introduce more fine art.</span> <span id="s617">And I hired more counselors who did painting and drawing and sketching and things like that for the whole summer.</span> <span id="s618">And I did that for 25 years, I enjoyed that very much and I felt that children away from parents and not near a classroom, were very receptive to -- to learning and self expression.</span> <span id="s619">And Louise has 400 acres of -- of land and you could go under a tree and just all day, spend all day just looking at the way the grass looks at different places.</span> <span id="s620">So I was very successful doing that, and I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s621">And what I did is that I called every parent that I felt had a potential student, in the fall, to give them lessons.</span> <span id="s622">And I made that a very strong point.</span> <span id="s623">I told the child that I will do that.</span> <span id="s624">And since then, which was about 20 years ago, I meet kids in restaurants and different places where they’ve said, oh you remember me?</span> <span id="s625">There was one kid the other day that says, do you know I am one of the head designers at Bloomindales in their interior department and it was all because of what you taught me about symmetry and asymmetry.</span> <span id="s626">She even remembered what I was working with her.</span> <span id="s627">And I had -- I had a great time with kids during the summer, with art and with -- it all started with my child and art.</span> <span id="s628">Now, out of my three children, they all love art and we all go to museums a lot.</span> <span id="s629">But one of my grandchildren paints very well [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s630">We had some of her stuff framed.</span> <span id="s631">And a -- and art has worked through th -- my whole family that way and -- and we’re very happy tha -- doing it.</span> <span id="s632">And I just recently stopped because my arthritis does not permit me to paint [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s633">But I’m in -- I’m -- my -- my next best job is the museum.</span> <span id="s634">I love to work with the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Can you tell me about your work with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes, I am in the education department and our primary thing is to take children, middle and high school age, those were the first ones, through the museum and they are supposed to have some background, one of the teachers goes to these schools and gives them a few lessons.</span> <span id="s637">But 99 percent of them don’t even know what the word means.</span> <span id="s638">The first thing I ask them is do you know what the Holocaust is, and you can see on their faces, mm -- mm -- no.</span> <span id="s639">It’s no use to go to that museum, and I told this at every meeting to everybody, if they don’t know the meaning.</span> <span id="s640">If you don’t know the word, you are wasting so much time because you are talking about something so abstract, and -- and you -- you know, you have to put these kids, some of them don’t even know where Europe is, or -- or what is it that we’re trying to do.</span> <span id="s641">We are not giving them enough basics.</span> <span id="s642">But I worked on that and I succeeded partially, and I am continuing on it that way.</span> <span id="s643">At first, as I take, and we have about 12 to a group on a good day.</span> <span id="s644">On a bad day we have 50 - 60, you define the Holocaust, you stand in the Hall of Witness and I try to teach them something about the architecture because I think it’s a very important part.</span> <span id="s645">You know, if I only spend five minutes, there has to be something said about the architecture.</span> <span id="s646">Then we go upstairs and then I try to go over and I explain to them we don’t have time for every picture.</span> <span id="s647">But as we walk along, if something appeals to you that I’m not stopping, just stop me and I can stop again.</span> <span id="s648">The main thing is that I try -- and I must confess to you that not everybody has this technique yet, to be able to get down on the level that the majority of the group is on.</span> <span id="s649">To pick that up on their eyes, because they’re too embarrassed to ask questions because they feel that they’ll appear dumb, okay?</span> <span id="s650">So you have to somehow, sometimes ask questions, but sometimes the questions are a waste of time because they don’t know the answers, but somehow or other feel and see of what level you have to bring.</span> <span id="s651">And that’s what -- that’s what I do.</span> <span id="s652">That’s what I try to do and I think that’s what I do well.</span> <span id="s653">And I -- and -- and now, a couple of months ago they started to do the police.</span> <span id="s654">The police chief, Ramsey thought that all the police should go up, and the CIA.</span> <span id="s655">And I -- having a choice I like the children better.</span> <span id="s656">Well, I think that sometimes the police [indecipherable] almost like entertain me.</span> <span id="s657">Without the word entertain, but like teach me.</span> <span id="s658">I -- I -- I know everything, kind of.</span> <span id="s659">That’s what I see on the face, you see, and it’s not always there.</span> <span id="s660">The children then, have a book what they can write what their opinion is or what they want, or -- and I suggest to the teachers to have them do two things.</span> <span id="s661">Write an essay about it and also draw.</span> <span id="s662">Art is a fabulous thing to draw wha -- about the things, about what they saw.</span> <span id="s663">And the most -- most meaningful thing that was ca -- on -- in the book, was written by black girls who said that up to now I only thought that my people suffered, and I didn't want to hear about anybody else suffering.</span> <span id="s664">But going to this museum, it opened my eyes that there are other people who have suffered also, and I must learn about their suffering.</span> <span id="s665">And I think that if we get one percent of this through to one percent of the population, that we’ve succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: What are the ages of some of the children that you’re referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Middle school is -- and high school.</span> <span id="s668">And then we have some college and then we have Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s669">The Hebrew school brings younger ones, cause they have some preparation.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Like Bar and Bat Mitzvah age?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Well, the -- the -- the Hebrew school teacher gives them some preparation and all that.</span> <span id="s672">And they have col -- college kids too, we have, and -- and there’s a new thing that I do that I just -- before I was sick I was ate -- not able to join, which is called wrap up, which is -- you ask me what I do, I don’t know whether you wanted to know about this part.</span> <span id="s673">It is -- you are given -- the group is given 28 or 30 photographs, and they are divided in 30 groups where they double up, depending on how many there are, and they make a line and hold the photographs in sequential order.</span> <span id="s674">The photographs of the permanent exhibit.</span> <span id="s675">And they -- the whole group decides, well this happened before, this happened before and then they make a line or a circle and then they discuss, do you think this pa -- photograph belongs here or there?</span> <span id="s676">It’s called wrap up.</span> <span id="s677">It is something that, if we have enough time to do it, it has a very good review concept.</span> <span id="s678">And it was done by Tim Kaiser, who is blind.</span> <span id="s679">I don’t know if you know him, he’s in the education department.</span> <span id="s680">We have a person in the education department, can’t see.</span> <span id="s681">But it’s a very good tool.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Are you involved with any other Holocaust organizations or institutions?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Have you ever been back to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yes, three times.</span> <span id="s686">There -- there are no Jews there.</span> <span id="s687">I wanted to see the -- where I was born and that apartment house is very similar, it looks similar than it -- than it did.</span> <span id="s688">Then, there’s a place where my fath -- i-it was square and my father had a store there.</span> <span id="s689">But that was the Communist headquarters; at the time that I was there was under Communism with red flags all over.</span> <span id="s690">And the third time my main thing, I was looking for the convent where I learned English, and that was totally grazed and they had something else on.</span> <span id="s691">And then I went into the cemetery because I had some grandparents buried there, but th-the -- the stones were all gone [indecipherable] gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: What years were -- were your trips to your hometown?</span> <span id="s693">What years?</span> <span id="s694">When did you go?</span> <span id="s695">A: I’m going to have to guess on that.</span> <span id="s696">Surely I was there -- let’s see, Communism was about ’75 -- about ’81 and maybe ’59 or ’60.</span> <span id="s697">But under Communism we found some relatives who, through some other people said that they can’t write because that would be looked upon very poorly, having American relatives.</span> <span id="s698">And we understood that, that -- we were just glad to see that they were alive, through somebody, but not to correspond.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So who in your family did survive the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I have one cousin in -- in Israel, who is my age, who -- who -- who has survived as [indecipherable] one of the ships like the Exodus and then became a male nurse.</span> <span id="s701">I have one cousin in -- in Hungary who survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s702">Do we have time?</span> <span id="s703">What time is it?</span> <span id="s704">Oh.</span> <span id="s705">She came on the train in Auschwitz -- to Auschwitz, and she was -- she had a baby in her arm.</span> <span id="s706">And she was told on the line that if you bi -- give the baby to your mother on the other line, they’re not going to kill the mothers and children.</span> <span id="s707">And of course that went first.</span> <span id="s708">Train she was on stopped and there was some kind of trouble, she got out not in the front of the car, but in the back door of the car and it said küche, and she spoke German.</span> <span id="s709">She went into the kitchen, she put on a chef’s hat and a chef’s uniform and started to -- and a -- an officer came in and she said -- he said, are you a new cook?</span> <span id="s710">And he -- she said yes.</span> <span id="s711">And she survived Auschwitz being in -- the cook, for three years there, without any papers or anything like that.</span> <span id="s712">And she was -- she was -- had a hard time because she could steal food, like the milk cans, you see?</span> <span id="s713">She could mark cans spoiled and they took them away at night.</span> <span id="s714">Well, where do you send the milk cans?</span> <span id="s715">There are 10,000 people in Auschwitz and the word got around that she sends the milk cans here.</span> <span id="s716">And the people that saw her walking someplace would try beating her up.</span> <span id="s717">It was a very difficult position in this particular area of Auschwitz, to be working in the kitchen, and not be able -- be equal to 10,000 people in terms of what you can do extra.</span> <span id="s718">So even when she survived and went home, the people tried to stone her, oh it’s a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s719">But she survived.</span> <span id="s720">She had a husband who was a Hungarian Jewish officer and they -- the Germans put those in the front of the Russian line so they should kill them.</span> <span id="s721">He was captured by the Russians, she hasn’t heard for seven years, the rabbi said that you can get married.</span> <span id="s722">So she was marrying his brother and two days before the wedding, he came home.</span> <span id="s723">And this is what -- what the -- for seven years he was in a Russian camp and he had a prayer book that was one inches long, someplace hidden.</span> <span id="s724">And he was davening one night and a Russian soldier saw him and said, I’m Jewish too, I’ll get you enough food.</span> <span id="s725">So he gave him enough soup to last that he survived the seven year.</span> <span id="s726">Then they were sent home, about 20 of them from this camp, and they hit a warehouse.</span> <span id="s727">They broke into a warehouse, it was a sugar warehouse, it had sacks of sugar.</span> <span id="s728">They cut the sugar open, they started to eat the sugar and 95 percent of them died because their stomachs were this small, and my cousin’s husband fainted after about the fifth -- and his luck was that he fainted and didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s729">So then he walked back to where he was, which took another couple of days and he came in.</span> <span id="s730">So that’s the second and the third survivor.</span> <span id="s731">I have another survivor in Czechoslovakia who was in Auschwitz, and I don’t know how she survived.</span> <span id="s732">And the rest, a few of them, are the second cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Have you ever experienced any anti-Semitism in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: No, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: What has been your best surprise about life in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: You could become anything you want to.</span> <span id="s737">The United States was very good to my family in -- in every possible way.</span> <span id="s738">Financially, e-economically, educationally.</span> <span id="s739">I mean, there was nothing that was denied to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: What was your biggest disappointment in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Maybe the slowness of the Civil Rights, the fact that -- that there aren’t -- isn’t more equality.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Is there anything more you’d like people to understand about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I am an optimist and that’s not a universal feeling among survivors or people that are looking at the future today.</span> <span id="s744">I feel that my family survived and Judaism survived with them, and it’s not going to disappear until there’ll be two people, like in Masada.</span> <span id="s745">I think that -- that Judaism will survive under all circumstances and I certainly, in my family will make sure that it does, and make it as palatable and as ag -- as agreeable to my family as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Is there anything that we haven’t discussed that you’d like to add before we conclude?</span> <span id="s747">A: No.</span> <span id="s748">I think that I -- I’ve said everything and I -- I repeat, I -- I don’t have any suffering to report, that -- any hardships like most people that have gone through, you know, the concentration camps [indecipherable] pictures and the books, as much as I can read on it, is a horror to remember, you know.</span> <span id="s749">I’m a diabetic and every time I take a needle, do twice a day and it hurts, I think about all those people in Auschwitz having no insulin and what they must have suffered, and the pain disappears.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q:
