feel about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, at that time, we’re young.</span> <span id="s47">And when they bombed Pearl Harbor, made us kind of mad.</span> <span id="s48">We took it as a joke, tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s49">And we – and after we started reading stories about it, and stories about – about Germany, and it turned us, started turn us.</span> <span id="s50">And, when the – I went in there, down to Camp Forrest, Tennessee, went through training down there.</span> <span id="s51">Then I went through training up at f-fort – Camp S-Salano(ph), Kansas, up at Camp Phillips.</span> <span id="s52">From there we sent us out to Yuma, Arizona to desert training.</span> <span id="s53">Then they sent us to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s54">New Jersey, the training there was about how many bars you could go down the street without getting drunk, from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And how long in – how long did that training take?</span> <span id="s56">How long of a period of time was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Oh, let’s see.</span> <span id="s58">Was year and a half in training.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s60">And was that all stateside, or – what happened when you went to Europe?</span> <span id="s61">Was there more training in – in – in Britain?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: In – in a – we got to England, was there about four weeks, picking up ammunition and waiting for our turn to go across the channel.</span> <span id="s63">We did some tr-training over there, ni – mostly night

left there, went down through Southampton, left out of Southampton to Utah Beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And when did you arrive at Utah Beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: U-Utah Beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: When – when did you arrive there, at Utah?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Boy, that’s a hard date to find.</span> <span id="s72">I can’t remember the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Okay, no worries.</span> <span id="s74">Do you feel that – all of that training, did it adequately prepare you for combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I was in regimental headquarters, and most of the people in regimental headquarters are specialists, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s76">I was in communications.</span> <span id="s77">And then – [background voices] Yeah, 15th of August, that’s when I got over there.</span> <span id="s78">That prepared us, I think, that year and a half, compared to what they’re training now, you know, weeks.</span> <span id="s79">They’re not getting enough training.</span> <span id="s80">And – and we got in France, and we do – was in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s82">And you said you were a radio lineman, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, I was a wireman.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Wireman.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Wireman.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: In the wire section the – in communications.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: And I said that most everybody in that regiment headquarters were specialists in something, radio, telephone, and my R and R platoon, and they were specialists their own about seeking out the men – enemy.</span> <span id="s90">And actually, the training was enough, cause we knew how to string a line, we knew how to make ties in the line for communications, and go out and repair them after they get – get shot up or broken up, and that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What – can you tell us about your first combat experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: First combat experience, I took a Polish prisoner, first day.</span> <span id="s93">He was wearing a wine colored suit.</span> <span id="s94">He was a – he was operating a machine gun.</span> <span id="s95">He wasn’t pulling the trigger, he was just loading them.</span> <span id="s96">And the SS officer was about 50 to 75 yards in back of him, with a string tied to the trigger of the machine gun, and he pulls – pulls the string for that machine gun to operate.</span> <span id="s97">And these guys were supposed to stay there and load it up when it’s empty, load it up.</span> <span id="s98">If they didn’t, he’d shoot them.</span> <span id="s99">And the – this man come out of the woods there, put his hands up when he saw me.</span> <span id="s100">And so I called the – our sergeant, pa – Sawyer.</span> <span id="s101">He was from Sewickly, he was Polish.</span> <span id="s102">I says, what’s he talking about?</span> <span id="s103">Well, he says, he’s been in that – been in that position for two days now with no water and he wants a drink.</span> <span id="s104">He says, don’t give him anything.</span> <span id="s105">I gave him a slug of water out of my canteen, and he was very grateful for it.</span> <span id="s106">And that was my first combat experience right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s108">And did you – were you at all involved in crossing the Moselle?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: How’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Were you at all involved in crossing the Moselle?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And can you tell – tell us about that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: We crossed the Moselle on September the 12th, and that was mean and nasty fighting down there.</span> <span id="s114">And that’s where I got the Bronze Star first – I mean, first time.</span> <span id="s115">And what happened was, they put us down in a defensive position at Dilliard(ph).</span> <span id="s116">As a – right above a church, a ro – dirt road went up the church, went up the OP.</span> <span id="s117">And they had shelled the OP, and quite a few of them were killed up there.</span> <span id="s118">And they’re sending an ambulance up there.</span> <span id="s119">And they told us that the – we had to stay there in this position.</span> <span id="s120">So I start digging a little bit.</span> <span id="s121">And the first time the 88 come in, and I digging – started digging faster, you know, I was really shoveling dirt there.</span> <span id="s122">What happened was that that, they had notified the guys in back of me, I was a – oh, about – about 50 yards in front of them.</span> <span id="s123">And they rolled back under a big apple tree, and I was out in that bend in the road that goes up the hill.</span> <span id="s124">A Dilliard there from Dilliard.</span> <span id="s125">And I happened to look across the field, here come a German patr – patrol across the field.</span> <span id="s126">And there wasn’t supposed to be a German on that side of the river.</span> <span id="s127">I saw they’re getting close, closer and closer to our position, and I start cutting loose at them when they got too close.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: How were you armed?</span> <span id="s129">How were you armed?</span> <span id="s130">Wha-What weapon were you carrying?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: The M1</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: The M1</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: M1.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: The carbine or the full sized?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: The – the – the full [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Right, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s138">And then I knocked off the last three in that patrol, there was approximately nine of them.</span> <span id="s139">And I knocked off the last three, and I thought, it’s funny, I don’t hear no shots behind me.</span> <span id="s140">Here what happened was the sergeant come up and ordered the men under the tree to fall back.</span> <span id="s141">And they forgot to tell me when I was up there digging.</span> <span id="s142">And that really made me mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: They left me there by myself.</span> <span id="s145">I knocked off the first three, and the rest of them gave – saw the three were being knocked off, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s146">And to this day, when I talk to Felix, he was down in a building in there, and they said he’s – he said it’s all the same patrol.</span> <span id="s147">That’s another – he’s over there, and so then, actually, I wasn’t supposed to be doing that work.</span> <span id="s148">I’m – I’m a – I’m a wireman, but I had to defend my position, and I did.</span> <span id="s149">And not only it happened then, it happened during the whole war, especially in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s150">And from then on, when we – well, after – after Argentan, Argentan-Falaise Gap, that battle up there in France, that was the beginning of it, and then when he got to Moselle river, which driving across France, you know, 50 - 60 mile an hour, how fast you want to go, until we got to Orleans.</span> <span id="s151">And I got a picture of G Company in Orleans.</span> <span id="s152">Did you ever see that picture?</span> <span id="s153">One guy was carrying a sniper rifle.</span> <span id="s154">And then the [indecipherable] got to Moselle, that’s – that’s where what, 317th lost 300 and some – 365 men, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s155">Across that river.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A2: The battalion, the battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A2: The battalion lost that.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yeah, yeah, we lost 365 men right there at crossing.</span> <span id="s160">And which I thought, and some others too say [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s161">Back in – back before this war started, when I was in school, I studied history.</span> <span id="s162">My family goes back as far as the year 1205.</span> <span id="s163">I’m entitled to wear a deer’s head [indecipherable] with a dagger through his head.</span> <span id="s164">You know what that means?</span> <span id="s165">It means your ancestors fought in the Crusades.</span> <span id="s166">And I had a relative fight in all wars, from [indecipherable] World War, Civil War, Spanish War, American war, and the – like, I had a uncle – great-uncle was killed in World War I.</span> <span id="s167">He got the DSO for what he did, but he died for it.</span> <span id="s168">He rescued two of his buddies out on the field, and he got machine-gunned.</span> <span id="s169">And they – they named a street down in Fort Benning, Brockman Way, because he got the DSO.</span> <span id="s170">And – so our family’s been in a – wars, all wars.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Can you tell us about the battle – your experiences at the Battle of the Bulge?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Cold, cold, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s173">We were gonna left – I was gonna head to – was heading to Beechy, out of Saint Avold, France.</span> <span id="s174">We got down there about 11 o’clock at night, and we was to go across into Beechy, Germany there.</span> <span id="s175">And they said, never mind.</span> <span id="s176">There’s trucks up there, get on them, you’re going for a long ride.</span> <span id="s177">So we took the long ride up to Luxembourg, a hundred – hundred mile way.</span> <span id="s178">And the first stop in Luxembourg, there’s a bend in the road going from Luxembourg city, up to Mersch.</span> <span id="s179">There’s a big bend road.</span> <span id="s180">The – in the middle of that bend is a – is a bar, a café.</span> <span id="s181">And that’s when we first got our first booze in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s182">We got Luxembourg – Mersch, the town of Mersch, top the hill Mersch was a knocked out German tank – I don’t know who knocked that out – knocked out tank there.</span> <span id="s183">And I knew then something’s wrong up here, we’re just going up here for a holiday.</span> <span id="s184">But we got up to Mersch and then we headed up north to Ettelbruck.</span> <span id="s185">We’re still going riding, riding at night.</span> <span id="s186">Ettelbruck, we took the back road above Ettelbruck, and it circled down around Oberfeulen and we went into Niederfeulen.</span> <span id="s187">And that’s where we stopped for a couple weeks right there, Niederfeulen.</span> <span id="s188">And then from Niederfeulen we went to Heiderscheid, Heiderscheid, and then there was a lot of towns, small towns around there.</span> <span id="s189">Tadler and Kehmens(ph).</span> <span id="s190">And from there we went to Wiltz.</span> <span id="s191">After we hit Wiltz, it was miserable cold.</span> <span id="s192">And we’re going up to Buchholz, and that was cold.</span> <span id="s193">The wind was blowing like crazy.</span> <span id="s194">And the town where we stopped, that was it.</span> <span id="s195">And they put us back on the trucks again, and they took us down south to cross into – over to the crossing to Depburg.</span> <span id="s196">What was the name of that river?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A2: Sauer river.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Sauer river.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A2: And Diligen(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: And Diligen(ph), yeah.</span> <span id="s201">Diligen’s(ph) where – where I crossed.</span> <span id="s202">And I went back over there, first trip when I went back was in ’72, my wife and I went over.</span> <span id="s203">And we stopped there at Diligen(ph).</span> <span id="s204">It’s a – where we cr – where they had the bridge head, that was the – some farmer.</span> <span id="s205">And he was mad at us, even then.</span> <span id="s206">Because the engineers come in and knocked his barn down to make a crossing.</span> <span id="s207">And I still ta – I didn’t do it, you know?</span> <span id="s208">And then, we crossed there, and then into Bitburg, and come back down.</span> <span id="s209">Back down, we come back down into – to Luxembourg, and from Luxembourg we crossed over the river again, and we stayed over there, that si – this time, we stayed over there.</span> <span id="s210">We went into Saarburg, Saarburg and up to the t-town, little town of Oberzerf.</span> <span id="s211">That’s where Turner got his medal, Oberzerf.</span> <span id="s212">Zerf, Zerf.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A2: Dolle.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Dolle?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A2: Dolle is where he got his Congressional Medal of Honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Well, who got – who got the [indecipherable] at Oberzerf?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A2: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Ri-Right there, we crossed there, at Zerf, and Oberzerf was before Zerf.</span> <span id="s219">And that’s where they throwed these Screaming Mimis at us, in this town.</span> <span id="s220">And it hit the General McBride’s Jeep, flattened it flatter than a pancake.</span> <span id="s221">And the communication officer, Officer Dolka(ph), well, anyway, he got his [indecipherable] blown off, and that’s the last I saw of that guy.</span> <span id="s222">And – and then we went through the woods to Gemirth(ph), and we stayed in a cellar which was a grocery store above us.</span> <span id="s223">And I went down the cellar, that’s where they got all the bottles, and the whole platoon stayed down in that cellar that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What did you select?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: They couldn’t get out, we couldn't get out because they was throwing mortar shells on us.</span> <span id="s226">And so we – we was drinking schnapps, chasing it down with white wine.</span> <span id="s227">Don’t ever do it again.</span> <span id="s228">And from then on, we went down through the – those woods, Gemirth(ph), and what was the name of that town?</span> <span id="s229">If I had my map here I’d tell you.</span> <span id="s230">That we went to [indecipherable] and from Kashdra(ph) we went north to Mainz, crossed the river Mainz and from there up to Kassel.</span> <span id="s231">And went up to Kassel and – and then we headed down to Eisenach.</span> <span id="s232">Gerdt, Netbray(ph), the – Autobahn, on the Autobahn, and we got to Weimar.</span> <span id="s233">And it’s four of us in the picture there.</span> <span id="s234">We just decided we need some drinks and we asked these people in Weimar where it was.</span> <span id="s235">And the one man says, you go up this road, he says, it’s two farmers up there, and they make good schnapps.</span> <span id="s236">So we went up that road, and we got within about three miles of the camp.</span> <span id="s237">Now, we didn’t even know the camp was there, we didn't know anything about those camps.</span> <span id="s238">They never told us about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s239">And we – I was driving the truck, we had a three-quarter ton truck, a Dodge, and I was the driver.</span> <span id="s240">And I asked Billman, Corporal Billman, I says, do they have monkeys over here?</span> <span id="s241">He says no.</span> <span id="s242">I says, well look up in them trees.</span> <span id="s243">And there was the inmates.</span> <span id="s244">They saw us coming first, before we saw them, and they went up in the trees to hide.</span> <span id="s245">And one of them was Italian, and the guy from – Siberelli(ph) from Altoona, he’s Italian and he can speak the language.</span> <span id="s246">We asked him about it, what – what you’re doing there?</span> <span id="s247">And they told us about the camp.</span> <span id="s248">We didn’t per – still didn’t believe them.</span> <span id="s249">So we took them up the ca – road up there.</span> <span id="s250">What’s the name of that mountain up there?</span> <span id="s251">Well, anyway, we took them up that camp, and we drove in the front gate.</span> <span id="s252">There wasn’t a guard around, in fact they had disappeared about three days before, and the Americans or anything else, six armored – they heard the six armored tanks coming, and they took off.</span> <span id="s253">And we went in there, and we saw the sights, we saw the bodies, the piles of bodies were right there, and that was it.</span> <span id="s254">And it made us kind of mad.</span> <span id="s255">I’m gonna speak a little rough now.</span> <span id="s256">And we stayed there – we got there on the 11th, we stayed there in Weimar on the 12th, and the 13th, 14th we left.</span> <span id="s257">We started going east then, we had – was ordered to le-leave.</span> <span id="s258">And well, we went back over there, this past year, on the Holocaust day.</span> <span id="s259">The people, I kept asking them, all over the city, you know, I says, you tell me why you was – why the camp was there.</span> <span id="s260">We didn’t know it was there.</span> <span id="s261">So, that made me kind of mad.</span> <span id="s262">I just told them, I says, you’re full of shit.</span> <span id="s263">I says, your kids were playing up in that camp during the war, the whole time, the kids were up there.</span> <span id="s264">They knew it was there.</span> <span id="s265">And you could smell it.</span> <span id="s266">You could smell it, the camp, from miles away.</span> <span id="s267">That’s six miles up there t – from the downtown, and you could smell it.</span> <span id="s268">And so then, when I come th – was up there on the 12th of April this year, they had the ceremony about everything up there, and was greeted by this man from Ukraine, a Russian.</span> <span id="s269">And then when – when the book I got, it’s in my case here.</span> <span id="s270">Okay.</span> <span id="s271">Yup, yup.</span> <span id="s272">It was – no, the little black book in the case.</span> <span id="s273">Little black book.</span> <span id="s274">These are the pictures we took over there.</span> <span id="s275">This what my daughter made up.</span> <span id="s276">This book I brought over there.</span> <span id="s277">It’s in English.</span> <span id="s278">That’s got the pictures of everything, Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Mr. Brockman, let’s – let’s back up to the 11th of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s280">You said you weren't told about the concentration camps and about their existence.</span> <span id="s281">Yet, as you – when you – you first made contact, what did you think you were seeing?</span> <span id="s282">What did you think you were taking in?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: The Crystal Night, I read about that before, back here in the States.</span> <span id="s284">And I always was a reader, and a history man.</span> <span id="s285">And I read about that Crystal Night, and I just wondered, you know, why the people let them do that.</span> <span id="s286">And you figure you got a guy with a black mustache on, he’s the boss, period.</span> <span id="s287">What he did, what he said, what he ordered, if you didn’t do it, you – you were shot, you know.</span> <span id="s288">These SS guys will sho – shoo – shoot you.</span> <span id="s289">I had a run in with a SS man where this picture was taken here of that – that there.</span> <span id="s290">We were talking to those two Polish prisoners.</span> <span id="s291">That was in the middle of some town after we left Weimar.</span> <span id="s292">That’s where we – where it is.</span> <span id="s293">Those guys were walking home from that part of the country to Poland.</span> <span id="s294">We told him stay still, you’ll get transportation, you know?</span> <span id="s295">No.</span> <span id="s296">But anyway, they was in a house.</span> <span id="s297">They were in a, like a slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s298">And was four women, three story house, four women.</span> <span id="s299">And this one come down, when we go into the town, she was covered with blood.</span> <span id="s300">She had a broken nose, busted jaw, her body was beat up.</span> <span id="s301">And I says, what happened to you?</span> <span id="s302">And she told me.</span> <span id="s303">She said, the SS man over there, she says, he tried to rape me.</span> <span id="s304">I says, you mean that private, the SS private?</span> <span id="s305">He says, he’s not an ess – he’s not a private, he’s a captain.</span> <span id="s306">I says, you’re sure about that?</span> <span id="s307">So she called her other girlfriends out of the house, and they says, yes, he’s a captain.</span> <span id="s308">And he beat hell on her, cause he tried to ra-rape her, right then and there.</span> <span id="s309">And well, he got four M1s, right quick like.</span> <span id="s310">Four of shot him, because he had no right to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Were you speaking to the woman in English, or did you have a –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: How’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Were you speaking to the woman in English, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: English, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: What town was that, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: A town?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: That – I don’t re-recall that town.</span> <span id="s319">If they bring that – that book where they took that picture, I would know.</span> <span id="s320">But we run across several of them going down si – when we left – left – we left the – the air – area there Gera.</span> <span id="s321">Now we were south.</span> <span id="s322">And we ran in – across several of those camps.</span> <span id="s323">Labor camps, I mean, there wasn’t the killing then, there was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Working.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: – u – use their bodies, that’s it.</span> <span id="s326">And then we got down to Austria, we stopped at the Enz river, that’s – couldn’t get no further cause we’re supposed to meet the Russians there.</span> <span id="s327">They took three or four days getting there.</span> <span id="s328">But I – that – now, when this first started out, my daughter says, why don’t you go?</span> <span id="s329">I says, no, I says, I – I said, I had enough of it, and I didn't want to be reminded.</span> <span id="s330">You don’t lose sight or track of it in your mind, of what went on over there, during the whole war.</span> <span id="s331">You try to, try to move everything back here.</span> <span id="s332">But di – you don’t, you can’t.</span> <span id="s333">And some people say they do, and I don’t know, I’m aware they’re li – they can’t.</span> <span id="s334">Because it’s something that happened to you.</span> <span id="s335">It turns you.</span> <span id="s336">And then, when we got these camps, we got the Buchenwald, we got the other camps, that really turns you off unto the German people.</span> <span id="s337">Although, there’s a town up in – above Hannover, Germany, it’s called Brockmanville.</span> <span id="s338">Due to the fact we had – the Brockmans were kicked out of England way back before th – it was Crusades times.</span> <span id="s339">And they went to Germany, lived in Germany for 200 years.</span> <span id="s340">And they come back over to England and they come back to England, then from there they went to America.</span> <span id="s341">I got a great-great-grandfather – well, a couple more greats, he’s buried down there in Chester county, phi – Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s342">He was buried down there in 1690.</span> <span id="s343">That’s how old we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Sir, you said it – th-the whole experience in Buchenwald and the other camps, did it change how you felt about the war, and why you were fighting it, and your role in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes, I – it did, du-due to the fact that I was always a happy-go-lucky guy, e-even during the war.</span> <span id="s346">We got through France, I was still a happy-go-lucky guy.</span> <span id="s347">But then when I saw the Buchenwald, and I saw the bodies, and I saw everything there, it – and then you get to thinking about it, it’ll change your mind real quick.</span> <span id="s348">You’re not a happy-go-lucky guy, you’re a killer then.</span> <span id="s349">Even though I was a wireman, I still had to get rid of some guys in our way.</span> <span id="s350">And, well to this day, my daughter still don’t know.</span> <span id="s351">All she knows is [indecipherable], and who was the other woman?</span> <span id="s352">And she started putting everything together.</span> <span id="s353">This picture here, this guy, that’s him right there.</span> <span id="s354">That was taken on the 12th.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: You said it changed – the experiences in the camp changed the way you felt about the Germans and the German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: 317 stayed on a little bit in Germany after the war was officially over.</span> <span id="s358">Did you stay on as well, for –</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: It was official over on – on the seventh.</span> <span id="s360">May the eighth was the official day.</span> <span id="s361">We pulled out of there, was it the – was it – Kurtsdorf(ph), Austria.</span> <span id="s362">And then we went over to Spital am Pyhrn, Austria.</span> <span id="s363">We stayed there, I think about two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s364">Then we moved down to Füssen, Germany, down that part down there.</span> <span id="s365">And I liked that part down there, because that’s where they sent all the women, down there to get away from the bombing.</span> <span id="s366">So – but anyway, on June – June 23rd, I think it was, or 24th, I got a letter from my aunt, and she passed away now, but I got a letter from my aunt saying my brother had been killed over in Europe.</span> <span id="s367">He was killed on May the 10th.</span> <span id="s368">That’s two days after the war he was killed.</span> <span id="s369">He was ground crew chief on a B17 out of England.</span> <span id="s370">And their plane was flying over, dropping Care packages to Holland and Belgium.</span> <span id="s371">He was dropping Care packages there.</span> <span id="s372">An airplane was coming in, another plane was taking off, they come together.</span> <span id="s373">Two planes ti – completely burn up.</span> <span id="s374">The only way you could identify him is by his teeth, after the – and he was buried in the cemetery, Cambridge, England.</span> <span id="s375">And then my uncle was a grange man, and he says, let’s bring him back over to sir – so we got him arl – he’s buried in Arlington now.</span> <span id="s376">And my sister, she was a – she retired as a lieutenant in the WACs, she spent her time down in Japan when occupation.</span> <span id="s377">So then, what did upset me about my brother, because they didn’t no – the government didn’t notify me, which they should have.</span> <span id="s378">And, we brought him back.</span> <span id="s379">But just a lot of things you – people ask me different questions, and then it starts coming back just plain as day.</span> <span id="s380">And I kind of hate that a little bit, because I was trying to forget it.</span> <span id="s381">But when I come back, I was – we come back on a Wednesday, but – see, my daughter had to go with me, she had to be my caretaker, you know, on the trip, on that trip.</span> <span id="s382">And, well, she wanted – so then, we flew back.</span> <span id="s383">We just got back in time when that volcano blew its stack over there, out there, you know.</span> <span id="s384">And so we made it in time.</span> <span id="s385">Well then, the next day, on Thursday, the ra-rabbi from synagogue in Wa-Washington, PA, he called.</span> <span id="s386">And he’s a jolly fellow, real fat.</span> <span id="s387">Beard.</span> <span id="s388">Very jolly.</span> <span id="s389">And don’t ask me his name, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s390">He says, would you like – would you speak in front of the congregation on Friday?</span> <span id="s391">I said, all right.</span> <span id="s392">So I got over there, I got to talking to him before he had this – we had the service on Friday night.</span> <span id="s393">And he says – and he – he made his talk at the service about us soldiers.</span> <span id="s394">He says we should talk and tell about the war.</span> <span id="s395">He says, when they don’t, then – then his whole sermon was about that, we should talk.</span> <span id="s396">Well then, he introduced me, and I asked him, I says, how long you want me to talk?</span> <span id="s397">He says, about 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s398">It was two and a half hours before I got out of there.</span> <span id="s399">Them people have all ears and everything else.</span> <span id="s400">And I passed out there – I passed 150 of these out to them.</span> <span id="s401">And my daughter got them, where she did I don’t know, don’t ask.</span> <span id="s402">But I’m – so then he called me again, he said, why don’t you come back over and do it again, and he says, we’ll tape it.</span> <span id="s403">He got – so I started, from the time I went in the service to almost what’s – I come home.</span> <span id="s404">Took two and a half hours.</span> <span id="s405">I didn’t cover all of it, but I cover most of it.</span> <span id="s406">And then the – what was the name of the lady?</span> <span id="s407">Sounds like tobacco.</span> <span id="s408">Judy, that was it.</span> <span id="s409">She called, she wanted me and my daughter to come over and have lunch with them.</span> <span id="s410">So we went over there.</span> <span id="s411">And it’s quite – quite interesting.</span> <span id="s412">Especially doing the service.</span> <span id="s413">And the book was in English, so it’s – songbook.</span> <span id="s414">I sang right around with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: You said – you said that you did not speak to your daughter about it, did you speak to – about – did you speak to anyone in your family about your experiences in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I talked to no one.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: And why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Not even friends, not even when I go down to American Legion or the vets, I never told about war.</span> <span id="s419">I never said that word to anybody.</span> <span id="s420">And, I had a good friend, by the name of Worth, Danny Worth from Washington, PA.</span> <span id="s421">Not Washington state.</span> <span id="s422">Danny Worth, he’s buried over there in Lorraine cemetery.</span> <span id="s423">At Saint Avold, he was killed [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s424">They had an 88 up the road, straight up the road, and I told him, I says, we gotta get in this other house, cause they got a better cellar in there.</span> <span id="s425">It was brick [indecipherable] brick and that.</span> <span id="s426">And he never made it.</span> <span id="s427">That 88 come down and took his throat right off.</span> <span id="s428">Now here’s a guy that when I go down to Columbia, Tennessee – you know what Columbia, Tennessee is noted for, besides mules?</span> <span id="s429">And Lansing, Michigan the same way.</span> <span id="s430">They got the prettiest girls in the st – in the cou – in the United States there.</span> <span id="s431">And I drove a truck to Lansing, Michigan before the war, and then – then I found out.</span> <span id="s432">But he would be s – he would actually blush walking down the street with a girl.</span> <span id="s433">That’s the type of man he was.</span> <span id="s434">He never swore, he never cussed or anything like that.</span> <span id="s435">He was a radioman in the – in the company, and that – he’s sitting in the Jeep when a shell come in, took his throat off.</span> <span id="s436">He’s buried over there.</span> <span id="s437">Now here’s a guy here, he went to church and all this.</span> <span id="s438">An old reprobate like me is still alive and he’s dead.</span> <span id="s439">Can you figure that out?</span> <span id="s440">Why the good persons go?</span> <span id="s441">I can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Let’s back up a bit to your actual training, when you were in training.</span> <span id="s443">Do you recall anyone – do you recall anybody visiting your training camp?</span> <span id="s444">Was there anybody important who visited your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: We had the President Roosevelt down there, driving through.</span> <span id="s446">We spent three days out in the drill – drill field putting up a pump that’s – and everything was lined up with a string, all the way down through that whole camp, the whole division, that’s 13,000 men.</span> <span id="s447">And he drove through there with that cigar in his mouth, that cigarette lighter – ha – holder, rather.</span> <span id="s448">He drove through that camp, boom, about 90 mile an hour I would say, you know.</span> <span id="s449">And that’s the only one – so, like that.</span> <span id="s450">Roosevelt, that’s the only one come down sa – we saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Was that a thrill for you?</span> <span id="s452">Did you enjoy seeing him, the president?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Well, I’m not a political man, I never liked politics.</span> <span id="s454">And, course they got politicians at home now, they’re giving me awards and decorations, by a dozen now.</span> <span id="s455">I said – I just got one from Tim Murphy over here to – House of Representatives, and his secretary was there ya – last night, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s456">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s457">She was there.</span> <span id="s458">And she hand that to me.</span> <span id="s459">I says, oh-oh, I says, did Barbara have something to do with that?</span> <span id="s460">That’s my daughter.</span> <span id="s461">And she says, yup.</span> <span id="s462">And Murphy, Tim Murphy, because he’s House of Representatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: I’m – I’m sorry to keep coming back to the issue of the camps, but after having seen the camps, labor camps, did it change how you interacted with the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I can’t tell that story, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No.</span> <span id="s467">Yes, it did.</span> <span id="s468">It changed.</span> <span id="s469">Like, we moved in their houses, you got 10 minutes to get out of here, we’re taking over.</span> <span id="s470">And we had one town in a part of the country of – part of Germany.</span> <span id="s471">It’s where the people were ger – women wear their hair in a knot on top of their head.</span> <span id="s472">And I think it’s above – it’s up around Kaiserslautern, Neustadt.</span> <span id="s473">And this woman says, what are you doing over here to us?</span> <span id="s474">We were at the door, told her we will like, take your house, you know, and this.</span> <span id="s475">And she says, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s476">We didn’t ask you to come over here.</span> <span id="s477">She never made it.</span> <span id="s478">She got a .45.</span> <span id="s479">That’s when it start turns.</span> <span id="s480">And, if they didn’t get out of our way, we knocked them out of our way.</span> <span id="s481">And we had to let them know we were soldiers, and we let them know the hard way.</span> <span id="s482">We got down to Austria in Spital am Pyhrn.</span> <span id="s483">We got in a house down there, and they had room for us, we didn't have to kick them out.</span> <span id="s484">And the one girl’s name Heidi, very beautiful blonde.</span> <span id="s485">And she was – I’d say she was strictly a Nazi to begin with.</span> <span id="s486">Her mother was Swiss, her father was German, and he owned about two or three blocks of Berlin up there.</span> <span id="s487">That’s where she’s born and raised, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s488">And I asked her, I says, did you go out there and heil this that, heil this, the guy there, and the – when they had the big parade?</span> <span id="s489">She says no, I says, I don’t believe you.</span> <span id="s490">Well, we left there and I come home, I got a letter from her.</span> <span id="s491">And she’s telling about, you know, she’s having rough time.</span> <span id="s492">So we collected a box of clothes, and my wife sent her her mother’s je – coat, with fur around there.</span> <span id="s493">We sent the clothes over to her.</span> <span id="s494">And we was friends with her for all these years.</span> <span id="s495">And when we went over there – I’ve been over there seven times.</span> <span id="s496">We went back first time over in ’72.</span> <span id="s497">And we went over there, we would always look her up.</span> <span id="s498">And she took us into Austria this last time we saw her, and her mother is in a nursing home, at that time, I think she’s dead now, in Austria down at – at Kitschdorf.</span> <span id="s499">She had nice apartment, balcony overlooking the Alps, beautiful view from across that valley for Kirshdorf there.</span> <span id="s500">And it cost her 28 dollars a month to stay in that apartment building.</span> <span id="s501">And that’s going downstairs to the kitchen to eat, you know, free of charge.</span> <span id="s502">But it start – I started relax a little bit then when I got there, because the war was over then.</span> <span id="s503">And – but she also give me a good wine to drink too, when I want a drink of wine, or – she give me good wine.</span> <span id="s504">That’s why I become friends with her.</span> <span id="s505">[indecipherable] But it’s hard to say, you know, if I could do it over again, I probably would.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, the same situation, everything else, I’d – being now, do it over again, you know something.</span> <span id="s508">You’re a little bit sharper on what’s going on in the world.</span> <span id="s509">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s510">Then, when I read that book about the Crystal Night over here, well that start tearing me right then, you know, could people do this?</span> <span id="s511">And then it started – the other book I read about the Jewish population over there, how they were be tr-treat like that.</span> <span id="s512">And I was never taught to be another nationality, or to be mean to them or anything like that.</span> <span id="s513">My mother was Irish.</span> <span id="s514">If I was – did anything wrong, I got clobbered.</span> <span id="s515">I mean, I got the paddle, more than once.</span> <span id="s516">And that kind of straightens you up a little bit.</span> <span id="s517">But then the – when the – is – in school, when “Life” magazine come out, first come out, and they had some pictures about over here, at that time, and I – I couldn’t understand it, why people could do that.</span> <span id="s518">And that’s what I told these we – people from Weimar, I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s519">That’s where Hitler got his start, out in Weimar.</span> <span id="s520">That the hotel was in, he did his speaker out of the balcony that hotel.</span> <span id="s521">That was – that was nice hotel.</span> <span id="s522">My daughter, she don’t eat fish.</span> <span id="s523">First night was over there, she went like this to the waiter, you know.</span> <span id="s524">And she says, I don’t eat fish.</span> <span id="s525">Well, he got another plate.</span> <span id="s526">Boy, did she get a plate.</span> <span id="s527">Everybody says, we want that too.</span> <span id="s528">And so that go on for about three days like that, my daughter call him over.</span> <span id="s529">If she didn’t like stuff, they’d change it.</span> <span id="s530">We got treated royal.</span> <span id="s531">So I called them over, I got my finger going, I called him over one day – one night.</span> <span id="s532">And I says, we can have anything, and you’ll get anything for us?</span> <span id="s533">Anything you want, we’ll get for you.</span> <span id="s534">I says, I want a Mercedes van.</span> <span id="s535">I says, I want a Mercedes van.</span> <span id="s536">I didn’t get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Do you remember hag – receiving your orders to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I was down Füssen, Germany in the in Schwangau-Horn Schwangau, that’s where I was at, and right below the castle neu, the Neuschwanstein castle.</span> <span id="s539">We had a whole hotel down there to ourselves, our communication wire section.</span> <span id="s540">And we was going – going out on a wire trip, was driving.</span> <span id="s541">And they say, Brock.</span> <span id="s542">I says, what?</span> <span id="s543">They says, pack up, you’re going home.</span> <span id="s544">And it hit me real quick.</span> <span id="s545">I was surprised.</span> <span id="s546">I thought I was going to Japan.</span> <span id="s547">Says no, you’re going home.</span> <span id="s548">And to tell you the truth, I was really sad.</span> <span id="s549">Those guys were down in that truck, which I had been driving all that time, and they’re going out on a job, and I’m not going.</span> <span id="s550">It upset me.</span> <span id="s551">I was, I was – upset me.</span> <span id="s552">I never saw them guys until the-they come home.</span> <span id="s553">Was after they had families and everything else.</span> <span id="s554">This one had about four or five kids.</span> <span id="s555">Siberelli(ph) had about four or five kids.</span> <span id="s556">Billman had three.</span> <span id="s557">And I drove up there and saw them one time, and that’s the last I saw of them.</span> <span id="s558">And one of the guys from the 80th, he said he was from Williamsport.</span> <span id="s559">He says, I think Billman’s dead, because he remembered reading a story about a Billman in the paper.</span> <span id="s560">And I know Siberelli(ph) probably dead, because he was a big drinker.</span> <span id="s561">And Harry Eckrel(ph), I don’t know too much about him, cause he was a nut.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: What was acti – what was coming home like when you actually arrived stateside?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: When I come home, I left
