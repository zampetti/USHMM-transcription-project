the stones in the yard.</span> <span id="s110">But I was running towards my father, because they were in a bigger building and we owned.</span> <span id="s111">And then right away they

today I’m still doing it.</span> <span id="s330">She, and then she was taken away forever.</span> <span id="s331">Then my brother Moniek...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">EM: Could you, I would like to go back to the time when they took your Mom away.</span> <span id="s333">Did they come to the house to take her away?</span> <span id="s334">Or was she notified by, in some way that she has to go to a certain place to be taken away?</span> <span id="s335">Or did they capture her in the street?</span> <span id="s336">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">DL: Yes.</span> <span id="s338">They telled everybody should go down the street, in front of the house.</span> <span id="s339">And in fact she was a very religious person.</span> <span id="s340">She wouldn’t even eat what she was giving [given?]</span> <span id="s341">so she started to swell from the ankles up.</span> <span id="s342">And she was a good candidate for death, so they took her right away away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">EM: So they examined everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">DL: They...</span></p> <p><span id="s345">EM: They looked, well they looked...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">DL: They just looked...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">EM: Everybody...</span></p> <p><span id="s348">DL: At the faces, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">EM: Right, right.</span> <span id="s350">All right, and now, they took your Mom away.</span> <span id="s351">What happened to your other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">DL: My brother got TB and we hardly could get to him any medicine.</span> <span id="s353">In fact we didn’t got nothing.</span> <span id="s354">I remember when he was spitting with blood, and we couldn’t help nothing.</span> <span id="s355">Then it was again a selection and they took him away.</span> <span id="s356">And I got regards--he was a soldier--I got regards that he jumped down the train and he went into the woods with the partisans.</span> <span id="s357">But I can’t believe this, in the condition that he was, so weak, that he was able to do.</span> <span id="s358">But friends assure me that this was true.</span> <span id="s359">So I had to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">EM: Somebody that was on the transport, on the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s361">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EM: That saw him jump?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">EM: You say he was in the uniform.</span> <span id="s365">Was, he was in the Polish Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">EM: When did, did they take him when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s368">Did they take him to the army or was he at home at that time?</span> <span id="s369">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">DL: He came home when the war broke out, he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">EM: When the war broke out he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">EM: O.K., so they took your brother away in Lodz, and your mother.</span> <span id="s374">What was your father doing at that time?</span> <span id="s375">Was he able to work, and what were you doing?</span> <span id="s376">Were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">DL: Yes, my father was working in a, where they maked out something from leather, because he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s378">EM: Shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">DL: Making, yeah, in shoe manufacturing.</span> <span id="s380">And I was working in the straw business, in straw factories, making boots for the soldiers from straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">EM: From straw?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">DL: From straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">EM: Yeah, that was insulating the boots or just...</span></p> <p><span id="s384">DL: Yes, yes, insulating the boots.</span> <span id="s385">And this was in Maryszyn, in Lodzer Ghetto, on Maryszyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">EM: What...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">DL: The factories were there placed in a place in the Lodzer Ghetto.</span> <span id="s388">It was called Maryszyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">EM: Maryszyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">EM: Now, could you describe the Lodz Ghetto a little bit for me?</span> <span id="s392">Was it surrounded by a wall?</span> <span id="s393">Was it surrounded by wires?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">DL: Wires, wires, and police.</span> <span id="s395">And if there is hell on earth, this was the Lodzer Ghetto.</span> <span id="s396">They gave us a little room, and we were, at the time we were, when we came, my mother and brother were still there, but then when they left, my father, me and my sister was there.</span> <span id="s397">But it was hell.</span> <span id="s398">They, the bugs, and the insects were biting us alive.</span> <span id="s399">I remember I was sleeping on a table, because the bed bugs were flying around at night and biting till the blood came out.</span> <span id="s400">And hunger, without describing.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">EM: So there were, and there were many people?</span> <span id="s402">Was this an apartment that you lived in?</span> <span id="s403">A room in an apartment?</span> <span id="s404">And there were other people living in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">DL: It was no apartments.</span> <span id="s406">Everybody got a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">DL: If it was ten people or five people, they got a room.</span> <span id="s409">And this is how they had to manage.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">EM: Now, where did you work?</span> <span id="s411">Did you have to go to work?</span> <span id="s412">Was it far away to go to work?</span> <span id="s413">Or was it, was the place where you lived nearby, near the place of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">DL: It was quite far to walk, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">EM: To walk.</span> <span id="s416">Did you get paid for your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">DL: I got paid with the money from the ghetto, which was called Rumkowski’s money.</span> <span id="s418">I got, but you hardly could buy something.</span> <span id="s419">And they gave out rations, you know.</span> <span id="s420">All our luck was when we came it was the end of the rations and hardly we could get something sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">EM: Were there soup kitchens in the ghetto, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">DL: Yeah, but you had to have a card for the soup kitchen, and we didn’t got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">EM: You didn’t get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">DL:

undescribable.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">DL: And the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">EM: And the cold.</span> <span id="s445">Do you, can you tell me something about Rumkowski?</span> <span id="s446">What did you know about him at the time and what was your attitude towards him?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">DL: I know that he was the King of the Ghetto, and he act like a king.</span> <span id="s448">I never saw him.</span> <span id="s449">Personally I never saw him.</span> <span id="s450">But people used to tell that he is not such a nice guy

Now, how long did you stay in, oh, first, did you have any schools in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s452">Do you remem-...</span></p> <p><span id="s453">DL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">DL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">EM: So you didn’t go to school or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">DL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">EM: O.K.</span> <span id="s459">How long did you stay in the Lodz Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">DL: From ‘42 till ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">EM: Till ‘44.</span> <span id="s462">One more thing.</span> <span id="s463">Were you aware of any smuggling that was going on, of food smuggling?</span> <span id="s464">Did any Poles come in to bring food in or...</span></p> <p><span id="s465">DL: I heard about it.</span> <span id="s466">I heard about it.</span> <span id="s467">But I never witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">EM: You never witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">DL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">EM: You weren’t, you couldn’t get any.</span> <span id="s471">Now, when did they take you out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">DL: They took me out, it would be in July or August.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t exactly remember to the date, but they took us out.</span> <span id="s474">We had to, oh, also we had to meet in the market place and then we were pushed into trains and out we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">EM: Was this the liquidation of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s476">Or do you know if any people still stayed behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">DL: This was the beginning of the liquidation.</span> <span id="s478">And then we heard that this, that they left an amount of 600 people to clean up the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">EM: So, an order was given everybody had to come to the market place?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">EM: And you were taken into the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">EM: Were you told where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">DL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">EM: They didn’t even try to tell you that you’re going to work somewhere else or if...</span></p> <p><span id="s486">DL: No.</span> <span id="s487">They pushed us in like cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">EM: Do you remember if there was any resistance at that point, or talk about a resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">DL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">EM: Nothing.</span> <span id="s491">You don’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">DL: I don’t remember, and I think I was too much down that I did care.</span> <span id="s493">I didn’t care for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s495">Is there anything else you want to tell me about your life in the Lodz Ghetto?</span> <span id="s496">Any incidents that really stand out?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">DL: This was going on for two years, almost two years it was going on, and hunger and fear and cold and sicknesses and whatsnot.</span> <span id="s498">But I will go a little farther, on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">EM: O.K. Now, they pushed you into the train.</span> <span id="s500">Your father and your sister were with you in the same wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">EM: O.K., now describe your train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">DL: Then they pushed us in just like cattle.</span> <span id="s504">I don’t remember my father ever being sick.</span> <span id="s505">But in the train I remember exactly the corner on the left side, my father was sitting down, because he was too weak to stay, so he was sitting down.</span> <span id="s506">And he got so terrible sick at night, which I later understood maybe he had attack on gall bladder, was all, or liver, something.</span> <span id="s507">He was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s508">When we arrived to the place, which I didn’t even know where, they chased us down.</span> <span id="s509">And right away they took away my father.</span> <span id="s510">When they took him away, I was looking around, and I hold my little sister, which is four years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s511">And I said, “Where are they taking him?”</span> <span id="s512">I started to scream, “Where are they taking my father!?”</span> <span id="s513">And somebody said, a smart one said, “Well, he’s gonna fly soon.”</span> <span id="s514">I didn’t relate nothing to that word.</span> <span id="s515">I only cared where is my father taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">EM: So you, they took you to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">DL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">EM: Right?</span> <span id="s519">That was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">DL: Yes, Auschwitz, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">EM: And as soon as you got off the train, there was a selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">EM: And you, at that point they took your father away?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">DL: My father.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">EM: Now, after they took your father away, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">DL: The next happened that they took me and my sister to change our clothes and to cut our hair.</span> <span id="s527">It was such a heartbreaking thing looking at my little sister with her blonde, long curls.</span> <span id="s528">And- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EM: This is an interview with Mrs. Dora Langsam, it’s tape one, side two, Edith Millman interviewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">EM: Now, tell me about, all right, what happened next?</span> <span id="s531">They cut your hair off?</span> <span id="s532">And then they gave you uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">DL: Some kind of shmatas [rags].</span> <span id="s534">They assigned us to the barracks.</span> <span id="s535">I didn’t really know where I went.</span> <span id="s536">I believe before we were staying near the chimney, which I didn’t know either, what it is.</span> <span id="s537">And that Czechish beast told us that...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">EM: What...</span></p> <p><span id="s539">DL: Pretty soon we’re gonna fly.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">EM: Well who was the Czechish beast?</span> <span id="s541">Was this...</span></p> <p><span id="s542">DL: She was...</span></p> <p><span id="s543">EM: A Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">DL: A Kapo.</span> <span id="s545">She was there, from Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">EM: Was she do you know was she a Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">DL: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">EM: She was a Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">DL: Gentile, yes.</span> <span id="s550">And she was calling us by all the filthiest names that I can remember.</span> <span id="s551">And she said that pretty soon we’re all gonna fly.</span> <span id="s552">And I still didn’t know where I am, what’s happening here, and I didn’t pay attention to her.</span> <span id="s553">But then the next day they assigned us to barracks.</span> <span id="s554">And we were there every day calling to Appells, and snow, and in cold and hardly having something to eat.</span> <span id="s555">And they made selections.</span> <span id="s556">They made every day.</span> <span id="s557">And if somebody was missing it was too bad for us.</span> <span id="s558">We had to stay hours and hours till they found the person.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">EM: How long did you stay in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">DL: It was approximately three weeks.</span> <span id="s561">But towards, when they were, one, this is a very step in my life, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s562">It was a selection.</span> <span id="s563">And they took away my [phone; tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s564">EM: O.K., let’s continue.</span> <span id="s565">That was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">DL: It was a selection.</span> <span id="s567">And my sister, which was at that time 12 or 13 years old, she looks like eight she looked.</span> <span id="s568">And they, when the selection was going on they took her away.</span> <span id="s569">And they assured me that she will get milk, and she will be taken care.</span> <span id="s570">But in those few weeks I learned difference.</span> <span id="s571">I got very educated, and I know that it isn’t so what they’re saying.</span> <span id="s572">So they took her away, and my friends of my sisters, we was making a five together.</span> <span id="s573">But when they took away, somebody has to step forward to make the fifth.</span> <span id="s574">Now I looked at her; in my mind was, "If they take her away I will really not know from where I’m coming."</span> <span id="s575">And I was staying like, leaving my breath and my eyesight and my hearing, everything.</span> <span id="s576">In this moment my friend’s sister gave me a push and she gave a scream, “Go grab her!”</span> <span id="s577">At that time the soldier, or the Unterscharführer [S.S. officer's rank] was going in front with two revolvers.</span> <span id="s578">And that Czechish beast was with him.</span> <span id="s579">When I grabbed my sister back to the line, a friend of mine stepped down to make the fifth.</span> <span id="s580">And in that split of the moment, that Czechish beast saw her, that I grabbed her, and she started to scream, "Herr Unterscharführer!</span> <span id="s581">Eine ist geflogen!</span> <span id="s582">Eine ist geflogen!"</span> <span id="s583">[One came out of line.]</span> <span id="s584">He turned around and took the two revolvers, came back to my space, and said he’s counting till five, if I, if, he’s counting to three.</span> <span id="s585">If I don’t step out, with my sister, he’s gonna shoot every fifth.</span> <span id="s586">And this was said and done, too...</span></p> <p><span id="s587">EM: And what...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">DL: But in my case, in that split of the moment came an air...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">EM: Air raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">DL: Air raid.</span> <span id="s591">And they start to whistle around, and they start to blow, and they took everybody from us and they pushed us in in the train.</span> <span id="s592">And this is the miracle, if I believed in miracles, that I have my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">EM: So, just at the moment when he wanted you to get out, that’s when...</span></p> <p><span id="s594">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">EM: That’s when the air raid started.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">DL: I felt that my body is turning, like a, like fifteen degrees, but my knees wouldn’t move.</span> <span id="s597">My knees wouldn’t move.</span> <span id="s598">And this is the moment that I had my sister because of the air raid.</span> <span id="s599">They pushed us into the train and we went off to Neukölln, to a working camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">EM: To a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">DL: Labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">EM: So, how far was Neukölln from Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s603">Do you know?</span> <span id="s604">How long were you in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">DL: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">EM: And this was the whole group still from Brzeziny?</span> <span id="s607">Many, many people from Brzeziny that were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">DL: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">EM: No?</span> <span id="s610">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">DL: No.</span> <span id="s612">They maybe sent them to different places, but I was the only one I think from, maybe a few more which I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">EM: So you and your sister went to Neukölln.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">DL: To Neukölln.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">EM: And tell me about Neukölln.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">DL: Well, this was an ammunition factory which is owned by Krupp.</span> <span id="s617">I believe the building belonged to America, because every day they were bombing it, not destroying the building but just bombing that we should be, that we should not be able to work, to continue with making ammunition.</span> <span id="s618">So the windows and the doors flew every day away.</span> <span id="s619">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">EM: Of the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">DL: It was a factory, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">EM: Of the fac--where did you sleep?</span> <span id="s623">Where did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">DL: In barracks, not far from the factory.</span> <span id="s625">At least we got a meal there.</span> <span id="s626">There we got a meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">EM: O.K., so you say it was bombarded, but the factory was never destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">DL: There wasn’t, the building wasn’t destroyed, but they just assured that the working cannot go on because the windows and the doors blow away every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">EM: So what were you doing in the factory?</span> <span id="s630">Were you working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">DL: Yes.</span> <span id="s632">I made some kind of clocks, watches.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t know if it was for airplanes or something.</span> <span id="s634">They assigned us to one...</span></p> <p><span id="s635">EM: One job.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">DL: Job to do, and this what we were sitting day by day and nine, for nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">EM: For nine months.</span> <span

<p><span id="s674">DL: Nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">EM: And what happened later?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">DL: Later they, I believe when they heard that the war is coming to an end they sent us to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s677">Again, I believe we went by train, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s678">I just remember that we came to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s679">And again, assigned us to some kind of barracks.</span> <span id="s680">After a few days the Red Cross started to send us, or American Red Cross started to send us packages.</span> <span id="s681">And we received packages of food which...</span></p> <p><span id="s682">EM: That was in 1945.</span> <span id="s683">Do you rem-...</span></p> <p><span id="s684">DL: ‘45.</span></p> <p><span

O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">DL: And, I remember, I received a package and my sister received a package.</span> <span id="s689">And it was going on a big fight.</span> <span id="s690">I wouldn’t allow her to eat anything except a piece of sugar, if that was sugar.</span> <span id="s691">The most was Speck [bacon], and colavd [phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s692">EM: [unclear] You mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s693">DL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s694">EM: Lard?</span> <span id="s695">You mean Speck, you mean lard?</span> <span id="s696">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s697">DL: Some bacon, bacon, some kind.</span> <span id="s698">And conserved meats.</span> <span id="s699">Also it must have been pig meat.</span> <span id="s700">And it was rice, a little bit of rice.</span> <span id="s701">That was minus cigarettes, the Germans took it out before.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">EM: So the Germans allowed you to get these packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">DL: It must have been, because the Red Cross intervened already, very hard with them.</span> <span id="s704">So anyhow, it was going on, the people was starving, just like I was.</span> <span id="s705">But I don’t know if I got smarter or common sense just telled me.</span> <span id="s706">I fighted with my sister.</span> <span id="s707">I wouldn’t allow her, not to eat anything, except a piece of sugar, if that was sugar.</span> <span id="s708">They had chocolate, cocoa.</span> <span id="s709">They had nothing for our stomachs, that our stomachs would tolerate.</span> <span id="s710">And sure enough, I was with my sister on the lower layer of the beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EM: On the bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">DL: On the bunk.</span> <span id="s713">And the girls took the packages up on their bunks.</span> <span id="s714">And in the morning was a big catastrophe.</span> <span id="s715">They got dysentery and typhus and they all kinds.</span> <span id="s716">And it was one day that we couldn’t even step out from there because it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s717">EM: They were throwing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">DL: Throwing up, and dysenteria.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">EM: Dysentery.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">DL: And then I showed it to my sister, which she was young and she didn’t understood.</span> <span id="s721">She didn’t understood, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">EM: Understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">DL: Only my common sense taught me not to eat this, because it’s not good.</span> <span id="s724">If we lived that long, maybe we will be free too.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EM: Well, were you still getting the ration cards?</span> <span id="s726">I mean, rations from the Germans like bread, at that time?</span> <span id="s727">Were they still feeding you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">DL: They must have give something out during the day, once a day they must have.</span> <span id="s729">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s730">EM: All right, tell me what happened later.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">DL: Later, Folke Bernadotte came sometimes in April, beginning of April must have been, or maybe towards, in the middle of April.</span> <span id="s732">He came in and he said he’s getting out 500 Jewish women.</span> <span id="s733">But, instead of the 500 it was maybe 300, because 200 came in and they said that they are Jewish, and they were Gentile.</span> <span id="s734">And I know a lot of them from Poland, that weren’t so friendly with us.</span> <span id="s735">But, the first convoy went out.</span> <span id="s736">And I don’t remember exactly to the date, but I know it was in April, towards maybe more to the end.</span> <span id="s737">And they got bombed on the way.</span> <span id="s738">We heard that they got bombed on the way because the trucks, with ammunition, the German trucks went in right away in between the Red Cross buses with the girls and there was a big catastrophe.</span> <span id="s739">They got bombed, and a few, it was a few casualties it was.</span> <span id="s740">And I know that one girl who lost a leg.</span> <span id="s741">So, the next day he came in again, Folke Bernadotte, and on that convoy I was.</span> <span id="s742">And it was real, the 24th.</span> <span id="s743">We left the 24th of April, we left the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">EM: You and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">DL: Me and my sister.</span> <span id="s746">And we went on buses, but we didn’t go at night.</span> <span id="s747">At night we were staying in the woods, sleeping over in the buses, and the next day we traveled to, across the border.</span> <span id="s748">We came to Denmark with the--the name of the city was Padborg.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">EM: Padborg?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">DL: Padborg.</span> <span id="s751">And there it was a the mayor from the city came over to the buses and they said, “If there is a young child, he would like to have the honor of taking her down.”</span> <span id="s752">And this was my sister.</span> <span id="s753">And he gave her a cone of ice cream.</span> <span id="s754">And they set the tables for us right on the [unclear].</span> <span id="s755">But it was an order that we cannot eat the food that they prepared for us.</span> <span id="s756">So they gave us a lean, something lean, like oatmeal or farina, something light.</span> <span id="s757">And we were going on, on trains till Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s758">And from Copenhagen we were put on, on the King’s Boat, which I remember.</span> <span id="s759">It was a round dining room with glass.</span> <span id="s760">I never saw a table cloth in my life.</span> <span id="s761">It was such a long time, and with silverware, beautiful.</span> <span id="s762">And they gave us a meal on the boat.</span> <span id="s763">And then we came to Malmö.</span> <span id="s764">And from Malmö they took us with buses to Lund--this was Sweden already--a university city.</span> <span id="s765">But they emptied out, this was the summer, they emptied out the universities and they put on for us to sleep, on the floor.</span> <span id="s766">But first we went to the doctors.</span> <span id="s767">And then it was other tragedies with other people.</span> <span id="s768">They find out that they have TB or other kind of bad sicknesses, because we were all malnutrition.</span> <span id="s769">And the doctors, all kind of booths was there.</span> <span id="s770">One gave out underwear, one gave out a dress and a raincoat and a suitcase.</span> <span id="s771">And, but we went, and we were still naked, we went to a bath.</span> <span id="s772">They gave us a bath that I will not forget this all my life.</span> <span id="s773">The first time I was clean in so many years.</span> <span id="s774">And then we went all to the doctors.</span> <span id="s775">And, to see what was wrong, x-rays and--me and my sister, thank God, we walked out from the other side which we didn’t recognize each other because all of a sudden we were dressed and clean.</span> <span id="s776">And this is how we start in the quarantine in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">EM: The quarantine in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">DL: Yes, for four weeks.</span> <span id="s779">We were staying...</span></p> <p><span id="s780">EM: And that was in Lund?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">DL: This was, this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s782">EM: This was in Lund.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">DL: In Lund we were just for eight days.</span> <span id="s784">But then when they checked that everybody is all right, whoever was all right, we was shipped to Visingö.</span> <span id="s785">This was like an island.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">EM: What is it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">DL: Visingö.</span> <span id="s788">It’s in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">EM: Visingö, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">DL: Visingö.</span> <span id="s791">Sö is an island.</span> <span id="s792">So, we were there for four weeks, and we were assigned to go to jobs.</span> <span id="s793">My sister went to school.</span> <span id="s794">I was eligible to go to school too, but I want to work.</span> <span id="s795">I wanted to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s796">So I was assigned to a hospital, which was a lung sickness, a..</span> <span id="s797">.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">EM: Chronic disease?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">DL: Lung sicknesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">EM: Oh, oh, for lungs.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">DL: A sanitarium.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">EM: Lungs, oh, a sanatorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">DL: In a sanitarium, in Hageborg [phonetic].</span> <span id="s804">This was not far from Falun.</span> <span id="s805">And at night I went to school for classes.</span> <span id="s806">And during the day I was working.</span> <span id="s807">And my sister was in school not far from me.</span> <span id="s808">She was in Toftabrun [phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s809">EM: Toftabrun?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">DL: Toftabrun, yeah.</span> <span id="s811">It was a school for the people, for the newcomers, that they provided.</span> <span id="s812">Sweden was nice to us.</span> <span id="s813">They tried to do the best for us.</span> <span id="s814">And this is how I ended that beautiful vacation of six years--hell on earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">EM: So you were in Sweden, you were going to the sanatorium to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">DL: I lived in the sanatorium...</span></p> <p><span id="s817">EM: Oh, you lived there, too.</span> <span id="s818">You lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">DL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">EM: Did you get paid at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">EM: You got paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">DL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">EM: And the war was ended by that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">DL: The 8th of May we heard officially...</span></p> <p><span id="s826">EM: At that time were you in Sweden already?</span> <span id="s827">Or were you still in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">DL: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s829">We arrived in Sweden the 28th...</span></p> <p><span id="s830">EM: Of...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">DL: Of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">EM: April.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">DL: Of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">DL: Yeah, of April, yeah.</span> <span id="s836">And the war ended officially at the 8th of May.</span> <span id="s837">So we were in a quarantine and we were celebrating, whatever we could, that it’s the end.</span> <span id="s838">But then we looked around how lonely we were, and that so many, so few of us lived through, we started the Red Cross to write papers, to write letters, maybe there, maybe there, maybe somebody will be still alive.</span> <span id="s839">But, not in my case.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">EM: When there were only women taken out of Ravensbrück?</span> <span id="s841">Or were there any men taken out, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">DL: Only women, at that time, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">EM: Now, how long did you stay in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">DL: I was staying eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">EM: Eight years.</span> <span id="s846">And can you tell me a little bit about your life in Sweden?</span> <span id="s847">Were you, did you get a degree?</span> <span id="s848">Did you graduate as a nurse?</span> <span id="s849">Or did you just continue to work in that hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">DL: I continued to work until I met my husband.</span> <span id="s851">He couldn’t--he didn’t like the smell of the DDT from the sanitarium.</span> <span id="s852">So he begged me that I should quit.</span> <span id="s853">We got married, and I worked other places, in Falun.</span> <span id="s854">I worked and...</span></p> <p><span id="s855">EM: Falun?</span> <span id="s856">Do you know how to spell it?</span></p> <p><span

Dalarna.</span> <span id="s862">Is that...</span></p> <p><span id="s863">DL: Dalarna, yeah.</span> <span id="s864">Like the whole county around is Dalarna, and this was the little town in Sweden, a very famous little town.</span> <span id="s865">It was--people came to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">DL: And I got assigned to a room.</span> <span id="s868">Also, after the war it was very hard in Sweden to get apartments.</span> <span id="s869">So I got a room and I was working.</span> <span id="s870">My husband was working.</span> <span id="s871">And then my son came.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">EM: Tell me, was your husband also a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">DL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">EM: How come he was in Sweden?</span> <span id="s875">When did he get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">DL: He--they asked him--in his labor camps towards the end, though he came after the war to Sweden--if he would like to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s877">So he said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s878">He signed himself in and they brought him to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">EM: So, and where was he from, originally?</span> <span id="s880">From Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">DL: From Poland, yes.</span> <span id="s882">Przemysl.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">EM: Oh, from Przemysl.</span> <span

girdle factory.</span> <span id="s895">And then I worked in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s896">All kind of jobs, whatever was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">EM: And now, you stayed there several years?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">DL: Eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">EM: Eight years.</span> <span id="s900">And your first child was born, or both children were born

to the United States?</span> <span id="s907">Did you get pap-, affidavits?</span> <span id="s908">Papers?</span> <span id="s909">Or did you ever consider going to Israel?</span> <span id="s910">What made you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">DL: My husband’s dream was to come to America.</span> <span id="s912">He said he would rather sleep in the streets and eat bread and coffee, he doesn’t ask for more, but he wants to be in a free country, especially when we had the children.</span> <span id="s913">And I want you to know, if I may, that this, that I was his second family.</span> <span id="s914">He lost a wife and two children in the war.</span> <span id="s915">They took them away.</span> <span id="s916">So, he says since he has another, God gave him another family, he wants to raise them in freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">EM: So that’s when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">DL: When we came, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">EM: Did you

ask for a lot.</span> <span id="s932">We just want to have a place where to lay down our heads when we are very tired.</span> <span id="s933">And we had food on the table, so we didn’t need nothing.</span> <span id="s934">Through our experience that we experienced during the war, we were grateful for everything, and especial here in the States.</span> <span id="s935">The children went to school.</span> <span id="s936">My daughter was four years when we arrived.</span> <span id="s937">My son was five-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s938">We did everything for education.</span> <span

<span id="s941">So, I went first to school to learn.</span> <span id="s942">And at that time I had to turn back to God.</span> <span id="s943">Thank God that I had everything what I wished.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">EM: Did your sister come with you to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">DL: My sister was a story.</span> <span id="s946">Her husband went to the University of

id="s955">When he finished school, she went into business right away.</span> <span id="s956">She is very bright and very beautiful.</span> <span id="s957">So she went into business, and they were very successful in business.</span> <span id="s958">So from one business was another business, and they are successful, so, but we promised to our parents that once a year we will be together.</span> <span
