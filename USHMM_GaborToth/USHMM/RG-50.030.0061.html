grandmother's house.</span> <span id="s16">(Chuckle) We lived that time in Hlohovec which was about two, two hours from the main city Bratislava.</span> <span id="s17">Uh...It was a small town, about 25,000.</span> <span id="s18">It had a very nice Jewish community and we had a very nice life there.</span> <span id="s19">It was democracy in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s20">The President was...was...uh...Tomáš...Tomáš Masaryk, who was really a[n] ideal president and we loved him.</span> <span id="s21">This democracy was...</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Well, tell me....</span> <span id="s23">I am going to interrupt.</span> <span id="s24">Just say...Let's...tell me about your family growing up.</span> <span id="s25">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s27">My family.</span> <span id="s28">My father...uh...was a big rancher.</span> <span id="s29">We had a big ranch on the outskirts of Hlohovec, that...that little town.</span> <span id="s30">And I had a terrific childhood.</span> <span id="s31">Uh...When I was about five years, we had...half of the house was rented to...to the army, and I had a very good friend there who was...who was always...uh...caring for me and I was much with him.</span> <span id="s32">It was the Czech [Czechoslovak] army.</span> <span id="s33">Uh...After that...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Tell me about...tell me about your...your mother.</span> <span id="s35">You had a mother.</span> <span id="s36">You had parents, sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s38">My...my mother was a beautiful woman and really a[n] angel.</span> <span id="s39">My father was a gentlemen...uh...a little bit like a gentry but he always was for...for the little man.</span> <span id="s40">He was very social-minded.</span> <span id="s41">We had a big farm and...and...uh... a lot of animals.</span> <span id="s42">Uh...the...the house was tremendous, big.</span> <span id="s43">The front was about 500 feet front and it went back about six, eight hundred feet back.</span> <span id="s44">In the back we had stables for horses and we had...uh...uh...prize bulls from the town, and we had...uh...carriages.</span> <span id="s45">My father did...uh...deliveries of building materials.</span> <span id="s46">We had big fields, corn fields, and...and wheat, wheat fields and...uh...we had 16 pair of horses.</span> <span id="s47">I had a terrific childhood.</span> <span id="s48">The town had a beautiful ...uh ...synagogue where we were playing as kids, and I had in my house...uh...a soccer team.</span> <span id="s49">I had my own soccer team as a child.</span> <span id="s50">It was really a beautiful childhood.</span> <span id="s51">But we had some problem.</span> <span id="s52">There was behind us...uh...behind our house was a small town.</span> <span id="s53">The...the town was...uh...very poor people behind it and very backward people, and we had always fights with them, especially there were...there were religious fights.</span> <span id="s54">Yah?</span> <span id="s55">Catholics against the Jews and so on and...and Evangelics against the Catholics, and things like that always.</span> <span id="s56">There was...were always fights.</span> <span id="s57">So we had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s58">I learned early in my life how to be careful really because every time if I..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">came home...home from school, the school was uptown and I was living downtown.</span> <span id="s61">In this area I had to be very careful that I don't get into a fight with...with somebody.</span> <span id="s62">Yah?</span> <span id="s63">So I learned early in life how to take care of myself.</span> <span id="s64">It was a beautiful area.</span> <span id="s65">In front of us was a big river, it was called Váh.</span> <span id="s66">On this river were...were mills on pontoons.</span> <span id="s67">There were about seven mills, one after the other, near each other, and millners [i.e., millers].</span> <span id="s68">For instance, it happens one day, for instance, we had a big flood.</span> <span id="s69">Every spring we had a big flood.</span> <span id="s70">And sometimes we...the flood was so...so high that our backyard was like a lake, so we took...we took our wash tub or something like that and we were paddling with it in the back yard.</span> <span id="s71">Naturally, the horses and the animals had to be evacuated every springtime.</span> <span id="s72">We had a big...uh...uh...barn up...uptown...yah?</span> <span id="s73">...in a place and so the animals were taken there and we just stayed.</span> <span id="s74">Our apartment was a little bit higher located with few steps up so we didn't get the flood into our apartment.</span> <span id="s75">The house was like a..</span> <span id="s76">.</span> <span id="s77">like a castle.</span> <span id="s78">It was one metre thick walls, solid brick, so that house could stand everything.</span> <span id="s79">Yah?</span> <span id="s80">There was no fear that the house would collapse or something like that from the floods.</span> <span id="s81">My...my father bought it from the local Count who had a castle not far, and the Count was a friend of...of my father.</span> <span id="s82">My father was a expert on horses, riding horses and...and...and...uh....race horses.</span> <span id="s83">So he was buying the horses for the Count, so he was very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s84">Sometimes my father took me to the Count, to the castle and I had a very good time there.</span> <span id="s85">The castle was beautiful, and we had a little buggy with a horse.</span> <span id="s86">He took us...he took me for a ride, and my sister too.</span> <span id="s87">Uh... We had a beautiful childhoods.</span> <span id="s88">One day there was a big flood, like usually in springtime and the water was...uh...coming almost to the top of the road.</span> <span id="s89">Between us and the river was a road, a highway.</span> <span id="s90">And it was very high the water, almost to the road, and we were always standing there with my sister and watching it.</span> <span id="s91">Watching because down the river were going even houses and big piles of...of straw and things like that.</span> <span id="s92">Yah?</span> <span id="s93">And that day my...my parents went to the market for food up...uptown and we were alone left.</span> <span id="s94">My...my sister was six years older so she took care like she was like a little mother to me.</span> <span id="s95">So we were standing at the river...river and watching the flood coming down, whatever was coming down.</span> <span id="s96">There are seven mills and the first mills, they were standing the millners always catching stuff what was flow...uh...going, flowing down the river.</span> <span id="s97">And one of...of these things what they wanted to catch was flow...flooding down...uh...a big pile of straw.</span> <span id="s98">They wanted to catch it and to dry it, you know, and...and to use it.</span> <span id="s99">But they didn't realize that the bottom was deeper and heavier than the top, and that hit the first mill and the first mill tore off all the chains.</span> <span id="s100">Yah?</span> <span id="s101">The big chains and everything and pushed into the next and into the next and the next and the next.</span> <span id="s102">All seven mills with the millners inside, with the people inside, were floating down the river and down the river was a big steel...uh...bridge.</span> <span id="s103">Yah?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">And they hit the steel bridge and exploded everything.</span> <span id="s105">Nothing.</span> <span id="s106">Was just a big cloud, a flour cloud, from the flour and quiet, and nothing visible.</span> <span id="s107">All the millners were gone.</span> <span id="s108">Naturally, that was a tremendous shock for everybody, and there was their funerals.</span> <span id="s109">They found them later, drowned...yah?</span> <span id="s110">...down the river somewhere and there were funerals always.</span> <span id="s111">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s112">The other things what...what was very important for me was I had a very good friend, a old retired mill man.</span> <span id="s113">Uh...Mr. Hauk.</span> <span id="s114">Mr. Hauk was his name.</span> <span id="s115">He was always sitting at the edge of the river on a bench near a little shed and he was always teaching me how to do work with...with...with....how to carve things for, with the little knife, with a..</span> <span id="s116">.</span> <span id="s117">uh...and he was telling me story and he was teaching me.</span> <span id="s118">He was a very experienced and very nice man.</span> <span id="s119">A beautiful looking old man.</span> <span id="s120">And that...that was a big influence for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What happened...as you started to grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: We...we had, yah, we...we had a beach there.</span> <span id="s123">We used to go to the beach and...and the whole town, all the boys and the girls together, to...on the beach.</span> <span id="s124">I had a..</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">with that time I had a boat, a paddle boat, and I used to take them across the river and we were swimming in...in the middle of the river, down the river for miles.</span> <span id="s127">It was a very dangerous river but we knew that river so well that...uh...it didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s128">The parents were always, naturally...uh...leery about us.</span> <span id="s129">I was all summer long only in swimming trunks.</span> <span id="s130">I don't put on anything else because I was always on the river with our friends.</span> <span id="s131">So it was a really beautiful life.</span> <span id="s132">We had very good neighbors, for instance.</span> <span id="s133">The [Brandts].</span> <span id="s134">That was a good friend of mine...and...and Wally [Brandt] was the...uh...uh...girlfriend of my sister and the next neighbors were the [Holliger] and the [Hertz].</span> <span id="s135">They had girls and boys so we...we got together quite often.</span> <span id="s136">We were playing together.</span> <span id="s137">They had a big...the [Holligers'] had a big...uh...uh...mill.</span> <span id="s138">lumber yard, and lumber mill.</span> <span id="s139">And so we were playing there...uh...hide and seek and things like that.</span> <span id="s140">So that life was there 'til '32.</span> <span id="s141">In '32, there was a big...uh... economical slump, especially agriculture and my...my father lost a lot of...uh...money, so he decided to sell...everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">He didn't sell the house.</span> <span id="s143">This house we were renting to a garage.</span> <span id="s144">'Twas a garage later.</span> <span id="s145">A part, the other part was occupied by other family, the [Britzomeyers] and we kept that apartment, but...but...uh...later we sold it.</span> <span id="s146">Uh...We moved to Bratislava, the main city, where we had all our...my mother had all her relatives, her mother, her...her aunts, her sisters so the family lived there.</span> <span id="s147">So my...my father went...uh...got a companion in a..</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">in a paper wholesale business with my uncle and he worked very hard there.</span> <span id="s150">He was everything there.</span> <span id="s151">Shipping clerk and...and...and you name it, everything he was doing.</span> <span id="s152">He was working very hard.</span> <span id="s153">But after that...in...so we lived there until early...that was going on 'til...'till the '38.</span> <span id="s154">I was studying.</span> <span id="s155">I was working part time...uh...in my uncle's workshop as a electrician.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I was a teenager.</span> <span id="s158">We...we moved to Bratislava when I was about 13.</span> <span id="s159">Yah?</span> <span id="s160">And as...I was going high school there, studying there in high school, and after that...uh... it was...it was a very normal time so...'til '38.</span> <span id="s161">In '38, it started.</span> <span id="s162">We heard about the German...about Hitler, about the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s163">We were shocked to hear about that all, because we...our cultural language was German.</span> <span id="s164">A lot of people were speaking German.</span> <span id="s165">Uh...We didn't believe that the Germans could...could...uh....do something like this because we used...we used to know the Germans as a cultured nation.</span> <span id="s166">Yah?</span> <span id="s167">So it was a tremendous shock for us to hear all this.</span> <span id="s168">But it didn't affect us personally right, right there.</span> <span id="s169">I knew always what's antisemitism.</span> <span id="s170">I knew always because there were a lot of antisemites in the...in the town, wherever I was.</span> <span id="s171">Yah?</span> <span id="s172">So that was nothing new to me, but we lived pretty comfortable near each other and the country, the laws were democratic so I had no complaints.</span> <span id="s173">But, as I say, in '38 it started.</span> <span id="s174">We...we almost had a war.</span> <span id="s175">We thought we will have a war with Hitler.</span> <span id="s176">The...the Czechs were very good equipped, the army and everything, and we were willing to fight.</span> <span id="s177">Yah?</span> <span id="s178">But the President Masaryk died and President Beneš took it over.</span> <span id="s179">He told...he saw that it was fruitless to fight.</span> <span id="s180">It wouldn't be worth to fight the country with...with...with the Germans, so he gave up.</span> <span id="s181">It broke up...the Germans took up...took off the Sudet, Sudets [i.e., Sudetenland] ... yah?</span> <span id="s182">...from Czechoslovakia and Czechoslovak...uh...the Czechs broke up and made it a protectorate with a President Hácha.</span> <span id="s183">Beneš died before that.He couldn't take 1 President Beneš died in September 1948, but he resigned from office twice--October 5, 1938 that, probably.</span> <span id="s184">And we had a..</span> <span id="s185">.</span> <span id="s186">it started, everything started that time already.</span> <span id="s187">And the Slovaks ...uh ...switched ...uh ...and ...and ...uh ... got in a..</span> <span id="s188">.</span> <span id="s189">in... uh...contact with the Germans, and they...they made... the Germans made a..</span> <span id="s190">.</span> <span id="s191">a sample state out of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s192">The President was, ...they took out from ... from ....</span> <span id="s193">uh... prison, Hlinka, and they made him President.And the Hlinka party was actually the fascist party, the Slovak fascist party.</span> <span id="s194">It...it was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s195">They started to...to ...uh...do with the Jews.</span> <span id="s196">Yah?</span> <span id="s197">They took over the Jewish stores, the Hlinka party.</span> <span id="s198">They put in so-called [Arierzahat (ph); Aryanized] stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Yah?</span> <span id="s200">And they...they just took over all the...the stores.</span> <span id="s201">Me, in '39, I was drafted to the army, to the Czech [Czechoslovak] army, but that was...that was exactly when they...when they switched to the Slovak state.</span> <span id="s202">And the Slovaks put us in...in working camps, army working camps.</span> <span id="s203">The first army...uh...first camp was in...in [Oremaz] which was...uh...used by the army, by the Czech [Czechoslovak] army, as a manoeuver place for the summer.</span> <span id="s204">There was barracks there and all what they...what we were doing there, we had to go out the roads in winter, in the biggest winter.</span> <span id="s205">Yah?</span> <span id="s206">and clean the roads from snow.</span> <span id="s207">They didn't have snow plows or something like that so we did that work.</span> <span id="s208">The roads, the highways to clean from snow.</span> <span id="s209">We were about 500 guys there, young, Jewish guys, and it was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s210">A hundred in a barrack.</span> <span id="s211">Yah?</span> <span id="s212">A hundred guys with bunk beds and one tiny little stove.</span> <span id="s213">Yah?</span> <span id="s214">We couldn't cook nothing.</span> <span id="s215">The meals, we were getting the meals at night.</span> <span id="s216">Early morning we got a coffee with a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s217">At night we got the dinner.</span> <span id="s218">Yah?</span> <span id="s219">Which was naturally no...no fancy stuff, but it was all cold.</span> <span id="s220">Yah?</span> <span id="s221">Because that was actually the lunch.</span> <span id="s222">The lunch was the dinner.</span> <span id="s223">So but we came home at night, so we had the cold lunch, the dinner.</span> <span id="s224">Some people could get to the stove to warm up that, but most of them ate it just cold everything.</span> <span id="s225">I..</span> <span id="s226">.</span> <span id="s227">with that time, I got frozen feet, boils on my feet...uh...so few days I had to stay indoors and I couldn't go to work.</span> <span id="s228">Yah?</span> <span id="s229">I was sick and so happens with many of them.</span> <span id="s230">Yah?</span> <span id="s231">We all got frozen boils on our feet, and it was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s232">So that was the first winter.</span> <span id="s233">Uh...The summer they transferred most of the guys of my...my colleagues there from the army to other places.</span> <span id="s234">They were sent mostly to...to Sabinov.</span> <span id="s235">That was a..</span> <span id="s236">.</span> <span id="s237">a sick...a small town... uh... in...uh...the east, eastern Slovakia.</span> <span id="s238">I was still there because I was a expert ...uh...electrician so they kept me to fix up a movie house.</span> <span id="s239">The electric...the electric and the... the projection machines and so on to...to fix them up.</span> <span id="s240">But they were so old, all these things.</span> <span id="s241">There was a..</span> <span id="s242">.</span> <span id="s243">there was a "dynamo" or they call it here...uh...I don't know.</span> <span id="s244">Some kind of...of electric machine.</span> <span id="s245">Yah?</span> <span id="s246">A generator.</span> <span id="s247">I had to fix it, but that was impossible to fix because it was so old, so backward that it was impossible and...uh...parts were missing and so on and projector parts were missing so I just took my time there.</span> <span id="s248">They didn't mind.</span> <span id="s249">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s250">They forgot about us there.</span> <span id="s251">We were there, a little group, just.</span> <span id="s252">But after that, finally, they got to us and they send us to...to Sabinov.</span> <span id="s253">Sabinov, no...nobody was there anymore.</span> <span id="s254">They were sent already away to a other place, to other camp.</span> <span id="s255">So they sent us to...to Liptovsky Svetý following the Munich Conference, and June 7, 1948 following the installation of a communist- dominated government.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">2 Andrej Hlinka died August 16, 1938.</span> <span id="s257">Monsignor Josef Tiso succeeded Hlinka as the leader of the Slovak People's Party and became President of Slovakia in October 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Martin [NB: there is no such place in Slovakia; probably he means Liptovsky Svätý Mikulaš].</span> <span id="s259">That was a nice town and we went there as...as normal...normal army men, but working commando.</span> <span id="s260">The working commando was that...that, for instance, just we were couple of...of guys, so one was a waiter, for instance.</span> <span id="s261">I was put in the...uh...weapons... uh... repair, where I repaired weapons.</span> <span id="s262">Huh?</span> <span id="s263">That was a pretty cushy job.</span> <span id="s264">I got food, normal food with the army and normal...uh...barracks...yah?</span> <span id="s265">...with a normal bed, but we had to train with the...with the rest of the army.</span> <span id="s266">But one day the...the German army took it over.</span> <span id="s267">Yah?</span> <span id="s268">The commando, and they needed an interpreter from German to Slovak.</span> <span id="s269">So they asked me.</span> <span id="s270">So I..</span> <span id="s271">.</span> <span id="s272">I volunteered.</span> <span id="s273">I will be their interpreter.</span> <span id="s274">I had a very good life.</span> <span id="s275">There was a high, very high officer, a German from the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s276">Uh...He was very friendly to me because I spoke the only one German.</span> <span id="s277">And he couldn't speak with nobody else.</span> <span id="s278">And the same his wife.</span> <span id="s279">He had a very...he was a old guy, but he had a very nice, young wife.</span> <span id="s280">And I had to go with her shopping.</span> <span id="s281">I had to go horse riding with her.</span> <span id="s282">I had to help her everything, with everything, because she couldn't speak one word in Slovak and he couldn't speak a word of Slovak.</span> <span id="s283">So in the morning I was the exercises, the army exercises, I was interpreting... uh...to him, and afternoon and so I had to go shopping with her and horse riding.</span> <span id="s284">(Laughing) So I had a pretty good life as...as in the army you have.</span> <span id="s285">Right?</span> <span id="s286">Uh...But that didn't last very long.</span> <span id="s287">Then I was transferred to Vrútky which was a..</span> <span id="s288">.</span> <span id="s289">a army depot ...uh...to clean the old uniforms.</span> <span id="s290">Yah?</span> <span id="s291">It was a ugly place.</span> <span id="s292">All day long smelling this... this... uh... old uniforms.</span> <span id="s293">Yah?</span> <span id="s294">They were in...in moth ball and so.</span> <span id="s295">But that didn't last again too long so they send us from there... uh...to...to _emerné.</span> <span id="s296">It was in eastern Slovakia, but that took a pretty long time until we got there.</span> <span id="s297">Meantime, we stopped places and we had a good time.</span> <span id="s298">Yah?</span> <span id="s299">So in _emerné, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s300">Part of the camp was...was gypsies... yah?</span> <span id="s301">... who were taken there, and working camp.</span> <span id="s302">We was...we were...we were...uh...doing nothing, just like in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s303">It was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s304">Uh... Before... but before that...uh ...we were in Svätý Martin.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Svätý Martin before...after Svätý Martin, we were in...in Svätý [Pretor].</span> <span id="s306">It was a little town too, but we were working there very hard.</span> <span id="s307">We were working bridges...uh...uh...roads and...uh...stone mines and air fields.</span> <span id="s308">That was a very nice place, picturesque, but it was high in the mountains, in the Tatras.</span> <span id="s309">And it was in winter, freezing cold, and to work on the roads...uh...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s310">We had to do earth moving for instance by hand.</span> <span id="s311">We had to...to do it with... with... uh...picks.</span> <span id="s312">The picks had to be sharpened every few minutes because the earth was like concrete, but we had to make a certain quantity that moving and so we had to do the same in a corn...in a stone mine, a certain quantity of stone we had to break out from the mine and bring it on...on a little... uh...wheelbarrows and so on to a certain place.</span> <span id="s313">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s314">But we had good food.</span> <span id="s315">We had the peasants there...that...that... the villages where we got good food.</span> <span id="s316">So that kept us going, and we got just stronger with it... with the... our...we ate a lot of fat, you know, pork and so on, to keep on going.</span> <span id="s317">The...the food in the army wasn't enough for that to do hard work like that.</span> <span id="s318">But as I say we had opportunity to buy things, food and so on.</span> <span id="s319">So I survived that very good.</span> <span id="s320">But in '42, from _emerné, we demobilized, and when I came home there was starting transports...yah?</span> <span id="s321">...to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s322">Most of these guys who came home, like me in '42, they were taken straight to the concentration camps to Germany and anyplace else.</span> <span id="s323">Me, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s324">I was chosen as important...uh...economically because I was a electrician and they, the government needed experts so they...they put me in charge as a electrician for a new...they just started to build a new...uh...university.</span> <span id="s325">The government built that.</span> <span id="s326">So...but...the...the university was located up on a mountain in a..</span> <span id="s327">.</span> <span id="s328">in a park, in a forest.</span> <span id="s329">They confiscated a forest from a old lady, a countess who owned it and then they made a park out of it and....then they started to build.</span> <span id="s330">We had to do everything from scratch.</span> <span id="s331">We had to...to take out the trees.</span> <span id="s332">Yah?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Like...lumber...uh...uh...jacks.</span> <span id="s334">We had to do everything to take out the whole forest to make room for...for that new...new buildings, the foundations and so on.</span> <span id="s335">And they started to build that after...after we finished.</span> <span id="s336">Then I was a regular electrician.</span> <span id="s337">I had to bring the electric lights and everything in.</span> <span id="s338">They made temporary buildings for the...for the office and so on and workshops, and I was their electrician there.</span> <span id="s339">Then later we had six electricians, all Jewish boys who...who was...were electricians.</span> <span id="s340">It was a very hard job to work there to do all the electric work.</span> <span id="s341">And...and on top of it I had to be there every night because they were pouring cement at night and I had to supervise the electric things and bring...locate the electric lights all over, wherever they were working and...uh...it was...it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s342">And on top of it, I had to make...help with the payroll in the office.</span> <span id="s343">Yah?</span> <span id="s344">For...for the workers.</span> <span id="s345">There were about 300 workers there.</span> <span id="s346">Huh?</span> <span id="s347">Everything was by hand.</span> <span id="s348">There were no machines like here.</span> <span id="s349">(Laughter) So I had to help with that too.</span> <span id="s350">Uh...Then one day everything was finished.</span> <span id="s351">We... we... you... we couldn't stay there anymore.</span> <span id="s352">We had to disappear.</span> <span id="s353">I..</span> <span id="s354">.</span> <span id="s355">a lot of guys went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s356">Yah?</span> <span id="s357">Those were the Russians who...who were in the mountains.</span> <span id="s358">Yah?</span> <span id="s359">Already against the Germans fighting.</span> <span id="s360">Guerrillas.</span> <span id="s361">Guerrilla war.</span> <span id="s362">And some of our guys joined them.</span> <span id="s363">And we had a place where we had...where we had a little workshop for... for carpentry... carpentry workshop with machines there and we had a little dormitory there so some of these boys were hiding there, because nobody knew.</span> <span id="s364">That was far in the forest the end of...of...of the property.</span> <span id="s365">And we made tunnels to hide under these...these....uh... these workshop.</span> <span id="s366">Yah?</span> <span id="s367">To hide in these tunnels there if somebody would have come there.</span> <span id="s368">But it was a pretty safe place.</span> <span id="s369">We had bunk beds there and as many as possible we were having there boys.</span> <span id="s370">I was hiding there for awhile and then later I couldn't stay there because it was too overcrowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Too many people were there and they...they had the factory...uh...to falsify papers, you know, for the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Was this under the ground?</span> <span id="s373">A: Underground.</span> <span id="s374">Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Can you describe...tell me what that underground bunker looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: (Chuckle) It was...it was...uh...under these...these workshop.</span> <span id="s377">And they had a machine there to make papers, you know, government papers like...like...like...uh...like false... uh...uh...false papers.</span> <span id="s378">Yah?</span> <span id="s379">Identifications and... and even passports we made there.</span> <span id="s380">But.</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">uh...uh...all kind of papers, everything we were...made there.</span> <span id="s383">And we had draftsmen who were...who copying all these...these legal papers and so on.</span> <span id="s384">So we had some very, very handy very good experts there.</span> <span id="s385">And that was sent out to the partisans and to people who were hiding, ...these papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Now one day there was no room for me.</span> <span id="s387">So one friend with me, we knew from our experience of working there on that ground that there was a old water reservoir...uh...that was not used.</span> <span id="s388">So that had a manhole on top.</span> <span id="s389">That's all what it was.</span> <span id="s390">A manhole, so we could open the manhole and climb into that water reservoir and we were hiding there.</span> <span id="s391">And we had a..</span> <span id="s392">.</span> <span id="s393">uh...I had a cousin, a girl cousin, Gerty Schweigger, she was bringing us the food every night.</span> <span id="s394">Only by night we could get out.</span> <span id="s395">Because what happened that place had a..</span> <span id="s396">.</span> <span id="s397">had a..</span> <span id="s398">.</span> <span id="s399">uh...whole unit of German army there during that time already located.</span> <span id="s400">They confiscated...that was a..</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">a palace...a palace from a old lady, a countess.</span> <span id="s403">They confiscated it for the German army.</span> <span id="s404">I don't know what they did with the old woman, probably they got her to a old age house, and they took...the army...the German army took...took that...uh...place.</span> <span id="s405">But that was a ideal hiding place, this whole ground because everybody knew that there are the Germans there.</span> <span id="s406">Yah?</span> <span id="s407">And the army they even know that we are there.</span> <span id="s408">Yah.</span> <span id="s409">Hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s411">They didn't care about nothing.</span> <span id="s412">Only like army, you know.</span> <span id="s413">So that was for awhile we could do that.</span> <span id="s414">And afterwards...uh...I came home.</span> <span id="s415">My...my parents...there was...there were transports already going to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s416">My parents were kept a long time because my father worked in the...in the kitchen where...uh...the Jewish kitchen where they supplied the transports with food and everything.</span> <span id="s417">Yah?</span> <span id="s418">For awhile it was good, and we had food from there too.</span> <span id="s419">Uh...So...it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s420">Every day were going transports, but we were...because my...my father was working in the kitchen, we were kept...uh...for awhile safe.</span> <span id="s421">And then it started...uh...that these transports and I told them, "You better hide somewhere because that will not go forever like this.</span> <span id="s422">You will not be able to keep it."</span> <span id="s423">We were all concentrated already in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s424">Yah.</span> <span id="s425">A long time we had to be in a ghetto, all the Jews, so they had us already concentrated there.</span> <span id="s426">Uh...My mother didn't want to hide.</span> <span id="s427">My father wanted to hide in the country somewhere.</span> <span id="s428">He had friends between the peasants and they would have hidden us, but my...my mother didn't want to go because the relatives were very prominent Jews in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s429">They were on the...on the...uh...committees there...uh...Jew...Jewish committee, and my mother thought they will know when to go to hiding.</span> <span id="s430">They will know what to do.</span> <span id="s431">They will protect us.</span> <span id="s432">But it didn't come out so.</span> <span id="s433">They were not protecting nobody.</span> <span id="s434">Nobody was protected.</span> <span id="s435">So I was hiding already.</span> <span id="s436">I was underground on the...in a house.</span> <span id="s437">It was a fancy, fancy one, a old fancy one, like a boarding house.</span> <span id="s438">It was a old woman, she kept it.</span> <span id="s439">She knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s440">She wasn't Jewish.</span> <span id="s441">Yah?</span> <span id="s442">She...she was a very nice woman.</span> <span id="s443">She know we are Jewish, but we had papers--different, not Jewish papers--so she thought...she thought it will be...she will be alright with that.</span> <span id="s444">The Germans were very, very dangerous for that too.</span> <span id="s445">It was very dangerous for her because they would brand her as a collaborator if... uh ... if they would know.</span> <span id="s446">So we were hiding there...about three or four Jewish boys with...with false papers.</span> <span id="s447">Yah?</span> <span id="s448">But I couldn't sit all day long home there.</span> <span id="s449">So one day I was going out.</span> <span id="s450">I was always going where big crowds were.</span> <span id="s451">There was a road not far from us... uh... uh... uh... street, the shopping street where all the stores were and windows so there would always be crowd so I always blended there in...in the crowds, hopeful that nobody is going to recognize me, that nobody is going to...to catch me.</span> <span id="s452">Yah?</span> <span id="s453">But it wasn't so.</span> <span id="s454">What happened--one day I was walking there and I see in a show window a old friend from the army.</span> <span id="s455">Yah?</span> <span id="s456">I knew almost everybody because we were a pretty small group, so I knew almost everybody from the army and there was a young man in a leather coat standing and watching the...in the show case.</span> <span id="s457">Yah?</span> <span id="s458">And I go to him, and that was my downfall because what I found out later...I didn't know at that time.</span> <span id="s459">But later I found out that he was caught by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s460">Yah?</span> <span id="s461">And to get out from the Gestapo to be still alive, they told him they can do it only if he brings in... uh... some Jews... Yah?</span> <span id="s462">... from the army he knew, whoever he knew from the army, Jews...that he will...he will give their names or...or...or just...just give them over to the...to the Germans, to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s463">And as soon as I got in touch with him there, he pretended he's very happy to see me and so on.</span> <span id="s464">There he was...he looked good.</span> <span id="s465">Yah?</span> <span id="s466">A blond guy with blue eyes, he looked like...like not a Jew.</span> <span id="s467">Yah?</span> <span id="s468">But few minutes later somebody grabbed me from the back.</span> <span id="s469">It was the Gestapo and they pushed me into a standing car there.</span> <span id="s470">They were watching him.</span> <span id="s471">You know?</span> <span id="s472">With whom he gets in contact.</span> <span id="s473">And they pushed me...they pushed me into a car and took me to a center...uh...which was once a Jewish house, a apartment building, and that...the Gestapo took over.</span> <span id="s474">So they pushed me there in.</span> <span id="s475">That was...there were a lot of Jewish young boy and girls waiting for a transport.</span> <span id="s476">Huh?</span> <span id="s477">That was already a..</span> <span id="s478">.</span> <span id="s479">a concentration, a transport concentration...uh...place.</span> <span id="s480">The Gestapo was interrogating and trying to get names, you know where they can pick up some other Jews, some other young men who were hiding because everybody was already hiding that way that time because the transport was...were always finished.</span> <span id="s481">It was already '43, 1943.</span> <span id="s482">There were still going to the last minute, the transport.</span> <span id="s483">So what we did...uh...that was a apartment and I saw that there...there was a place where... where was a little room and they...they had there a sign 'no...no entrance'; nobody can enter, it's the next room.</span> <span id="s484">There was a little room, like a corridor and there was a door and a..</span> <span id="s485">.</span> <span id="s486">a guard, yah?</span> <span id="s487">...a SS guard was walking there with a rifle, watching that nobody should go in that little room there.</span> <span id="s488">But I thought there must be something important if they are watching ...if they are watching that room.</span> <span id="s489">Huh?</span> <span id="s490">So when the guard went by...Yah?</span> <span id="s491">...I run over into that room.</span> <span id="s492">I opened the door.</span> <span id="s493">It was open, and nobody was in that room.</span> <span id="s494">And I looked out the window.</span> <span id="s495">I was looking for a escape situation, and I saw my...my escape situation.</span> <span id="s496">There was under the window... I ... we were on the second floor and in the back yard I saw a window...the window...looking out the window I saw a little shack, a wood shack.</span> <span id="s497">And I saw that it wouldn't be hard to jump out the window on this shack because that was higher than straight to...to earth.</span> <span id="s498">That would have been too high.</span> <span id="s499">So I figured out, I stayed there 'til night.</span> <span id="s500">When it got dark.</span> <span id="s501">Everything was...was covered... the windows... yah...because of the airplanes and so on.</span> <span id="s502">They had to have covers on the windows.</span> <span id="s503">So I opened the window.</span> <span id="s504">I jumped out at night.</span> <span id="s505">'Twas about 9 o'clock night.</span> <span id="s506">I jumped out, and jumped on that shed roof; but I didn't know that that shed roof was all wood, wood planks, and that acted like a..</span> <span id="s507">.</span> <span id="s508">like a..</span> <span id="s509">.</span> <span id="s510">like a jumping board and it...I jumped up back and fell down on the ground on my back, and I passed out.</span> <span id="s511">I got a terrible...uh...when I woke up, I saw where I am lying and I was in terrible pain so but I know that I had to disappear so I pushed myself into the wood shack between the wood and...and again fell unconscious.</span> <span id="s512">I don't know how long I was lying there, but I..</span> <span id="s513">.</span> <span id="s514">when I woke up I knew I had to get out from it.</span> <span id="s515">I had a terrible pain in my back but I knew I had to get out from that place.</span> <span id="s516">So where was the place?</span> <span id="s517">There was a..</span> <span id="s518">.</span> <span id="s519">there was a..</span> <span id="s520">.</span> <span id="s521">uh... fence... yah?</span> <span id="s522">... uh... uh... brick fence, but on top of the brick fence was...was wire that these...these...uh... I don't know how you call these wire.</span> <span id="s523">You know with this...uh...little like on the front you see these...these wire mesh, so I jumped over that fence.</span> <span id="s524">I had that...that much strength that I jumped over the fence, but I didn't know what's on the other side.</span> <span id="s525">There was a..</span> <span id="s526">.</span> <span id="s527">there was a big empty crate.</span> <span id="s528">Yah?</span> <span id="s529">A wooden crate, and I fell into that crate and again passed out.</span> <span id="s530">I don't know how long I was there lying.</span> <span id="s531">Again I woke...I..</span> <span id="s532">.</span> <span id="s533">I woke up.</span> <span id="s534">I saw maybe I can get out.</span> <span id="s535">That was already the next house.</span> <span id="s536">So I tried to get out the door, but the door was closed, so I knew what I have to do.</span> <span id="s537">Jump the other fence to a other house.</span> <span id="s538">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">The houses were...uh...like townhouses.</span> <span id="s540">So the next house was again like that...a fence.</span> <span id="s541">Yah?</span> <span id="s542">And I jumped over.</span> <span id="s543">A dog...a dog started to bark and came to me in order to eat me.</span> <span id="s544">What I did, I grabbed his mouth.</span> <span id="s545">It was a German shepherd.</span> <span id="s546">I remember.</span> <span id="s547">It was a big dog.</span> <span id="s548">And I grabbed.</span> <span id="s549">I didn't have no other choice, I was desperate.</span> <span id="s550">Yah?</span> <span id="s551">I grabbed the dog by his mouth and pulled him through the door and tried to open the door to run out from the door.</span> <span id="s552">Yah?</span> <span id="s553">The house door.</span> <span id="s554">It was open.</span> <span id="s555">Huh?</span> <span id="s556">So I pushed the dog...dog back and I run through the door.</span> <span id="s557">There was a other door on the other side.</span> <span id="s558">It was open, too.</span> <span id="s559">But I had to be very careful because the street was patrolling... uh...the SS...Yah?</span> <span id="s560">...with the rifles.</span> <span id="s561">So it was night.</span> <span id="s562">It was late night.</span> <span id="s563">I saw that the...when the guard was going up the street, I ran out the other direction and I run through...through back yards... yah?</span> <span id="s564">... through all...through little streets.</span> <span id="s565">I knew Bratislava very well.</span> <span id="s566">So I run back to my place and...and I was in tremendous...uh...this... uh...I had a tremendous pain in my back.</span> <span id="s567">So I lie down in bed and was lying for a month in this bed and after a month I got up.</span> <span id="s568">We had a little meeting with all...with about four or five guys together to plan what to do next.</span> <span id="s569">Yah?</span> <span id="s570">What...what was the news?</span> <span id="s571">What was going on?</span> <span id="s572">Cause we didn't know.</span> <span id="s573">So as we were having this meeting, I was the first day up.</span> <span id="s574">I was in my...my...uh.</span> <span id="s575">.</span> <span id="s576">robe.</span> <span id="s577">Yah?</span> <span id="s578">Suddenly, the door opens and four big SS guys in leather coats were standing there with their guns on us.</span> <span id="s579">Yah?</span> <span id="s580">"Let's go."</span> <span id="s581">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s582">As I was and as they were, we had to go.</span> <span id="s583">They put us in...in cars...yah?</span> <span id="s584">...and they took us again to this place there, but this time they knew already what was...that we are trying to...to escape so that we...there was no escape there.</span> <span id="s585">But first of all they wanted to know some other guys from us.</span> <span id="s586">So they took us one after the other for interrogation.</span> <span id="s587">The interrogation was terrible.</span> <span id="s588">I..</span> <span id="s589">.</span> <span id="s590">I was standing in the middle, four guys...four SS guys were standing there and hitting us with their fists...with their...with their...with anything what they had at hand.</span> <span id="s591">They hit us... uh... and asked questions.</span> <span id="s592">I remember the last one wanted... took off the...uh...uh...hanger...yah...a wooden hanger and hit me with that.</span> <span id="s593">I was all bloody.</span> <span id="s594">Then I..</span> <span id="s595">.</span> <span id="s596">he couldn't get nothing out of me, so they took us out and they threw me in a deep cellar where just was a tiny little window.</span> <span id="s597">Uh...I don't know how long I was there because I was unconscious when they brought me there, and when I woke up I was lying on a bench, on a plain bench I was lying there and a guy was over me and trying to wipe off my blood.</span> <span id="s598">But I didn't see him very well.</span> <span id="s599">Then later he came to the...to the window.</span> <span id="s600">We were sitting there near the window and I asked him question.</span> <span id="s601">Who you are and what's your name and so on.</span> <span id="s602">He looked very weird.</span> <span id="s603">He looked very weird.</span> <span id="s604">A big guy, young, big husky guy and he looked very weird.</span> <span id="s605">And I asked him, "What time is it?"</span> <span id="s606">And he takes out like a..</span> <span id="s607">.</span> <span id="s608">like a quarter, something like that...money, and looks at it and said, "It's 8 o'clock," or what, some...some...some kind of a number.</span> <span id="s609">I look out the window.</span> <span id="s610">It was day light.</span> <span id="s611">Yah?</span> <span id="s612">So I saw there is something wrong with that guy.</span> <span id="s613">It came out he was taken from the institute by the Germans...yah...by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s614">Was a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s615">He was taken from a..</span> <span id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">from a mental institute.</span> <span id="s618">He was a cook there.</span> <span id="s619">Yah?</span> <span id="s620">And he was brought.</span> <span id="s621">So he was sitting there and I couldn't talk to him.</span> <span id="s622">He was out of it and I was scared.</span> <span id="s623">I was scared what will happen with this guy there.</span> <span id="s624">So then I started...he had some normal moments.</span> <span id="s625">So I asked him, "Who are you?</span> <span id="s626">What's your name?"</span> <span id="s627">And he told me his name.</span> <span id="s628">Uh...uh...He was Stern, I think so, was his name.</span> <span id="s629">And I said to him, "I was in the army with a young guy by that same name."</span> <span id="s630">And he said to me, "Oh, you must have been with Hansi, my brother Hansi."</span> <span id="s631">Yah?</span> <span id="s632">Hans.</span> <span id="s633">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s634">From that moment, he kissed me and he...he talked to tell me about him everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Yah?</span> <span id="s636">He had some normal moments.</span> <span id="s637">Yah?</span> <span id="s638">He was glad he saw me and that he spoke with me that...that he knew that...that his brother was alive.</span> <span id="s639">Huh?</span> <span id="s640">He thought so...his brother was alive.</span> <span id="s641">I don't think so he was alive, but I didn't want to tell him what's.</span> <span id="s642">.</span> <span id="s643">was going on.</span> <span id="s644">He didn't know everything.</span> <span id="s645">So I was there about two or three nights.</span> <span id="s646">He went with me together.</span> <span id="s647">I couldn't escape from there.</span> <span id="s648">They took me out just straight into the transport.</span> <span id="s649">Yah?</span> <span id="s650">The transport was covered up, you know in a..</span> <span id="s651">.</span> <span id="s652">in a covered wagons, you know, these...these trains and that was it.</span> <span id="s653">We were going to Sered.</span> <span id="s654">Sered was still in...in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s655">It was...uh... "Sommerlager."</span> <span id="s656">It was a camp where...where they brought in just everybody and from there the transports were going to Germany and so on.</span> <span id="s657">Yah?</span> <span id="s658">It was still in Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: I think this is a good place to stop and break and change tapes.</span> <span id="s660">Then you can tell me about "sommerlager."</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s662">Okay.</span> <span id="s663">All right.</span> <span id="s664">Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Can you describe that transport to Sered?</span> <span id="s667">What was that ride like?</span> <span id="s668">.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s670">So they...they put us with...with other people into... uh... uh...train, yah.</span> <span id="s671">Closed truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">And we were about 70 in one truck.</span> <span id="s673">And the transport was going only to Sered, which wasn't too far.</span> <span id="s674">And there we got out into a other camp.</span> <span id="s675">Twas a old...uh...military camp, and there were barracks there.</span> <span id="s676">And we had...we got...uh...our place in the barracks ...our ...our bunkbeds.</span> <span id="s677">And the food was still...uh...pretty good there because the...the Jewish... uh... these....</span> <span id="s678">uh... agency was supplying it with food.</span> <span id="s679">So we were standing... staying there until they had ready transports, the Germans... to Germany.</span> <span id="s680">Yah?</span> <span id="s681">Until they put together a train transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: What was Sered like?</span> <span id="s683">That camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: That camp wasn't bad because it was actually just a summer... summer camp.</span> <span id="s685">That means...uh...just concentrating people.</span> <span id="s686">I had there some friends in the workshops who told me, "When you will get to the transport, like few transport ahead of you, young men...they jumped off the trains, and escaped to the partisans.</span> <span id="s687">Some of them got through.</span> <span id="s688">Some of them were... were caught.</span> <span id="s689">So that...that's your only hope what you can do.</span> <span id="s690">They supplied us from the workshops with blades and...and drills, things like that which we put into our shoes.</span> <span id="s691">They are builded into our shoes, and they told us when you go to the transport, you should put these with you...take these with you.</span> <span id="s692">Put on three or four...uh...jackets and clothing, everything on you.</span> <span id="s693">Nothing in your hands because you will jump.</span> <span id="s694">And to minimize the...the...the injury, you put on as many as possible clothes and jackets and...and...and suits and so on.</span> <span id="s695">So really it came to it.</span> <span id="s696">I didn't think, but it came to it that they...there was a transport going to Germany and they put us on that transport.</span> <span id="s697">Again in closed trucks, you are going at night.</span> <span id="s698">Everything was going at night.</span> <span id="s699">They were everything doing all these things at night because they didn't like the population to see that.</span> <span id="s700">Yah?</span> <span id="s701">What was going on.</span> <span id="s702">So we got into one of...all the young guys, friends... Yah?</span> <span id="s703">... together.</span> <span id="s704">We got together into one...one truck.</span> <span id="s705">And we figured out we will cut out the lock and jump out when...when the train will go slow...will slow down a little bit.</span> <span id="s706">Yah?</span> <span id="s707">And so it happens.</span> <span id="s708">It was at night.</span> <span id="s709">We cut out the...the door.</span> <span id="s710">Yah?</span> <span id="s711">I helped.</span> <span id="s712">I helped.</span> <span id="s713">He'd helped and so on.</span> <span id="s714">We...we...we changed, and we cut out the lock.</span> <span id="s715">But before we...the end that we should...should throw out the...the lock, we kept it like that.</span> <span id="s716">You know it looked like it would be still on, the lock.</span> <span id="s717">But it was already cut out; almost was to the point where it will fall out, the whole lock.</span> <span id="s718">Suddenly the train stopped.</span> <span id="s719">Yah?</span> <span id="s720">It was a little station in Slovakia still, somewhere in Nové Mesto [nad Váhdom], or where it was I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s721">On the way to Germany.</span> <span id="s722">And the...right away, the SS who was...who was...uh...going with us...uh...with a rifle as they were patrolling, looking all the cars, at the locks because they had the experience already.</span> <span id="s723">Yah?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">And they saw that our lock is cut out.</span> <span id="s725">They opened the truck and all out.</span> <span id="s726">All toward...towards the wall.</span> <span id="s727">Yah?</span> <span id="s728">So, I said myself, "That's it.</span> <span id="s729">That's it."</span> <span id="s730">Huh?</span> <span id="s731">They put us on the wall.</span> <span id="s732">"Every 10th will be shot dead."</span> <span id="s733">They put us on the wall, and who knows who is the 10th?</span> <span id="s734">How they will start to... to... to....</span> <span id="s735">Really, every 10th they shot dead.</span> <span id="s736">Yah.</span> <span id="s737">Every 10th.</span> <span id="s738">That was the first time I saw they are not joking.</span> <span id="s739">And the rest...I was left.</span> <span id="s740">Yah?</span> <span id="s741">Some other friends were there, they were dead already.</span> <span id="s742">The rest they put into the first car.</span> <span id="s743">That was a Panzer [armored] car.</span> <span id="s744">Yah?</span> <span id="s745">No food.</span> <span id="s746">No nothing.</span> <span id="s747">Yah?</span> <span id="s748">Not even water.</span> <span id="s749">They put us there.</span> <span id="s750">Dark.</span> <span id="s751">Just a tiny, little window was on top of the Panzer car and nothing else.</span> <span id="s752">We were going for 3 days without food, without drinking water, without anything.</span> <span id="s753">Yah?</span> <span id="s754">Even the closed up about 12 or 50 guys, we were there.</span> <span id="s755">So we were going until we stopped one day; at night, naturally.</span> <span id="s756">We stopped in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s757">I didn't know right away where we were, naturally, but I knew we must be in Germany.</span> <span id="s758">Sachsenhausen ...the first impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Everybody out from these trucks and everybody in five, five...uh...five people in one row.</span> <span id="s760">Yah?</span> <span id="s761">And that will be like soldiers.</span> <span id="s762">And they were surrounding us with dogs, German shepherds and...and...and ...uh... SS... Yah?</span> <span id="s763">...standing with...with rifles on us, trained, and we saw far away from the trucks...we saw a big camp with a big door lead up with... with... with... uh... with....uh...lights lit up and they told us, "We will march there."</span> <span id="s764">So we were marching there to that door, to that big door.</span> <span id="s765">We marched into the camp, that was Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s766">First impression was...I saw running around there...it was night.</span> <span id="s767">I saw barracks there.</span> <span id="s768">I saw people running around, some, not too many, but some running around, probably kapos, in these uniforms.</span> <span id="s769">I was so naive that time that I thought those are pajamas, because it was night...that...that they have pajamas.</span> <span id="s770">Yah?</span> <span id="s771">(laughter) And then there were...there were slogans on the barracks written...uh...uh..."Arbeit Macht Frei"...Yah?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Uh..."Work makes you free."</span> <span id="s773">Huh?</span> <span id="s774">Things like that.</span> <span id="s775">Slogans, they had there.</span> <span id="s776">So I was pretty good impressed.</span> <span id="s777">I thought we will be in a working camp, working!</span> <span id="s778">Yah?</span> <span id="s779">But they brought us first into a place, looked like a factory, like a broken down factory, the [sauna].</span> <span id="s780">The [sauna] was a place where...where they...they disinfecting station... was a disinfecting station.</span> <span id="s781">Whatever we had with us, it were...what we were carrying with us, they took away everything.</span> <span id="s782">We had to strip completely and they were internal ...they were checking us out completely...if we don't hide something.</span> <span id="s783">Yah?</span> <span id="s784">Gold or...or jewelry or something like that.</span> <span id="s785">And they took us in a very cold room.</span> <span id="s786">I was freezing, all naked, and there they were...were a whole group of barbers and they...uh stripped our hair completely.</span> <span id="s787">Yah.</span> <span id="s788">All over.</span> <span id="s789">And we had...the next step was...was to go into a pool, a stinking pool with sulphur acid or what was there...some...some kind of a..</span> <span id="s790">.</span> <span id="s791">uh... sulphuric things, because it stank terrible.</span> <span id="s792">And that was the disinfection.</span> <span id="s793">We had to go into that pool and submerge few times completely and that was the disinfection.</span> <span id="s794">Yah?</span> <span id="s795">After that we had to go under a shower and they gave us a..</span> <span id="s796">.</span> <span id="s797">a towel, a rag and a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s798">After that, after the showers...it was cold, freezing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Yah?</span> <span id="s800">That...that was not heated.</span> <span id="s801">Nothing!</span> <span id="s802">We were all naked.</span> <span id="s803">After that they...they brought us in a place where they gave us these uniforms.</span> <span id="s804">Yah?</span> <span id="s805">The stripped prisoner uniforms.</span> <span id="s806">Then we knew what it is, and nothing else.</span> <span id="s807">All our...clothing, civil clothing and everything was gone.</span> <span id="s808">They kept it, the Germans.</span> <span id="s809">So I was there in a..</span> <span id="s810">.</span> <span id="s811">in a quarantine.</span> <span id="s812">The first thing was to put us in a quarantine.</span> <span id="s813">Always the first two weeks, wherever you came from you were in a quarantine because they were...the Germans were terribly afraid about sicknesses, about epidemics and things like that because of their own...for their own purposes.</span> <span id="s814">So I was there in Sachsenhausen about two weeks, the quarantine.</span> <span id="s815">After the quarantine, we had to march at night through a town...I think so it was Sachsenhausen or so...to a town to Heinkelwerker...Heinkelwerker.</span> <span id="s816">Yah?</span> <span id="s817">It was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s818">Terrible place, Heinkelwerker.</span> <span id="s819">It was nothing there.</span> <span id="s820">No food.</span> <span id="s821">We didn't get there food.</span> <span id="s822">It was in a hangar, in a airplane hangar.</span> <span id="s823">They...they pushed us there in, and there were some...uh...some bomb pits in these hangers.</span> <span id="s824">The hangar was cold like ice, but we had to stay there.</span> <span id="s825">I..</span> <span id="s826">.</span> <span id="s827">we thought maybe we will be working in the factory there.</span> <span id="s828">That was the Heinkelwerker...the airplane factory.</span> <span id="s829">So I didn't think about nothing.</span> <span id="s830">But we were there for two or three weeks and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s831">We were just in the barracks there and we got hardly food.</span> <span id="s832">So it...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s833">From there they took us to a transport, again to a transport, put us in...in...in these trucks...Yah?</span> <span id="s834">...in the railroad trucks and they took us to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s835">Buchenwald again started the same thing with the...with the disinfection station... Yah?</span> <span id="s836">... and the quarantine...for two weeks in this quarantine.</span> <span id="s837">After the two weeks were off, they took us...uh...to the regular camp what they had, for work.</span> <span id="s838">So I was very satisfied, very happy.</span> <span id="s839">At least some work to do and maybe we'll get better food because when you work you have to get food.</span> <span id="s840">Yah?</span> <span id="s841">So really they took us out one...but first of all the barracks were already better.</span> <span id="s842">A little better, and the food was right away a little better too.</span> <span id="s843">And they got...we got some money, Lager money.</span> <span id="s844">You know, it was their own, made-up currency which, when you worked, every week you got a certain salary.</span> <span id="s845">It depends on what kind of work we were working.</span> <span id="s846">And for that you could buy in a canteen there, let's say a beer or a..</span> <span id="s847">.</span> <span id="s848">a..</span> <span id="s849">.</span> <span id="s850">something, yah?</span> <span id="s851">Something, a soda or something like that...for the whole week's salary, naturally.</span> <span id="s852">Yah?</span> <span id="s853">So...but it was something already, after all.</span> <span id="s854">So I was working in a detail...go out of the Lager, out on a road doing the ditches on the road, cleaning the ditches, making new ditches on the highways and so on.</span> <span id="s855">Naturally, they were watching us very carefully...the SS with the rifles trained on us and with the dogs there with the...with the shep...with the German shepherds watching us.</span> <span id="s856">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s857">And they had some people escaped I heard.</span> <span id="s858">But.</span> <span id="s859">.</span> <span id="s860">uh...we never heard about them.</span> <span id="s861">Yah.</span> <span id="s862">So there I was just a short time.</span> <span id="s863">After that, they took us to...uh...to Sachsenhausen, to..., from Buchenwald we went to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s864">Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s865">That was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s866">That was terrible.</span> <span id="s867">First of all, it depends in what Lager you were.</span> <span id="s868">There were different Lagers in the Lager...in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s869">There was, for instance, a Lager where... where privileged Jews were, so-called, which were...uh...had relatives in America or so, and they sent them money and they paid the money to the SS or to whomever.</span> <span id="s870">Yah?</span> <span id="s871">And that's how they survived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">And they had maybe a opportunity to go even out from the country.</span> <span id="s873">That was really privileged people.</span> <span id="s874">A handful.</span> <span id="s875">It was a small Lager with families and so on, and very, very prominent people and so on.</span> <span id="s876">But I was just a plain schnook so I had to go through again the...the [sauna]... the ...the disinfection station, and then after the...the quarantine.</span> <span id="s877">The quarantine was terrible.</span> <span id="s878">The quarantine was made that way that more people should die as possible.</span> <span id="s879">It was a big room, open room, with a concrete floor and everybody was sleeping on that concrete floor.</span> <span id="s880">We got one...one... uh... blanket, the only one, and...and we had to sleep on that concrete floor.</span> <span id="s881">So it was terrible.</span> <span id="s882">The food just to survive that.</span> <span id="s883">A lot of people were dying there because they were already weak anyway and they didn't have food.</span> <span id="s884">So a lot of people there dying there already.</span> <span id="s885">I discovered there a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s886">He was already on the end.</span> <span id="s887">Strong guy.</span> <span id="s888">Strong, beautiful guy and I told him, "Stay alive.</span> <span id="s889">Try to survive."</span> <span id="s890">He had no...no guts anymore to...to fight.</span> <span id="s891">Yah?</span> <span id="s892">He couldn't fight anymore.</span> <span id="s893">I tried to give him a little soup when I got the soup once...the little warm soup.</span> <span id="s894">I pushed it into his mouth.</span> <span id="s895">He didn't want to take it anymore.</span> <span id="s896">He wanted to die.</span> <span id="s897">He wanted to die.</span> <span id="s898">And so...but I didn't want to die.</span> <span id="s899">I had the survival instinct.</span> <span id="s900">No matter what, I had to live.</span> <span id="s901">So what happened?</span> <span id="s902">They were bringing food in 50 pound, uh, 50 liter or so containers.</span> <span id="s903">Yah?</span> <span id="s904">Open containers.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">The...Russian prisoners, Russian army prisoners.</span> <span id="s906">They were in the...in the kitchen there, and they were... uh ...distributing the food, you know, in big containers.</span> <span id="s907">What was the food?</span> <span id="s908">It was a vegetable soup.</span> <span id="s909">Yah?</span> <span id="s910">But better than nothing.</span> <span id="s911">What...what they did, on the way to...to where... where they were supposed to hand out the food, they stole one of the containers, so there were one container less and they knew...knew that will not be enough.</span> <span id="s912">They stole it and they sold it for money or...or...or gold to some other place, some...some other prisoners.</span> <span id="s913">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s914">Yah?</span> <span id="s915">And so what they did, they put down these...these two container and told...told everybody, "Get it yourself."</span> <span id="s916">So what happened?</span> <span id="s917">Everybody run and grabbed some...some soup from there, and so far that...that if you couldn't get even to it because everybody was fighting.</span> <span id="s918">So they tipped over the whole container on the floor, and who is going to eat it from the floor, cold and everything?</span> <span id="s919">Yah?</span> <span id="s920">And that was the only food what we got!</span> <span id="s921">So what I did, just thinking for survival.</span> <span id="s922">What I did, I picked up the vegetable, the cold vegetables from the floor, ran to the barrack room and washed the whole vegetables and everything under the water pipe and ate it cold, whatever, just to survive.</span> <span id="s923">Yah?</span> <span id="s924">I survived it so far.</span> <span id="s925">But then they put us in the regular... the regular...uh...this... uh... barracks.</span> <span id="s926">And then there was a sick barrack.</span> <span id="s927">The sick barrack didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s928">I was sick.</span> <span id="s929">For instance, I went to the...to the...uh...sick place...to the so-called hospital, or what it was.</span> <span id="s930">Yah?</span> <span id="s931">What they gave you a placebo.</span> <span id="s932">Yah?</span> <span id="s933">In every color, or they gave you charcoal, little pieces of charcoal.</span> <span id="s934">What did I do?</span> <span id="s935">I ate it.</span> <span id="s936">I ate it just to survive.</span> <span id="s937">For instance, I found a old toothpaste lying on the ground somewhere.</span> <span id="s938">I opened it up, I ate the toothpaste.</span> <span id="s939">Yah?</span> <span id="s940">What was inside.</span> <span id="s941">For instance, I..</span> <span id="s942">.</span> <span id="s943">I..</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">there was... uh... grass.</span> <span id="s946">I mean wild grass, crab grass.</span> <span id="s947">I pulled out the crab grass and ate the roots, wherever, whatever.</span> <span id="s948">Just to survive.</span> <span id="s949">And there was a other...other place, other barrack where all the sick people were going.</span> <span id="s950">Yah?</span> <span id="s951">When you were sick and you couldn't go to work, which there wasn't work really, you had to...uh...go to this barrack, the sick people.</span> <span id="s952">What was the barrack?</span> <span id="s953">Concrete floor, straw, some plain straw on the...on the side of the barrack.</span> <span id="s954">In the middle a..</span> <span id="s955">.</span> <span id="s956">a walkway, and there they were lying there and waiting to die them.</span> <span id="s957">Yah?</span> <span id="s958">Then in front of it or in the back of it was a big pile of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s959">Yah?</span> <span id="s960">All like...like skeletons.</span> <span id="s961">When I saw that, I knew what's waiting for me, naturally.</span> <span id="s962">But it didn't happen that way.</span> <span id="s963">I didn't stay there long, because if I would have stayed there long... That was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s964">Just to see that, yah?</span> <span id="s965">First of all, people...we were walking just like zombies.</span> <span id="s966">We are walking...I was already skin and bone, already that time.</span> <span id="s967">We were walking there and walking all day long just asking for... for situation reports from...from the fronts or so what's going on?</span> <span id="s968">'Twas late.</span> <span id="s969">It was in '43.</span> <span id="s970">Yah?</span> <span id="s971">Already.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">And...nothing.</span> <span id="s973">We didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s974">And one day they came, took us with big trucks away.</span> <span id="s975">We were going in the transport, I don't know how long, in covered trucks with a guard in the truck.</span> <span id="s976">We were going to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s977">Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s978">There they told us we will be working there.</span> <span id="s979">It was a factory.</span> <span id="s980">An old factory where then it was like a..</span> <span id="s981">.</span> <span id="s982">like a warehouse, something like that.</span> <span id="s983">There were bunk beds, and I was there I don't know how long we were there.</span> <span id="s984">I met an old childhood friend there by accident.</span> <span id="s985">He...he recognized me.</span> <span id="s986">And...it was Herman.</span> <span id="s987">His name was Herman.</span> <span id="s988">He was a child.</span> <span id="s989">He was completely finished with his nerve...nerves.</span> <span id="s990">He was crying and...and asking me I should save him.</span> <span id="s991">I should save him.</span> <span id="s992">"My God, I cannot save myself.</span> <span id="s993">How can I save you?"</span> <span id="s994">Huh?</span> <span id="s995">And a few times we...we saw each other, and he was happy to see me.</span> <span id="s996">Yah?</span> <span id="s997">And then he disappeared.</span> <span id="s998">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s999">Huh?</span> <span id="s1000">I never found out what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1001">So from there, we are going to...uh...to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1002">In Mauthausen was terrible too.</span> <span id="s1003">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s1004">I couldn't get food there.</span> <span id="s1005">I couldn't work.</span> <span id="s1006">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1007">You were there going through the process, the quarantine and everything, and that weakened us even more; and we got very bad food or we didn't get food at all.</span> <span id="s1008">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1009">The hy...hygienes were terrible.</span> <span id="s1010">We had very bad bathrooms and everything.</span> <span id="s1011">You...it...everything was cold.</span> <span id="s1012">Cold water.</span> <span id="s1013">There was no warm water.</span> <span id="s1014">Never.</span> <span id="s1015">So I don't know how I survived that.</span> <span id="s1016">And we were in a other camp....</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Did you...?</span> <span id="s1018">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1019">Did you work in Mauthausen at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: No.</span> <span id="s1021">No.</span> <span id="s1022">Nowhere.</span> <span id="s1023">I..</span> <span id="s1024">.</span> <span id="s1025">I didn't work in there.</span> <span id="s1026">Only place I started to work a little bit was in...in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1027">They didn't need us.</span> <span id="s1028">There was already a..</span> <span id="s1029">.</span> <span id="s1030">they were evacuating everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">They were...they were losing the war.</span> <span id="s1032">The Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1033">Huh?</span> <span id="s1034">They were running from the front, and they were running with us.</span> <span id="s1035">They were always pushing us further and further.</span> <span id="s1036">Yah?</span> <span id="s1037">And they were running to the Americans, not...not to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1038">Yah?</span> <span id="s1039">So they were always running from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1040">And they took us with... with them.</span> <span id="s1041">We were going...I remember once.</span> <span id="s1042">They put us in a Lager.</span> <span id="s1043">It was an old...it was a new...uh...army camp, but it was empty.</span> <span id="s1044">And why it was empty I found out later.</span> <span id="s1045">It was all loused up.</span> <span id="s1046">Full with lice.</span> <span id="s1047">And they put us there.</span> <span id="s1048">Huh?</span> <span id="s1049">Naturally everybody got lice...lice.</span> <span id="s1050">And we were dying like ...like...like...uh... flies.</span> <span id="s1051">And then what they did, they wanted to make us to work so they took us...every morning at 5 o'clock we had to get up, "Appell".</span> <span id="s1052">"Appell" was...was where we had to account...everybody out.</span> <span id="s1053">They were doing the count of everybody to stay in rows like soldiers and they... they marched us every morning over...through a town.</span> <span id="s1054">I don't know even what was the name of the town, to a..</span> <span id="s1055">.</span> <span id="s1056">to a station ...to a railroad station, a little one.</span> <span id="s1057">And there in the railroad station there were old locomotives, old, old engines.</span> <span id="s1058">And we had to clean these engines and repair them because they were rusty.</span> <span id="s1059">Repair them to...to use them, because they were out of engines.</span> <span id="s1060">Yah?</span> <span id="s1061">They were bombed, ...the...the....the railroads.</span> <span id="s1062">Besides that, we had to carry...uh...uh... railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1063">We had to carry to where they were bombed out, you know, where they were repairing them; from...from a forest to this place, to the station.</span> <span id="s1064">What was that we were carrying.</span> <span id="s1065">Six...six people.</span> <span id="s1066">Six meager people...I mean we had to carry a big railroad track.</span> <span id="s1067">I don't know how many feet it was long.</span> <span id="s1068">But it was very heavy, even for six people.</span> <span id="s1069">Three on one end, three on a other end.</span> <span id="s1070">It was murder.</span> <span id="s1071">Yah?</span> <span id="s1072">I saw if I will do that with these food what we had, I couldn't survive it.</span> <span id="s1073">And really everyday a few people just dropped dead.</span> <span id="s1074">And I saw that, "My God, I have to do something."</span> <span id="s1075">So the first opportunity came and they were looking for...for a guy who knew how to handle a engine.</span> <span id="s1076">Yah?</span> <span id="s1077">A stream engine, a locomotive.</span> <span id="s1078">I thought myself, "What can happen?</span> <span id="s1079">Just to get out of it."</span> <span id="s1080">I..</span> <span id="s1081">.</span> <span id="s1082">I said I can handle the machine.</span> <span id="s1083">Yah?</span> <span id="s1084">Like that.</span> <span id="s1085">I..</span> <span id="s1086">.</span> <span id="s1087">I was technically always inclined...I was in engineering school and so on.</span> <span id="s1088">I knew the principles and so on.</span> <span id="s1089">So they took us into a forest where old...uh...all these old engines were rusting there and they told us, "Any engines which will be fixed up, we should try out."</span> <span id="s1090">Huh?</span> <span id="s1091">The try out was that we had to bring it to a SS man, the engine from the forest.</span> <span id="s1092">I mean it was on tracks but...but old tracks.</span> <span id="s1093">We had to bring it to the SS commander and go a stretch.</span> <span id="s1094">And if we made it, if we made the test, he told us to go forwards, to go backwards and so on.</span> <span id="s1095">Then we will be accepted...accepted.</span> <span id="s1096">Yah?</span> <span id="s1097">As a railroad engineers.</span> <span id="s1098">Alright.</span> <span id="s1099">So I tried.</span> <span id="s1100">I tried my best.</span> <span id="s1101">But in the meantime, I tried really to find out what's about it.</span> <span id="s1102">How to work it.</span> <span id="s1103">There was a Russian young guy...uh...a Russian prisoner.</span> <span id="s1104">Yah?</span> <span id="s1105">Not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1106">I knew...I found out that he was really in a factory on a engine.</span> <span id="s1107">He was going in a factory with...with a engine.</span> <span id="s1108">So I asked him all the details how to handle this engines.</span> <span id="s1109">Yah?</span> <span id="s1110">And it happened that I tried out and it was working.</span> <span id="s1111">Yah?</span> <span id="s1112">It was working.</span> <span id="s1113">So now came again the test.</span> <span id="s1114">Yah?</span> <span id="s1115">One guy in front of me...watching...come...came to the test.</span> <span id="s1116">I knew he was a engineer.</span> <span id="s1117">Yah?</span> <span id="s1118">I knew.</span> <span id="s1119">But what happened is these engines are old and rusty and he couldn't move that...that handle, and he got stuck somewhere.</span> <span id="s1120">Yah?</span> <span id="s1121">He couldn't come back to the...the...the guy, ...the...the SS man ran after him.</span> <span id="s1122">Yah?</span> <span id="s1123">And shot him right there on the spot.</span> <span id="s1124">So when I saw that, I wasn't sure I will not be shot either.</span> <span id="s1125">But luckily, the engine was going.</span> <span id="s1126">I could do everything.</span> <span id="s1127">It was a better engine.</span> <span id="s1128">So, I got through the test.</span> <span id="s1129">The next time I was...I was getting better food.</span> <span id="s1130">I got better place, yah, in the barracks and I was doing the job.</span> <span id="s1131">Every morning coming there with a whole group to that place and picking up the engine and taking materials, railroad tracks and all these things to a factory...about a 15 mile track.</span> <span id="s1132">There I had two civilians.</span> <span id="s1133">They were doing the...uh...the other things on the engine.</span> <span id="s1134">Yah?</span> <span id="s1135">There were my...my assistants but actually I was their assistant, officially.</span> <span id="s1136">Yah?</span> <span id="s1137">They were...had the... they... they were in charge of the water and the coal for the...for the steam engine.</span> <span id="s1138">So when I came in the morning so everything was prepared already, and I had to ask them always, "Did you prepare everything?</span> <span id="s1139">Is the engine, everything okay?</span> <span id="s1140">Did you check out everything?"</span> <span id="s1141">"Yes, everything okay.</span> <span id="s1142">There is water, everything."</span> <span id="s1143">I spoke German.</span> <span id="s1144">That...that was helping me, you know.</span> <span id="s1145">So I went on a stretch like usual, and I got stuck.</span> <span id="s1146">The engine was overheated.</span> <span id="s1147">I didn't have enough water in the engine.</span> <span id="s1148">And right away him coming on a..</span> <span id="s1149">.</span> <span id="s1150">on a car, you know, a railroad car, you know...uh...the SS guy and a commander, "What happens?</span> <span id="s1151">What happens?"</span> <span id="s1152">I said, "They didn't put in enough water.</span> <span id="s1153">I had to let off all the steam and everything from the engine because we don't have water."</span> <span id="s1154">"Ooh, you don't tell that the Germans.</span> <span id="s1155">The German civilians did that, that they didn't put in water?"</span> <span id="s1156">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1157">That was enough for him.</span> <span id="s1158">He pulled out his...his gun...Yah?</span> <span id="s1159">and...and to show it to me.</span> <span id="s1160">He said to me, "Ooh, that's too good for you.</span> <span id="s1161">That's too good for you.</span> <span id="s1162">I will take care of you."</span> <span id="s1163">For what he will take care of me, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1164">Huh?</span> <span id="s1165">Yah, he put me on a..</span> <span id="s1166">.</span> <span id="s1167">in a place...in a jail...in the ...in the Lager.</span> <span id="s1168">Yah?</span> <span id="s1169">No food.</span> <span id="s1170">I had to die hunger.</span> <span id="s1171">That's what he said.</span> <span id="s1172">"You will die hunger."</span> <span id="s1173">It didn't need much more.</span> <span id="s1174">Huh?</span> <span id="s1175">But what it is, the others didn't know about it, the other commanders and so on.</span> <span id="s1176">Only this one.</span> <span id="s1177">And I thought...I looked terrible already.</span> <span id="s1178">I was quite down and I said I have...uh...I have before T.B., you know, tuberculosis so if I can go to the...to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1179">I asked in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1180">Huh?</span> <span id="s1181">I got out to the hospital and I made believe that I have tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1182">They didn't have x-rays or nothing so I just made believe that I am coughing and I am cold.</span> <span id="s1183">Yah?</span> <span id="s1184">I..</span> <span id="s1185">.</span> <span id="s1186">A cold I had always anyway, so I could make very easily believe I have tuberculosis, and I looked it too.</span> <span id="s1187">Yah?</span> <span id="s1188">So they put me into the sick bay.</span> <span id="s1189">That was a barrack where all the sick...sick were.</span> <span id="s1190">Again it was the same thing as...as in...in...uh...before I told you.</span> <span id="s1191">Again a barrack with...with a concrete floor on the side, straw and all the sick were lying there.</span> <span id="s1192">Whoever stayed alive, whoever could go for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Yah.</span> <span id="s1194">They brought a container.</span> <span id="s1195">Whoever could go for food survived.</span> <span id="s1196">Whoever couldn't get up, he died there, a slow death.</span> <span id="s1197">Yah?</span> <span id="s1198">So it was terrible, but what happened one day the...the war was getting to end and there was a..</span> <span id="s1199">.</span> <span id="s1200">I saw on the side there, there was a transport of...of German Army, a convoy going on the...the high...highway, not far from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Which camp were you in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I don't know what camp it was.</span> <span id="s1203">It was somewhere, I think so, in Württemburg, because it had just...just a number.</span> <span id="s1204">It didn't have a name.</span> <span id="s1205">It had just a number.</span> <span id="s1206">And what happened there, I saw this...this convoy and suddenly I saw airplanes, bombers, English bombers came and started to bomb that...that convoy.</span> <span id="s1207">And it was very close to the camp.</span> <span id="s1208">And the camp started to get bombed, and from the pressure, the shrapnels and everything, I flew into one corner of the barrack... Yah?</span> <span id="s1209">...of the...of the barrack and a big plate, a table plate, flew right on me...Yah?</span> <span id="s1210">...and covered that corner.</span> <span id="s1211">And that saved my life from the shrapnels.</span> <span id="s1212">Yah?</span> <span id="s1213">I survived it.</span> <span id="s1214">A lot of dead already there.</span> <span id="s1215">A lot of dead, and whoever was there alive, they made a quickly, quickly to evacuate us.</span> <span id="s1216">"Everybody out.</span> <span id="s1217">Everybody out.</span> <span id="s1218">Everybody stand up."</span> <span id="s1219">And they...they brought a train, a open train, a coal train.</span> <span id="s1220">Yah?</span> <span id="s1221">It was usually used for coal, and they put us in the open trains.</span> <span id="s1222">Everybody who survived.</span> <span id="s1223">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1224">It was already...uh...in '44...uh...it was already...uh...starting to be summer.</span> <span id="s1225">Was sometimes in spring.</span> <span id="s1226">And they opened...during the day these opened cars were...were hot, like Hell.</span> <span id="s1227">The sun was shining on us.</span> <span id="s1228">And at night was again too cold, you know, freezing.</span> <span id="s1229">Was terrible, but we were about 50 or how many in one of these trucks so we huddled together just to keep ...uh ...warm during the night.</span> <span id="s1230">And the...the food was terrible.</span> <span id="s1231">They didn't have themselves already, the Germany army, much food.</span> <span id="s1232">So that was the German army.</span> <span id="s1233">So they took us already with them to evacuate.</span> <span id="s1234">And what they had only corn syrups with...with...with...uh....beets.</span> <span id="s1235">You know, red beets, sliced beets.</span> <span id="s1236">That was the only food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">And when they let us out when they stopped somewhere because they had to stop because some...some of these...these trucks were bombed out, so until they fixed them they...we had to stop.</span> <span id="s1238">So they...when we stopped, they let us down to the...from the truck, but they were watching us with a..</span> <span id="s1239">.</span> <span id="s1240">with a..</span> <span id="s1241">.</span> <span id="s1242">machine guns and everything.</span> <span id="s1243">Huh?</span> <span id="s1244">So I tried always to take out some...some roots...some roots from grass and eat them; just to survive, because that wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s1245">We got water.</span> <span id="s1246">That's all what we got.</span> <span id="s1247">But not always water either.</span> <span id="s1248">So one day it was very hot.</span> <span id="s1249">We were about 14 days on this trip.</span> <span id="s1250">All up and down going over Germany.</span> <span id="s1251">I don't know where we were.</span> <span id="s1252">And all SS as...as the war was going, as they were running, so that's how they took us with us, with the transport.</span> <span id="s1253">And...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1254">It was hot one day, noontime and we didn't have water.</span> <span id="s1255">There's no water.</span> <span id="s1256">Now I saw there was...there were people, Germans civilians....</span> <span id="s1257">repairing the trucks.</span> <span id="s1258">Right the other trucks and there were about 30, 40 feet away, and I saw they have their pail a little bit water with a..</span> <span id="s1259">.</span> <span id="s1260">with a little...little thing...uh...cup for drinking.</span> <span id="s1261">So I thought myself, "What can happen?</span> <span id="s1262">I will die...die this way or that way or...or...or...from...from...thir.</span> <span id="s1263">.</span> <span id="s1264">thirst.</span> <span id="s1265">I was terribly thirsty.</span> <span id="s1266">People were dying there from thirst.</span> <span id="s1267">So I jumped out from the car and run to that pail and drunk that water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Naturally, the...the guard...right away, the guard...but he couldn't shoot on me because I was between the civilians there.</span> <span id="s1269">I..</span> <span id="s1270">.</span> <span id="s1271">he would have shot a civilian.</span> <span id="s1272">And I run back, so he couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1273">What he...the only thing what he did he did hit me with his butt, with his rifle butt good on my head so that I was knocked out for a..</span> <span id="s1274">.</span> <span id="s1275">for a..</span> <span id="s1276">.</span> <span id="s1277">I don't know how long...which rammed into me good.</span> <span id="s1278">I had a big bump.</span> <span id="s1279">But I survived it.</span> <span id="s1280">I survived it.</span> <span id="s1281">And next...next time...what was it?</span> <span id="s1282">Bergen-Belsen, or...I think so.</span> <span id="s1283">It was Bergen-Belsen, or was it...?</span> <span id="s1284">Yah, that was the last one.</span> <span id="s1285">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: You had said Bergen-Belsen before?</span> <span id="s1287">A: Did I say before?</span> <span id="s1288">Yah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: You were in one more camp now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1291">One more camp they took us.</span> <span id="s1292">We came night there.</span> <span id="s1293">I didn't know even where...what it was.</span> <span id="s1294">We came at night and was a big camp and [pause] we had to get off into the...into the camp.</span> <span id="s1295">We passed the kitchen and at the kitchen...in front of the kitchen, there was lying...uh...potato peels, you know, what they peeled off dirty potatoes, you know.</span> <span id="s1296">We were so hungry that we run to these potato peels and grabbed as many as we could these potato peels and ate them.</span> <span id="s1297">Dirty and all, dirty, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1298">Yah.</span> <span id="s1299">Just to survive.</span> <span id="s1300">Yah?</span> <span id="s1301">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1302">It was a terrible camp.</span> <span id="s1303">Again through all these procedure, I found out that two of my uncles died in that camp because I met their...uh...uh...uh...good friend who survived them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Yah?</span> <span id="s1305">Who survived until we...I came there, but he was in pretty shape too, very bad shape too.</span> <span id="s1306">And so we were there, I don't know how many weeks we were there, just surviving.</span> <span id="s1307">We got there some food, some...some bread, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1308">Yah.</span> <span id="s1309">But not all the time.</span> <span id="s1310">So we survived somehow there.</span> <span id="s1311">One day we hear the Russian guns.</span> <span id="s1312">At night you could hear already the Russian guns were coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s1313">The sky was red.</span> <span id="s1314">We were starting to be very happy.</span> <span id="s1315">We know what's happening.</span> <span id="s1316">We...we knew that what's happening.</span> <span id="s1317">And the Germans were very...very concerned about it.</span> <span id="s1318">They felt already that it's getting to the end.</span> <span id="s1319">So one day they made it at night a "Appell" and we were in rows standing and as we were standing, "March."</span> <span id="s1320">We were marching by a..</span> <span id="s1321">.</span> <span id="s1322">a big...uh...warehouse, a German warehouse, and you know what was in that warehouse?</span> <span id="s1323">Care packages, from America.</span> <span id="s1324">They kept it there, you know.</span> <span id="s1325">They didn't give it to us.</span> <span id="s1326">All the time, they had...these Lager...these warehouses were full with packages, these care packages.</span> <span id="s1327">When we got there out because they were evacuating us, actually.</span> <span id="s1328">Yah?</span> <span id="s1329">We didn't know that, but it was the evacuation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">They gave everybody two care packages to carry with him.</span> <span id="s1331">So we were very happy.</span> <span id="s1332">But to carry that with our bodies, you know, weakened, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1333">It was a ordeal.</span> <span id="s1334">We were marching and marching and marching and you had to be in line because if you were not in line, if you stayed behind, they just shot you dead.</span> <span id="s1335">Everybody who stayed behind, who couldn't walk was shot dead by the SS.</span> <span id="s1336">The SS was going with us.</span> <span id="s1337">Uh...I don't know how many...how long we were walking.</span> <span id="s1338">My feet were all...all bloody because what did I have?</span> <span id="s1339">I had wooden soles and...and...and material at top.</span> <span id="s1340">Yah.</span> <span id="s1341">So I couldn't...I could hardly walk in them, and we had to march.</span> <span id="s1342">We have to stay in line and we had to go.</span> <span id="s1343">Finally, sometimes noontime, it was very hot already, we had to rest.</span> <span id="s1344">The rest was on a open field near a river, and we were very thirsty so we run to the river and took with our...we had that...that...uh... you know...this...you know like a ration.</span> <span id="s1345">Uh...We had that and with us so I run to the river and drunk the water.</span> <span id="s1346">And that was polluted water.</span> <span id="s1347">So after an hour or so of sitting there, I started to get very sick.</span> <span id="s1348">And so others too.</span> <span id="s1349">Some others.</span> <span id="s1350">And I knew if I stay here, I couldn't get up, if I'd stay here I will be shot dead.</span> <span id="s1351">Because everybody who stayed behind, the SS shot.</span> <span id="s1352">So I was standing there, but I was lucky because that time there was a..</span> <span id="s1353">.</span> <span id="s1354">uh...a unit of...of regular army in the...in a village there nearby, and they heard that we have care packages.</span> <span id="s1355">Yah.</span> <span id="s1356">And they wanted the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1357">And they went, came with a carriage and tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Yah?</span> <span id="s1359">Tea!</span> <span id="s1360">They came and said to the SS man, "You are not going to shoot anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s1361">You go."</span> <span id="s1362">And they took all...all the...whoever could walk, they took and I couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1363">Whoever stayed there, the sick people, they gave everybody tea.</span> <span id="s1364">Yah?</span> <span id="s1365">The SS...the...the regular army, and they told us no more shooting.</span> <span id="s1366">They couldn't because they would have gotten into a fight with a..</span> <span id="s1367">.</span> <span id="s1368">with a..</span> <span id="s1369">.</span> <span id="s1370">with the regular army...the SS.</span> <span id="s1371">So they couldn't shoot us.</span> <span id="s1372">So we survived there.</span> <span id="s1373">We gave them cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1374">Huh?</span> <span id="s1375">And they told us, "We will take you to the village and we will hide you there.</span> <span id="s1376">You will give...give the peasants some things from your package and they will keep you there.</span> <span id="s1377">They will give you food and everything."</span> <span id="s1378">So really one carriage came to me and put me on a covered wagon, yah, army wagon, and they took me to the village.</span> <span id="s1379">It was a nice little village, and they took me...two...two guys we were together.</span> <span id="s1380">He was a German.</span> <span id="s1381">I just spoke German.</span> <span id="s1382">So they took us to the...to a peasant and we told him that we will give him soap, American soap if he would give us some food and...and give us some lodging.</span> <span id="s1383">So he said, "Okay, I will hide you here."</span> <span id="s1384">He put us in...into a empty pen...uh...uh...pig pen.</span> <span id="s1385">Huh?</span> <span id="s1386">And he brought us some potato soup.</span> <span id="s1387">Yah?</span> <span id="s1388">And we gave him...we gave him every time he came, we gave him a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s1389">Huh?</span> <span id="s1390">So we were there hiding.</span> <span id="s1391">I don't know how long we were there.</span> <span id="s1392">Just a few days.</span> <span id="s1393">They said they cannot keep us here because the SS is coming and so on, and there are other transports going like our...our transport.</span> <span id="s1394">They will try to put us sick people on a baggage store because after every...after every transport...the walking transport, was going a carriage with all the luggage of the kapos and...and the SS men and so on.</span> <span id="s1395">They were pulling it.</span> <span id="s1396">Prisoners were pulling it.</span> <span id="s1397">Yah?</span> <span id="s1398">So they said they will try to put me on a baggage... uh... this ...uh...little carriage.</span> <span id="s1399">So they put me really to a transport on a bag...baggage...luggage...these ...uh ...trans ...uh ... carriage and I had to give the prisoners always cigarettes that they should carry me.</span> <span id="s1400">But I..</span> <span id="s1401">.</span> <span id="s1402">I was feeling already very bad.</span> <span id="s1403">I was losing completely my...my...my conscious.</span> <span id="s1404">I was falling...uh...like in a coma.</span> <span id="s1405">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1406">I..</span> <span id="s1407">.</span> <span id="s1408">I had...had...I later found out I had stomach typhoid.</span> <span id="s1409">Huh?</span> <span id="s1410">And terrible dysentery and everything.</span> <span id="s1411">I..</span> <span id="s1412">.</span> <span id="s1413">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1414">A few days and I would have been gone.</span> <span id="s1415">But so they were carry me every time I gave them a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1416">"I want a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1417">Can I have a cigarette."</span> <span id="s1418">Cigarette, cigarette, cigarette.</span> <span id="s1419">Until I run out of cigarette.</span> <span id="s1420">And I run out of food.</span> <span id="s1421">Very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">The carriage...the care packages.</span> <span id="s1423">I ran out of everything at the time.</span> <span id="s1424">And...the food didn't do us good.</span> <span id="s1425">These corn syrups from...from the...from the care packages because we didn't have bread.</span> <span id="s1426">And to eat these ...these corn syrups and everything without bread that was...for our weak stomachs, that was even worse.</span> <span id="s1427">Huh?</span> <span id="s1428">That make us even more sick.</span> <span id="s1429">So I give...when I gave up all my care packages to these prisoners who were pulling that carriage, with the... with the luggage and me, they just stopped one day and just threw me off...off the carriage into a ditch near the road.</span> <span id="s1430">Yah?</span> <span id="s1431">And I was lying there half dead because I was almost ...most of the time unconscious...unconscious.</span> <span id="s1432">I was already in such a..</span> <span id="s1433">.</span> <span id="s1434">uh...state that I saw...unconsciously, I saw a..</span> <span id="s1435">.</span> <span id="s1436">a white tunnel with a white light on the end, and I knew... somehow I felt that if I get to the end of the tunnel, I will be dead.</span> <span id="s1437">Yah?</span> <span id="s1438">I felt that somehow.</span> <span id="s1439">So I picked myself up and was watching the road.</span> <span id="s1440">And there was running...the army was gone already....the Germans.</span> <span id="s1441">The civilians were running from the Russians...Yah?</span> <span id="s1442">...in...in carriages with horses.</span> <span id="s1443">Horse-driven carriages, covered wagons.</span> <span id="s1444">They were running there and it was already getting late.</span> <span id="s1445">The Russians...you could hear the Russians guns.</span> <span id="s1446">And I didn't know where to run.</span> <span id="s1447">Nobody wanted to take me on these carriages with him to run from the front, to run.</span> <span id="s1448">Finally on the end, there was just single carriages going with...with...with these...these covered carriages.</span> <span id="s1449">With one single horse, I saw a old couple.</span> <span id="s1450">And I said to me, "That's my last chance."</span> <span id="s1451">I jumped out from the ditch, caught the...the horse muzzle, and I told them, "If you don't take me with you to the next village, I don't let you go."</span> <span id="s1452">They were scared of me.</span> <span id="s1453">Those were old people, a..</span> <span id="s1454">.</span> <span id="s1455">a..</span> <span id="s1456">.</span> <span id="s1457">a very old couple, and I looked terrible.</span> <span id="s1458">I..</span> <span id="s1459">.</span> <span id="s1460">in the prisoner garb, so they knew who I am, so they agreed that I should sit down in the back, they will take me to the next village.</span> <span id="s1461">But only to the next village, because the horse cannot take more.</span> <span id="s1462">Yah?</span> <span id="s1463">So they really took me to the next village and the road...there was a big old restaurant and I got there, and I saw there was a lot of women from concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">They were there from...from concen...all kind of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1465">On the way to evacuating, they got lost there.</span> <span id="s1466">The SS was running.</span> <span id="s1467">The ...the army was running so they left them there.</span> <span id="s1468">There was a big...like a auditorium, old, very old, junky.</span> <span id="s1469">There were straw on the...on the ground and they put me there.</span> <span id="s1470">Huh?</span> <span id="s1471">And I wanted to eat something.</span> <span id="s1472">So one day I go.</span> <span id="s1473">There...there was a big kitchen and open stove, and they were cooking there soups and food for themselves...these women.</span> <span id="s1474">So I sit down near this stove, just to get warm.</span> <span id="s1475">And I hear talking to the...one of the womans to the other...give this old man a little warm soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">This old man, give him a little warm soup.</span> <span id="s1477">I must have looked terrible.</span> <span id="s1478">Yah?</span> <span id="s1479">I was in my early 20s.</span> <span id="s1480">Yah?</span> <span id="s1481">An old man.</span> <span id="s1482">So they gave me a little food, a little this.</span> <span id="s1483">Was very good, but I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1484">So they put me again there into...into that auditorium there on the straw lying and suddenly, we heard the Russians coming.</span> <span id="s1485">The shrapnels, the...the guns were...you could hear.</span> <span id="s1486">Yah?</span> <span id="s1487">I knew that was...at the...at the main road so the Russians will come there.</span> <span id="s1488">They will bomb this whole place.</span> <span id="s1489">So the women run away already.</span> <span id="s1490">They run all over to the village, deep into the village, and they left me there alone.</span> <span id="s1491">I was, ...I think so, the only one left there.</span> <span id="s1492">So if I saw that and I saw it starting to hear the guns...if I will lie...lie here I can be killed here from the front.</span> <span id="s1493">The front will go through.</span> <span id="s1494">So I crawled on my four, with my last strength, I crawled deeper into the village about 300 feet or how much...was a peasant farm.</span> <span id="s1495">And I thought I'd go in, no matter what, into the farm.</span> <span id="s1496">I opened the door.</span> <span id="s1497">There was a apartment and nobody in.</span> <span id="s1498">The peasants were gone, so I opened one door after the other.</span> <span id="s1499">One was a bedroom.</span> <span id="s1500">I saw there a bed, a open bed with a big...uh...down cover.</span> <span id="s1501">I lie down into that bed and covered myself over my head and I lost my conscious.</span> <span id="s1502">Huh?</span> <span id="s1503">I don't know how long I was lying there, how...how long it was, but I woke up suddenly.</span> <span id="s1504">I took off my...somebody pulled the cover off my head, and a Russian soldier with a Kalashnikov trained on me, "Who are you?</span> <span id="s1505">Where are you?</span> <span id="s1506">What are you?"</span> <span id="s1507">I showed him the prisoner garb.</span> <span id="s1508">I
