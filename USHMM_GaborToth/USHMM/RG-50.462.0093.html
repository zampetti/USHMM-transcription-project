35 years in America--that's something to think of.</span> <span id="s13">It's characteristic that I think of the other newcomers to the fresh country.</span> <span id="s14">So, he married very young and...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">JF: He had married before he went into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">BM: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s17">He married.</span> <span id="s18">He has two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">JF: And then he went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">BM: Yes, he went in, not that he wanted to...</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">BM: You know when the Czar said, and the Jews lived there, and my father was already the new breed, he was already the Jew, the-fighter, he was already no more the Talmudist.</span> <span id="s23">He was already the Left Wing of Judaism.</span> <span id="s24">That means he believed, but he learned a craft.</span> <span id="s25">And he was a fine, all-around mechanic in locksmithing, foundry, engraving.</span> <span id="s26">He was a fantastic mechanic!</span></p> <p><span id="s27">JF: So he also had his Talmudic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">BM: Of course, he had his Jewish training!</span> <span id="s29">Like every Jewish child from the old days on.</span> <span id="s30">Now, my grandfather, one of them--one was a shochet [ritual butcher]; and my father's father, he was a cap maker.</span> <span id="s31">A little cap maker.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">JF: A cap maker.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">BM: Cap maker, yes.</span> <span id="s34">Those were the Jewish professions of the time.</span> <span id="s35">After the pogrom, my father [unclear], my father was very powerful, I mean, physically, like I am.</span> <span id="s36">I am very physical.</span> <span id="s37">If not, I wouldn't survive the war.</span> <span id="s38">And, after the fighting, he took my mother and the two children...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">JF: He had been discharged from the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">BM: No, no, as a deserter...</span></p> <p><span id="s41">JF: He was a deserter?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">BM: Of course, most of the Jews at that time deserted!</span> <span id="s43">Who could live?</span> <span id="s44">When they had a chance, they deserted.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JF: Was not that a dangerous thing to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">BM: It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s47">It took him one year to escape from Russia to come to Belgium.</span> <span id="s48">He stopped in Austria.</span> <span id="s49">And for a while, where they were happy, but it was too close to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">JF: He went back to Kishinev?</span> <span id="s51">And got...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">BM: He fought in Kishinev.</span> <span id="s53">He left Vladivostock, came to Kishinev fought the pogrom, took my mother and the two sisters and run away.</span> <span id="s54">He run away and he wound up in Belgium after one year of all kind of adventures.</span> <span id="s55">He had in mind like every Jew to come to America.</span> <span id="s56">But my mother gave birth to a child, and they remained in Brussels.</span> <span id="s57">Why not in Antwerp?</span> <span id="s58">Because that is where he was stopped.</span> <span id="s59">He found a job immediately because he was an excellent craftsman.</span> <span id="s60">The language was not a barrier because the ten fingers speak when you know what you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">JF: About what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">BM: In 1906, he came to Belgium.</span> <span id="s63">Six, or seven, six, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">JF: And at that point, your mother had had two daughters in Kishinev?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">BM: And a boy, by the name of Natan.</span> <span id="s66">He died unfortunately.</span> <span id="s67">But that's not, you know.</span> <span id="s68">So then after this, my father worked, and his brother, Boris, joined him later on.</span> <span id="s69">And he left later on to America.</span> <span id="s70">Just on the beginning of the first World War, in 1914, so I remember him as a child.</span> <span id="s71">My memory is very awake since I was three years old.</span> <span id="s72">So, I can see Uncle Boris come and I was crying, and I loved him; he was the only uncle I had.</span> <span id="s73">He was pampering me, and I know where we lived at that time, and he gave me a little, you know, in which you crush medicine or garlic, in a little shtoissel, auf Yiddish it's called, and he left then.</span> <span id="s74">The war started, the first World War.</span> <span id="s75">It was very few Jews in Belgium...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">JF: You were born...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">BM: Before the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">JF: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">BM: 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">JF: 1910, okay.</span> <span id="s81">So, your early memories of your Uncle Boris were of quite a young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">BM: 1912, 1913, and 1914, of course.</span> <span id="s83">And, then, Uncle Boris came to America, and then, I don't know if you are familiar with Strawberry Mansion.</span> <span id="s84">He had a studio, Mednicki Studio, a photographist.</span> <span id="s85">He has two sons and a daughter.</span> <span id="s86">One is, was Saul Mednicki, and his wife is Miriam Mednicki, who was involved with work at City Hall with unwed young mothers; very prominent.</span> <span id="s87">And then I have another cousin by the name of Seymour Mednicki, who is also very prominent in his field of industrial photography.</span> <span id="s88">And then I have another cousin, Klev Lewin [phonetic], who is married to an American child, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">JF: Did your father tell you, as a young child, about the experiences that he had in the Army and the pogrom, the Kishinev pogrom?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">BM: Yes [clears throat].</span> <span id="s91">You must excuse me.</span> <span id="s92">This is a person who cannot help it, that Philadelphia weather...</span></p> <p><span id="s93">JF: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">BM: As a child my father had a very awakened life.</span> <span id="s95">He started reading the materials of the time, who came out with Karl Marx, Lenin already; it was the beginning of Socialism, when he was a young man, of course.</span> <span id="s96">And already, he was less than an orthodox Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JF: Was this difficult to do in his family?</span> <span id="s98">Or, did they permit him?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">BM: No, there was no question of permissiveness.</span> <span id="s100">My paternal grandfather was a very mild person, and an understanding person, who knew that the world was turning.</span> <span id="s101">Although they lived in a fairly large-sized city, Kishinev, they had a very broad mind; Jewish population in that sense.</span> <span id="s102">I remember my father telling me that he would be going to the park, and they would eat unkosher, little, dried salami, Karnatzlach [phonetic] he would say.</span> <span id="s103">And in my young mind, I would say, gosh, if I would do that, mother would shoot me, because mother was Orthodox.</span> <span id="s104">And my father would tell me that, alone, not to the girls.</span> <span id="s105">Not to the girls.</span> <span id="s106">I was part of everything that he did.</span> <span id="s107">For instance, we would go Saturday to the synagogue in Brussels.</span> <span id="s108">Now the Jews were concentrating in different bourgs.</span> <span id="s109">We lived in Anderlecht.</span> <span id="s110">Anderlecht was near the southern station.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JF: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">BM: A-N-D-E-R-L-E-C-H-T.</span> <span id="s113">Anderlecht.</span> <span id="s114">We lived in Anderlecht.</span> <span id="s115">We lived across a park.</span> <span id="s116">Now just before the war, the first World War.</span> <span id="s117">Across the park, on the top of the park, was a railroad going by.</span> <span id="s118">I recall the soldiers going to the front, and [unclear] throwing a--heart attack, you know, right from the source.</span> <span id="s119">I don't know, you've never seen it, and [unclear] patriotic songs, a youngster with a Belgium flag, I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s120">And I had been told by my father.</span> <span id="s121">He had already spoken to his brother, and then later on, when I was six and seven years old, that often my father in view to have shalom bayis, peace in the house, he would say to me, "Berel, don't get Mother's nerves; do what she wants you to do; don't be like I was."</span> <span id="s122">That's where I learned what he was, with the trefe kishkalach: nonkosher little sausages.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JF: He would tell you these tales of his rebellion, as a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">BM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">JF: But only for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">BM: Because, eh, the oldest of the boys, then I had to be accomplished, because going to the synagogue Saturday morning, we would take a little street; he turned to smoke a cigarette, and he would say, "If you tell Ma about it, I'll--” So, I didn't.</span> <span id="s127">Being involved with the confidence of my father was not an easy task, because I had to obey my mother's orders, and she was very religious, to the point that she was called a tsnia, [a modest holy woman] who was like a tzaddik.</span> <span id="s128">There is a tsnia.</span> <span id="s129">So my mother was a tsnia.</span> <span id="s130">Mind you that the rabbi would eat in our home, and we were a small Jewish congregation at that time; very few Polish and Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s131">It was more Polish Jews from Warsaw, from Lodz, who would change their home, come to Belgium, because it was very close to the border, just across Germany, and that's it.</span> <span id="s132">Of course it's large, but nevertheless, the closest that they could come.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">JF: So this section in Brussels that you're talking about...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">BM: Was a Jewish section...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">JF: Was primarily Russian and Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">BM: Not primarily Russian.</span> <span id="s137">There wasn't such a thing, primarily.</span> <span id="s138">If there was 2000 Jews, there was a lot at that time.</span> <span id="s139">It was before the Polish Jews and the Russian Jews came.</span> <span id="s140">It was whole in this reformiste.</span> <span id="s141">The Reformed Jews, all of them, were there and they were assimilated.</span> <span id="s142">In the synagogue was the rabbi with the high hat.</span> <span id="s143">There was an organ playing, and there was a choir, and there was big apparel that the Jews from Russia and Poland has never known.</span> <span id="s144">We know a synagogue was a place of worship, where you spoke to God about your problems and your heartaches, and nobody looked at the luxury of the establishment like it was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s145">So, slowly, the few families created a Hasidim shtibl [small synagogue].</span> <span id="s146">There was Hasidim from Poland and they put together Hasidim shtibl where, forcefully, we had to belong.</span> <span id="s147">There was no other one that was Reformed or Conservative or Orthodox.</span> <span id="s148">And when enough Jews came after the first World War, there was more Jewish people in Brussels.</span> <span id="s149">They made a couple of synagogues, and my father belonged to what they called at that time, the Red Synagogue.</span> <span id="s150">I refer now to 1922, already.</span> <span id="s151">The Red Synagogue was--that was the period of the Russian Revolution, and I remember as a youngster I would listen to my father and his friends discussing.</span> <span id="s152">And they would say the ambition was that when the Communists come, there would be no more antisemitism.</span> <span id="s153">All people would be equal, there would be no more war, and everybody will have work, no more hunger.</span> <span id="s154">And we would dream, and we would take back, not hunger, that was the dream, not hunger, not to be rationed, because during the first World War we were rationed.</span> <span id="s155">We would get six ounces of bread a day, period!</span> <span id="s156">That's all.</span> <span id="s157">We would go for food every second day to the German canteen, and in the canteen they would give us rations or bread.</span> <span id="s158">That would go on for four years.</span> <span id="s159">And my parents, being kosher, because of Mother, of course.</span> <span id="s160">When we received the pork, meat and the fatback, and the pork fat, my mother would exchange with the lady next door.</span> <span id="s161">And the Germans would make synthetic products.</span> <span id="s162">From coal they were able to extract saccharine, honey and margarine, and it tasted very good.</span> <span id="s163">They are geniuses!</span></p> <p><span id="s164">JF: From coal?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">BM: From coal, yes.</span> <span id="s166">From coal--they are geniuses.</span> <span id="s167">We would exchange it, and then Mother would try to feed us; it was horrible.</span> <span id="s168">During the war, from America, for the children in the school system, we received at that time one little bread a day, like a sandwich roll.</span> <span id="s169">And you see, most who suffered was those like my father, who came to Belgium, who had no one in the country.</span> <span id="s170">The Jew was a city person.</span> <span id="s171">We don't have acquaintances in the country who raises a pig, he has a calf, he grows some wheat, and so on.</span> <span id="s172">So we always struggled and my father made surgical instruments, he was a fine craftsman.</span> <span id="s173">So, the Germans occupying Belgium for four years, forced him to go work for them, and he would make instruments.</span> <span id="s174">You know, at that time there was horses.</span> <span id="s175">See, there was a cavalry.</span> <span id="s176">They had horses.</span> <span id="s177">So for the surgeons, the veterinarians, he had to make instruments.</span> <span id="s178">So he was able to bring, once in a while, back home, a loaf of bread, and the bread was the German bread, very heavy and black.</span> <span id="s179">But we couldn't get enough of it, of course.</span> <span id="s180">So, we grew up with this idea of hunger, and closeness among the Jewish population because we were so few.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JF: The Red Synagogue that you're talking about...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">BM: Alright, I'll come back to it.</span> <span id="s183">So, in the Red Synagogue was a very brilliant rabbi from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s184">He had nothing to do with politique, and the only time the Jews could come together and speak of politique--because during the week everybody was hustling to make a piece of a living.</span> <span id="s185">It wasn't easy because Belgium had nothing.</span> <span id="s186">Belgium was steel and coal and farmland and dairy.</span> <span id="s187">So the Jews, when they came in, they brought with them small industry; pocketbook making, tailoring, shoemaking, glove-making, fur-making.</span> <span id="s188">And from this, slowly they developed a tremendous industry and Belgium became one of the big exporters.</span> <span id="s189">And the King of Belgium has always been very benevolent for the Jews.</span> <span id="s190">Belgium has always been a heaven for the Jews.</span> <span id="s191">There was--Antisemitism has always existed.</span> <span id="s192">You cannot escape antisemitism in the best of heavens.</span> <span id="s193">Even in the Vatican with the Pope of Rome, there is a tremendous antisemitism.</span> <span id="s194">And then it is always going to be because they needed a scapegoat, and we were the scapegoat.</span> <span id="s195">So, the point was that Belgium was good to the Jews.</span> <span id="s196">My father was making out living, and they would come together on Saturday in the synagogue--and on the way to the synagogue we would buy--Belgium had the Communist Party, the Liberal Party, Catholic Party, Socialism--we had about 26 parties.</span> <span id="s197">So, we would buy a Communist paper and a Socialist paper, and on the way we would read the paper.</span> <span id="s198">And in the synagogue after you put on the tallis [prayer shawl], you make your bruchas [prayer, blessing], you speak politics, or slowly you take out the paper, you show this article, and this article.</span> <span id="s199">And the rabbi would bang on his bench, and he would be infuriated.</span> <span id="s200">And in that atmosphere in which I grew up of freedom and democracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">JF: Was the Red Synagogue then a nickname for this...</span></p> <p><span id="s202">BM: A nickname, a nickname of course.</span> <span id="s203">A nickname.</span> <span id="s204">The Roite Yiden they called them "the Little Red Jews."</span> <span id="s205">Then they know, this one is a Communist, this one is a Socialist, this one is a Polei Zion [Labor Zionist] and this one is--whatever party there was.</span> <span id="s206">And in the house when you came together, there was no radio and television, and there was no electricity, we still had gas.</span> <span id="s207">So when people came together, there was, [unclear] conversation.</span> <span id="s208">There was a talent in speaking.</span> <span id="s209">There were practically good orators.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: Did your father tell you stories--we had mentioned the Kishinev Pogroms, and you were going to tell me about his experience with that.</span> <span id="s211">Did he tell you any stories about experiences with the rebellions at that time, the Socialist uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">BM: Well, the thing is that he told me in that time, recall, although I didn't pay too much attention.</span> <span id="s213">When you are young, you listen and then you think of children's things.</span> <span id="s214">But, as I grew older, it came back into my mind that he told me that very few, very few non-Jewish people were helpful to the Jewish population, because the Jew always was able to hack out a living, and poverty was mostly among the muzhiks [peasants].</span> <span id="s215">It was Russia under the Czar.</span> <span id="s216">So there was a big jealousy;

why struggle in America?</span> <span id="s508">We are already here; we heard of antisemitism in America and then gangsters, and everything else."</span> <span id="s509">So my mother didn't really think of America, and America to me was so remote.</span> <span id="s510">Like for you remote is now Uganda.</span> <span id="s511">I had no dreams, ambitions, or desire of America.</span> <span id="s512">The only thing we liked from America is that pictures where everybody was happy: scrubbed houses, everybody was always making a good living.</span> <span id="s513">But when we start reading, and we read of Upton Sinclair, and we start reading the tragedies of life.</span> <span id="s514">Then we saw that America was really not such a heaven, but was really a heaven for those who were bloody, like the Vanderbilts, and the Rockefellers, who could step on ours and brains and toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">JF: Were you reading in English at that time, or were these books translated into French?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">BM: French, always French.</span> <span id="s517">My English was American, I don't speak now better than after three years in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">JF: You were speaking Yiddish at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">BM: Yiddish, French, Flemish and German.</span> <span id="s520">That's the languages we spoke in the house.</span> <span id="s521">Now for Mother and Dad, they bought the Flemish paper, because Flemish is similar to Yiddish.</span> <span id="s522">So I learned to translate, to read because of Mother, she lost her sight.</span> <span id="s523">At that time, we did not know much about, oh, modern diseases like diabetes, and God knows what else she had.</span> <span id="s524">So when she became blind I would get the papers, sit on her knee, sit on a little bench near her and read the paper in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s525">So she would say, "S'is a Yiddisher Zeitung, Barel?"</span> <span id="s526">[Is it a Yiddish paper, Barel?]</span> <span id="s527">And I would say, "Yeah, Ma," and then one of the children would say, "Ma.</span> <span id="s528">Es is a lig'n." [It is a lie].</span> <span id="s529">"No Ma, he doesn't tell the truth; it's a French paper."</span> <span id="s530">Mother would say, "Why don't you tell me it's a French paper?"</span> <span id="s531">And she would compliment me.</span> <span id="s532">And I've gained that knack, and today I can do the same thing: translate automatically three, four languages.</span> <span id="s533">We Jews have all kinds of talents.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">JF: A valuable one.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">BM: Oh, I admire you girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">JF: Anyway, in 1928, you were trying to get your...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">BM: In 1928, so after...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">JF: ...Belgian papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">BM: Yes, I had made all my necessary requests and so on.</span> <span id="s540">And I had brought proof that I was an honest man, because in vertig [in reality] I didn't think, like I said, you have an identity card.</span> <span id="s541">The identity card is a little--I have one, an old one.</span> <span id="s542">It's a little booklet in which there is your picture and there is written the names of your father and of your mother, where you were born, the street on which you live, what is your occupation, when it was given to you.</span> <span id="s543">And then there is a number that says in what book and city where you are registered.</span> <span id="s544">You carry it in your pocket, and every policeman has the right to ask you, "Can I see your papers?"</span> <span id="s545">And you show it, that's all.</span> <span id="s546">No big deal, it's not a hassle.</span> <span id="s547">He just wants to know your identity.</span> <span id="s548">He's entitled to--and we don't see anything wrong with it.</span> <span id="s549">In America, harassment!</span> <span id="s550">We have to admit we are a young nation here, we need another five hundred years.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">JF: Did this mean that you were a Belgian citizen to have these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">BM: No, if I were Belgian, I have a green card.</span> <span id="s553">If you are an alien, authorized to live legally in Belgium, you have a green with a white stripe.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">JF: So did you get a green card then?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">BM: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">JF: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">BM: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s558">I had a white, I had a green with a white stripe until I became a Belgian, then I received a green one.</span> <span id="s559">Well, among the Jewish population, that was something.</span> <span id="s560">"Unser zin ist a Belgium."</span> <span id="s561">[Our son is a Belgian.]</span> <span id="s562">"Bernard Mednicki is a Belgian" That means "Everything is open for me."</span> <span id="s563">I can walk in a bank; I can become a street cleaner; I can drive a trolley car; I can become a policeman; I can open my own store.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">JF: You can vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">BM: I can vote.</span> <span id="s566">Well, vote is the last thing that we thought of because we never had that privilege.</span> <span id="s567">We never had that privilege, but then when I start getting that privilege, I became very much involved in political life because it's in you.</span> <span id="s568">Every Jew is an activist, this was so.</span> <span id="s569">If we wouldn't, we wouldn't be eat.</span> <span id="s570">I don't have to tell you, you know that.</span> <span id="s571">And I had joined, of course, the union, a syndicate, which was a guild from craftsmen belonging to the same profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">JF: This was a Jewish guild?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">BM: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">JF: This was not?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">BM: We are not that big, we cannot organize.</span> <span id="s576">For Passover we had to bring in the stuff from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s577">There was a nice Jewish congregation.</span> <span id="s578">But, we had, I think, one Jewish grocery store in the whole neighborhood, that's all.</span> <span id="s579">We were restrained.</span> <span id="s580">And, so I received authorization and at that time, Belgium is very prolific--a family of 23 children is not abnormal.</span> <span id="s581">In Webun [phonetic] there was a royal society of large families--you must have a minimum of six children.</span> <span id="s582">We were eight, so we belonged.</span> <span id="s583">So we had privileges; we didn't have to wait in line for a trolley car.</span> <span id="s584">When the trolley car came, I showed you my card, you moved and let me go on top of it.</span> <span id="s585">If I went to a store, I would get a reduction in prices.</span> <span id="s586">On the train I would pay half a price and things like--all kinds of privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">JF: This is automatically for any family?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">BM: That's the law; that's the law.</span> <span id="s589">More than six children belong to the "Royal Society of Large Families," and because of that...</span></p> <p><span id="s590">JF: In order to belong to the "Royal Society of Large Families" you did not have to be a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">BM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">JF: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">BM: And my father belonged because the privileges were there.</span> <span id="s594">You could get clothes for children; reductions.</span> <span id="s595">And Belgium always give children subsidy.</span> <span id="s596">For instance, if you are a working man and you had a child, you would get so much a month for the child.</span> <span id="s597">That's called "children's money."</span> <span id="s598">And, if you had six children, you would get enough because they were logical in the sense that if you and I would both work on the same job--you are a bachelor; you make $100.00 a week and I make $100.00 a week and I have four kids.</span> <span id="s599">Now, you will live much better than I will, but I have done much more than you have done for the country.</span> <span id="s600">So, therefore, you and I, we both paid a very small fraction of our wages, plus the employer, in a fund who would send "children's money" to the mother, not to the father.</span> <span id="s601">With that money she buys shoes, the necessary food and clothes for the children.</span> <span id="s602">And that was controlled by social workers.</span> <span id="s603">They would come and see the children are well dressed.</span> <span id="s604">See, we lived a very ordered way.</span> <span id="s605">The police would run the street and every policeman would know everybody in the houses.</span> <span id="s606">He would knock on the door, "Good morning, how come you did not wash your pavement today?"</span> <span id="s607">Extremely clean.</span> <span id="s608">No guns at that time.</span> <span id="s609">They had canes, the policemen.</span> <span id="s610">It was, of course, a more civilized world after the first World War.</span> <span id="s611">And then, after they told me I can become a Belgian--I had the papers--it's called opter; I had an option.</span> <span id="s612">And, I optioned towards Belgium citizenship.</span> <span id="s613">As I became a Belgium citizen, I knew automatically I have to make my nine months of military service.</span> <span id="s614">So, the military service in Belgium was that, you went in the morning at eight o'clock with your uniform into the Kaserne [barracks], where they give you all kinds of drinks and at night they gave you money for the trolley car, for a couple of glasses of beer and a pack of cigarettes, and you went home.</span> <span id="s615">That was deserving.</span> <span id="s616">So they trained like in Switzerland, you know, National Guard.</span> <span id="s617">And when I went in for training, after four weeks, there was too many soldiers, and being I was from a large family, they let me go.</span> <span id="s618">That means that at the end everybody was so proud to be a Belgian soldier with a little hat with a pompon on front you know, and my brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s619">My brother is a soldat [soldier] and it was like, you know, it was something!</span> <span id="s620">Anyway, my father's name, Mednitzky's son--Belgian.</span> <span id="s621">After me, all the children became Belgian.</span> <span id="s622">Because I had put in that my brothers and sisters, who were born in Belgium, should become Belgian automatically; at least have a nationality.</span> <span id="s623">But my two sisters, Rosa and Sheva, they couldn't because they were born in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">JF: You could get citizenship...</span></p> <p><span id="s625">BM: I, no, I worked that my brothers and sisters should get the papers...</span></p> <p><span id="s626">JF: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">BM: ...the nationality.</span> <span id="s628">But my two sisters, they couldn't.</span> <span id="s629">So my father was without a land, without a country, and we were both citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">JF: There is no way that someone who was born in another country could have gotten Belgian citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">BM: Buy citizenship; yes, you can buy...</span></p> <p><span id="s632">JF: You could buy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">BM: You can buy naturalization.</span> <span id="s634">If you have a lot of money, you buy small naturalization.</span> <span id="s635">That means you can vote locally, for the local elections.</span> <span id="s636">If you have much more money, you have done things for the country, like many Jews have done, they give you the big naturalization--you can vote for Congress and Senate.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">JF: But in order to become a citizen, if you were born in Belgium, was not as complicated if you were born there?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">BM: Well, also you had to be able to prove that you were an asset to the country.</span> <span id="s639">Had I been a no-goodnick, they would not have allowed me to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s640">Had my father been disreputable, they would not have allowed him either.</span> <span id="s641">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">JF: You had to pay for it though.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">BM: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">JF: You did not have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">BM: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">JF: Your sisters would have had to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">BM: If they would have so chosen to become.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">JF: I see; okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">BM: But it was of importance.</span> <span id="s650">It was important to the young people born there.</span> <span id="s651">You see, my sisters being already aliens, then Mother died when I was 18 years old, 17 years old, and life has changed then.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">BM: Well, in every way; father lost completely the desire to live.</span> <span id="s654">We were a large family.</span> <span id="s655">Only one sister was married and being that he lost all ambition.</span> <span id="s656">He still had Rebecca, Morris, Chara and Zula were still going to school and I was working.</span> <span id="s657">So, I brought my pay home and I worked very hard.</span> <span id="s658">I dropped my apprenticeship--I was an apprentice from nine to twenty one.</span> <span id="s659">Eleven years of apprenticeship to become a craftsman.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">JF: From nine until twenty one?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">BM: Yes, because it was a very rigorous training then.</span> <span id="s662">See, being a Prosthesis Technician was not an easy trade.</span> <span id="s663">That's paramedical; I had to learn, then I had to go to evening classes and learn, anatomy, whatever pertains to it.</span> <span id="s664">And, I was working with masters who were very rigorous.</span> <span id="s665">After this, I worked but I couldn't make enough money, so I quit the job.</span> <span id="s666">And I start unloading barges on the canal, who paid good money.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">JF: This was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">BM: 1928-29.</span> <span id="s669">I would unload barges of soft sand, coal for good money.</span> <span id="s670">So you carry 50 kilo on your back, going up the ladder from the road, then you go empty them, all day like ants climbing up and down the ladder.</span> <span id="s671">Men, chain of men, doing it, unloading the ship.</span> <span id="s672">Today they have compact machinery, empty a ship in no time.</span> <span id="s673">Then, it was a job.</span> <span id="s674">After this, that job finished, and I went to construction.</span> <span id="s675">I was a mason's helper, carried the bricks on the third floor on the shoulders, and there almost broke the neck many times.</span> <span id="s676">After this I looked for a job--I needed money--so I went to a steel mill and I was working with a sledgehammer seven hours a day, breaking of the old foundry pieces.</span> <span id="s677">But like I said again to you, I was physically strong like a bull, and I worked with a rage and that rage helped me to survive.</span> <span id="s678">I was a big eater, when there was food.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">JF: When you say you worked with rage, what do you...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">BM: Rage--that why is life--mad at my mother?</span> <span id="s681">We had a good God.</span> <span id="s682">We were raised in Judaism.</span> <span id="s683">God is my father and here he takes my mother away, a mother from eight children.</span> <span id="s684">And Mother always in her fanaticism would say, "This world is a valley of tears.</span> <span id="s685">The real world, the world of life is Haolam habaa [world to come]."</span> <span id="s686">And we couldn't understand our Mother wanted to go.</span> <span id="s687">All right, we all love God but stay with us.</span> <span id="s688">So when He took her away, she died before Chanukah.</span> <span id="s689">Bitter winter.</span> <span id="s690">When she died, something happened to me.</span> <span id="s691">And in my heart, I hated God, and I didn't like it anymore.</span> <span id="s692">Because we did not learn Judaism was a philosophy, we learned Judaism was a fact of life, that is it!</span> <span id="s693">We're grown, of course; we understand better, we hope!</span> <span id="s694">In fact, who understands anything?</span> <span id="s695">Absurdity, all life is absurdity.</span> <span id="s696">So anyway, to go back to the story.</span> <span id="s697">I worked there for a long while, but my sister Rosa was very unhappy that I broke my training.</span> <span id="s698">In the meantime, Sheva became engaged--that's my second oldest sister; Rosa was the oldest and Sheva was the second.</span> <span id="s699">When Sheva became engaged and she married--in fact I found her children later; they are now in America, with us here--and she moved out from the house.</span> <span id="s700">So Rosa was responsible, and Rosa was like--in fact when I was born, Rosa was my Godmother.</span> <span id="s701">There was no Jews enough to have somebody being Godmother, so she was my Godmother.</span> <span id="s702">And you know, in families of large, of children, there is affinities [favoritism].</span> <span id="s703">There was a clans.</span> <span id="s704">I love you both and I love her--oh no, but I don't like her, she is my sister.</span> <span id="s705">But I would side with you in case of something.</span> <span id="s706">So Rosa and I were one piece of flesh; we were one.</span> <span id="s707">I looked up to her; she was a short one and I was not a good boy, so she would say to me, "Maybe I should hit you, [unclear] until you feel better, Rosa."</span> <span id="s708">She was like a mother--unfortunately the Nazis destroyed her.</span> <span id="s709">So, in the meantime, I start getting--I worked until nine-ten o'clock at night, on my boss, and went back to my trade.</span> <span id="s710">And that boss had a big contract for the coal mines, to make special gloves.</span> <span id="s711">And there was those little things in between the fingers called in French, fourchettes [forks].</span> <span id="s712">And those little things was a very tedious job.</span> <span id="s713">You have to cut them and match them to the color of the skin.</span> <span id="s714">So, I could get this to take home to work at night.</span> <span id="s715">So, I would take bundles of scrap leather and I would stay on my bench and pull the leather, it's soft leather, and I would work on it until eleven, twelve, one o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s716">Because every time I would make an extra franc, it was more money to make it easier in the house.</span> <span id="s717">We were not pauvre [poor], but we didn't have the facility of having a franc in your pocket for spending.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">JF: This was when, in the early thirties?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">BM: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s720">Not the early thirties, 1920-'28, '29... [counts in French]</span></p> <p><span id="s721">JF: '29.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">BM: '29-'30.</span> <span id="s723">No, '30, in fact, I met my first wife.</span> <span id="s724">And things were getting better then; my sister Rosa found a young man and she married.</span> <span id="s725">Then in due time, a young woman came to the house, and she fell in love with my father.</span> <span id="s726">Well for us children, a young woman would fall in love with Father!</span> <span id="s727">It's like a six year old would say to you, "I want to marry you."</span> <span id="s728">But, nobody would tell Father that.</span> <span id="s729">And she was the daughter of a rabbi from Poland.</span> <span id="s730">Father took a trip, went to Poland to meet her parents, and he came back and he said, "Children, I'm going to marry.</span> <span id="s731">As I was 13 years a widower, or 12 years."</span> <span id="s732">No, no, no, no, not that long; he was a widower for many long years.</span> <span id="s733">And then he said to me, "We are going to get married, so will all the children will--Look, it is Father's desire."</span> <span id="s734">In the meantime, before he was getting married, I met a young woman, in the synagogue on Yom Kippur looking over to the girls' side, because the synagogue was a room divided with a blanket in the middle, and that's it!</span> <span id="s735">That young woman was in Belgium illegally.</span> <span id="s736">There was many illegal Jews in Belgium.</span> <span id="s737">The rules is like this in Belgium--if you come to work in the coal mines, you can work two years and get papers to become legal in Belgium.</span> <span id="s738">The Jews, they all came to work in the coal mine, but in two weeks there had our diseases, lung diseases, they all find diseases and they never work in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s739">Polish Jews, [unclear] weak parties, there was nothing, it was not the Jew of America.</span> <span id="s740">Do you, you are a golden product; you are a tall girl kein ahora [don't invoke the evil eye].</span> <span id="s741">Where do you see girls like that?</span> <span id="s742">You are a giant for the Belgiums of Franks [Flanders].</span> <span id="s743">I'm the tall men in Belgium, small people.</span> <span id="s744">During the pogroms and the wars and everything else, we have been cleaned out.</span> <span id="s745">So, I met a beautiful young woman in the synagogue and she was here illegally.</span> <span id="s746">She was working in the lingerie, and I was friend with the boy of that Mr. &amp; Mrs. Glicksburg.</span> <span id="s747">And that lady, she was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s748">She was extremely beautiful.</span> <span id="s749">Eighteen years old or nineteen, and she had two sisters in Belgium, who worked in factories.</span> <span id="s750">There was no other work; depression was there.</span> <span id="s751">And, I met that young lady--at that time she had brought a Jew from Cuba to sell her away; not to sell her, to marry, then get a nice piece of gold because she brought a pretty girl to an old man.</span> <span id="s752">So, when this young woman saw me getting very pleasantly influenced by her, and I asked her to go out.</span> <span id="s753">She said to me the first thing, "I'm not legal."</span> <span id="s754">"Oh."</span> <span id="s755">I feel that's good, if she is not legal; I can marry her and make her legal.</span> <span id="s756">You know, I scheme, when you love somebody you scheme.</span> <span id="s757">And, so my father said, "Why do you want to get married; you aren't even 21?"</span> <span id="s758">I said, "Pa, I will wait."</span> <span id="s759">And I waited, and I waited until I was twenty-one and a-half.</span> <span id="s760">And then, for the first time in my life, my sister, Rosa, said, "Bernard, you must tell Pa that you want to get married now.</span> <span id="s761">If not, Pa's going to hold you until he wants you to get married."</span> <span id="s762">So, it was; I married, and I split my pay with my father, so that he should not suffer too much financially.</span> <span id="s763">In the meantime, he was going with that younger woman.</span> <span id="s764">And I rented one room, furnished.</span> <span id="s765">Started very modest--a bed, and a table, a little stove, and my bench.</span> <span id="s766">That bench followed me.</span> <span id="s767">I have my scissors here, my tools, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">JF: You still have your tools.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">BM: Oh yes, [tsk tsk sound].</span> <span id="s770">No Jew goes without.</span> <span id="s771">And you know this, I bless my father's memory.</span> <span id="s772">My father said a Jew must have a trade wherever he goes, should make a living.</span> <span id="s773">Now, assuming, God forbid, that you have to run away and make a living in Okinawa.</span> <span id="s774">What do you do?</span> <span id="s775">So you work.</span> <span id="s776">What can you do?</span> <span id="s777">You know the weaver, you know the pocketbook maker, you know the shoemaker, or a baker and a tailor?</span> <span id="s778">And my father had a good idea, he made a craftsman out of me, and I was always thankful to him.</span> <span id="s779">And I was always respectful, and I split my pay with him but I worked home very much.</span> <span id="s780">After work, I would bring home work and Shabbos [Sabbath] you not work.</span> <span id="s781">But some day I would work Saturday night and Sunday.</span> <span id="s782">I get no free time, but don't bother me, I was in love.</span> <span id="s783">So, the first year we had a baby.</span> <span id="s784">After one year married, we had a baby.</span> <span id="s785">And my father get married.</span> <span id="s786">And that made a complete change.</span> <span id="s787">He started making a living; he went back into what he did, and then he had a little boy, my little brother.</span> <span id="s788">My father was then fifty some odd years old.</span> <span id="s789">But of all the children we were, he was the most gorgeous one.</span> <span id="s790">He had teeth like pearls and eyes like jade, black, fantastic!</span> <span id="s791">And he was just unbelievable and everybody loved him, my little brother, Jacko.</span> <span id="s792">He was killed by the Nazis, of course.</span> <span id="s793">And then, I moved out from that one room.</span> <span id="s794">I had a good job, and I was a hard worker, and I rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s795">In Belgium you don't buy homes that easy.</span> <span id="s796">You can live all your life in a nice apartment.</span> <span id="s797">A house in Belgium goes from generation to generation to generation.</span> <span id="s798">And, I was involved politically with the Socialist Party, like the democrats in America.</span> <span id="s799">I was an activist.</span> <span id="s800">When Hitler came to power in the beginning, in 1933, I start getting active against Hitler's political activities.</span> <span id="s801">We had in Belgium our own Hitler: our Victor Leon de Grell.</span> <span id="s802">Leon de Grell was the Belgium Gauleiter [Nazi district administrator].</span> <span id="s803">He was ours, Seyss-Inquart, a traitor.</span> <span id="s804">And, we bodily fought him.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">JF: He was running for office as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">BM: No, he was not running for office, he wanted to become the Gauleiter, like Hitler in Germany.</span> <span id="s807">Don't forget we were poisoned everyday by the news in French and in Flemish.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">JF: There was a Nazi party then also?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">BM: It was a National Socialist Party.</span> <span id="s810">Partie d'Unitée Nationale de Belgium, they called themselves, National Unity Party of Belgium--against the foreigners, against the Jews, against the blacks, against the Free masons and the Judaic Kabbalah [Jewish mysticism].</span> <span id="s811">That is what it was for, like "La Kabale Judaique."</span> <span id="s812">So, we start fighting bodily against them.</span> <span id="s813">I remember coming home with a split face because we fought with--we had belts with big buckles.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">JF: You had belts?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">BM: Oh yea, we had groups--workers from our union and we would go fight meetings when they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">JF: You would fight at political meetings?</span> <span id="s817">You try to break up political meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">BM: Sure, because you see the people is--we always have found in the population a certain amount of people who are open to all kind of subversive permissiveness, hooliganism.</span> <span id="s819">If, today, I would tell my neighbor that he has a free hand to kill and rob, it would be he is a Jew hater, because he has no moral fiber.</span> <span id="s820">He is an alcoholic, and you have many like that, all over the world.</span> <span id="s821">America is no special privilege in that.</span> <span id="s822">It was the same thing in Belgium; so we were trying, if we cannot get him, it won't get poisoned by his propaganda.</span> <span id="s823">The police, of course, was trying to remain neutral.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">JF: So they did not arrest you?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">BM: They were disturbing us; they were chasing us; the gendarmarie with their horses and their long swords.</span> <span id="s826">They would, you know.</span> <span id="s827">We would attack them.</span> <span id="s828">Being the attacker, we were wrong.</span> <span id="s829">It's like when somebody hits you in the rear, and you are even guilty because you stopped brusquely, and see he was guilty in the back.</span> <span id="s830">And so, my son Armand was born and he grew up in an atmosphere where we had refugees already from Austria in the house, because we had to hear of fatalities of those who were running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">JF: Your son was born in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">BM: [counts in French], '33.</span> <span id="s833">Is it '33?</span> <span id="s834">Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s835">My son is 49, keyn eyn horah [without invoking the evil eye].</span> <span id="s836">[unclear] Tape 2, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s837">JF: You said your son was born in 1933...</span></p> <p><span id="s838">BM: Yes, he was born in 1933...</span></p> <p><span id="s839">JF: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">BM: Armand Mednicki.</span> <span id="s841">Armand, and he teaches here in a private school--Oakdale Day School.</span> <span id="s842">He lives in Doylestown, has a wife, has a son.</span> <span id="s843">He went through his share with me later on, of course, also a refugee in France.</span> <span id="s844">When he was born, the union paid for the maternity and, of course, paid for the crib and for the first week of nursing and everything else.</span> <span id="s845">It was part of the union plan we had.</span> <span id="s846">He was born in the center of Brussels, in a maternity.</span> <span id="s847">He was born in the month of January.</span> <span id="s848">We took the last trolley car to go to the maternity.</span> <span id="s849">And the water bag broke standing in the trolley car.</span> <span id="s850">"Bernard," she said.</span> <span id="s851">And I said, "Breathe and hold it, don't let the baby come," and so it was.</span> <span id="s852">The baby was born, an hour after she came to the maternity.</span> <span id="s853">At that time, the rumors of Hitler were not known.</span> <span id="s854">We started rumbles already because the German economy was totally decomposing.</span> <span id="s855">The mark, at that time, was like a million marks for a cent.</span> <span id="s856">It was paper and ink.</span> <span id="s857">And, already antisemitism was starting getting Fluchtlinge, refugees from Austria.</span> <span id="s858">Then later on the Putsch; then later on refugees from Germany, from Poland some.</span> <span id="s859">And in the house we slept six, on mattresses on the floor.</span> <span id="s860">And I would go to the bakery and I would buy yesterday's bread.</span> <span id="s861">It was three for one, and I would cook big batches of soup with bones and [unclear].</span> <span id="s862">And Belgium was very lenient, they all accepted them.</span> <span id="s863">Gave them momentary identity cards; they shouldn't be illegal.</span> <span id="s864">And, at that time, some of them, see, were able to come to America.</span> <span id="s865">Some went to England, France.</span> <span id="s866">And in the meantime we kept agitating against fascism, against DeGrell who was the Gauleiter of Belgium.</span> <span id="s867">And, they start putting together their black list of those to be arrested first when Hitler would win.</span> <span id="s868">They knew that Hitler will win, because our democracy was a trustworthy democracy.</span> <span id="s869">We had signed a pact of neutrality like Holland in the First World War.</span> <span id="s870">Neutrality means that nobody touches you.</span> <span id="s871">But, Hitler didn't listen to that.</span> <span id="s872">In May the 12th, 1940, my little daughter, Eliane, one who spoke to me now, was one year old.</span> <span id="s873">And that night, May 12th, on a Wednesday, she was weaned from the breast, and I was walking the floor with her because she was crying, she wanted the breast.</span> <span id="s874">As I walked her, I hear muffled explosions--and we lived on the high point in Brussels, "in Foret" its called.</span> <span id="s875">I looked out the window and far away--about 15 miles away--I see little silver lightnings.</span> <span id="s876">And I put on the radio, and the radio said we were being attacked.</span> <span id="s877">Our neutrality has been broken.</span> <span id="s878">I woke up her mother, and, at that time, Armand, my son.</span> <span id="s879">The year before we went swimming.</span> <span id="s880">The first time we open a solarium in Belgium--we never had anything like that--so we went swimming all day in the sun.</span> <span id="s881">And Armand had a spot on his lungs from the sun, decalcification.</span> <span id="s882">So in Belgium is very conscious about tuberculosis because the Queen Elizabeth suffered of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s883">Because of the coal mines there was a lot of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s884">So when a child had it, right away they took him away and they sent him out outside, outskirt from Brussels, in Vallee St. Lambert.</span> <span id="s885">And, there was a beautiful installation for children--they had everything they need--good food, good care, the fresh air.</span> <span id="s886">And I lived already very nicely.</span> <span id="s887">We had a nice apartment, four rooms, nice furniture.</span> <span id="s888">We lived very comfortably, I made a good living.</span> <span id="s889">And I was working for an employer who wasn't too far away from where I was living.</span> <span id="s890">And I worked for a Jewish employer.</span> <span id="s891">And the first thing is I have to go get Armand.</span> <span id="s892">Armand is like from here to Camden, New Jersey, and only by trolley car.</span> <span id="s893">We don't have automobiles, because there was no need.</span> <span id="s894">There is enough public transportation in Belgium to go from Belgium to France by trolley car.</span> <span id="s895">So I took Eliane in a basket--in the meantime, the Stukas [dive bombers] already start going low in the streets and dropping explosive bombs to scare the population.</span> <span id="s896">That was their tactic.</span> <span id="s897">They made panics, then they dropped the Fifth Column.</span> <span id="s898">Parachutists dressed like priests, butchers, bakers, and they would disturb the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">JF: You had no idea that this was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">BM: Of course not!</span> <span id="s901">We were neutral.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">JF: You were neutral.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">BM: Are you believe that your husband is in the taproom drinking beer now?</span> <span id="s904">If somebody would tell you, what would you say?</span> <span id="s905">It's dumb.</span> <span id="s906">My husband is a responsible person.</span> <span id="s907">He is working.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">JF: Did you feel that neutrality was that secure that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s909">BM: Definitely!</span> <span id="s910">Because Hitler had promised that he would never break any country who would be neutral.</span> <span id="s911">But he didn't break our neutrality, he came to defend us on the help, on the call of Leon de Valant.</span> <span id="s912">Leon deGrell called him to defend Belgium.</span> <span id="s913">Belgium was in the hands--in almost the hands of Communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">JF: I see.</span> <span id="s915">That was the rationalization.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">BM: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">JF: Before this time, did you talk at all about leaving Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">BM: No.</span> <span id="s919">Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">JF: You felt that you could stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">BM: Sure, it is my country.</span> <span id="s922">I am a Belgian.</span> <span id="s923">I vote, I counted, and I speak--I was an organizer.</span> <span id="s924">When it was depression and there were strikes, I was not afraid to manifestate because if you are an alien, you don't manifestate.</span> <span id="s925">This is not America where everybody has the rights here.</span> <span id="s926">I am flabbergasted and outraged at all the aliens taking privileges in America, like the Iranians manifestating in Washington.</span> <span id="s927">They are not even nationals of America.</span> <span id="s928">We say in the parallel, you are a guest in my house, you behave like a guest.</span> <span id="s929">You marry me, then you are a co-owner.</span> <span id="s930">But if you are a guest, then you are a guest.</span> <span id="s931">You have all the rights, but don't mix in my family life.</span> <span id="s932">So, is with America.</span> <span id="s933">Political--they have no rights, until they are citizens.</span> <span id="s934">We give them the privilege to live and work and study and do everything, and pay taxes, yes, because those taxes protects those who are here.</span> <span id="s935">And, believe me, I am not an empty nothing, because I went through everything.</span> <span id="s936">But that's my way to see democracy.</span> <span id="s937">Of course, I understand America being very young.</span> <span id="s938">We still need a few hundred years to polish everything that we have and this is time alone can do it.</span> <span id="s939">There's no question of rushing, you cannot plant tomatoes today and reap tomorrow.</span> <span id="s940">You cannot get pregnant yesterday and have a baby tomorrow.</span> <span id="s941">It takes time.</span> <span id="s942">So is democracy.</span> <span id="s943">Takes time but we will and if, God forbid, America will not wake up to defend that beautiful democracy, then we are doomed.</span> <span id="s944">And, we all have to work together.</span> <span id="s945">I am trying to convince the people that we are in one little globe, one world, nowheres else to go.</span> <span id="s946">Black, white, Christians, Jews, we all have to work together.</span> <span id="s947">And if, God forbid, we are not going to do it, then it is not going to be good, because there are people looming in the shadow, waiting to take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">JF: Let's go back to that time when these people were dropping out of planes, and it became...</span></p> <p><span id="s949">BM: The parachutists.</span> <span id="s950">Well, Belgium became wise to them and they eviscerated them.</span> <span id="s951">They waited for them on roofs, jumped them, and just sliced them open like pigs.</span> <span id="s952">Throw them down from the sixth floor, the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s953">This is what we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">JF: Who are you talking about now?</span> <span id="s955">Which Belgian?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">BM: The Belgian.</span> <span id="s957">Any Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">JF: Any Belgian?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">BM: Any Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JF: Not just the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">BM: We were watching already the parachutes coming down.</span> <span id="s962">You see, the Germans they would come with their gliders, and we wouldn't hear them, because they would be gliders.</span> <span id="s963">You would just hear "swish" so they would drop parachutists dressed, like I said to you, with sabotage and everything else, ammunition to blow up and disturb the normal ways of life.</span> <span id="s964">But the Belgians became wise, and, we get watchmen on roofs.</span> <span id="s965">And when we were lucky to catch them, oh they just maimed them terribly because there was no more neutrality.</span> <span id="s966">And there was no convention of Geneva working because there was no act of war.</span> <span id="s967">That was sabotage.</span> <span id="s968">And this went on until the Belgian government--that was the 12th.</span> <span id="s969">Then my employer and his family, and my wife also, had her sisters living in Paris.</span> <span id="s970">They moved from Belgium to Paris.</span> <span id="s971">So, I took my wife and my two children, after I came back with Armand--terrible ordeal until I was able to get them to the trolley car as transportation, the alerts, the sirens going on every time there was another plane coming over.</span> <span id="s972">We put them on the train on the south station to Paris.</span> <span id="s973">Now, she was a Belgium born in Warsaw from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">JF: Who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">BM: My wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">JF: You were putting your wife...</span></p> <p><span id="s977">BM: My wife and the two children...</span></p> <p><span id="s978">JF: ...and the two children...</span></p> <p><span id="s979">BM: ...on the train going to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">JF: Under what protection?</span> <span id="s981">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s982">BM: The protection which should be had from Belgium.</span> <span id="s983">France was not fighting yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">JF: Alright, there was no problem then?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">BM: No, there was a problem.</span> <span id="s986">The trains were getting short.</span> <span id="s987">Because, remember, it was a Blitzkrieg [flashwar].</span></p> <p><span id="s988">JF: Why were you not planning on going with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">BM: Because I was a Belgian and I had to serve in the land in case they needed me for the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">JF: Okay.</span> <span id="s991">Legally you had to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">BM: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s993">And, I didn't want to break the legality because if I am going to run, then everybody is going to run.</span> <span id="s994">Then there is no country.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">JF: Was there any place for them to go in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">BM: Yes, her sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">JF: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">BM: So, I put them on the train going to Paris, and the trains were already horribly crowded, because the Germans destroyed, right away, transportation and everything else.</span> <span id="s999">I put them on the train and I went back to the hou--to the center of the city to listen what the news are.</span> <span id="s1000">And, as I come back to my house, I was only away one night, in the morning the house was empty.</span> <span id="s1001">In the same house--we were a house of four, five floors - already the neighbors had taken about everything.</span> <span id="s1002">They took the bedding, and they took the linens, they went through the closets.</span> <span id="s1003">And, I just found...</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">JF: Your neighbors had emptied out your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">BM: Sure, all Christians.</span> <span id="s1006">I was one Jew in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">JF: Had you ever experienced any...</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">BM: No, never.</span> <span id="s1009">Never, because we did not expect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">JF: But before with these people you had not experienced any kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">BM: Never.</span> <span id="s1012">"Good morning, good night.</span> <span id="s1013">How are you?"</span> <span id="s1014">that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">JF: Do you think they did it thinking you had left, or do you think they did it because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">BM: [unclear], it was good.</span> <span id="s1017">nobody would punish; no it was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1018">Nobody would punish you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">JF: Before that time there was no expression of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">BM: Of course not.</span> <span id="s1021">Of course not.</span> <span id="s1022">So, when I came back to the house and I just saw from my Bar Mitzvah, a tray with 12 little kiddush barel [kiddush glasses].</span> <span id="s1023">In the commotion, I grabbed them, put them in my pocket and I took an alarm clock, and one coat was left in a suit.</span> <span id="s1024">I had three [unclear].</span> <span id="s1025">So, I grabbed what I get and I run.</span> <span id="s1026">And I went back to my employer and I said to him, "The house is empty."</span> <span id="s1027">Oh yes, one of my neighbors said the Belgian Gestapo came.</span> <span id="s1028">"Leon deGrell's armed men came for you."</span> <span id="s1029">That was the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">JF: The second day after...</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">BM: Yes, the 13th of May.</span> <span id="s1032">They came to look for me, the Gestapo, the Belgian Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">JF: Would you say the Belgian Gestapo...</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">BM: Was the men of Leon deGrell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">JF: Okay, they had been organized before the invasion...</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">BM: Of course.</span> <span id="s1037">of course, they're paramilitary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">JF: But they had had no power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">BM: No, they had no power.</span> <span id="s1040">But, you see, they were helped by the rich, the powerful in Belgium who were afraid of communism and propaganda.</span> <span id="s1041">If you hammer long enough a lie, it becomes the truth.</span> <span id="s1042">So, they were hammered by Hitler that the Jews are the one who own the world, that the Jews, the Jews, the Jews.</span> <span id="s1043">So of course, every [unclear] and every capitalist--Belgium was a wealthy country.</span> <span id="s1044">Belgium is one of the rich countries in the world.</span> <span id="s1045">So after I saw that I went back to my employer.</span> <span id="s1046">And the radio, at that time, said, due to the speedy attack of the land and we are unable to reconstitute our troops here, we all have to go into France, and reconstitute in Montpellier.</span> <span id="s1047">"Go by your own means."</span> <span id="s1048">So otherwise the 13th and 14th I was on the train.</span> <span id="s1049">Come to the train station and my employer had a son about my age and his wife was expecting a baby.</span> <span id="s1050">So he said to me, "Bernard, take my wife, I am staying here."</span> <span id="s1051">I said "Alright," and I took his wife and I pushed her into the train from a window.</span> <span id="s1052">There was no room to go in.</span> <span id="s1053">And I pushed my way to the train, pulled up and swung into the train--there was no room.</span> <span id="s1054">There was just room to be able to stand up.</span> <span id="s1055">Finally, we come to the Belgium-French border.</span> <span id="s1056">All those Belgians born in a foreign land, could not cross over to France.</span> <span id="s1057">And my wife was a Belgian, born in Warsaw, Poland, so they had kept her on the border with the two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">JF: Did you find her there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">BM: And I found her.</span> <span id="s1060">That was the first time the coincidence made it that I found her.</span> <span id="s1061">My little Eliane, the baby, because she just weaned her and she couldn't get the milk, she had water, so at once she became--she had an inflammation of the stomach.</span> <span id="s1062">She had enterite [enteritis] and she was very sick.</span> <span id="s1063">As I came, I start making a lot of noise.</span> <span id="s1064">I am a Belgian, that piece of green paper.</span> <span id="s1065">And, my wife "What's the matter [unclear]?"</span> <span id="s1066">See, then, they would send all those foreign-born Belgians to France, but to another side, not a direct route.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">JF: Your wife was not automatically a Belgian then by marrying you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">BM: Right.</span> <span id="s1069">She was a Belgian by marrying me but she still was born in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">JF: But this didn't make any difference at the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">BM: On the border, no; it's like in America.</span> <span

and my wife's sisters were waiting on the train station, knowing that we would come in that train, or another train, but two of them come.</span> <span id="s1104">They were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1105">My brother-in-law was in the French Army.</span> <span id="s1106">He was from Poland, but, he was a French citizen.</span> <span id="s1107">In France, it was easy to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s1108">And by becoming a soldier, he was, of course, a big citizen.</span> <span id="s1109">And he was there, he was on furlough.</span> <span id="s1110">And we kissed, we

track.</span> <span id="s1116">They had cleaned out and they had put fresh straw and [unclear] stables per family or they would put men together and women together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">JF: And at this point the Germans were glad to get you through France...</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">BM: The Germans were already swallowing Belgium.</span> <span id="s1119">They were not in France yet.</span> <span id="s1120">The Belgians put up a fight; well, this is history already.</span> <span id="s1121">And after we had to eat--we saw my brother-in-law that time, the last time, he was prisoner of war for five years.</span> <span id="s1122">He was on the Line Maginot, and that's it.</span> <span id="s1123">Then after this, my sister-in-law remained in Paris and we wound up in Vichy.</span> <span id="s1124">When we came to Vichy, the French treated us very nobly.</span> <span id="s1125">We were French, there was no question of a Jew or non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1126">[Phone rings.</span> <span id="s1127">Tape off, then on.]</span> <span id="s1128">We were in Vichy and we received a stall for ourselves because we were a family of four.</span></p>

of Vichy in season had 400,000 people.</span> <span id="s1136">Off season, 40,000.</span> <span id="s1137">And Vichy is known for the waters.</span> <span id="s1138">They came from all over the world for their waters.</span> <span id="s1139">And, of course, Belgium and France is like a brother and a sister because we have a lot of affinities and there was always that alliance, French and Belgium.</span> <span id="s1140">They received us royally.</span> <span id="s1141">At that time, that part of France has always been very rich in everything; in farms, and in everything; butter, wine, grain, everything.</span> <span id="s1142">So, they received us very well and we were receiving our three meals a day there.</span> <span id="s1143">And they registered, on the loud speaker, intercom: everyday they would call up being that the population had swelled so much, they would look for a shoemaker, baker or whatever they would look to.</span> <span id="s1144">They never came to me for a job because there was nothing that--then, suddenly, one day, they came out and they said that those who are Jewish should please register so they could get kosher food.</span> <span id="s1145">So, I said to my wife, "You know what this, now we are Christians, now we are Catholic."</span> <span id="s1146">See, I grew up in Belgium where Catholicism is the official religion, with Judaism and Protestantism.</span> <span id="s1147">But I knew much about Catholicism, growing up near the church, in the church practically, with all the boys.</span> <span id="s1148">In the street lived a priest and we were one Jewish family in the whole street.</span> <span id="s1149">So my wife said, "Do you know what you are doing?"</span> <span id="s1150">I said, "I know autrement [otherwise]; I know from fact," I said, "that this is not because of kosher food."</span> <span id="s1151">We were but few Belgium Jews, and I said, "Listen fellas, everybody does what he thinks is necessary."</span> <span id="s1152">See, before leaving Brussels, I went to my father, and I said, "Pa, let's run."</span> <span id="s1153">Before that, I have to go back a little.</span> <span id="s1154">We had a seder in April, was Passover, I think, ya, the end of April was Passover and that Passover precisely I wanted to go on my own.</span> <span id="s1155">Already, I had two children, I want to be my own balabos [my own boss].</span> <span id="s1156">So, my father said, "God knows what's going to be next year, with the rumbling of war and everything else, let's have a seder together."</span> <span id="s1157">I said, "Fine," and we had a seder together.</span> <span id="s1158">At that time I had said to my father, "You know, Pa, when we run, we all run."</span> <span id="s1159">My father said, "No son," he said, "what God will do with all the Jews, he will do with me."</span> <span id="s1160">I said, "Pa, it's not wise," I said, "now."</span> <span id="s1161">I said, "We all have to look," I said, "to save our lives, and running is the thing.</span> <span id="s1162">We cannot remain here and be like sheeps."</span> <span id="s1163">My father said, "You have your family.</span> <span

sister stayed, everybody stayed.</span> <span id="s1168">When they run, was too late.</span> <span id="s1169">I lost 87 people in the family.</span> <span id="s1170">I lost 87 of them.</span> <span

school the parents were taken away--that was my sister Sheva and my brother-in-law Roger.</span> <span id="s1177">When they came back from school, the neighbor said, "Your parents have been taken; quick run away and hide."</span> <span id="s1178">The children were youngsters, they didn't know where to hide, so they run to a neighbor.</span> <span id="s1179">And, the neighbor gave them to somebody else who sent them away to a convent.</span> <span id="s1180">That's where I found them later.</span> <span id="s1181">And my nephew was in the French border, French-Belgian border.</span> <span id="s1182">There, he was hidden in a monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">JF: Did these children know you, or did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">BM: They knew me but when I found them later on, of course, they knew me.</span> <span id="s1185">I'll tell you this later.</span> <span id="s1186">So, yes, we'll come back to, of course.</span> <span id="s1187">So, we remained in Vichy and we became Christians.</span> <span id="s1188">Every other day--I didn't say nothing to Armand, because it was not important.</span> <span id="s1189">I was with all the children and playing around.</span> <span id="s1190">And we would sit with everybody else, and the Jews they would sit on an [unclear].</span> <span id="s1191">It was 15,000 people eating and it was the month of May, June, it was beautiful weather already.</span> <span id="s1192">One day they would call out and say they need a man to work in the dairy plant who knows how to make butter and cheese.</span> <span id="s1193">[That's my mailman.]</span> <span id="s1194">During the war years the instincts say that you should always be near where food is.</span> <span id="s1195">So I went for the butter and cheese job.</span> <span id="s1196">As I came to the butter and cheese place, I said to the man "What is the reason that you need somebody to work here?"</span> <span id="s1197">He said, "Well, the person I have steals a half pound of butter a day, and our population is so big, I need every piece of butter I can get and its money."</span> <span id="s1198">He said to me, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s1199">I said, "I'm from Belgium."</span> <span id="s1200">"How did you learn to make butter and cheese?"</span> <span id="s1201">I said, "My grandparents were in the dairy business."</span> <span id="s1202">Because when you lie, you must lie with knowledge what you lie.</span> <span id="s1203">And I said, "Only thing is you have to show me one time what system you use because we make it differently from the French."</span> <span id="s1204">He said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s1205">And he told me, because he steals, I said, "I will never steal from you."</span> <span id="s1206">And, I never stole, I took.</span> <span id="s1207">Between taking and stealing is a difference.</span> <span id="s1208">When you steal, it's for selling; when you take, it's for your own.</span> <span id="s1209">But he never missed it because I was working very conscientiously.</span> <span id="s1210">I worked there for about three weeks.</span> <span id="s1211">Started 3:30 in the morning, received all the milk down from the mountain, and he had a regular dairy plant.</span> <span id="s1212">I would sterilize, I would sterilize the milk, pasteurize the milk.</span> <span id="s1213">First the milk would come down to me and I would test it.</span> <span id="s1214">What is for human consumption, clean; what has to be treated for butter and cheese.</span> <span id="s1215">There was a certain acid that you turn into the milk, turn the color, and so on.</span> <span id="s1216">And you pour the milk in separators, the sweet cream, the heavy cream, falls in a bucket, and the skim milk falls in big, huge containers.</span> <span id="s1217">In those containers, you put a little bit of rennet--that is made from the lining of stomach from calves, to gel the milk.</span> <span id="s1218">Then you pour it in large milk vats and let it stand all night and molds and you let it ripe, you salt it, put it in shelves, in closets who are closed with special doors where the aeration can come in.</span> <span id="s1219">And you salt the cheeses every day, you turn them over and you make a Saint Chevremont [name of cheese].</span> <span id="s1220">Delicious cheese.</span> <span id="s1221">And I worked there for three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">JF: In the meantime, where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">BM: In the meantime, because we were a family, we had received an attic in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1224">In a beautiful hotel.</span> <span id="s1225">The people were beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">JF: This is still in Vichy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">BM: In Vichy, of course.</span> <span id="s1228">After the third week working there, I received a paper from the French government that they need my skills, to go and work for the war effort.</span> <span id="s1229">And they send me away about 800 kilometers from Vichy, in La Vieille Sèvres.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">JF: In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">BM: La Vieille Sèvres.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">JF: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">BM: V-I-E...</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">JF: Vieille

children were still...</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">BM: Remain there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">JF: In Vichy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">BM: And they would get a stipend, the same thing else a refugee from the Belgian Government.</span> <span id="s1241">See, because the Belgian Government--the Red Cross was looking over us--hey, we were not just like that.</span> <span id="s1242">You know.</span> <span id="s1243">So, they sent me away to Vieille Sèvres.</span> <span id="s1244">It was a tragedy: Armand didn't want to let go and Eliane was a little baby.</span> <span id="s1245">She was only 14 or 15 months old.</span> <span id="s1246">I was sent away.</span> <span id="s1247">I come to a--that was a four hour ride, it took 50 hours.</span> <span id="s1248">The bridges were blown and the trains with soldiers coming back from the fields, and we were going and coming, it was crisscrossing, it was sad.</span> <span id="s1249">And, I left my wife who spoke French like I do speak English, with an accent.</span> <span id="s1250">She was a Polish born Jewish girl and she was of the quiet, timid type.</span> <span id="s1251">Like I was outspoken and I was outgoing, so she was calm.</span> <span id="s1252">She was a balabatish torte [a good housekeeper], they call it, of noble upbringing.</span> <span id="s1253">Like you would say in America, a JAP.</span> <span id="s1254">She was a fine lady.</span> <span id="s1255">And finally I reached my destination.</span> <span id="s1256">In the meantime, I have received a paper and on the paper was said I have been requisitioned by the French government to go into work in that and that company, and the document said in the corner, "Secret."</span> <span id="s1257">Secret document!</span> <span id="s1258">I didn't see anything secret, but, alright, everything was secret at that time.</span> <span id="s1259">Took the train, came into the place, then I came into the city of Niort, who is the capital of La Vieille Sèvres.</span> <span id="s1260">N-I-O-R-T.</span> <span id="s1261">I come into Niort and there was a tremendous amount of refugees.</span> <span id="s1262">They had put up refugee camps and so on.</span> <span id="s1263">So I need a sleeping quarters because I had to go another twenty kilometers out of the city, about fifteen miles.</span> <span id="s1264">So I go to one of the employees there.</span> <span id="s1265">I said, "I am a refugee and I need sleeping quarters."</span> <span id="s1266">"Oh," he said to me, "we have plenty; sleep with all the refugees."</span> <span id="s1267">I don't feel to sleep with 2,000 more refugees, with the pigs and everything else.</span> <span id="s1268">So, I took out the paper from my pocket, and I said, "No, I cannot--Secret."</span> <span id="s1269">"Oh," he said, "we have room for you."</span> <span id="s1270">So, they gave me to sleep; a husband was taken prisoner before so the wife had a little grocery with her daughter.</span> <span id="s1271">So they gave me sleeping quarters there.</span> <span id="s1272">They received me very nice.</span> <span id="s1273">And the house was one of those very, very old houses.</span> <span id="s1274">And all night, in the wall, little mices were running up and down, up and down, you could even--So five in the morning I was up and I had to walk up to go to that tannery where they make chamois skins.</span> <span id="s1275">That is where I was sent.</span> <span id="s1276">So I start walking on the road and here comes a heavy truck.</span> <span id="s1277">I said to the fellow, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1278">He said, "I go to the chamois."</span> <span id="s1279">So he takes me, he gives me a lift.</span> <span id="s1280">I come to the chamois factory, and a whole village of 3,000 people would live from that factory.</span> <span id="s1281">And, why the chamois factory was there?</span> <span id="s1282">Because they have a special water stream running underneath the chamois factory and that water was to tan the skins.</span> <span id="s1283">It was a special quality of the water, that was hundreds of years old.</span> <span id="s1284">You know France is an old country.</span> <span id="s1285">So the employer received me.</span> <span id="s1286">And he said, "Crazy," he said, "the Germans are maybe 100 kilometers away, they send me people."</span> <span id="s1287">I said to him, "Don't blame me," I said, "I have followed orders."</span> <span id="s1288">"No," he said, "I have nothing against you; however," he said, "alright so go upstairs and work with the fellows."</span> <span id="s1289">So I started working with them; they seemed very nice.</span> <span id="s1290">Of course, nobody knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1291">As of then, I never spoke of religion.</span> <span id="s1292">And, after working there for about four weeks...</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Tape 2, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">BM: And I worked there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">JF: You said that you just did not tell anybody that you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">BM: No, that's all.</span> <span id="s1297">When the subject would come up I would keep quiet that's it.</span> <span id="s1298">I would like you to realize this was 40-odd years ago.</span> <span id="s1299">And when 40 years went by I was much younger; in fact, I will show you pictures later.</span> <span id="s1300">I had hair on my head, nothing on the chin.</span> <span id="s1301">I was younger and I was not white.</span> <span id="s1302">I was chatin [auburn] and I was not bad looking, and I could pass for anything you want to.</span> <span id="s1303">I had nothing of the characteristics that the people know that the Jew has to look like.</span> <span id="s1304">So therefore, I could pass very easily.</span> <span id="s1305">With my languages, I was a natural, so that was very easy for me to be what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1306">In the meantime, I have received, from the city, living quarters.</span> <span id="s1307">I had received a slice in the dungeon of a circular room, where they had made like pie slices for refugees who would come.</span> <span id="s1308">And be that I was employed in the factory for the war effort, so saying, they gave me that room.</span> <span id="s1309">Now they know that my wife and children will later on join me, so they gave me two bunches of straw for blankets, an hygienic pail, because there was no facilities, so they give you a pail with a rim on it for the women and children to sit down for physical needs.</span> <span id="s1310">And the men, they go into the fields.</span> <span id="s1311">It's natural.</span> <span id="s1312">And I was given box of candles; there was no light; and two boxes of sugar.</span> <span id="s1313">That's what I received.</span> <span id="s1314">And in the meantime, I was going to work.</span> <span id="s1315">The fellows treated me very nice.</span> <span id="s1316">I was invited every other night to go to another guy's supper and so on.</span> <span id="s1317">And one evening, going back to my sleeping quarters, room or whatever you want to call it, I see a woman on the road, sitting with two suitcases, crying.</span> <span id="s1318">I said, "What's happening?"</span> <span id="s1319">She was a refugee from Paris.</span> <span id="s1320">I said, "Can I help you?"</span> <span id="s1321">She said, "It's the third night," she said, "I sleep outside."</span> <span id="s1322">I don't tell where to sleep; there was no room to pack anymore refugees.</span> <span id="s1323">They run away when the Germans were coming back; they were running from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1324">And I explained to her, I said, "Listen," I said, "I'm waiting for my wife and the children, and I didn't realize that they couldn't make it."</span> <span id="s1325">"But," I said to her, "I'm expecting them every day."</span> <span id="s1326">"If you want to, in all due respect, if you want to split, I'll give you part of the room where I sleep."</span> <span id="s1327">Oh, she thanked me very much and I helped her with the suitcase to come upstairs and she said to me, "Well, don't you think it's odd, a man and a woman in a place?"</span> <span id="s1328">I said, "There is many more men and women in the same circle," I said, "there's nothing--that's your concern."</span> <span id="s1329">"Believe me," I said, "I have no intentions whatsoever, I just want to share, I know what it means to sleep outside."</span> <span id="s1330">She was altogether a teacher from Paris; she was 76 years old.</span> <span id="s1331">She was still afraid to sleep in the room where men were.</span> <span id="s1332">So she accepted and she shared with me.</span> <span id="s1333">I received a letter from Paris, by Anna, first wife, from Vichy, by a miracle; I don't know how it came.</span> <span id="s1334">And in the letter she said she is taking the train and she is coming to join me soon.</span> <span id="s1335">And that's all I heard.</span> <span id="s1336">In the meantime, my sister-in-laws from Paris, they had run away from Paris, because the Germans would go into Paris.</span> <span id="s1337">They didn't run away alone.</span> <span id="s1338">In the court where they lived, was about ten families.</span> <span id="s1339">And one of the people of the ten families was mover and he had a huge van.</span> <span id="s1340">A big van.</span> <span id="s1341">It was a twelve-wheeler.</span> <span id="s1342">He loaded that van with about thirty people, and he moved away with them, away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1343">And he wound up in the town of Saint Liguère, no, in Marie Boussais.</span> <span id="s1344">Saint Liguère is where I worked.</span> <span id="s1345">He wind up in the town of Marie Boussais.</span> <span id="s1346">And I still don't know how she found my address, my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1347">I received a note, we are in Marie Boussais.</span> <span id="s1348">That was only 90 kilometers from where I was.</span> <span id="s1349">That's 60 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">JF: But your wife was staying in the stall...</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">BM: My wife was in Vichy.</span> <span id="s1352">No, my wife was in a little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">JF: Oh, this attic room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">BM: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">JF: In Vichy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">BM: And she was trying to join me.</span> <span id="s1357">As I received that letter, and the Germans were coming closer, my employer had to let me go.</span> <span id="s1358">And, I didn't want to stay, because I didn't want to become a prisoner of war, because the Germans would pick out any man that they would see.</span> <span id="s1359">They would pick them to send them forced labor to Germany.</span> <span id="s1360">They didn't want any men to go around freely, young men.</span> <span id="s1361">So, when they told me I can go, I have a map.</span> <span id="s1362">In fact, I still have the map.</span> <span id="s1363">I'll show it to you later, if you wish.</span> <span id="s1364">And, on the map, I made a plan, how to go back to Paris, to Marie Boussais.</span> <span id="s1365">I want to see my sister-in-laws, only being 60 miles away.</span> <span id="s1366">God knows when we see each other again.</span> <span id="s1367">So I plot my way, and I start walking, that's the only way of communication.</span> <span id="s1368">And I made it, sixty miles in eight days.</span> <span id="s1369">Walking the night and hiding in the day.</span> <span id="s1370">But on the road I had found two other fellows.</span> <span id="s1371">So I was sharing my sugar that I had, and the candles.</span> <span id="s1372">And I gave some to them.</span> <span id="s1373">And they had sardines and butter.</span> <span id="s1374">One had a hunk of bread.</span> <span id="s1375">We stopped in farmhouse at night and we could sleep in a shack.</span> <span id="s1376">The farmer was very cooperative, very helpful.</span> <span id="s1377">I took one of them to Boussais and it was very hot; it was the month of August.</span> <span id="s1378">The heat was murder.</span> <span id="s1379">I wear a heavy coat and I carry the coat on my arm.</span> <span id="s1380">And I walk, and, in my heart, I figure the life of the Jew is always an eternal return.</span> <span id="s1381">My father was running away from the Kishinev pogrom, struggled with his family.</span> <span id="s1382">Now, here I am on the road, my family one way, here I am I'm going to see my sister-in-laws and as I walk, I hear the rumble of a heavy truck.</span> <span id="s1383">And I put myself in a covert, I don't want to be seen.</span> <span id="s1384">And it is a platform truck which stunk.</span> <span id="s1385">So I stand in the middle of the road, stopped the guy, and he takes me on his truck, and he said, "You know what?"</span> <span id="s1386">He said, "The Germans are on both sides.</span> <span id="s1387">So when we pass, when we come there," he said, "lay down low."</span> <span id="s1388">But, my curiosity made me not lay down low; I had to look.</span> <span id="s1389">There was SS men running around naked in a stream of water in the ideal bathing, beautiful bodies.</span> <span id="s1390">All naked.</span> <span id="s1391">A huge amount of them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1392">Then I lay down and I figure, my God, look where I am going, in Marie Boussais, thinking I'm running away from them.</span> <span id="s1393">As I come into the town of Marie Boussais, by accident, my nephew was there on the street.</span> <span id="s1394">David.</span> <span id="s1395">"Uncle Bernard," and he ran into my arms.</span> <span id="s1396">And, I asked, "Where is Mama?"</span> <span id="s1397">And he told me, "Mama," he said, "est en grande queue [in a great line].</span> <span id="s1398">[unclear] with all those people, and the farmers are pigs; they exploit them just for sleeping in the stables, and a little bit of food, and everybody is working."</span> <span id="s1399">And, my sister-in-law was a seamstress, and the other one was a fine housewife.</span> <span id="s1400">So, everybody was working to the bone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">JF: In a pig farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">BM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1403">Because nobody speaks French with French accent.</span> <span id="s1404">They all speak French like Jew who speaks that is not born in France.</span> <span id="s1405">And David was then 14-15 years old.</span> <span id="s1406">And Albert his colleague, the son of the owner of the big truck, he was the driver, the sixteen year old boy, Albert.</span> <span id="s1407">I come in and Mr. Sonder, "Ah, Mr. Mednicki."</span> <span id="s1408">He knows me from traveling to visit my in-laws in the olden days and we spoke Yiddish, he said, "We fell in," he said, "we are afraid to speak, we dealing with antisemiten.</span> <span id="s1409">They found out that we are Jews and they are exploiting it; we have to beg for everything."</span> <span id="s1410">I said, "Fine, that's the end of it."</span> <span id="s1411">I come in and I said to my sister-in-law, to my two sister-in-laws, "That's enough; pack deine Sachen, pack your stuff."</span> <span id="s1412">And I go to the farm and I said, "No beef from you," I said.</span> <span id="s1413">And I had an angry look.</span> <span id="s1414">I said, "No beef from you," I said, "you exploited for the rest of them; I'm going to fix you."</span> <span id="s1415">I don't know; I was speaking through my head.</span> <span id="s1416">He said, "Here, take them."</span> <span id="s1417">And we loaded the truck.</span> <span id="s1418">And the outside wheels were good ones, the inside were flat, there was no tires.</span> <span id="s1419">So mind you, we are thirty people, elderly, 78-80 year old people, young mothers with babies, and a..</span> <span id="s1420">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">JF: How many people are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">BM: 30.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1426">BM: The whole group.</span> <span id="s1427">It's the old people living in one court.</span> <span id="s1428">They lived in Montmartre, and my sister-in-laws were right there and my nephew was in there.</span> <span id="s1429">So everybody was settled.</span> <span id="s1430">So I came to them and I said, "Listen," of course I speak in Yiddish now and I said, "for the safety of everybody, when the children are ready to cry, you must pacify them.</span> <span id="s1431">Those who get the breast, feed them.</span> <span id="s1432">Even if the breast is always in their mouth.</span> <span id="s1433">Those who have little babies, give them the bottle, but no squeaks because we don't know where we are going to go through."</span> <span id="s1434">In fact, I was right.</span> <span id="s1435">We had to go through the most populated Nazi region, in view to go back to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">JF: The truck that you were in...</span></p> <p><span

id="s1449">And huge trucks of--and then--the farmers with eight horses and a big wagon.</span> <span id="s1450">On that wagon was six households.</span> <span id="s1451">And that's all you saw on the road.</span> <span id="s1452">So Albert was the driver, a sixteen-year old kid, and he was scared stiff.</span> <span id="s1453">And it was up and down the mountains.</span> <span id="s1454">So I stood on the step, on this side, and I said, "Look, I'll tell you when to close the..." We had no gasoline.</span> <span id="s1455">I said, "I'll tell you when to close and go in speed."</span> <span id="s1456">Because when we went down the mountain you could go just on the speed and I had a piece of wood, and when we would come on the bottom of the mountain, I would put a piece of wood underneath the wheel.</span> <span id="s1457">See, that was a--don't ask--it was a very risky thing between no alternative, we had precious cargo in the back.</span> <span id="s1458">And he became scared and frightened.</span> <span id="s1459">In my pocket I had the top of a bottle, from porcelain.</span> <span id="s1460">You know those French bottles that you open, beer bottles, soda bottles.</span> <span id="s1461">I think and I said, "Albert, you know this?"</span> <span id="s1462">"Attach it," I said, "to the volent [steering wheel], to the wheel."</span> <span id="s1463">"This," I said, "is a talisman; it will carry you over anywheres.</span> <span id="s1464">When you feel that you get weak, hold it in your hand, like a rabbit's foot; you will have the courage to do everything."</span> <span id="s1465">That kid was driving and my heart was pounding.</span> <span id="s1466">We had no gasoline, we had no wheels, and we came into the town of Saumur.</span> <span id="s1467">Saumur is a big military school.</span> <span id="s1468">In French, one of the schools of cavalry.</span> <span id="s1469">And there is a lack for gasoline, from here to Camden, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1470">Park the car and I let them go off the truck and I said, "Disseminate, go two and three together but go different ways and come back in a couple of hours."</span> <span id="s1471">So that we can aerate the truck and clean up.</span> <span id="s1472">Diapers and everything else.</span> <span id="s1473">Was no disposables then.</span> <span id="s1474">They had old shirts and whatever shmattes [rags] they could find.</span> <span id="s1475">As we snoop around I come to the gasoline station and I see Belgian SS men, from Leon de Grell, with the Belgian emblem.</span> <span id="s1476">Oh, I come to them and I--"Sieg Heil--I am a good brother, I am from Brussels.</span> <span id="s1477">So what are you doing here," I said, "when the Fuhrer will us allow to come back.</span> <span id="s1478">See, I was sent away," I said, "to work for the French," I said, "but I am going back to Vichy to pick up my wife and kids and go back to Belgium, when the Fuhrer allows us to go back.</span> <span id="s1479">You are a good citizen, you are a good Belgian."</span> <span id="s1480">"Sure," I mean I spoke slang, Flemish slang.</span> <span id="s1481">And, to speak Flemish slang you must be a regular guy.</span> <span id="s1482">It's like, do you speak the [unclear]?</span> <span id="s1483">No, you cannot speak like KNL.</span> <span id="s1484">That's the language I spoke, KNL.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">JF: They didn't check inside the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">BM: The truck was empty because all the people were going away.</span> <span id="s1487">I had them all disseminated.</span> <span id="s1488">I gave them three hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">JF: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">BM: Couldn't afford to leave.</span> <span id="s1491">David was sitting in the truck with Albert, because you don't leave a truck alone.</span> <span id="s1492">And Mr. Sonder and I were working.</span> <span id="s1493">And Sonder said not a word because his French is like my English now.</span> <span id="s1494">You understand me, but there is a terrible accent, and that's, of course--if you would be here, I would say this is Pennsylvania Dutch.</span> <span id="s1495">So I said to the guy about gasoline.</span> <span id="s1496">He said, "Don't buy it now because we mix with a lot of water."</span> <span id="s1497">He said, "Now we trying to make money, but come tomorrow morning at 4 o'clock, we will have fresh gasoline and we will be here, and we will give you.</span> <span id="s1498">After all, you are a blood brother, you are a compatriote, and we treat you well."</span> <span id="s1499">Fine.</span> <span id="s1500">In the meantime, the people in the line, they, if they could have shot me with their eyes, they would have done it.</span> <span id="s1501">I speak to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1502">And my heart was beating; you have no idea, because I was playing with fire.</span> <span id="s1503">See, the Nazis were very suspicious.</span> <span id="s1504">But, if you had the guts, and mazel [luck], that little bit of mazel.</span> <span id="s1505">I was so lucky, all through the war, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1506">And so, we go away, everybody comes back to the truck and I said, "Now we going to look for food."</span> <span id="s1507">And you cannot discern me from a Frenchman; I wear a beret and I look like them and I behave like them and I slouch like them and I speak like them.</span> <span id="s1508">And I pick the accent very fast from wherever I am.</span> <span id="s1509">When I am in Marseilles, I speak with an accent meridional; when I am in the North, I speak with the heavy accent, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1510">And I see people going to a café.</span> <span id="s1511">Little door, one by one coming out with bundles and so on.</span> <span id="s1512">I go into the café and there's tables loaded with bread and butter.</span> <span id="s1513">I mean bread and butter.</span> <span id="s1514">And they drink coffee and they have omelets and everything else.</span> <span id="s1515">So I sit down on the table and the waitress comes to me.</span> <span id="s1516">And I said, "How much do you want?"</span> <span id="s1517">She looks at me; she says, "You stranger."</span> <span id="s1518">I said, "No, I'm from the old village."</span> <span id="s1519">"Oh," she said, "okay, but don't want anybody to know other places; they are just for us, we don't want to feed the refugees."</span> <span id="s1520">I said, "That's fine with me.</span> <span id="s1521">I said maybe you feed me, but can I take some."</span> <span id="s1522">She said, "You buy what you want, you pay me, that's all."</span> <span id="s1523">So, I sat down, I ate myself nice and round and I bought a bundle of bread, you know the flutes [slim long fresh bread], and she gave me a hunk of butter and I had money by me, I had received from the place.</span> <span id="s1524">I go out.</span> <span id="s1525">Then I sent David and Albert in and they ate and they brought out bread and butter.</span> <span id="s1526">And one after the other, those that I deemed necessary, no, those that I saw could blend without the characteristics that the French know that they had to look for.</span> <span id="s1527">So we were able to feed everybody.</span> <span id="s1528">But for the night, there was announcements that there is sleeping quarters for refugees in the big castle.</span> <span id="s1529">We don't want anybody to sleep in cars, in trucks and on the street.</span> <span id="s1530">They don't want the Germans.</span> <span id="s1531">So I said to my two sister-in-laws, you know what I said, two old ladies I don't want to go upstairs sleeping.</span> <span id="s1532">The mothers with the babies, they can go upstairs.</span> <span id="s1533">[Aside to interviewer] And my sister-in-laws took those young women and children and very slowly went up to that castle where to sleep.</span> <span id="s1534">It was an old castle, round rooms, you know, straw on the floor, and they were there in the morning; about 5 o'clock, everybody was back.</span> <span id="s1535">Because it was not so much the sleeping, them to get out from the car.</span> <span id="s1536">I kept two old ladies in the car, and of course, my nephew, my boy, Mr. Sonder and I. Three thirty in the morning, Mr. Sonder and I would go with big pitchers, five-gallon, for gasoline.</span> <span id="s1537">And there is a line.</span> <span id="s1538">We make believe we don't see the line.</span> <span id="s1539">My heart breaks, but I cannot help it.</span> <span id="s1540">This is pikuach nefesh [for the sake of saving life] and I have to save my truck.</span> <span id="s1541">I come to the front and I see the guys and from the line came out, "Traitor!"</span> <span id="s1542">"Nazi!"</span> <span id="s1543">"Boche," "Vendu" [sold to the enemy].</span> <span id="s1544">But, I don't see, and I told Sonder, I said, "Don't you ever look on the left side; if you look, you are finished, keep going."</span> <span id="s1545">We come and the guy fills me my two pitchers.</span> <span id="s1546">And he said, "The best bet for you, when you come to Paris, go to the Kommandatur and tell him; they will send you home and they will bring your wife and children later."</span> <span id="s1547">I said, "I'll do that.</span> <span id="s1548">Good idea," I said, "because the Fuhrer can use me in Belgium, I can work for the government."</span> <span id="s1549">When I was a youngster, I belonged to an acting group.</span> <span id="s1550">And when you are an actor, you know what to do.</span> <span id="s1551">And I was a natural.</span> <span id="s1552">So we take the truck, we load it, and we are on the road.</span> <span id="s1553">Now, we have to cross a river; la Loire, and on the Loire, the bridges were blown.</span> <span id="s1554">So the Germans had made pontoons and the pontoons are just wide enough for our truck to go by with about six inches on each side.</span> <span id="s1555">And I go to Albert, and I said, "Albert, listen, I'll stay in the back.</span> <span id="s1556">I want you to ride and look in your mirror, watch my signal.</span> <span id="s1557">You make one move and it is goodbye for all of us.</span> <span id="s1558">So, remember, hold that Jig-jig in your hand, in one hand, that bottle cap, that will give you the strength."</span> <span id="s1559">And he rides, and I am in the back, and I control him, and my heart fills up and that pontoon waves.</span> <span id="s1560">And here was that big truck.</span> <span id="s1561">Finally, I am already on the other side and we have to climb up and it's a sharp thing.</span> <span id="s1562">And I see that he is going to go down and coming back at me and I pushed the truck like I would be friends with the giver.</span> <span id="s1563">And the Nazis standing on that thing, they start laughing: that dummer Franzose.</span> <span id="s1564">That stupid Frenchman, look what he is doing.</span> <span id="s1565">Finally, he had the grip on the edge and he pulled themselves up.</span> <span id="s1566">That is where I turned white and bold.</span> <span id="s1567">That's where if I don't die, it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1568">We came up into Saumur.</span> <span id="s1569">Now we are not far from Paris.</span> <span id="s1570">Now to go into Paris, you know there is all kind of Portes, Porte de Clignancourt, Porte Saint Jean, Porte Saint Denis [areas on entry to Paris].</span> <span id="s1571">The Germans had forbidden anybody to come into Paris.</span> <span id="s1572">They wanted a closed city.</span> <span id="s1573">They want to know who is left, and who is not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">JF: This was about what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">BM: It must have been August, September.</span> <span id="s1576">Yea, around there.</span> <span id="s1577">Was still very warm.</span> <span id="s1578">Mr. Sonder, being a mover, he knows little ins and out.</span> <span id="s1579">And we came into Paris.</span> <span id="s1580">We come into Paris, we go back to the same place where they lived.</span> <span id="s1581">Everybody goes into their home; nothing has happened.</span> <span id="s1582">But I don't want to stay.</span> <span id="s1583">So he gives me a lift to the east station and I take a train to go to Vichy.</span> <span id="s1584">And I want to buy a ticket.</span> <span id="s1585">There is no train going to Vichy.</span> <span id="s1586">Nobody goes to Vichy: it became the zone non-occupée, unoccupied zone.</span> <span id="s1587">So, until, where do you go; they go to Orléans.</span> <span id="s1588">[Mr. Mednicki asks Ms. Fisher to hold a map so she can follow him.]</span> <span id="s1589">Well, I just wanted you to see where I went.</span> <span id="s1590">See what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">JF: When you got to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">BM: So when I came into Paris, from Paris I went into the train station and went to Orléans.</span> <span id="s1593">From Orléans I had to wait, and in the evening, with a group of men, we jumped in open wagons, when the train start moving.</span> <span id="s1594">We pulled the door closed and we start riding.</span> <span id="s1595">And we took the train and went all the way to Bourges.</span> <span id="s1596">And in Bourges was a--the demarcation.</span> <span id="s1597">We couldn't go any further, because the French would check the trains to see what comes in.</span> <span id="s1598">So we jumped off the trains and slowly we slide on because there was German guard on this side and French on the other side.</span> <span id="s1599">So we go down and there was always a farmer on order, helping passing the people because there was the width of the [unclear] river.</span> <span id="s1600">On some spots you could walk and some spots was lots of water.</span> <span id="s1601">It was in September, you know, August, September.</span> <span id="s1602">So we disrobed, made a bundle of the clothing and put it around our necks which is better than the belt and we waddled through the water--we swam part of it.</span> <span id="s1603">We come to the other side.</span> <span id="s1604">There is French people who help you already.</span> <span id="s1605">And there was a French flag floating and the motion, the tears running, and they are embracing and everything else.</span> <span id="s1606">And then, there were trains going already, radiating all over France.</span> <span id="s1607">So I took a train and went to Vichy.</span> <span id="s1608">As I come into Vichy, I had already--I wasn't shaved for a few days.</span> <span id="s1609">Took me 19 days altogether, that was walking, and crawling.</span> <span id="s1610">And one night we were so hungry we were during the day in a shack with a herd of goats.</span> <span id="s1611">They were keeping them inside because if the German sees them, they steal them, you know.</span> <span id="s1612">We were so hungry and we took goats and we washed the udder with a little milk, and then we took the udder, and we just drank from the udder.</span> <span id="s1613">The taste of it was horrible, but in the meantime, we had full stomachs of milk.</span> <span id="s1614">And, we survived like that.</span> <span id="s1615">Going to Vichy, I got a few francs with me.</span> <span id="s1616">And the farmers couldn't sell their stuff because the traffic was disrupted, so peaches and tomatoes were very inexpensive.</span> <span id="s1617">And this is my nature; I am a food buyer.</span> <span id="s1618">So I am going to the wife and children so I will buy a basket of one and a basket of the other.</span> <span id="s1619">And I am so happy, I'm going to the hotel.</span> <span id="s1620">As I come just in front of the hotel, Source de l'Hôpital was the name of the hotel.</span> <span id="s1621">The people on the street, in the tears from the newspaper, the vendor knew me, they call me Le Belge [the Belgian].</span> <span id="s1622">I was always different than anybody else.</span> <span id="s1623">I have a little moustache, and I was always the friendly type, I was always the speaking type.</span> <span id="s1624">And, he sees me come, he says, "Belge, where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1625">I said, "What do you mean, where am I going?</span> <span id="s1626">I am going to pick up my wife and children."</span> <span id="s1627">"My poor friend," he said, "your wife went to join you."</span> <span id="s1628">I said, "What do you mean, join me?"</span> <span id="s1629">He said, "Sure, she went to Niort, [unclear]."</span> <span id="s1630">Ah, when I heard that, I dropped my peaches and I fell on the floor.</span> <span id="s1631">I was just--so, they brought me back, took me to the hotel, and the lady said, "Your wife is in Riom."</span> <span id="s1632">But, Riom, you know in the confusion, I said, "How did she make that long trip?"</span> <span id="s1633">She said, "No, she is only 90 kilometers from here, 60 miles."</span> <span id="s1634">"Oh," I said, "thank God; how could I go?"</span> <span id="s1635">She said, "Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1636">When your wife left with Armand and Eliane, she had a little suitcase, and I had given her plenty food for the baby, and plenty food for the road."</span> <span id="s1637">She was a nice gentile person but they knew we were Christians, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">JF: They thought you were Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">BM: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1640">The word Jew never came into our mouth.</span> <span id="s1641">First of all, they never spoke of it.</span> <span id="s1642">And because they never spoke, we never mentioned it.</span> <span id="s1643">Remember the old proverb, "Don't steal the nest."</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">JF: What about your name?</span> <span id="s1645">Your last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">BM: It doesn't mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">JF: It had no connotation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">BM: Mednicki means nothing.</span> <span id="s1649">It will be any kind of Woesburg, Bernstein, Silverberg, Cohen, Levy, maybe.</span> <span id="s1650">My wife's name was Anna.</span> <span id="s1651">In her passport it was written Chana Leah.</span> <span id="s1652">But in France, where we moved later on--I am jumping the gun, but that doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1653">In the village where we lived in Valvic, where most of my story happened to be.</span> <span id="s1654">This is only preliminary, coming to the real stuff.</span> <span id="s1655">In the village of Valvic was a forest called Les Bois de Chana [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1656">And, it was hard to spell it.</span> <span id="s1657">Was Shana; spelled like Chana.</span> <span id="s1658">There was villages, you have seen Montluçon, Saillah-Lajin [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1659">The name Leah [pronounced Lailla] was spelled Lajin.</span> <span id="s1660">So Chana Leah, to them, was not unfamiliar, Chana Lajin.</span> <span id="s1661">So, and she had the personality of the people who lived there, [tapes stops and starts] so therefore she was very fortunate in that respect.</span> <span id="s1662">And the children were children.</span> <span id="s1663">So, when I start looking for her, and they told me that she is in the city of Riom--a train was bombed in Gannat and the Red Cross took the people to the nearest city, that was Riom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">JF: The train that she was on was bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">BM: Yes, the train she was on was bombed.</span> <span id="s1666">She was on the train to go to join me to Niort but the train was bombed, so they took down the people.</span> <span id="s1667">At that time, Armand took a wrong suitcase, dropped everything, they were completely destitute.</span> <span id="s1668">They had nothing left.</span> <span id="s1669">They were taken in by an attorney's wife, very kind person, who gave them hospitality.</span> <span id="s1670">The lady from the hotel, who told me that she is in Riom, said, "Your wife is in good hands; she is with a lawyer; takes good care and don't worry; your son, everybody is well."</span> <span id="s1671">To travel, at that time, you needed a special permit because the government from Paris was all in Clermont-Ferrand, in Vichy.</span> <span id="s1672">And they traded on all the buses passes.</span> <span id="s1673">In order to get a permit, you needed time, so I had no permit.</span> <span id="s1674">And, you can understand, I was dilapidated.</span> <span id="s1675">Dirty from the trip, from those long days traveling, [unclear] I was indecent and it was very hot.</span> <span id="s1676">So, I stood--I go to the bus station and I look at the people there and I said, "Listen."</span> <span id="s1677">And, I explained to them my case.</span> <span id="s1678">All people well dressed, all Fonctionnaires [government employees] from the government, and I explained: my wife, children--am away for months.</span> <span id="s1679">And they all had pity and they squeezed together and gave me a room.</span> <span id="s1680">I come into the city of Riom, go to the house of the lady and a maid lets me in.</span> <span id="s1681">She said, "The lady wants to speak to you."</span> <span id="s1682">I come in, she received me very gracefully and she said, "Mr. Mednicki, when the train was bombed, your wife was alone and we gave her the guest room and we had a little carriage for the baby, and your son was taken care; he wasn't well.</span> <span id="s1683">But, then refugees came a lot.</span> <span id="s1684">We had about 600, so we had to clean out the stables in the back of the house.</span> <span id="s1685">They are big stables and they cleaned it out and made cots and they gave us [unclear] 500 women, 700 children; and I couldn't make a difference so your wife is there with the children."</span> <span id="s1686">But she said, "Your wife knows, we told her, the lady from the hotel called me that you are coming, and your wife is waiting for you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">JF: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1688">At this time, it is still assumed that your wife and children are Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">BM: Oh, all the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">JF: All the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">BM: All the way.</span> <span id="s1692">That's it.</span> <span id="s1693">That's all.</span> <span id="s1694">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1695">That's it, all the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">JF: You just knew that it would have been dangerous to have identified yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">BM: Of course.</span> <span id="s1698">You see, when in a situation where there is license to kill and to rob, people are looking out for that.</span> <span id="s1699">Not every individual can make the judgment, it's wrong or right.</span> <span id="s1700">And I knew that, from the experience of Austria and Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s1701">And I thought it was the wise thing to do.</span> <span id="s1702">Although it was not in my best wishes, but that was pikuach nefesh [for the sake of saving life], to save my life we have to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">JF: And you never had official papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">BM: Nobody.</span> <span id="s1705">No, I was very lucky that in the beginning, I had my head on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1706">Of course, at somebody, but we will come to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">JF: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">BM: So, I go and look for my wife.</span> <span id="s1709">As I come into the yard, children, women, sanitary conditions, épouvantable, awful.</span> <span id="s1710">It is September, the heat is fantastic.</span> <span id="s1711">I come and look for my wife, and all the women jump on me.</span> <span id="s1712">Man.</span> <span id="s1713">All the men were arrested or were in jail, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1714">And all the questioning: "Did you see that one, that one?"</span> <span id="s1715">I saw nobody, "Where is my wife?"</span> <span id="s1716">"Your wife went to the train station."</span> <span id="s1717">I came by bus.</span> <span id="s1718">The train station was just across the street.</span> <span id="s1719">As I turn around and go on, I see my wife with Armand and Eliane in her arms.</span> <span id="s1720">Armand saw me and gave a scream, "Papa."</span> <span id="s1721">And he run to me in my arms.</span> <span id="s1722">"Please," he said, "don't go away ever."</span> <span id="s1723">He was sick when I left because we were very close, one to the other.</span> <span id="s1724">Eliane was a baby that did not walk when I left, but now she is already walking, you know, like a baby, like a little duck, wobbling.</span> <span id="s1725">Armand runs to me, grabs me with kiss and hug.</span> <span id="s1726">And the little one runs and falls, her mother picks her up, comes to me.</span> <span id="s1727">We are a family again.</span> <span id="s1728">So the lady from this house had a small little shack where she kept a little donkey.</span> <span id="s1729">So she cleaned it out and made it for me special; I had my own shack.</span> <span id="s1730">The refugees in the village--in the town of Riom there were about 1,500.</span> <span id="s1731">1,000 were eating at the hospital.</span> <span id="s1732">Three times a day they had to feed the refugees, they were nothing, destitute, because there was big poverty.</span> <span id="s1733">And I said to my wife, "Where do we eat?"</span> <span id="s1734">She said, "Well, we are fed at the hospital, breakfast, lunch and supper.</span> <span id="s1735">And I didn't want to go to the Red Cross here because I was hoping to see you."</span> <span id="s1736">I said, "Fine on me, that is the second time we found each other."</span> <span id="s1737">"That means you must have mazel [good luck], that's what counts."</span> <span id="s1738">Tape 3, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">BM: We go up to the city of Riom to meet the Belgian representative from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1740">I was entitled to get some help from my compatriot.</span> <span id="s1741">As we came, there was a young man by the name of Robert Duhin, a Frenchman born in Brussels, very sympathetic, extremely magnetic.</span> <span id="s1742">And Eliane was a beautiful little child, and a child is always a bridge to a lot of sympathy, understanding.</span> <span id="s1743">It can open doors, and so on.</span> <span id="s1744">And, Armand, was a cute little boy.</span> <span id="s1745">One day I will show you pictures.</span> <span id="s1746">So he put me down on the rolls and we spoke.</span> <span id="s1747">We spoke of Brussels, he was from Mixelles, I was from [unclear], and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1748">We became buddy-buddy.</span> <span id="s1749">In the meantime, we went to the hospital to eat.</span> <span id="s1750">Riom was always a city of lawyers and great orators.</span> <span id="s1751">We became acquainted with the director in charge of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1752">And after I eat my supper there, I asked him for a job.</span> <span id="s1753">He told me that I could work, if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s1754">They needed a dishwasher.</span> <span id="s1755">If, I know what to do.</span> <span id="s1756">I said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s1757">I know how to work.</span> <span id="s1758">It was long hours with not much money, but the food I received compensated, at that time.</span> <span id="s1759">For lack of many things, job of this quality was to take the food through the nuns.</span> <span id="s1760">I was working, washing dishes, for 15-1000 people a day--metal plates.</span> <span id="s1761">I started in the morning at four o'clock.</span> <span id="s1762">Then, the cook was already cooking for about two hours.</span> <span id="s1763">We had big copper pots, those old-time copper pots.</span> <span id="s1764">The hospital in Riom is a hospital built at about, I would say, about 600 years ago from lava, black lava from Volvic and beds are alcoved come into the lava.</span> <span id="s1765">That's old.</span> <span id="s1766">The refugees were fed in the corridors from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1767">In the kitchen they would prepare for breakfast, the food for the hospital.</span> <span id="s1768">No, first for the nuns, the best food was for the nuns, the second food was for the hospital, and third for the clinic, the fourth was for the maternity, and then the food for the refugees.</span> <span id="s1769">For refugees, they would make coffee from the fifth pouring of water over the same grind.</span> <span id="s1770">They gave refugees stale bread, they shouldn't eat too much.</span> <span id="s1771">They gave them butter with margarine, mixed together, although they had butter.</span> <span id="s1772">And it was rationed.</span> <span id="s1773">I came for supper and they had string beans cooked with sheeps heads and sheep legs and tripe.</span> <span id="s1774">It's food.</span> <span id="s1775">My son cannot eat it, my wife cannot eat it.</span> <span id="s1776">They eat the dry piece of bread and they drink a glass of wine.</span> <span id="s1777">I eat everything.</span> <span id="s1778">I am a big eater and I eat everything.</span> <span id="s1779">My son wants another piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1780">I asked the Reverend Mother.</span> <span id="s1781">She said, "No, my son, tomorrow is another day."</span> <span id="s1782">"Thank you, sister."</span> <span id="s1783">Before going out I go to the guy from the hospital, the Monsieur Jean, a little guy, and I said, "I need work."</span> <span id="s1784">Dishwashing, fine.</span> <span id="s1785">He gave me there a little salary, but it was for me just a question of being near the kitchen to be able to feed my family.</span> <span id="s1786">I came to work the following day four o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1787">And in the kitchen was a young chap, about 23 years old, 24, and he was from the southern part of France, very garrulous very alive--outspoken.</span> <span id="s1788">Received me with very big friendship and he was a communist.</span> <span id="s1789">And there was a big crucifix hanging in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1790">He said, "Let's bomb Jesus Christ!"</span> <span id="s1791">Here I come, I want to work, I have problems, and he is going to bomb Jesus Christ, and he is a young chap, 23, 24.</span> <span id="s1792">He had nothing to worry, he doesn't have to serve, because he's a cook for hospital.</span> <span id="s1793">He start throwing eggs on the Jesus Christ.</span> <span id="s1794">I said, "Throw my way, I'm hungry, could you feed me?"</span> <span id="s1795">"Sure," he said, "what do you want?"</span> <span id="s1796">"Make me an omelet from twelve eggs."</span> <span id="s1797">And he made me a steak, a big one; that's four in the morning; and a bunch of french fried potatoes, a bottle of milk, a bottle of wine, a hunk of bread, and I polished everything off.</span> <span id="s1798">Ya.</span> <span id="s1799">He said to me, "Bernard, if you can work the way you eat," he said, "you are going to help me tremendously."</span> <span id="s1800">Well, I start washing dishes.</span> <span id="s1801">He fed me well, but I worked.</span> <span id="s1802">My job was to feed, from the kitchen, where he cooked.</span> <span id="s1803">Where I washed the pots and pans, on the other side, was a door giving to the dining room for the nuns.</span> <span id="s1804">And a nun would take the pots of food what I would give.</span> <span id="s1805">And between there and there, I took enough down to feed my family delicious food, no tripe, legs and heads.</span> <span id="s1806">And we had to do everything with sechel [good sense], it shouldn't show.</span> <span id="s1807">Now, my son Armand came to see me, and Armand was only six years old.</span> <span id="s1808">So I would get from the cook, sugar in a handkerchief and I would attach it to Armand's suspenders and put it in his pants like a big package in the pants.</span> <span id="s1809">I said, "Armand, you don't talk."</span> <span id="s1810">"Papa, I don't talk."</span> <span id="s1811">Armand didn't know anything that we were Jews or Catholics because it was too soon for him.</span> <span id="s1812">He did not start Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1813">And he was not involved.</span> <span id="s1814">We spoke Yiddish, but, here they show us like Flemish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">JF: So he was not told that he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">BM: Armand was not--not yet, if you'll wait, I'll come to that too.</span> <span id="s1817">And I worked there for a while but to sleep in that stable was horrible.</span> <span id="s1818">The rats were so big I had to fight the rats the whole night, they shouldn't nibble on the children.</span> <span id="s1819">There was a lady in the hospital who had a house in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1820">Now, the mountain is just there.</span> <span id="s1821">A huge mountain, it's an extinct volcano, it's called the mountain of Volvic.</span> <span id="s1822">And just there you can touch it six miles.</span> <span id="s1823">So she said to me one day, she said, "You know, le Belge, I could rent you a room for very little, just that you should live like a human being, with your wife and the children."</span> <span id="s1824">I know my wife must love her, she is a beautiful person.</span> <span id="s1825">Quiet, don't speak too much.</span> <span id="s1826">But from appeal, she knows she is attractive.</span> <span id="s1827">And the children were beautiful little children.</span> <span id="s1828">She said, "And I can give you the room, you pay me what you want."</span> <span id="s1829">I said, "I'd like to see it."</span> <span id="s1830">She said, "So go up."</span> <span id="s1831">And going up to me was--I thought it was a walk from an hour; it takes two hours to go up, and it's all up the mountain.</span> <span id="s1832">But I was a good walker.</span> <span id="s1833">I never drove or rode or anything else but walk.</span> <span id="s1834">I came to the room.</span> <span id="s1835">And in the mountains, the mountaineers are very hard people.</span> <span id="s1836">They live a hard life.</span> <span id="s1837">They are hard for everybody, for themselves, and they don't give you friendship.</span> <span id="s1838">They are just civil enough to say "Hi" to you, period.</span> <span id="s1839">And she tells me "That room there."</span> <span id="s1840">The room is beautiful.</span> <span id="s1841">It is square; there is a spring-box on the floor, one table, two chairs, a stove.</span> <span id="s1842">And the stove has a bucket full of water, to make it; when the stove cooks you have heat.</span> <span id="s1843">There is no other way to cook but this stove.</span> <span id="s1844">There is plenty wood around.</span> <span id="s1845">And we have near, a non-operating railroad, who has stopped operating because the quarry are using other transportations.</span> <span id="s1846">So I had just the sun in front of me in the mountains, beautiful!</span> <span id="s1847">On the right, I have a room for the children, downstairs lives a man who works in the quarries during the day.</span> <span id="s1848">At night he is a poacher.</span> <span id="s1849">There is a lot of poaching to do there, deer, rabbit and pheasant.</span> <span id="s1850">And he was around poaching.</span> <span id="s1851">But that don't bother me.</span> <span id="s1852">There is no facilities.</span> <span id="s1853">There is an hygienic pail.</span> <span id="s1854">When the pail is full with human waste, you go to the fields and it is fertilizer.</span> <span id="s1855">The men don't use that, the men go into the field, period.</span> <span id="s1856">Very primitive.</span> <span id="s1857">There is one shower in the village and it's never used because you don't need it.</span> <span id="s1858">Once a year you went to the vat to crush the wine anyway.</span> <span id="s1859">So it's not necessary.</span> <span id="s1860">And we decided we move up there.</span> <span id="s1861">As we are ready to move up there, Armand gets a fever.</span> <span id="s1862">In the meantime, that fellow, that French-man, Robert Durain [phonetic], I will call him, as of now, Captain Durain because he was my Captain.</span> <span id="s1863">As of now, Robert Durain said to me, "Bernard, we stay in touch."</span> <span id="s1864">And he had brought toys for Eliane and Armand.</span> <span id="s1865">As we leave for the mountains, the French Red Cross help me to go up with the children and we received a few blankets and a few little things.</span> <span id="s1866">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s1867">We come into the room and that night Armand had a very high fever.</span> <span id="s1868">Well, he has a high fever--I heard of a sanitarium behind the mountains.</span> <span id="s1869">I know that I took him out from a sanitarium because he had a spot on his lungs.</span> <span id="s1870">All the tests were negative.</span> <span id="s1871">He had not tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1872">And his fever was so high that he starts speaking in his fever.</span> <span id="s1873">I was scared, so I took him and I walked up five kilometers [about 3 3/4 miles] into the mountains with him to that sanitarium.</span> <span id="s1874">I came there about 5:30 in the morning and there was a guard at the door and he let me in.</span> <span id="s1875">I said, "I have a sick boy in my arms."</span> <span id="s1876">"I must speak to the doctor," I said, "tell him that we are Belgian refugees."</span> <span id="s1877">When he heard you are Belgian refugees, he made a phone call.</span> <span id="s1878">He said, "You can go in."</span> <span id="s1879">I go in and there was a lady doctor.</span> <span id="s1880">Dr. Rechauzier.</span> <span id="s1881">She received me and she said, "What's wrong with your son?"</span> <span id="s1882">And I said, "He has a high fever."</span> <span id="s1883">I told her the story of the sanitarium, that he had a spot on the lungs from the sun, so I was told.</span> <span id="s1884">"And now, I don't know what I am doing.</span> <span id="s1885">I have a little girl at home and my wife is not feeling well, and I don't have nothing to go by."</span> <span id="s1886">She said, "All right."</span> <span id="s1887">She disrobes him.</span> <span id="s1888">Before going with Armand, a couple of days before, I had said to Armand, "You know Armand," I said, "the only way that you will know that you will be Jewish is first of all your name is Abraham, you know that."</span> <span id="s1889">We always called him Avraim but now I said, "Now, your name is Armand."</span> <span id="s1890">And then I said, "You have been circumcised.</span> <span id="s1891">Only the Jews and the Muslims in Europe get circumcised, not like in America, every male baby.</span> <span id="s1892">So therefore, in case anybody would ask you, "Why are you circumcised?</span> <span id="s1893">You tell them when you were three years old you had an inflammation of your penis and you had to be operated; you know, if it's called circumcised or whatever, you were operated and that's all.</span> <span id="s1894">Now, remember, we are Catholic."</span> <span id="s1895">And, I spoke to him and he is very precocious for his age; I guess we mature very fast, some of us.</span> <span id="s1896">And I said, "Armand, if you ever tell anybody that we are Jews, our life is in danger because we are Catholics from Belgium."</span> <span id="s1897">And he shook hands with me, and he hugged me, and he said, "Papa, I will do everything I can that nobody never knows."</span> <span id="s1898">The doctor looks upon me and I told her I am a Catholic.</span> <span id="s1899">She said, "I understand."</span> <span id="s1900">She knew.</span> <span id="s1901">She was a Protestant, a Huguenot.</span> <span id="s1902">She knew that we were Jews, but she did not say a word.</span> <span id="s1903">She said, "Mr. Mednicki, this is a woman's sanitarium, of a lot of patients who came from Paris.</span> <span id="s1904">They are from the regions around France that Germans occupy, so we are full.</span> <span id="s1905">However, I'll take your son."</span> <span id="s1906">And she took him in.</span> <span id="s1907">And she wrote me a letter that I should be able to travel, because you needed a special permit.</span> <span id="s1908">I have the permit, I will show you in due time.</span> <span id="s1909">You need a special permit to travel between one village to another, orders of the Gendarmerie [police].</span> <span id="s1910">So she gave me a paper in which she stipulated that my son had tuberculosis and in each case, and that I should be allowed to see him because the child is very ill.</span> <span id="s1911">So, starts traveling.</span> <span id="s1912">One of the neighbors saw Eliane, she was adorable and pretty.</span> <span id="s1913">And she saw that we were not pushy people.</span> <span id="s1914">She lent me a little carriage for my baby and we travel up to the mountains to see Armand, and that went on for about six, seven months.</span> <span id="s1915">They kept him; he was alright, and he became the mascot of the women in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1916">I have pictures from them.</span> <span id="s1917">And in the meantime, when I was in Vichy, I wrote a letter to my father's brother in Philadelphia, not having an address or nothing, just trusting that Mednicki's Studio would be enough.</span> <span id="s1918">And I wrote Mednicki's Studio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1919">He received the letter, and about eight months later, I received through American Friends Committee, through the French Red Cross, and another group of American Friends or French Friends, I don't know, I received a check of $15.00.</span> <span id="s1920">At that time that was the Taj Mahal.</span> <span id="s1921">Was like an estate, a fortune.</span> <span id="s1922">Just at that time, in the village, I was doing odd jobs.</span> <span id="s1923">I worked on the quarries, I chopped wood, I keep busy; I have to make a few francs.</span> <span id="s1924">And I made myself the reputation as a Belgian, as a hard worker.</span> <span id="s1925">You can trust a Belgian.</span> <span id="s1926">Now the French people are good drinkers.</span> <span id="s1927">They make their own wines.</span> <span id="s1928">I am not a wine drinker, not an alcoholic.</span> <span id="s1929">But the necessity when you dance, when you dance, you dance with music.</span> <span id="s1930">So I made myself a reputation of being a regular guy.</span> <span id="s1931">I drink well, I work hard, and they looked upon me with a little bit different eyes than in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1932">And I was working for an entrepreneur who had received a contract from the French government to clean up the walls of the ravine going to a railroad track that goes through the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1933">There is a long tunnel from Volvic to Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s1934">And to work on that ravine is "Ooh la la."</span> <span id="s1935">Maybe 10,000 feet deep, the ravine.</span> <span id="s1936">So you attach yourself with a rope on one tree and with a hatchet you cut down the trees and then you have to clean it and, and, I was working.</span> <span id="s1937">The winter came; I was working very hard.</span> <span id="s1938">In the meantime, in the village, I learned the ways of life, their procrastinations, I learned their idiocies, their ways of everything else, and I was able to go along with them very well.</span> <span id="s1939">And 1941, that's [in 1940].</span> <span id="s1940">In 1941, I received a letter from the French government and I should present myself in Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s1941">We lived in Volvic.</span> <span id="s1942">I should present myself in Clermont-Ferrand with three days food and three days work to go help out in Germany for the war effort.</span> <span id="s1943">I was to be sent out from France.</span> <span id="s1944">That was not in my book.</span> <span id="s1945">So instead of dressing up like go to work, I dressed up with the best I had.</span> <span id="s1946">I had one suit and I had one collar.</span> <span id="s1947">And I dressed up and I didn't take anything but a satchel underneath my arm, a sandwich for the day, what with a sandwich, a piece of old bread, whatever I had.</span> <span id="s1948">And we come into the city.</span> <span id="s1949">As I come into the city of Clermont-Ferrand, in front of a huge building like our football field where they play soccer, you know, baseball, what do you call it there, you know the field in JFK.</span> <span id="s1950">Well, they could get 20,000 people in.</span> <span id="s1951">In front of it, was about 15,000 aliens milling around waiting for the doors to open with the same invitation.</span> <span id="s1952">And they carry bags with clothes and food and they have shovels and picks.</span> <span id="s1953">It was people from Alsace-Lorraine and from Les Vosges and from Normandy.</span> <span id="s1954">It was Polish from the coal pits, and the iron pits, and the coal mines, you know, and they were ready to go.</span> <span id="s1955">As I come to the place, they separated like they thought I was part, a part from the government.</span> <span id="s1956">So as they separate, I kept walking.</span> <span id="s1957">And I jumped to the door, the first one.</span> <span id="s1958">And I opened the door, and I go in, close the door in the back of me and I look around.</span> <span id="s1959">The hall is immense.</span> <span id="s1960">And all around are chairs with tables and young ladies sitting in front of books and papers.</span> <span id="s1961">I said to the first young lady, "I have an invitation: do you know what this is?"</span> <span id="s1962">I said, "Do you know who I am?"</span> <span id="s1963">Of course, we speak in French now.</span> <span id="s1964">So she said, "I have nothing to do with this."</span> <span id="s1965">I said, "You send me work."</span> <span id="s1966">I said, "Ah oui [ah, yes], do you know who I am?"</span> <span id="s1967">She said, "Sir, I don't know, but tell me," she said.</span> <span id="s1968">And she looks in her book, "I may have other jobs.</span> <span id="s1969">Do you know how to make pocketbooks?"</span> <span id="s1970">That's a crazy idea like I would ask you suddenly, "Do you know to blow a trombone?"</span> <span id="s1971">So, I said, "Yes, of course."</span> <span id="s1972">I never say no.</span> <span id="s1973">I will have time to correct later.</span> <span id="s1974">I said, "Yes, of course, what do you want me to do?"</span> <span id="s1975">"I need," she said, "some craftsman to make pocketbooks.</span> <span id="s1976">It's for the German Army."</span> <span id="s1977">I said, "Where?"</span> <span id="s1978">She said, "Here in C1ermont-Ferrand."</span> <span id="s1979">I said, "Give me the address."</span> <span id="s1980">And she said "Clermont-Ferrand."</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">JF: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">BM: C-L-E-R-M-O-N-T - F-E-R-R-A-N-D.</span> <span id="s1983">And that's in the P-U-Y - D-E - D-Ô-M-E.</span> <span id="s1984">Accent circumflex [accent ˆ] over the Dôme.</span> <span id="s1985">See, the city is Clermont-Ferrand and the department of le Puy de Dôme, and the region is called L'Auvergne.</span> <span id="s1986">You heard of La Seine, good!</span> <span id="s1987">and that's L'Auvergne.</span> <span id="s1988">In L'Auvergne, the people are very hard and L'Auvergnois they are a mixture of Sarazilians, and Turk and Italian and Spanish.</span> <span id="s1989">They have been occupied for the centuries by all those nations in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1990">So, she gives me four addresses, and four names.</span> <span id="s1991">And I look at the names and I see three Jewish names and one non-Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1992">Like I told you, pocketbook making is in the hands of the Jewish people, because it's a clean, small industry and it's a tedious job, and the Jews are patient.</span> <span id="s1993">I figure why risk everything now that I have been able to escape everything: why go to the Jew?</span> <span id="s1994">I go to a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1995">I go to Monsieur Orléans.</span> <span id="s1996">Monsieur Orléans' place was "Eye of the Mountains" and as I come in that street, Eye of the Mountains, I open the door and go in.</span> <span id="s1997">And in front of me stands the most gorgeous specimen of my people, beautiful curly hair, gorgeous black eyes, rich sensuous lips--I mean just the beautiful type of a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s1998">"Monsieur Orléans," I said, "here is the paper, I need a job.</span> <span id="s1999">I have been sent by the order of obligatory work."</span> <span id="s2000">"Oh yes," he said, "I'll send you my foreman."</span> <span id="s2001">And I see it's a big thing going on.</span> <span id="s2002">Young man comes in, well dressed, beautiful, elegant, thin.</span> <span id="s2003">"Mssr.</span> <span id="s2004">Mednicki?"</span> <span id="s2005">"Yes."</span> <span id="s2006">And he looks, "Mednicki, Bernard?"</span> <span id="s2007">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s2008">"Born in Brussels?"</span> <span id="s2009">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s2010">He doesn't read the paper.</span> <span id="s2011">"Born in Brussels.</span> <span id="s2012">Did you live in this and this street in the first World War?"</span> <span id="s2013">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s2014">"Did you live on the fifth floor on top of a family called Zlotnick?"</span> <span id="s2015">I said, "Yes," I said, "in fact Rogers Zlotnick was my friend, we grew up together," I said, "but after the war, in 1920, his parents left for France."</span> <span id="s2016">"Bernard, I am Rogers."</span> <span id="s2017">And we fell into the arms of each other.</span> <span id="s2018">Well, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s2019">The emotion of it made that we both collapsed.</span> <span id="s2020">After we calmed a little bit I said to Rogers, I said, "I'm not a pocketbook maker, I am a technician, an orthopedist."</span> <span id="s2021">"It's all right Bernard, I'll teach you."</span> <span id="s2022">"Do you know how to steal?"</span> <span id="s2023">I said, "What do you mean by stealing?"</span> <span id="s2024">"Well," he said, "you see, we work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2025">So they give us a quarter, we have to make so much from so many skins and so many materials, but we turn and we connive and we combine and we piece together--what they don't see, they don't know.</span> <span id="s2026">And we steal, and what we steal, we sell, we pay those--we give subsidies to those families from the men in the resistance."</span> <span id="s2027">That was my first knowledge with resistance.</span> <span id="s2028">I said, "When it comes to stealing," I said, "you--I'm your man."</span> <span id="s2029">So he taught me how to work.</span> <span id="s2030">And I would travel--I received a special permit because I had that special German paper.</span> <span id="s2031">I am working for the war effort for the Nazi empire.</span> <span id="s2032">And I travel up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s2033">In the meantime, then, at night before going, a Jew was called a dentiste, or a Normand or a Breton.</span> <span id="s2034">When, for instance, I would see you on the street, and I would think maybe you are Jewish, I would ask you, "Are you a dentiste?"</span> <span id="s2035">Would you be Jewish, you would know and then you would say "Yes" or "No."</span> <span id="s2036">If you would be not, then you would say, "I have never been a dentiste", or whatever.</span> <span id="s2037">Second question is "Are you from Brittany?"</span> <span id="s2038">It was like a password, like, you know.</span> <span id="s2039">And in the shop, it was about eight of us, Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s2040">Was two of them were craftsmen in the profession.</span> <span id="s2041">They taught me.</span> <span id="s2042">Then after two weeks I had three apprentices already myself.</span> <span id="s2043">But the main job was to steal the stuff at night.</span> <span id="s2044">You unroll skins all over your body, put your trousers on, put your jacket on, you walk out very stiffly.</span> <span id="s2045">And he lived across the street.</span> <span id="s2046">So we would go on the second floor and get unrobed [disrobed] and put down whatever we took and from the other side of the house they would sell it to the black market.</span> <span id="s2047">With that money they would keep resistance families alive.</span> <span id="s2048">So we are already, almost spring.</span> <span id="s2049">And we sit outside after I came back from having my lunch--I was having a bottle of wine, a hunk of cheese and a piece of bread in a café, down the mountain street in Place de Jote.</span> <span id="s2050">And as I was--the guy from the café liked me.</span> <span id="s2051">Was two people, very elegant couple.</span> <span id="s2052">About middle 40's, a little older than I am, and they took me under their wing.</span> <span id="s2053">"Le Petit Belge" [little Belgian] they called me.</span> <span id="s2054">I was pleasant to look at, let's put it that way, I was good looking.</span> <span id="s2055">Well, I cannot help it, the truth is the truth.</span> <span id="s2056">Look, self praise is not agreeable but you have to say the facts like they are.</span> <span id="s2057">I can say that you are pleasant, agreeable, pretty, but, if you have to say it yourself, you have to.</span> <span id="s2058">So, anyway, they liked me very much.</span> <span id="s2059">And they said to me, "You know, mon Petit Belge, there is another Belgian coming here once in a while.</span> <span id="s2060">We'll tell him that you come, maybe he can wait for you."</span> <span id="s2061">So one day after coming back, we stood outside the place of business--we didn't have to go in for a moment--and it was cool, but nice.</span> <span id="s2062">We see an old man, Jewish fellow with a beard, an old man, trying to push a wheelbarrow with coal up the street.</span> <span id="s2063">Now we had Spanish refugees from the revolution of Spain--maybe you heard of the revolution--who would be working with us.</span> <span id="s2064">And we had a few shicksas [gentile girls] from the neighborhood, cheap labor, you know, apprentices, and they were laughing from the poor man who couldn't lift.</span> <span id="s2065">I said, "You know what, you want me to play a dirty joke to that Jew?</span> <span id="s2066">I'll tell you what I'll do; watch me."</span> <span id="s2067">I go down, and inside, my heart, was tearing.</span> <span id="s2068">I thought maybe my father, could be my father.</span> <span id="s2069">So I go down to the man and I said, "What are you trying to do, eh, old man?"</span> <span id="s2070">I had to be vulgar.</span> <span id="s2071">"You want to put it up; do you know how to pull a carriage?</span> <span id="s2072">Have you ever worked in your life?</span> <span id="s2073">I'll show you," I said.</span> <span id="s2074">And I give him a shove, took the wheelbarrow, ran up in the street and put it on top of the mountain.</span> <span id="s2075">I start laughing and I said, "You see, that's smart, you are not."</span> <span id="s2076">And the fellows thought it was a beautiful thing.</span> <span id="s2077">Inside, I was crying.</span> <span id="s2078">It hurt me, but the man didn't have to struggle anymore to bring the coal up.</span> <span id="s2079">The Jewish guys, they knew it.</span> <span id="s2080">And inside, they bawled me out, "Don't you ever do that again.</span> <span id="s2081">Let him struggle."</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">JF: Did you ever clarify with your employer that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">BM: Of course, he knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">JF: He knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">BM: Rogers Zlotnick knew it because we grew up together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">JF: So he told him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">BM: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s2088">Of course, I suppose he told him.</span> <span id="s2089">Hey...</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">JF: And was this man, was the employer open about his Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">BM: No, he couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s2092">Yes, he was open.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">JF: It was known?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">BM: Oh yes, it was known.</span> <span id="s2095">He was under the protection of the--see, the Germans used whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s2096">And they protected you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">JF: Was Zlotnick known as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">BM: No, Zlotnick, no.</span> <span id="s2099">Zlotnick was not known a Jew.</span> <span id="s2100">Because, he didn't look at all.</span> <span id="s2101">Not at all.</span> <span id="s2102">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">JF: They kept your secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">BM: Oh yes, they kept it secret of everybody.</span> <span id="s2105">Oh yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s2106">So one day in the café I sat, and here comes in Robert Durain, from Riom; big man; armband; Special Service.</span> <span id="s2107">And he came to me, "Bernard, Monsieur Mednicki?"</span> <span id="s2108">He said, "Now we see each other."</span> <span id="s2109">And he said, "what are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s2110">I said to him, "I'm working," I said "for Le Service de La Guerre [war service], for the Germans."</span> <span id="s2111">"Ah," he said, "and I," he said, "became now as the head of the department of recruiting aliens to send work in France and Germany."</span> <span id="s2112">When I heard that a collaborator, my heart stopped beating.</span> <span id="s2113">He was very sympathetic, very lovely and everything else, but, he was contact with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2114">I had to watch my p's and q's.</span> <span id="s2115">And I had to go to work; goodbye, we see each other again.</span> <span id="s2116">And his office was not far from where I was working, two streets further.</span> <span id="s2117">He said to me, "Instead of the café, come upstairs and have a bottle of beer with me, or a glass of wine."</span> <span id="s2118">So I said, "All right."</span> <span id="s2119">Because I had to keep up some kind of friendship with somebody.</span> <span id="s2120">Not knowing exactly if he was collaborator, so, it scared the hell out of me, but I had to.</span> <span id="s2121">Come to his office and he had a lot of beautiful young women working in his front office; typists, steno, you know that, so on.</span> <span id="s2122">I said to him, "What is that?"</span> <span id="s2123">He said, "They are all from Paris, and they are my office help.</span> <span id="s2124">This one's father is a minister, and this one's father is the ex-director of the Upper Rhine: it's all personalities."</span> <span id="s2125">It was gorgeous women.</span> <span id="s2126">He was a good looking chap who was full of magnetism--I will show you pictures, you will see yourself.</span> <span id="s2127">And, we talked and here is in the back of his office is three pictures of Pierre Laval, the French dictator, and Darlan, and then another guy from the government, Marshal Pétin.</span> <span id="s2128">And I look at them and we speak--we speak of little things, a million little things.</span> <span id="s2129">In the meantime, we received rations of wine, and tobacco was rationed.</span> <span id="s2130">And we received like one ounce of tobacco, cute amount.</span> <span id="s2131">Usually I would sell it for black market to buy food for the kids, for my wife, for myself.</span> <span id="s2132">But here, I am dealing with a non-Jew, who is a big smoker and a drinker, and you remember the old saying, "Little gifts keeps friendship alive."</span> <span id="s2133">So, I used my head and I brought him tobacco and he became very good friend to me.</span> <span id="s2134">And like this, we saw each other.</span> <span id="s2135">In the meantime, the events were going on.</span> <span id="s2136">In the village was the resistance going on.</span> <span id="s2137">And I would be traveling day and night, up and down, the food wasn't there, and it was bad.</span> <span id="s2138">And one day coming down, I go to his office, and he said to me, "Bernard, I'm going on a mission to Brussels.</span> <span id="s2139">I want you to give me your parents' name and address, and I will be going to them and bring greetings from you and the children, and your wife."</span> <span id="s2140">That is all I needed.</span> <span id="s2141">So, I said to him, "I don't know," I said, "and I don't think it is necessary for you to divert yourself from your official obligations to go to see my family; they live so far away."</span> <span id="s2142">"Oh no," he said, "I have a car."</span> <span id="s2143">He had an official car with a flag and gasoline.</span> <span id="s2144">Because the cars, at that time, were going on charcoal, special system.</span> <span id="s2145">I said, "Let me think it over."</span> <span id="s2146">So, I come home at night and I said, "What do we do now, Anna?"</span> <span id="s2147">And she said, "You know, Bernard, we trusted him that much, and nobody knows that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s2148">Maybe it is written, maybe that's the way it should be.</span> <span id="s2149">Tell him."</span> <span id="s2150">And the following day I come to his office and I brought him two bottles of my wine, that we had rations.</span> <span id="s2151">And I said, "Robert, I have something to tell you of very grave importance and I like to close the door to your outside office."</span> <span id="s2152">He said, "Very well."</span> <span id="s2153">And I closed the door and he said, "Now let me hear; what do you have to say?"</span> <span id="s2154">I said to him, "I would never have told you anything that..." Tape 3, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">JF: You said...</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">BM: I said to him, "You know that until now we were good friends.</span> <span id="s2157">What I have to tell you may change the whole situation.</span> <span id="s2158">In fact, what I am going to tell you may put in your hands the life of my family."</span> <span id="s2159">So, sitting in back of his desk, he looks up to me and he said, "What did you do, kill somebody?"</span> <span id="s2160">I said, "No, I didn't kill anybody, but I am Jewish."</span> <span id="s2161">And with this, he looks up to me, stays up, he comes around, grabs me and kisses me on both cheeks.</span> <span id="s2162">For a fraction of a second, I thought he was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s2163">And he squeezes me to his heart and says, "Bernard, I am looking for guys like you."</span> <span id="s2164">And he goes and turns the three pictures over.</span> <span id="s2165">General de Gaulle is there, and two guys from the resistance, Marshall, and another guy.</span> <span id="s2166">He said, "Bernard."</span> <span id="s2167">He said, "I'm the coordinator of London [Coordinateur de Revenants] here in that section; I'm resistance, FFI, Force Française de L"Interieur [Internal French Force]."</span> <span id="s2168">Well, I had to cry and he had to cry.</span> <span id="s2169">And I said, "Thank God.</span> <span id="s2170">I found somebody that I can do something for."</span> <span id="s2171">He said to me, "Do you want to help me?"</span> <span id="s2172">I said, "What question," I said, "If I have to die, what's better than to die fighting."</span> <span id="s2173">"No, Bernard, we speak of life," he said, "no dying."</span> <span id="s2174">I said, "What can I do?"</span> <span id="s2175">He said, "It's like that.</span> <span id="s2176">We pick up parachutages [things parachuted] from London; they drop ammunition, explosives, weapons, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2177">Our friends pick them up and they bury them not far from where I live.</span> <span id="s2178">I am the coordinator and distributor."</span> <span id="s2179">Because, you see, there was political parties; there was the Communist and there was the Nationalism, there was the Royalist.</span> <span id="s2180">And everybody wanted to put their fingers in whatever came from London.</span> <span id="s2181">And he was the coordinator.</span> <span id="s2182">So, he said, "Bernard, I need you badly."</span> <span id="s2183">So, in his car, after work, he would invite me.</span> <span id="s2184">Of course, he had plenty of everything.</span> <span id="s2185">See, he was with collaborators who did not know that he was not a collaborator.</span> <span id="s2186">And those collaborators had everything they needed, wine, women, food, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">JF: About what year, what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">BM: That was '41, the middle of '41, I would say.</span> <span id="s2189">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">JF: And can you tell me how to spell his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">BM: Robert--you know how to spell.</span> <span id="s2192">D-u-h-i-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">JF: D-u...</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">BM: ... h-i-n.</span> <span id="s2195">And he had a mother, he told me, she is sworn antisemite and an elderly school teacher, he was no youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">JF: He was no youngster?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">BM: No, he was about five or ten years older than I am.</span> <span id="s2198">Of course, at that time, to me he was old; he was 40 when I was 30.</span> <span id="s2199">And I started working with him.</span> <span id="s2200">I didn't come home at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">JF: You explained, I assume, to your wife, what...</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">BM: I said to her, of course," Listen dear.</span> <span id="s2203">Now."</span> <span id="s2204">You know we spoke Yiddish, like I told you, and I said to her, "The 'Passionar' [La Passionara - Spanish Civil War] in Spain had said a very good word.</span> <span id="s2205">That we translate in a Jewish song, "Instead of living like the slaves standing up, no, instead of living like the slaves crawling on the floor, it is better to die standing like a man with a weapon in one hand."</span> <span id="s2206">Therefore, I said, "Remember, my father before me, and through the generations of our people, somebody has to start, and, I'll start in my family."</span> <span id="s2207">I said, "I'm gonna fight."</span> <span id="s2208">And she said, "Bernard, what you have to do, you have to do."</span> <span id="s2209">Armand was still in the sanitarium, Eliane was a baby.</span> <span id="s2210">And I said, "I will take care the best I can with you," I said, "and don't worry."</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">JF: And you were still in Clermont?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">BM: No, we were in Volvic.</span> <span id="s2213">I worked in Clermont-Ferrand; we lived in Volvic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">JF: V..</span> <span id="s2215">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">BM: V-O-L-V-I-C</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">JF: Okay.</span> <span id="s2218">Let me ask you a question at this point.</span> <span id="s2219">Had you been able to have any contact with your father during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">BM: I wrote a letter to my sister; the letter came back.</span> <span id="s2221">I have it.</span> <span id="s2222">I have a letter.</span> <span id="s2223">Came back censored and everything else.</span> <span id="s2224">Nothing; that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">JF: Did you have any specific knowledge of what was happening outside of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">BM: No.</span> <span id="s2227">First of all, I lived in a remote village.</span> <span id="s2228">The news were very strongly censored and I was in contact with no one; by necessity.</span> <span id="s2229">There was a Jewish Maquis [French underground] near the Spanish border and I wasn't in touch with them.</span> <span id="s2230">Through our Maquis, many people came through our village of Volvic and they went further south to the region of Evian.</span> <span id="s2231">And, of course, you heard of Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s2232">They went to Le Chambon, those people, but we didn't know.</span> <span id="s2233">Later on, we find out.</span> <span id="s2234">And so, I would come home twice a week, once a week., I would come home for a long weekend.</span> <span id="s2235">Then Robert Duhin sometimes would drive me home.</span> <span id="s2236">And he would bring food.</span> <span id="s2237">And, in the village seeing that, I received a reputation of a collaborator.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">JF: While you were with him, you were getting these explosives and burying them--this was your...</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">BM: My job was to go with him, pick up the explosives where they were hidden by the mountaineers, who picked them up in the mountains when from London it was parachuted.</span> <span id="s2240">See, they had different type of mountains, you know.</span> <span id="s2241">We lived in the massif central, near Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s2242">There was mountains in La Correze, there was the mountains near Plaines de Limoges and there was the mountains of Le Puys.</span> <span id="s2243">And all those--there was a centralization point, because if they dropped the detonators here, the plastic came here, if they dropped the machine gun here, the [unclear] of it was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">JF: So you picked these up before the Army was able to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">BM: Right.</span> <span id="s2246">We picked them up and put them together and distribute them.</span> <span id="s2247">That was Captain Duhin's job, to distribute, to see who gets it.</span> <span id="s2248">Because we didn't want--see, it was like this--there was the regular Army of General de Gaulle (FFI), then there was the FTPF, Francs Tireurs et Partisans Français, who were members of the communist party.</span> <span id="s2249">They were actually the doers.</span> <span id="s2250">If real jobs had to be done, they were on the top and we had to wait for orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">JF: In the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">BM: Yes, in the resistance.</span> <span id="s2253">They were not part of our units.</span> <span id="s2254">We were a legitimate unit of the French government.</span> <span id="s2255">They were a faction, fighters for liberty for the French people.</span> <span id="s2256">They in view to get weapons and everything else, had to scheme, had to do all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2257">We had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">JF: So, his, Robert's job, technically, was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">BM: Coordinator and distributor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">JF: Of these weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">BM: That's right, of the weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">JF: Did...</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">BM: And all kind of, yes, explosives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">JF: And in his facade, in his job as the Germans saw him, did he have something to do with these explosives?</span> <span id="s2265">Or this was totally on the side?</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">BM: Of course not.</span> <span id="s2267">He was hunting the alien to send him to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">JF: Can you tell me what it was like gathering these explosives?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">BM: Well, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s2270">At night we would go out about 6:30-7:00, and we would go out of the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s2271">And it was lots of mountains and caverns and there would be containers about one meter long, more than a yard, a yard and a half long, and weighing about fifty kilo, 100 pound.</span> <span id="s2272">One container was with explosive called plastic.</span> <span id="s2273">It was a very potent dough-like material, smelling like almonds.</span> <span id="s2274">Another container was detonators.</span> <span id="s2275">Then another one was, cartridges for machine guns, rifles.</span> <span id="s2276">We had small weapons.</span> <span id="s2277">And we had two or three pick-ups a month.</span> <span id="s2278">Those pick-ups were in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2279">And until they reached us, we had a daily, practically, three times a week, pick-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">JF: In other words, there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">BM: You see, one came to Camden, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">JF: Did you go...</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">BM: No, we did not.</span> <span id="s2284">Somebody from there.</span> <span id="s2285">We only worked in our region.</span> <span id="s2286">Chamaillère, we worked.</span> <span id="s2287">Everything came to Chamaillère.</span> <span id="s2288">But, Chamaillère was out--mountain, in mountain--and instead of loading his car with a few, we could load really maximum.</span> <span id="s2289">Then, around where he lived was caverns and mountains.</span> <span id="s2290">Near the place where he lived, and in front of his door, was two Algerian guards, bodyguards.</span> <span id="s2291">They would have sliced the throat of anybody trying to go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">JF: So you had resistance working in the mountains who picked these up, brought them to his...</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">BM: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">JF: ... his home...</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">BM: To his neighbor... to his neighborhood...</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">JF: ... to his neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">BM: And then, we would take it and bring it to his home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">JF: And then you reassembled...</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">BM: And, then, from there other guys would come with carriages with straw, or on a bicycle with containers of milk, and they would take their shares and go.</span> <span id="s2300">That was the center of distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">JF: Okay.</span> <span id="s2302">So that this ammunition was refed into the French Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">BM: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2304">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2305">We were only the gathering point.</span> <span id="s2306">And we worked like this quite a few months until one day he says to me, "Bernard, I have another job for you.</span> <span id="s2307">This," he said, "for the time being we leave alone, I can use somebody else.</span> <span id="s2308">I need somebody in a factory."</span> <span id="s2309">In the city of Riom is a factory, who was making signalization apparatus for the subways of Paris.</span> <span id="s2310">That factory is quite an old one since they installed the subways in Paris.</span> <span id="s2311">That is all they made, signalization.</span> <span id="s2312">I need laborer there.</span> <span id="s2313">The Germans took over the plant with the craftsmen, fine, old French craftsmen.</span> <span id="s2314">And the machinery, and all the stock, it was all copper and brass.</span> <span id="s2315">And they start making--fitting out trailers with emission stations, and detecting apparatus where there will be illegal radio stations.</span> <span id="s2316">And they would outfit this and send them in the field.</span> <span id="s2317">He said, "We need somebody to sabotage this."</span> <span id="s2318">I said, "What sabotage can be done?"</span> <span id="s2319">He said, "There is the little oil shafts where they pour the oil to the motors.</span> <span id="s2320">In this, you pour a powder we give you.</span> <span id="s2321">And after working for a couple of hours, the whole thing goes bad."</span> <span id="s2322">Of course they tried; it's good it goes out.</span> <span id="s2323">It is still good.</span> <span id="s2324">But once it's in the field, there it goes.</span> <span id="s2325">Now, I live in Volvic, and I have to go down two and a quarter hours, the mountain, and go up three hours, and I have to be 3:30 at work in the morning.</span> <span id="s2326">Because I have to start.</span> <span id="s2327">Then already it was September, October.</span> <span id="s2328">Now, of course, you realize we lost completely touch with anything pertaining to anything in Judaism.</span> <span id="s2329">In the village, they know I was a Protestant, because they were Catholics.</span> <span id="s2330">Robert Duhin knew I was a Catholic.</span> <span id="s2331">His mother knew I was a Catholic, cause I am a Belgian.</span> <span id="s2332">In the part of Limoges they know I was Protestant Huguenot because they were Catholics.</span> <span id="s2333">I mean, we get to confuse them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">JF: And yet Duhin knew that you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">BM: Of course.</span> <span id="s2336">So after a while, Duhin said to me, "Look," then he gave me the job to go to work in the factory.</span> <span id="s2337">I go down, I present, they look me over, I'm strong, I can get the job.</span> <span id="s2338">When you take a job for the Germans, you could not miss a day, or you must have a good excuse.</span> <span id="s2339">They would send the doctor, they would send the soldiers to pick you up.</span> <span id="s2340">I don't know, Volvic is like the snow belt in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s2341">In the winter, it's horrible.</span> <span id="s2342">It is so cold that the bark on the tree would explode in the middle of the night, so cold it was.</span> <span id="s2343">Now, I was underfed, there was no food.</span> <span id="s2344">We would live on the rations.</span> <span id="s2345">In the rations, sometimes we would get, for instance, hundred grams of beans, not even a half a pound, three ounces of beans, per person, a month.</span> <span id="s2346">And I would collect that amount of beans and you come home and you look at them, they are crawling full of maggots.</span> <span id="s2347">But I wouldn't say nothing to the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">JF: How often were you able to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">BM: Well, every weekend I would try.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">JF: On the weekends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">BM: Yes, but from that factory, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">JF: Oh, from the factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">BM: Oh yes, I would walk, I would leave in the morning and come back at night.</span> <span id="s2354">I would never stay out at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">JF: And the factory was in what town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">BM: In Riom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">JF: In Riom, which is R..</span> <span id="s2358">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">BM: R-I-O-M</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">JF: M?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">BM: M, yes.</span> <span id="s2362">And in the factory I came in touch with friends.</span> <span id="s2363">I was wondering where the powder would come to me.</span> <span id="s2364">He said, "You go to work."</span> <span id="s2365">So in the morning I started, and I lugged I--the factory was not modern; it was old.</span> <span id="s2366">So they had rooms like my little house.</span> <span id="s2367">And in the middle of the room there was a big potbelly stove that I had to stoke with coke.</span> <span id="s2368">Outside the yard watched by the Nazis, by two soldiers, was a pile of coke, that I used to warm the factory.</span> <span id="s2369">And I would go from one shop to the other, all day, stoking the fires.</span> <span id="s2370">Or I would carry steel from one place to another in my wheelbarrow.</span> <span id="s2371">Or I would go--on my shoulders carry a couple of bars of metal.</span> <span id="s2372">I was busy all day.</span> <span id="s2373">And I was working, and I was well known in the yard by whoever was watching there.</span> <span id="s2374">"Der dumme Belgier," the dumb Belgian is there.</span> <span id="s2375">Because whenever I go by, I would greet them, you know, like a dumb-bell.</span> <span id="s2376">Don't ever show that you are smart when it is not necessary.</span> <span id="s2377">So I didn't shave to look dirty like the people of the village; I was wearing clothes received by the Belgian Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2378">I had a jacket six times too big.</span> <span id="s2379">But it was very good for me.</span> <span id="s2380">I had a pair of pants that two men could go into it.</span> <span id="s2381">It was good for me because, I could steal copper wire.</span> <span id="s2382">I made myself, with ropes, suspenders, and I would slip a roll of copper wire, put in my pants and I had about 150 pound of copper wire, to steal.</span> <span id="s2383">Like from here across the street was an old English dentist.</span> <span id="s2384">And he would take the copper that would go out from the back of the house and he would take it up into the mountains.</span> <span id="s2385">They needed telephone wire to throw through the city.</span> <span id="s2386">See, the resistance was telephone operators, gasman operators, electricity operators.</span> <span id="s2387">Everybody was collaborating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">JF: No one ever checked you to see that you were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">BM: "Der dumme Belgier.</span> <span id="s2390">Der dumme Belgier [the dumb Belgian]."</span> <span id="s2391">I was running in and out with wheelbarrows always.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">JF: You were such a terrific actor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">BM: I was good.</span> <span id="s2394">I was dumb.</span> <span id="s2395">I was never well-kept.</span> <span id="s2396">I was always filthy and I was always with a piece of cigarette hanging from the lip.</span> <span id="s2397">And I would always say, "Gibs mir ein cigarette.</span> <span id="s2398">[Give me a cigarette.]"</span> <span id="s2399">And then he would speak German, I would say, "Je comprent pas mon vieux.</span> <span id="s2400">[I don't understand old man]."</span> <span id="s2401">[Probably meant to say, Je ne comprend pas mon vieux!]</span> <span id="s2402">So I was able, like I told you, I was able to survive.</span> <span id="s2403">Often, I would reflect and say, we have been told as children that our ancestors are always watching over us.</span> <span id="s2404">The neshamah [soul] of our ancestors is watching.</span> <span id="s2405">And I would always say, "Ma, please don't remove your eyes from me."</span> <span id="s2406">Often, I cried.</span> <span id="s2407">Oh, do I cried.</span> <span id="s2408">One day I was going to work and it was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s2409">And going down the mountain I was wearing wooden shoes, the sabots.</span> <span id="s2410">I slid and fell right on my coccyx.</span> <span id="s2411">And the night was dark, you don't have light--no way.</span> <span id="s2412">And far away you hear the night owls, you know, "Whoo, whooooo," and then, a couple of wolves high up in the mountains, the barks.</span> <span id="s2413">And then the droning of an airplane, and by the droning we recognized what it was and suddenly I feel things falling.</span> <span id="s2414">Propaganda from an English plane who came, but I couldn't pick it up, it was pitch dark.</span> <span id="s2415">And I am going down, ravines on both sides with my foot.</span> <span id="s2416">If this was soft I know I was ready to fall off.</span> <span id="s2417">And I would walk with my eyes closed and listen to the step of my feet and I was a fast walker.</span> <span id="s2418">When I would come down from the forest into the factory, I was soaking wet.</span> <span id="s2419">So fast I walked!</span> <span id="s2420">And in my bag with food, I had a bag with rutabagas, turnips.</span> <span id="s2421">That's all, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s2422">They had meat and potatoes and bread and wine.</span> <span id="s2423">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s2424">And I walked with anger.</span> <span id="s2425">And the fellows in the place were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s2426">One day, one guy said to me, "Bernard, I will sell you fifty kilo potatoes."</span> <span id="s2427">The small baked potatoes that they cannot cook, it's too much time.</span> <span id="s2428">I said, "Good."</span> <span id="s2429">So he lent me a little bicycle cart and I attached it to my wrist with my red handkerchief, and I was wearing a brown heavy jacket and my blue beret.</span> <span id="s2430">And the feet I had with rags like ace bandages around the pants that should keep warm.</span> <span id="s2431">And in the shoes I had straw that my feet should be warm, the wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s2432">And here, I pulled out and suddenly a storm comes down.</span> <span id="s2433">The rain and the hail and everything else.</span> <span id="s2434">And I pull and I grab the ground to pull my potatoes.</span> <span id="s2435">And my beret, the dye was giving out and there was no light in the house; the village light went out.</span> <span id="s2436">So, when I came home, finally, God knows what time it was, my wife was listening on the door.</span> <span id="s2437">She heard my step, because in the village it was all stone.</span> <span id="s2438">And I was wearing a pair of shoes received from the Germans with hobnails and I had an automatic step, un, deux, un, deux--that was my step.</span> <span id="s2439">So she heard me coming already.</span> <span id="s2440">So she said, "Thank God."</span> <span id="s2441">And there was only a small piece of candle, so when she light the candle when I came in, she looked at me, she almost fainted.</span> <span id="s2442">The dye had come up on me, but that is nothing.</span> <span id="s2443">I said, "I have potatoes.</span> <span id="s2444">I have potatoes."</span> <span id="s2445">So we brought up the fire; I had a lot of wood, and we put the potatoes in the fire.</span> <span id="s2446">Half raw, we swallowed them.</span> <span id="s2447">We had food.</span> <span id="s2448">And in the morning I took the carriage back to that fellow.</span> <span id="s2449">That fellow was an amputee from the hip.</span> <span id="s2450">He was working in a pylon and the pylon was made from aluminum.</span> <span id="s2451">And inside the pylon the guy had little envelopes and little bottles, dynamite, diamond powder, emery powder.</span> <span id="s2452">And he gave me--he was my contact in the shop, to put the powder in those things, those machines.</span> <span id="s2453">After working one year like that and I have certificates to prove that I tell you the truth because I couldn't leave from there.</span> <span id="s2454">I had to leave; I couldn't stay any longer.</span> <span id="s2455">Robert said to me, "Bernard, I have a job for you, you try to leave now."</span> <span id="s2456">And you can not leave until you are legally discharged; they don't discharge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">JF: So you worked in Riom for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">BM: I worked in Riom for a year.</span> <span id="s2459">How am I going to go out?</span> <span id="s2460">I know what I do.</span> <span id="s2461">One day, I was watching in the court that the commanding officer of the guard, of that place, was speaking to the main engineer of the plant, a Frenchman, Monsieur Mathieu.</span> <span id="s2462">And I see him speaking on the other side and I load the wheelbarrow with a ton of metal.</span> <span id="s2463">And as they were there, with an effort, I throwed it on the ground, made a terrible noise and I fell down and I yelled, "My abdomen!"</span> <span id="s2464">And I curled up like in a fetal position.</span> <span id="s2465">And I screamed like I would have torn my kishkes [abdomen].</span> <span id="s2466">And they came running to me and they want to touch me.</span> <span id="s2467">Nobody can touch me.</span> <span id="s2468">I scream.</span> <span id="s2469">I know what the hernia looks like, I should know, I make enough trusses in my life.</span> <span id="s2470">And I know the symptoms and everything else.</span> <span id="s2471">So they finally--four men--slipped a board underneath me and carried me upstairs to the infirmary.</span> <span id="s2472">Doctor, nobody can touch me, I'm like this.</span> <span id="s2473">So finally the doctor said, "I'm going to give him an injection."</span> <span id="s2474">Then, I figure, "I better move my hand."</span> <span id="s2475">And the doctor looks at me, he said, "Yeah, that looks to me like a torn abdomen, it's like a eventration.</span> <span id="s2476">That looks to me like a double hernia.</span> <span id="s2477">I think he should go home and wear a bandage, and lay in bed for two weeks."</span> <span id="s2478">They drove me home in a truck.</span> <span id="s2479">That things never happened, I could walk!</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">JF: The doctor examined you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">BM: Yes.</span> <span id="s2482">But how could he examine me?</span> <span id="s2483">I couldn't allow him.</span> <span id="s2484">I just allowed him a little bit.</span> <span id="s2485">I held my kishkes.</span> <span id="s2486">I said, "I let my hand go and I'm dropping my intestines."</span> <span id="s2487">And I was thin then, 160 pounds.</span> <span id="s2488">So, I was able to do that.</span> <span id="s2489">They drove me home.</span> <span id="s2490">In the village was Dr. LeBlanc.</span> <span id="s2491">He was a French doctor, a five by five.</span> <span id="s2492">He was a good wine drinker.</span> <span id="s2493">He died young from cirrhosis of the liver, but happy.</span> <span id="s2494">And he came to see me, but he was resistance, so he put down a certificate to send back to the shop that Bernard Mednicki will never be able to do any hard labor again, being that he has torn intestines.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">JF: Upon these examinations, doctors did not see that you were circumcised?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">BM: No, because they removed only--hey, doctors have to be decent too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">BM: You know he removed until the abdomen, that's all, you don't drop your pants like that.</span> <span id="s2499">The French are very prude people, very prude.</span> <span id="s2500">When men went to the men's room, was little things, not together like in America.</span> <span id="s2501">You went to a big men's room where men is men and woman is woman.</span> <span id="s2502">No, I was fortunate in that respect.</span> <span id="s2503">That's what I was always afraid of.</span> <span id="s2504">And I came home and the doctor gave me a certificate.</span> <span id="s2505">I sent it in to the place.</span> <span id="s2506">They discharged me.</span> <span id="s2507">I was two weeks home.</span> <span id="s2508">I went to the pharmacist with the truss prescription, and he was resistance too.</span> <span id="s2509">And he bought the truss for two boxes of milk, powdered milk, and two boxes of formula, child formula.</span> <span id="s2510">And he gave me a pound of saccharin, and I gave him the prescription from which he collected from the government about twenty five francs.</span> <span id="s2511">Now I was invited by the mayor of the village.</span> <span id="s2512">At that time, they start making stamps, food stamps and the mayor of the village said to me, "Mr. Mednicki," they held me in high esteem, because they saw I am a worker and mind my business, I don't go to the cafés, and they see the way I behave with my wife, and I don't scream.</span> <span id="s2513">"Mr. Mednicki," he said, "we are going to have to give out food stamps, and I really have no one to trust to give them out.</span> <span id="s2514">We are only allowed 5% mistakes."</span> <span id="s2515">That's the time when I received that money from my uncle and I held on to that money like to life.</span> <span id="s2516">I had about 600 francs.</span> <span id="s2517">Today, it's about $7.00, $10.00 maybe.</span> <span id="s2518">And I received that privilege to work in the city, all I organized.</span> <span id="s2519">First, I put [unclear].</span> <span id="s2520">There was 3,000 people.</span> <span id="s2521">There was about 2,000 families, no, 1,500 families, so there was 1,500 booklets.</span> <span id="s2522">So I took down my forty-five booklets first, and I left them 2% to the errors.</span> <span id="s2523">At least we are.</span> <span id="s2524">So when I finished giving out the books to everybody and I said, "Monsieur, the Burgmeister, Mr. LeMaire [mayor], we only had 3% errors."</span> <span id="s2525">"Oh," he said, "that's beautiful."</span> <span id="s2526">And I had enough booklets to buy stamp.</span> <span id="s2527">With the food, the money I had I bought food, and I sent to my sisters-in-law to Paris.</span> <span id="s2528">This you can do.</span> <span id="s2529">You could ship food from out of the city to Paris, the Parisian reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">JF: And that was not checked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">BM: That was not checked because it was legal.</span> <span id="s2532">And because they wanted the population to be--and my sister-in-law had the right to remain in Paris.</span> <span id="s2533">Also Jew, because her husband was in the French Army, prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s2534">But my sister-in-law, her sister, was a Polish nationality.</span> <span id="s2535">She was hidden in her house, in the bathroom, in a corner, three feet by three feet for two years.</span> <span id="s2536">Only at night would she open a window to breathe a little.</span> <span id="s2537">When the war was finished, she was yellow like an egg yolk, from the lack of anything, and the lack of food.</span> <span id="s2538">So this came in handy for me to work for the city.</span> <span id="s2539">After this, I was getting well and the doctor discharged me that I can do any kind of mild labor.</span> <span id="s2540">A fellow from Alsace-Lorraine, resistance, had bought into an orthopedic shop in Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s2541">And that fellow from Clermont-Ferrand who owned the orthopedic shop was Monsieur.</span> <span id="s2542">D'Astugue, a Gascon man of 92 years old.</span> <span id="s2543">He was in business from his father's time.</span> <span id="s2544">Mind you, I found chastity-belts made from silver when I went into the place for the first time.</span> <span id="s2545">Chastity-belt!</span> <span id="s2546">If I had the brains then I would have a fortune, but then, when he said to throw it out, I crushed it and sold it 'cause I had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">JF: How old were they, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">BM: The chastity belts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">BM: Two hundred years old at least, then, 250 now.</span> <span id="s2551">And we throwed out everything.</span> <span id="s2552">So he had a lot of wax dolls from Napoleon's time.</span> <span id="s2553">I broke them and put them in containers, in bags, took it home to melt them, make candles.</span> <span id="s2554">Hey, you had to live with everything you could find.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">JF: Wax dolls?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">BM: Yes.</span> <span id="s2557">Wax dolls, you know, mannequins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">JF: Oh, mannequins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">BM: Mannequins, you know, orthopedic with trusses and corsets, and amputated and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2560">And it was old, the man was an old man.</span> <span id="s2561">You know, he was 91 years old and I see him one day come because he stood with us to give us the courant [news] from the baille [rent], and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2562">And he said to me one day, "Bernard," he said, "I may die."</span> <span id="s2563">I said, "What's the matter Monsieur D'Astugue?"</span> <span id="s2564">"I can have no more sex," he said.</span> <span id="s2565">Ninety-one years old, he can't have any more sex.</span> <span id="s2566">I said, "That's it?"</span> <span id="s2567">"Sure," he said, "no sex, no life."</span> <span id="s2568">I had to laugh.</span> <span id="s2569">And he died after that, short while, but he was a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s2570">And then, the store was a big store.</span> <span id="s2571">One was cosmetic, all ladies' foundation and apparel, and this side was orthopedic, in which I was in charge, with Dr. Streisgood.</span> <span id="s2572">Dr. Streisgood had lost his voice.</span> <span id="s2573">He had an operation and his voice was--he was speaking like that [words were whispered].</span> <span id="s2574">So I was his voice and I was his right arm.</span> <span id="s2575">I was his alter ego.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">JF: This job was also part of the resistance.</span> <span id="s2577">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">BM: Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s2579">Because there in that shop they had accepted a contract to make arch supports for the officers and the men from the Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s2580">Hitler was already after scraping the barrel of the men.</span> <span id="s2581">He used everything that was crawling and walking.</span> <span id="s2582">So in the Air Force he figured he don't need men who can't walk, but, so we made arch supports.</span> <span id="s2583">So, I would take casts, I would take tracings, and while I would do that I would speak German to them.</span> <span id="s2584">"Ich bin ein Blutbruder.</span> <span id="s2585">Habe schon so viel gesehen und das werden Sie nie sehen [I am a blood brother, I have seen so much, you will never see] and I would ask, "Where are you from?</span> <span id="s2586">Where do you come from?</span> <span id="s2587">I'm from Brussels.</span> <span id="s2588">And my family is from the Flanders.</span> <span id="s2589">And I have a grandfather who lives on the German border in Malmédy."</span> <span id="s2590">Ah, then I would get where he comes and when does he came and what is the name of the plane and how many men are there.</span> <span id="s2591">And every little bit would help.</span> <span id="s2592">Then, one day, Robert Duhin, who was not far from me, came.</span> <span id="s2593">He said, "Bernard, I have an invitation for you.</span> <span id="s2594">You are going to have supper with the elite of General Franco's officers, the French collaborators, and German officers."</span> <span id="s2595">There was a big fraternal evening.</span> <span id="s2596">He gave me a small camera, the size of a matchbox.</span> <span id="s2597">Now, I was known amongst them that I was a good Belgian, a patriot, but my wife was not well and my son is in a sanitarium.</span> <span id="s2598">Armand was no more in sanitarium.</span> <span id="s2599">Armand was then in preventorium.</span> <span id="s2600">After the sanitarium, they took him out and a preventorium is where they get adopted back to civil life.</span> <span id="s2601">So I have pictures from that too.</span> <span id="s2602">You know, it's funny, all those little things I could take pictures.</span> <span id="s2603">I have, not, I didn't have a camera.</span> <span id="s2604">But pictures I would love to have, I don't have any because there was no moment to think of it.</span> <span id="s2605">And I went to that evening--home we had nothing to eat, just the bare minimum.</span> <span id="s2606">And I come to that big feast of food.</span> <span id="s2607">The best in bread, butter, meat; oranges, tangerines sent by Franco from Spain.</span> <span id="s2608">We didn't see an orange or tangerine and I was collecting the peels where one German said to me, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s2609">I said, "That's for my children."</span> <span id="s2610">"Ach," he said, "Please."</span> <span id="s2611">And he gave me a whole bunch of stuff.</span> <span id="s2612">Now, I was wearing clothes six times too big, I told you, but I was dressed up.</span> <span id="s2613">I had lost a lot of weight, so my clothes were--whatever spoon or plate I could put into my pants I would steal.</span> <span id="s2614">And because there was nothing--a young couple who would get married would get from City Hall stamps enough to buy two spoons, two knives, two forks and one pot, one ironing iron and a pound of nails.</span> <span id="s2615">And of course, everything was barter.</span> <span id="s2616">That, for instance, in the village was a woman, a nymphomaniac.</span> <span id="s2617">[To interviewer] You have enough room?</span> <span id="s2618">There's some gory details now.</span> <span id="s2619">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">JF: Go ahead for a while, then we'll stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">BM: That nymphomaniac she could throw, over a day, twelve young men.</span> <span id="s2622">She was that type of a woman.</span> <span id="s2623">She had twelve children from fifteen fathers.</span> <span id="s2624">And she was a very well-to-do farmer.</span> <span id="s2625">And her husband was always working.</span> <span id="s2626">And they were collaborators, but not officially, they were swimming in the middle.</span> <span id="s2627">And in the village the baker said to me, "Bernard, you are so hard up for everything, why don't you go to Marie Jalouille and sleep one night with her, she will give you all the food you need."</span> <span id="s2628">Well, that's all I had in my mind, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s2629">Here I am trying to survive and it's not in the making of--first of all, not in any circumstances, but now especially not; I love my wife.</span> <span id="s2630">And my wife and I, we had made an agreement--also, we were young people, whatever shouldn't be, we'll try to remain honest one with the other.</span> <span id="s2631">So I see that I have no alternative but to bring food in the house.</span> <span id="s2632">I said to her, "You know," I said, "I'm going tomorrow play," I said, "with dynamite.</span> <span id="s2633">You trust me, and I am proud of it, and you know I'm not going to cheat on you, but, remember," I said, "have confidence, let me play my cards," and I go down to the woman in the morning, 6:30, with the hugest basket I could find.</span> <span id="s2634">And I took two huge...</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Tape 4, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">BM: And I go down to that lady, and like I said, I took huge basket and two huge containers like they put more than two gallon milk in it, and I walk the necessary four kilometers up to the castle where she lived with her family, lots of children, a huge farm and a lot of cattle.</span> <span id="s2637">And the baker had told her that I would be coming.</span> <span id="s2638">Of course, like I told you previously, I had all the necessary challenge to survive.</span> <span id="s2639">And of course, it's forty five years ago.</span> <span id="s2640">We had a special, not so much sex education, but we have the knowledge of love.</span> <span id="s2641">We know how to love a wife, we know how to love a mistress; we know how to love a friend; and we know how to love children and parents.</span> <span id="s2642">I come to her and she was drooling and standing outside.</span> <span id="s2643">She was a forty- year-old woman, and I feel, oh, heavens, I'm going to have to play very tidy.</span> <span id="s2644">She's pulling me and I say, "Hold it!</span> <span id="s2645">This is a rush.</span> <span id="s2646">First of all, I walked so far and I'm very hungry.</span> <span id="s2647">I must have strength.</span> <span id="s2648">And then, after we're finished, we'll fill the basket.</span> <span id="s2649">Later, I say.</span> <span id="s2650">"No.</span> <span id="s2651">Later, there is no later.</span> <span id="s2652">You know better than that."</span> <span id="s2653">I said, "First of all, let's be calm.</span> <span id="s2654">If we're going to be calm, it's going to be charming, delightful, we will both remember.</span> <span id="s2655">So let's sit down and eat."</span> <span id="s2656">She put down on the table smoked ham, salted pork, a hunk of butter, and a big bread the size of an automobile wheel, once a week.</span> <span id="s2657">But she had good bread, and a pitcher of milk, and a bottle of wine, and a big hunk of cheese, Fourbe du Cantal [type of cheese].</span> <span id="s2658">I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s2659">And I took out my knife of the pocket--in fact, this is the original knife!</span> <span id="s2660">I always have a knife in the pocket, and with that knife, I can sharpen it to kill a bull.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">JF: This is the original knife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">BM: That's the original knife, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">JF: You were using then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">BM: And then you do like that, you take a piece of bread in one hand, like that, and a piece of cheese, and you cut and you eat, and then you put the knife down and sip on the wine, sip on the butter.</span> <span id="s2665">And I sat there for about an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s2666">She sat there and she was bursting on the seams, but she said nothing.</span> <span id="s2667">She was watching me.</span> <span id="s2668">How I was shoving everything into my mouth.</span> <span id="s2669">I wasn't chewing properly, I was just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">JF: Inhaling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">BM: ...inhaling the food, I was hungry!</span> <span id="s2672">And I cleaned the table maybe of five kilo of food.</span> <span id="s2673">Now, of course, realizing the fully belly and my spirits, I wasn't hungry first of all, but now I have to see, to get food for the family.</span> <span id="s2674">I said, "Let's fill my basket."</span> <span id="s2675">"Oh," she said, "later."</span> <span id="s2676">I said, "Look, later you will be tired, I will be tired.</span> <span id="s2677">It will be a long time, and it will be time for me to go home."</span> <span id="s2678">And she was having the hams hanging, and the salamis and everything they prepared themselves, everything.</span> <span id="s2679">"We fill the basket like Bernard likes it."</span> <span id="s2680">I had maybe 30 pounds of food; I had two containers full of milk and a hunk of butter.</span> <span id="s2681">She had everything in the world.</span> <span id="s2682">Now, that I'm ready for the amorous adventure.</span> <span id="s2683">I said, "Don't pull me now; let me see the house."</span> <span id="s2684">There were so many rooms, you know, and in the meantime I wanted to cool her off a little.</span> <span id="s2685">She was so excited.</span> <span id="s2686">So we finally came to her bedroom, and I said, "Don't disrobe, it's cool, sit down with me."</span> <span id="s2687">You read the story of Tarzan in one night, Scheherazade.</span> <span id="s2688">That's what I did.</span> <span id="s2689">I was a salesman, I promised the moon; I gave her the sunshine, I showed her the stars, we had no physical contact, like kiss and hugs, and that woman, she flew half a dozen times.</span> <span id="s2690">She said, "The best time in my life," she said.</span> <span id="s2691">"Never in my life have I had such a sensation," I said, "Marie, see, listen to the Belgians.</span> <span id="s2692">We know how to make love."</span> <span id="s2693">I said, "Now, remember, you can look in my eyes, I can look into your eyes; we have behaved like normal adult human beings.</span> <span id="s2694">Nothing has been done that I should be ashamed to look at my wife, and you at your husband."</span> <span id="s2695">Like her husband knows everything, but he has no alternative.</span> <span id="s2696">It was a disease with her.</span> <span id="s2697">Like I said, she threw over 10, 12, 15 young men a day.</span> <span id="s2698">She was, as the way, she was a sickness.</span> <span id="s2699">And before leaving, she says to me, "Do you know how to make soap?"</span> <span id="s2700">I said, "Of course.</span> <span id="s2701">Why do you need soap for?"</span> <span id="s2702">She says, "There was a shortness of soap."</span> <span id="s2703">I said, "Where are you going to get the fat?"</span> <span id="s2704">She said, "We're going to kill a cow."</span> <span id="s2705">"Ah," I said, "you're going to kill a cow," I said, "Well, you know what?"</span> <span id="s2706">I said, "you keep a piece of the liver for me and a piece of the loins," and whatever I wanted her to save, I said, "save, and I'll make you the soap.</span> <span id="s2707">Keep all the fat for me."</span> <span id="s2708">I had about 100 kilo of fat, two big burlap bags full of fat.</span> <span id="s2709">I schlepped it home on the wheelbarrow.</span> <span id="s2710">Where we lived we moved and we had three rooms, one, two, three.</span> <span id="s2711">The house was built 900 years ago with blocks of lumber the size of this table; not a drop of cement or mortar, just put one block on top of the other, three stories high.</span> <span id="s2712">It's black lava; in the summer it's cool; in the winter it's cold.</span> <span id="s2713">But we have a fireplace the size of the wall, in which you put one whole oak or one whole chestnut tree.</span> <span id="s2714">And I schlepped this home.</span> <span id="s2715">Now we have no water in the house and there is no sewer, there is no sink.</span> <span id="s2716">We have a slab of stone going through a hole in the wall, where it runs into the sewer... in an open sewer.</span> <span id="s2717">The water runs constantly from the la source, what do you call a source, the spring.</span> <span id="s2718">Because there is a spring of water bringing the water to the village.</span> <span id="s2719">I bring it home.</span> <span id="s2720">And I start cleaning that fat and putting in all the pots I had and I started rendering it.</span> <span id="s2721">I made grieven [rendered fat].</span> <span id="s2722">You know what's grieven are?</span> <span id="s2723">That's delicious, you know.</span> <span id="s2724">I never missed an onion because there was plenty in the fields, so I grilled the schmalz with the onions, and I jarred it, put everything away.</span> <span id="s2725">Now I received from the Belgian Red Cross, two warm shirts, I took one shirt and went to the city.</span> <span id="s2726">I went to a hardware store, and I said, "What you can you give me?"</span> <span id="s2727">He wanted to give me one kilo of nails, and I wanted five kilo of nails.</span> <span id="s2728">He gave me the five kilo of nails.</span> <span id="s2729">I took two kilo of nails, and I went to a dairy store, and I said to the guy, "What can you give me?"</span> <span id="s2730">And the guy said, "I can give you cheese;" I said, "No, I want butter."</span> <span id="s2731">So for two kilo I collected five kilo of butter.</span> <span id="s2732">I split the butter in two, and I go to a guy who was having a laundry.</span> <span id="s2733">He was washing laundry for les chantiers de la jeunesse [youth groups].</span> <span id="s2734">When the Germans started taking the men, Marshal Petain at the time decided that all the young men between 16 and 22 or 23 must go to the les chantiers de la jeunesse, youth groups, and that fellow was washing the laundry and the sheets for that youth groups.</span> <span id="s2735">All the sheets were made from 100% pure linen, good for 200 years, at least, and he was washing.</span> <span id="s2736">He had his own electricity, because he lived on the foot of the mountain, and the water coming down activated a dynamo that activated the electricity for the machinery.</span> <span id="s2737">So I go to him with the butter and I said, "I need soap."</span> <span id="s2738">Now in view to wash the laundry, instead of using the good soap the Germans gave him, he was using pulverized powder from the mountain's volcano.</span> <span id="s2739">It's called pusilan [phonetic].</span> <span id="s2740">And he would mix ten kilo of pusilan with five kilo of soap, and he would clean the laundry, but it would tear apart in three months, and he didn't give a damn.</span> <span id="s2741">So I said, "I want ten kilo of soap, for two kilo of butter."</span> <span id="s2742">He said, "You're crazy."</span> <span id="s2743">I said, "I'll tell you what, make a deal, I'll give you a kilo of nails, and two kilo of butter.</span> <span id="s2744">I want 25 kilo of soap," and he gave me that.</span> <span id="s2745">Now, that soap was synthetic, full of pusilan, it weighed a ton, but it was more dirt than soap.</span> <span id="s2746">I take that home.</span> <span id="s2747">I had grieven and the schmaltz.</span> <span id="s2748">Now the schmaltz you cannot eat because it solidifies on the tongue, you know, that's beef.</span> <span id="s2749">But in the village there grew a lot of walnut trees, and there is a mill who makes walnut oil, so you mix the walnut oil with that grease and it comes up like margarine.</span> <span id="s2750">Turned out delicious, beautiful.</span> <span id="s2751">So I would go to the fields with Eliane on my shoulders; she was then 2 years old, and I would say, "Tatala, pick that."</span> <span id="s2752">and when the farmer would come, I'd say, "It's a child, what does she know."</span> <span id="s2753">And I had a sweater ten times too big, attached with a belt and I would shove it in.</span> <span id="s2754">I came home and I had fifteen kilo, thirty pounds of walnuts in my sweater.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">JF: Thirty pounds of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">BM: Walnuts.</span> <span id="s2757">And we sit at night with that knife, open them up, take the meat out and then I would go to the mill and I would get my three liters of oil.</span> <span id="s2758">You had to live by the "noodle!"</span> <span id="s2759">And then I came home in the village, the Belgian with the reputation--some stud!</span> <span id="s2760">Because she had amplified.</span> <span id="s2761">So when I came home, I was ashamed, of course, because when you love your wife, you do not try to deceive, but here it was, a question of trust.</span> <span id="s2762">I came back and I looked in her eyes, I said, I called her Chanelah [phonetic], "You know, Chanelah" I said, "we did not cheat."</span> <span id="s2763">She kissed me, she hugged me.</span> <span id="s2764">We spoke Yiddish, for the neighborhood it was called Flemish.</span> <span id="s2765">They never had seen a Jew in the village.</span> <span id="s2766">We were playing with dynamite three times a day.</span> <span id="s2767">And so, after this, there was a little episode in our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">JF: Did you continue to trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">BM: Always, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">JF: With this woman you're talking about?</span> <span id="s2771">Or was it just this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">BM: No, that's the only time I would go to her, eh, how much--I'm only a man.</span> <span id="s2773">I'm only flesh and blood.</span> <span id="s2774">I can hold my head on the shoulders.</span> <span id="s2775">There were so many occasions, I don't want to speak of it, it's not even nice to be told, but it was war time.</span> <span id="s2776">In the orthopedics shop, we had allocations for elastic and rubber, for you know, varicose veins stockings.</span> <span id="s2777">In view to get it, or ph--what do you call it, condoms, you know, preservatives, [French: condoms], we had allocations.</span> <span id="s2778">So when the farmer would come down and he would ask me, "You have any condoms?"</span> <span id="s2779">and I would say, "We have a few but we cannot get them."</span> <span id="s2780">I would say, "What can you give me?"</span> <span id="s2781">We didn't want any money.</span> <span id="s2782">He would bring a side of pork, a half a sheep, a little trundle of butter, or a bag of flour, or a little bottle, five liters of cognac.</span> <span id="s2783">Not for--to barter.</span> <span id="s2784">Money was of no idea.</span> <span id="s2785">So here comes in a very elegant woman, I mean real crème de la crème, because over there was the old noblesse, from the olden days.</span> <span id="s2786">And she had prescription for stockings for varicose veins going into the groin.</span> <span id="s2787">In the orthopedic field, to me the human body is like for a physician, my comments I keep to myself, because that's all there is to.</span> <span id="s2788">Anatomy is anatomy.</span> <span id="s2789">A woman is a woman; a man is a man.</span> <span id="s2790">It's bigger, it's smaller, it's pretty or it's agreeable.</span> <span id="s2791">That's all.</span> <span id="s2792">Here comes a woman with I mean, chic.</span> <span id="s2793">And she has a prescription for long stockings.</span> <span id="s2794">The first thing you ask, "What is your occupation?"</span> <span id="s2795">Because the money is not important; you want to know if she bakes bread or if she makes catfish.</span> <span id="s2796">So she said, "My husband is chef du ravitaillement [chief of food distribution].</span> <span id="s2797">He is the one who controls the inbringing of food in the department and the distribution to the commune, the neighborhoods."</span> <span id="s2798">Well, that's all I had to know!</span> <span id="s2799">I said to her, "Madame," I said, "because you have a prescription, but to the prescription, we don't get the necessary allocations to get the elastic to make it.</span> <span id="s2800">For me in view to have that allocation of elastic, I will have to bribe.</span> <span id="s2801">And in view to bribe I have nothing."</span> <span id="s2802">"What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s2803">That's what I was waiting for!</span> <span id="s2804">She brought me down a case of condensed milk, and she brought me down a case of children's cereal and bags of sugar.</span> <span id="s2805">A man drove down a car and brought me maybe ten boxes.</span> <span id="s2806">Then I measured for the stockings.</span> <span id="s2807">Now you know, it was wartime, many men were missing.</span> <span id="s2808">And women are human beings too.</span> <span id="s2809">French woman is not worse than another, but a little bit more osée [daring].</span> <span id="s2810">Her husband was always on the road.</span> <span id="s2811">She was very charming.</span> <span id="s2812">So I measuring the stocking, and I measured.</span> <span id="s2813">She was laying down on the oscultation bed.</span> <span id="s2814">And I go from the groin to the ankle.</span> <span id="s2815">And she passes her fingers in my ear.</span> <span id="s2816">And I figured that's it.</span> <span id="s2817">It's not the first time, but I'm always scared of it.</span> <span id="s2818">You never know with whom you're dealing.</span> <span id="s2819">I lift my head, I said, "Is there anything wrong?"</span> <span id="s2820">She said, "You are so beautiful; you are so charming.</span> <span id="s2821">Do you have evenings off?"</span> <span id="s2822">"Oh," I said, "I'm married; I have a wife and children, and I live in Volvic.</span> <span id="s2823">See, my insurance!"</span> <span id="s2824">"Oh," she said, "En tout bien et tout honneur" [with honorable intention].</span> <span id="s2825">I said, "Je comprends naturelment" [I understand very well].</span> <span id="s2826">I said, after all, I'm going to make her a woman of low morale, now, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">JF: Translate it for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">BM: After you shut off the machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">(OFF RECORD)</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">BM: ...be made and sent to Lyon.</span> <span id="s2831">So I take the measurements, and send away the stocking to Lyon, and I told her, "When I have the stockings for a fitting, I will call you."</span> <span id="s2832">She said, "No, when it's ready for fitting, let me know, my chauffeur will pick you up.</span> <span id="s2833">I don't have reason to come up here, and it's easier for me."</span> <span id="s2834">Well, already I have experienced, and I know how to behave, because I have my love for me and my security; I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s2835">This is a big thing.</span> <span id="s2836">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s2837">Three weeks later, I get one stocking.</span> <span id="s2838">Call her up, "I'd like to fit."</span> <span id="s2839">She said, "Would you like to have supper?"</span> <span id="s2840">So I had no telephone in Volvic, so I called the post office and said to the post office, "Call my wife that tonight I cannot home, I'll come home tomorrow night."</span> <span id="s2841">I go up for supper.</span> <span id="s2842">She has the table set.</span> <span id="s2843">"My husband is in Vichy, won't come back until tomorrow."</span> <span id="s2844">I said, "That's nice."</span> <span id="s2845">I start speaking of the children, of my wife, how beautiful you are.</span> <span id="s2846">I said that right before supper.</span> <span id="s2847">And in the meantime, I eat.</span> <span id="s2848">Because I can talk and eat, you wouldn't believe it, I can outeat a storage meter.</span> <span id="s2849">I ate.</span> <span id="s2850">When the war was finished, I came back to Belgium, and I received my rations of food for the five years I was [not] in Belgium, and I was allowed to buy 600 kilo of bread or 6000 kilo of bread and I was allowed to buy 20,000 herring.</span> <span id="s2851">I bought, my sister gave her my apartment.</span> <span id="s2852">I didn't have anywhere to live, and I used to buy my food in a certain point where I lived before the war.</span> <span id="s2853">I carried in my rucksack a pail in which I had sixty herring, and I bought three loaves of big, three loaves of bread and two kilo of butter.</span> <span id="s2854">I could take a loaf of bread from the pound, slice it in two, put a half of butter, squash it, and take a bowl of coffee, dunk it and before you had time to say Constantinople--so hungry.</span> <span id="s2855">I ate twelve herring with the bones, the skin, the heads.</span> <span id="s2856">And when my wife told me "Bernard, where is it?"</span> <span id="s2857">"Oh," I said, "I was too hungry, I couldn't see it."</span> <span id="s2858">So that's the kind of a guy I am, people enjoyed watching me eating.</span> <span id="s2859">Thank God, I got all my teeth so far.</span> <span id="s2860">And then she said, she again came to me, she said, "You know, it's a lonesome evening."</span> <span id="s2861">I said, "Madame, you know I have to deal with you.</span> <span id="s2862">It's against policy of the company that I should get involved with people: it is too dangeureux [dangerous].</span> <span id="s2863">Your husband comes in, my employer will find out, I'll lose a job.</span> <span id="s2864">Do you want this to happen?</span> <span id="s2865">Why don't we remain good friends?"</span> <span id="s2866">"Good friends can kiss."</span> <span id="s2867">So I kissed her, and she was a happy woman.</span> <span id="s2868">And I measured her stocking.</span> <span id="s2869">I gave her a kitsle [a tickling squeeze].</span> <span id="s2870">You have no alternative.</span> <span id="s2871">And when I came home the following day, I told my wife and she laughed.</span> <span id="s2872">She said, "Bernard, are you going through temptation!"</span> <span id="s2873">In the meantime, my wife became pregnant, and we expected a little girl.</span> <span id="s2874">And this was the worst period in our lives--not to get pregnant.</span> <span id="s2875">But look, we cannot do anything else, so Yvette was born in April '42.</span> <span id="s2876">And I was operating the Resistance.</span> <span id="s2877">Now, we're going to stop now because it is 2:20.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">[This is a continuation of the interview with Mr. Mednicki on April 30, 1982.]</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">BM: So when the pregnancy went through, we were, of course, very concerned, having very little food, and I was very involved in the work with Capitain Duhin.</span> <span id="s2880">So when the time came, I was able to scrounge together, from French refugees from Paris, a few little medicine bottles, eight ounce bottles of gasoline; and one fellow took out his car from underneath the hay, and he took a chance and drove me down to the maternity in Riom.</span> <span id="s2881">In the maternity of Riom, the hospital was called l'Hotel Dieu, The House of God.</span> <span id="s2882">It was very primitive, built, God knows, maybe 900 years ago.</span> <span id="s2883">The alcoves, instead of beds in the maternity, were cut out underneath, underneath staircases from stone.</span> <span id="s2884">And that's where little Yvette Rolande was born.</span> <span id="s2885">Luckily, my wife was able to breast-feed her.</span> <span id="s2886">After spending ten days in the maternity, while I was involved taking care on the children; I had Armand home already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">JF: How long was Armand in the sanitarium following hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">BM: Just before Yvette was born.</span> <span id="s2889">He was home just before Yvette was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">JF: He had been away for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">BM: From September--until September the following year.</span> <span id="s2892">From '40, to '41, Armand was away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">JF: A year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">BM: Yes, a year, between the sanitarium and the preventorium.</span> <span id="s2895">And the preventorium was in chamallière, of course, in the city of Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s2896">That's where they recuperated the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">JF: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2898">You had questioned before whether or not Armand might be identified as a Jew during his hospitalization?</span> <span id="s2899">Did anything like that ever occur?</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">BM: Never, no one has ever questioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">JF: No one ever asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">BM: I think that there must have been some kind of a--let's not mix up the troubled waters, even if he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s2903">They don't ask, I don't know, and there was nothing happening from it.</span> <span id="s2904">And Armand never told me about it.</span> <span id="s2905">So this period went through very quietly.</span> <span id="s2906">So we brought back Yvette in a horse and donkeycart, and she came home, and the neighborhood couldn't understand how come the refugee has another child, but that was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">And at that time then, after I secured everything home, I went back to my occupations.</span> <span id="s2908">And slowly, Yvette was doing very well.</span> <span id="s2909">In fact, the lady next door who had everything she needed, very wealthy family, long generations evolving, was wondering what Yvette was fed with, so good-looking she was.</span> <span id="s2910">And we practically had no food.</span> <span id="s2911">Like I told you previously, we had to stay in line for everything we could get, for stamps.</span> <span id="s2912">And financially, I wasn't well; I was living on a subsidy from the Belgian Red Cross, where Capitain Duhin was instrumental, plus I was able to get from Capitain Duhin once in a while, something.</span> <span id="s2913">So Yvette came home, and in the meantime, I went back to my occupations.</span> <span id="s2914">And I was working at Streisgood.</span> <span id="s2915">And working at Streisgood then this attack of the Gestapo happened into the town of Clermont-Ferrand, that's the raid where the University of Strasburg was raided, and arrested.</span> <span id="s2916">Most of the leaders of the Resistance were from Alsace-Lorraine.</span> <span id="s2917">When I came down that morning, two of my friends in the bus were arrested.</span> <span id="s2918">The Gestapo was waiting, and they picked them both up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">JF: That was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">BM: That was in '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">JF: In '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">BM: Yes, it must have been September.</span> <span id="s2923">September, '42, yes.</span> <span id="s2924">See, dates are not very clear, because the truth is that when the events happened home, I never had in mind of tabulating or keeping track or holding a record, or putting down on paper anything.</span> <span id="s2925">I never thought that it would be of family importance.</span> <span id="s2926">The importance was the moment that we lived.</span> <span id="s2927">So therefore, the fact that I have no documents besides official papers that I have received during that period, from Capitain Duhin, and later on from, different administrations, I have no pictures--I have nothing.</span> <span id="s2928">Sometime I wonder how come people have pictures, but to me, at that time, it was not important.</span> <span id="s2929">Of course, now, when I travel, I know better.</span> <span id="s2930">I take and I keep a diary, and I keep a day-book, and so on the log, but then I had nothing, so therefore, with dates, I am very much mixed up.</span> <span id="s2931">I only know what happened at that time when it happened, and when I went to the office that day of the raid--in the city you see that the news not widespread.</span> <span id="s2932">Radio was not there, we had no radio; television didn't exist, of course.</span> <span id="s2933">The paper was controlled, only was printed what they wanted, and then we didn't buy the paper because we didn't have the means.</span> <span id="s2934">So we actually did not know much of the news what was going on.</span> <span id="s2935">So when I came down to Clermont-Ferrand and I saw that the city was full of SS, and soldiers running back and forth, it was something disturbing.</span> <span id="s2936">I went to my place of business, to the orthopedic shop, and as I come in--there was a corridor in two places.</span> <span id="s2937">Like I said, an orthopedic shop on the left, and the ladies garment shop on the right.</span> <span id="s2938">They made corsets, bras, combinaisons [slips], you know, underwear for ladies, and there was about twelve or fourteen ladies involved there.</span> <span id="s2939">I had nothing to do with that department.</span> <span id="s2940">And as I come in, there was a man in the back, and I was asking him, "What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s2941">I thought it was an Alsacian, because we had many refugees who would come to the store, or they would bring in information, or they would come to ask for some help, and Dr. Streisgood was from Alsace-Lorraine like I told you previously, so I was familiar with those people.</span> <span id="s2942">And that fellow in the back was wearing a typical outfit of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2943">He was wearing a loden coat, leather, a black beret, and two hands in his pockets, and you would see the point of guns.</span> <span id="s2944">He approached me and said, "Geheime Staatspolizei."</span> <span id="s2945">And Geheime Staatspolizei means Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2946">I said, "What can I do, what do you want?"</span> <span id="s2947">Right away, you know, all ideas run into your mind.</span> <span id="s2948">"Streisgood."</span> <span id="s2949">I said, "Dr. Streisgood is not there."</span> <span id="s2950">As we spoke he came up from the basement where he was putting a guest, Dr. Streisgood.</span> <span id="s2951">And he arrested him, and he made us in, in the right side, I didn't know, but there was huge group of Gestapo on the right side, and as I came in, with the Gestapo, and Dr. Streisgood, I see two Belgian young fellows; otherwise there were some other nationality, Gestapo with them.</span> <span id="s2952">And they were all discussing, everybody was under the commandant employees.</span> <span id="s2953">I looked at the Belgians, and I asked them, "Do you speak Flemish?"</span> <span id="s2954">And they said, "Yes", so I started speaking the slang of the street, and to them, it was like a delight, to have somebody to speak the slang.</span> <span id="s2955">So they asked me what am I doing here, and I said, "I'm an orthopedist, and I work here, and my wife lives in the mountains, and I have a son who is very sick, and a baby who was very sick," and you know, you make it very pathetic.</span> <span id="s2956">And of course, I said, "I'm waiting for the Führer.</span> <span id="s2957">To make a way for us to come back, and to get out from France," I said, "We don't like it here.</span> <span id="s2958">We want to go back," I said, "to live in the Fatherland with all the Belgians."</span> <span id="s2959">"Oh," he said, "that's the spirit."</span> <span id="s2960">In the meantime, the German turns around and he speaks to him in German and he said, "What's that?"</span> <span id="s2961">"Oh," he said, "this is one of my good brothers," he said.</span> <span id="s2962">"He's a national."</span> <span id="s2963">I showed him my identity card, Bernard Mednicki.</span> <span id="s2964">There was nothing to tell him who I was and my heart was beating, because in the orthopedic shop, I had a bunch of documents belonging to Capitaine [Captain] Duhin, but it was between stockings and between orthopedic appliances on the shelves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">JF: You mean documents saying that you were part of the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">BM: No, no, this was nowheres written.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">BM: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2969">That's one thing you never do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">JF: There was nothing in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">BM: There was nothing; but there were some documents, propaganda dropped from the English; and I had a label that I found, from London you know, little momentums, but it was documents, enough to incriminate.</span> <span id="s2972">So after they put everybody in the van, there was no room for me, so the Belgian said, "Wait, we'll come back for you later; we need you for the inquiry.</span> <span id="s2973">But you are clean."</span> <span id="s2974">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s2975">As they left, I went in and took all the papers in my pocket, and called up Duhin on the telephone and he said, "Bernard, last night was bloody murder, they arrested all apparel of the Resistance in Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s2976">And they arrested the student group, and they dissolved everything, and it was murder.</span> <span id="s2977">A lot of killed."</span> <span id="s2978">I said, "What I do now?"</span> <span id="s2979">He said, "Bernard, listen, you take to the mountains; go to the Maquis now.</span> <span id="s2980">And as you go to the Maquis," he said, "you will become part of the Resistance, but what part of the Resistance; you are finished working with me."</span> <span id="s2981">"But in Volvic I have a lousy reputation as a collaborator."</span> <span id="s2982">He said, "I know, but the commanding officer," he said, "from Volvic, by the alias Fox.</span> <span id="s2983">I will give him a call."</span> <span id="s2984">See, they had telephones, put from different spots through the farms; the Resistance nest, through the entrees of the telephone, we would go in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s2985">And, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">JF: This man's alias was again...</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">BM: He was the head of our company.</span> <span id="s2988">His name was Soleavoup, that's a French name, Soleavoup, but his alias was Fox.</span> <span id="s2989">F-O-X.</span> <span id="s2990">That's Fox in American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">JF: Was that with the meaning also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">BM: He is a fox, that's right.</span> <span id="s2993">He was a smart cookie.</span> <span id="s2994">And you must be; if not he couldn't be the head of our department, the head of the group, you know, he was a Capitaine [Captain].</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">JF: So he was with the Maquis...</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">BM: Naturally, he was a seasoned fighter from another region, and we never asked questions, because in case you have to fall in the hands of Gestapo; if you don't know, you cannot tell.</span> <span id="s2997">So we didn't ask, and we didn't tell.</span> <span id="s2998">So this was about 10:30, 11:00 in the morning, and the bus never leaves before six o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s2999">So I walked about twelve and a half miles up the mountains, back to Volvic.</span> <span id="s3000">Came to the house, and I changed my clothes, and from the Belgian Red Cross, I had received fatigues from the Belgian Army, I put this on.</span> <span id="s3001">And I kissed my wife, and I told her what's happening, and I said, "We cannot help it; don't cry, it's going to be all right."</span> <span id="s3002">Armand was then going to school, public school, in Volvic; Eliane was a baby, a little girl, and Yvette was in a crib, of course.</span> <span id="s3003">Tape 4, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">BM: I took off from the house, like I said, dressed in fatigues.</span> <span id="s3005">And I had said to my wife, "I'll see the best I can do to be in touch with you."</span> <span id="s3006">And I left.</span> <span id="s3007">I am going to pass by the emotional impact of this departure.</span> <span id="s3008">If we have survived without major defects, it's a miracle.</span> <span id="s3009">I climbed the mountain.</span> <span id="s3010">I was smart enough not to take the roads, because the roads were patrolled by some Germans.</span> <span id="s3011">There was always a little plane flying, we don't know why, a spy, he would come from the airport of Clermont-Ferrand and he would fly around the woods, to try find where was the Resistance nest.</span> <span id="s3012">So therefore I took through the woods.</span> <span id="s3013">And as I was climbing, after about an hour, an hour and a half, I heard, "Stop!</span> <span id="s3014">We've got you covered!"</span> <span id="s3015">Now, I know that the Resistance had a file on me as a collaborator and I know that I was on their list.</span> <span id="s3016">So when I heard, "We've got you covered," I stopped and I hollered, I said, "Don't shoot, I came to give myself up."</span> <span id="s3017">Well, I know the rules are shoot first, and question later; my hands went up automatically and they start poking me in the ribs with machine guns.</span> <span id="s3018">As I told them, "I want to see your commanding officer, Commander Fox."</span> <span id="s3019">They relented a little bit; nevertheless, they thought it was a ploy for my sight.</span> <span id="s3020">And another one came and said, "Finally, we got him, finally we got him."</span> <span id="s3021">Must be very unpleasant and I was scared, terribly scared.</span> <span id="s3022">As we came up from through the bushes, an immense plateau, where walnuts and chestnut trees were growing for many, many decades, immense trees.</span> <span id="s3023">Underneath those trees, was the camp of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3024">There were shacks, stables, hovels.</span> <span id="s3025">And as I approached from one of them to the other, a man came out from one of the houses, shaking his arm, and hollering, "Welcome, Bernard."</span> <span id="s3026">As he hollered, "Welcome, Bernard," the fellows removed their guns from my back, and I run, I did not walk, we fell into the arms of each other, and he said, "Robert just called me and told me about you."</span> <span id="s3027">Well, then the fellows, of course, started getting very happy about finding out that I was not a collaborator.</span> <span id="s3028">After the first time the rejoicings went over, I was given two hand grenades and a pistol, and with this, I was told to go and get my own weapons.</span> <span id="s3029">Because we were not rich enough at that time in our Maquis; because there was more important places where ammunition and weapons had to go.</span> <span id="s3030">We were very rich, was in explosives, in sabotage material, because that was the purpose of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3031">To sabotage the war for the Nazis in any angle; blowing railroads, electric, supporting the cable support, dams, tunnels, bridges.</span> <span id="s3032">Naturally, the price was paid, because every time something like this happened, in their brutality they would come to the village, take ten men, twenty women, shoot them, without question; trying to stymie our enthusiasm for sabotage.</span> <span id="s3033">It is not in the nature of a Jew to be bloody, and I knew in the village a farmer that showed me that he had saved his weapons from the first World War.</span> <span id="s3034">So I went to him, and with gentle persuasion, I showed him my two hand grenades on the belt, hanging, and I said, "Please give it to me without me forcing to get it."</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">JF: What was the name of the village that you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">BM: Volvic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">JF: This was still Volvic.</span> <span id="s3038">You were still central there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">BM: Everything was in Volvic.</span> <span id="s3040">The farmer gave me the rifle, who was a French Lebel 1914, and a bottle with fifty cartridges, kept well.</span> <span id="s3041">And I took my weapons, climbed back to my mountain and I asked the commanding officer, "I can understand the pistol, but two hand grenades, but why two hand grenades?"</span> <span id="s3042">He said, "In case you would be attacked, you would throw one, and the other one, under your belt, you open and blow yourself, because you don't want to fall in the hands of the Gestapo or SS."</span> <span id="s3043">It made sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">JF: Were there any other Jews in this group that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">BM: There was one, a Russian Jew from Paris, who was not a Jew, at least he declared himself not a Jew, but he wanted to play the role of a commissar.</span> <span id="s3046">He was a communist, and he wanted to play the role of a commissar, but we just left out of him.</span> <span id="s3047">He was not a tactician, and he was not a planner, and he was not a diplomat.</span> <span id="s3048">He was just a little arrogant snip of a Jew, and I made believe that I ignored him.</span> <span id="s3049">And he wanted to impress.</span> <span id="s3050">And like I said, a little dictator.</span> <span id="s3051">He wanted to be a commissar.</span> <span id="s3052">That didn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">JF: Did you ever talk with each other about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">BM: Ummm, mmm [no].</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">JF: Or you both pretended that you were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">BM: I could see that he is Jewish, because his name was Jewish, and I think that he was known as a Jew.</span> <span id="s3057">And I didn't recognize him, and I didn't tell, because once I took that tremendous responsibility of denying what I am, then I could not until things went better.</span> <span id="s3058">See, because we had to make allowances in case Hitler wins the war--what happens then?</span> <span id="s3059">So we decided, we'd climb all the way up, really in the mountains, and get close with farmers and sit to survive as much we can, and go to church, do like our ancestors did in Spain.</span> <span id="s3060">For survival purpose.</span> <span id="s3061">It never happened.</span> <span id="s3062">We were very thankful for that.</span> <span id="s3063">So, after I get my weapons, the fellows admired the Lebel--it was a huge rifle, very clumsy, very heavy, from the first World War.</span> <span id="s3064">The commanding officer said to me, "Bernard, you know how to shoot it well?"</span> <span id="s3065">I said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s3066">Never had a gun in--I was besides in the carnival.</span> <span id="s3067">But this was something else.</span> <span id="s3068">I put a bullet, an accurate bullet and after I gave the first press on the trigger, the ricochet made me fly back fifteen feet and everybody laughing.</span> <span id="s3069">So as of then, I never carried a rifle; I always had a bag of grenades.</span> <span id="s3070">I became a grenadier.</span> <span id="s3071">The hand grenade was the best weapon for me.</span> <span id="s3072">And that's the way I became Resistance.</span> <span id="s3073">Now I needed a uniform, and in view to get a uniform, our uniform was a brassard, an armband.</span> <span id="s3074">I don't know from what miraculous way, but we stick together enough material from a bag of flour, to make an armband from old hats.</span> <span id="s3075">We had girls with us, too.</span> <span id="s3076">From old hats, we were able to cut out pieces of felt, and we sewed on, and we made FFI, Force Française de L'intérieur [French Force of the Interior] and then with a rubber stamp, we had an official stamp, the FFI, the Croix de Lorraine [Lorraine Cross], and this I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">JF: You still have your armband?</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">BM: That's my uniform.</span> <span id="s3079">This I carry with me.</span> <span id="s3080">If you stop the machine, I'll bring it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">(OFF RECORD)</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">JF: Tell me the reason for using the armband in terms of the treatment that you would get if you were caught wearing this armband.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">BM: It was a known fact that as of the occupying of the Nazis whoever was in the Resistance was a terrorist.</span> <span id="s3084">A terrorist was summarily tried and shot.</span> <span id="s3085">So, therefore, for us to be regular army, of General de Gaulle and called Force Française de L'Intéreur [French Force of the Interior], we wore armbands or a patch.</span> <span id="s3086">It was a distinction between those who were from the FTPF, Franc Tireur et Partisan Français [French Shooter and Partisan], the left wing of the Movement de Resistance.</span> <span id="s3087">They were extremely active, but they were not supported by General de Gaulle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">JF: They were considered the terrorists.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">BM: They were considered terrorists, so were we!</span> <span id="s3090">Not that they give us special treatment, but for history, and for payment of later on, the justice, we could claim that we were officially the Army of France, fighting the enemy.</span> <span id="s3091">De Gaulle had said we lost the battle; we did not lose a war.</span> <span id="s3092">He made a statement that the Force Française de L'Interieur and his army in France, where he cannot come, but then when he debarcated, when he came into France, automatically, the French Army had sovereignty over the FFI.</span> <span id="s3093">And that's where, because I was a Belgian, I could legally step out.</span> <span id="s3094">I could have served in France, but I did have the tremendous desire to go back and see what's happening to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">JF: If you were then under De Gaulle's...</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">BM: authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">JF: Had you been captured, would you have been shot, or would you have been treated according to the laws of the Geneva Convention?</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">BM: Shot!</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">JF: You would have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">BM: We would have been shot.</span> <span id="s3101">They wanted us to observe the laws of the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s3102">They screamed bloody murder if we didn't, and I must say in all fairness, that we didn't.</span> <span id="s3103">Because there was no way we should, after what they had done.</span> <span id="s3104">They approached some of our friends.</span> <span id="s3105">He was a pharmacist and she was a pharmacist; and she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s3106">They inserted in her body, in her vagina, a machine gun, and we found her body with nineteen bullets shot into her.</span> <span id="s3107">We found him later, his lungs floating outside his cavity.</span> <span id="s3108">They had opened the rib cage and pulled the lungs out.</span> <span id="s3109">We found them dead like that, both of them in the forest.</span> <span id="s3110">We found the bodies of our friends, and remember those two friends of mine that were arrested coming down from autobus, from Volvic to Clermont-Ferrand before the raid, we found their bodies.</span> <span id="s3111">They were tall, six footers, and they were so tall that they broke their legs, to be able to put them in boxes, and they buried them in the forest underneath the trees.</span> <span id="s3112">Later on, their bodies were found, and we made national funerals in Volvic.</span> <span id="s3113">And I was one of them who carried the boxes on our shoulders, and I was on the night honor watch.</span> <span id="s3114">There was no embalming and there was no metal caskets.</span> <span id="s3115">In view to remain awake, we were drinking gallons not liters, gallons of brandy, because the stench of the decomposition of the body.</span> <span id="s3116">And the morning was the funeral, and it was a state funeral in the village of Volvic.</span> <span id="s3117">And there was done by the Nazi, but then they wanted Convention of Geneva, and that Americans gave it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">JF: These people were all in the Resistance...</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">BM: Yes, the Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">JF: ...the pharmacists, and this is what happened during the war by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">BM: In 1943!</span> <span id="s3122">So you understand, I have never been back in Germany--never!</span> <span id="s3123">I traveled all over the world, and I was by accident once, our plane was detoured because of bad weather, and I wind in Frankfurt, and you wouldn't believe how my heart was pounding.</span> <span id="s3124">And I felt the blood seeping from the stones of Germany.</span> <span id="s3125">Couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s3126">Of course, it's very hard, when you are emotionally involved, and when you have paid so dear, with the ones you love, and all your people, to have much love.</span> <span id="s3127">But that's part of being Jewish, I presume.</span> <span id="s3128">We cannot keep hatred, if not we would have to hate humanity, and we are not a people with hate.</span> <span id="s3129">This is part of our problem, I am afraid.</span> <span id="s3130">We should have a little bit more, although it's not possible.</span> <span id="s3131">We are what we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">So, let me come back to my story, now.</span> <span id="s3133">So, I had my uniform, my Brassard, and life in the Maquis was not easy.</span> <span id="s3134">There was a group of fellows scrounging the countryside for food.</span> <span id="s3135">They knew the mountains, they knew the farmers; was very rich land.</span> <span id="s3136">And they would bring down whatever they could.</span> <span id="s3137">Sometimes we had wheels of cheese, and barrels of wine; sometimes we ate a pig that we had to stick.</span> <span id="s3138">While the pig was still squeaking, we tore it apart.</span> <span id="s3139">Sometimes we had bread.</span> <span id="s3140">We went into actions at night, most of the time blowing up electric stations, and sabotaging railways, railway signals.</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">JF: You mean putting explosives...</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">BM: Naturally, yes, plastic explosives with detonators, that we received from London, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">JF: From London.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">BM: Yes, London with parachutes, like I did previously with Capitaine Duhin.</span> <span id="s3145">Now Capitaine Duhin, later on, was part of intelligence on the higher level.</span> <span id="s3146">And, in one of his operations, around France, around Montarg is exactly, he was wounded, and he was wounded badly, and he was smuggled out of different departments until he was smuggled into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s3147">From Switzerland, he was able through Portugal, to go to London.</span> <span id="s3148">When he came to London, I do not recall exactly how, but I received notice that I should wait for a message from him through the radio.</span> <span id="s3149">See, up in the Maquis, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s3150">I don't know if you recall, if you ever read, maybe, because you are too young to recall; you weren't even born and, you were a baby maybe, so at that time London had signals and coded message.</span> <span id="s3151">Like, for instance, "The Black Cat from Bliteriss [?]</span> <span id="s3152">danced twice," and they repeated it twice.</span> <span id="s3153">Then we had a message who said, "The Black Cat has arrived; everything is good," and repeat it twice.</span> <span id="s3154">The Black Cat was my Capitaine Robert Duhin was in London, and he could sent a message to tell me that he was there--I was not only the one who was anxious about this behavior and his going and coming, so we knew that he was in London.</span> <span id="s3155">I am jumping ahead of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">JF: How would he get to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">BM: I told you, from Switzerland, he crossed over from Switzerland, Evian and the French-Italian border, and went up to the Pyrenees, and he went through Spain, and from Spain, into Portugal, and from Portugal to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">JF: On a boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">BM: Of course, Portugal was neutral.</span> <span id="s3160">That's the way he came to London.</span> <span id="s3161">Then later on, he was in the occupation army of France, and he was a judge in Schweinfurt.</span> <span id="s3162">He was presiding over the destiny of traitors and Nazis, and when...</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">JF: He was a judge after the war in...</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">BM: He was part of the French Army d'Occupation, and with the French Army d'Occupation, he was a judge and he was able to distribute justice, and order and distribute justice, doing it in a justifiable way.</span> <span id="s3165">He couldn't just allow his emotions to take revenge, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s3166">He was part of French, German--French, American, English and a Russian, quadruple tribunal always.</span> <span id="s3167">But nevertheless, later on, when we saw each other, we met twenty five years later.</span> <span id="s3168">Twenty-five, that's a long story, I get involved, okay, I get side-tracked.</span> <span id="s3169">So after we fought, we went on expeditions.</span> <span id="s3170">And once in a while we were able to come home, and we would bring food.</span> <span id="s3171">And the village was considering, my family with more kindness, and with those in Resistance, we were a large group of fellows from the mountains, where we lived in the village, and there were merchants of cheese and wine, selling groceries, and their wives would support the wives who were didn't have, you know.</span> <span id="s3172">And I wasn't of no help of course, I was a refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">JF: Did the people in the village then know that you were in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">BM: Of course not, they didn't know I was in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3175">And the priest of the village, Father Mathieu, he was an elderly man, and all the refugees--and he was bothered by the fact that I never went to church, or sent my family, because I wasn't Protestant, but we were Christians and that satisfied him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">JF: Did you know of any priests who were helpful to Jews in the areas in which you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">BM: No, there was no Jews in Volvic, period.</span> <span id="s3178">There never was; they never saw any.</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">JF: So you were not acquainted on a personal basis, then, with any of the rescue operations or hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">BM: No, but I know of people coming to Volvic who were not officially Jews, that I could in my emotions, feel that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s3181">And they would go further--we'd direct them to Evian, from there to Chambon.</span> <span id="s3182">You've heard of the operation at Le Chambon?</span> <span id="s3183">Many people from Volvic went to Le Chambon, and we were aware of this.</span> <span id="s3184">Le Chambon, but in a very vague way.</span> <span id="s3185">We didn't know the name of it.</span> <span id="s3186">We know it was somewhere and that's it.</span> <span id="s3187">The rescue operations--no, Volvic was a dangerous nest.</span> <span id="s3188">The Gestapo occupied the village and Hotel Martinon.</span> <span id="s3189">You know, every village has a main street.</span> <span id="s3190">And we had two hotels, one across the city, also one on the main street.</span> <span id="s3191">The main street, you had the fountain and you had the church, and on the left side just Place des Vieillards, the old home, then below was the priest's home and the fields.</span> <span id="s3192">It was only a village.</span> <span id="s3193">They grew vineyard and lots of vegetables, but mostly that was a quarry town; they exploded the lava from the volcano that was extinct for 25,000 years.</span> <span id="s3194">And after all that time, I start knowing the people; they start knowing me and they were not a friendly bunch, they were "correct."</span> <span id="s3195">They were not garrulous, they were not like the Marseillais, who was all songs and dance, and they are mountaineers working hard for everything they have.</span> <span id="s3196">And life was not easy, although we managed to go by.</span> <span id="s3197">Because I was bending according to the needs.</span> <span id="s3198">I would break my back to help everyone, and in return I could get a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">JF: Were you able to see your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">BM: Once in a while.</span> <span id="s3201">I would come down every few weeks, but I would get a report from the priest who would come and visit us.</span> <span id="s3202">And he would tell me, "The children are well, your wife is well, and this wife is well."</span> <span id="s3203">And then he would go to the farmers and he would bring down a gift to all the families that needed it.</span> <span id="s3204">You know, the Belgians had nothing, because we had nothing.</span> <span id="s3205">This one here, a cousin in the mountain, this one had a cousin in the city; but we...</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">JF: You had no extended family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">BM: That's it.</span> <span id="s3208">So we had nothing, and there he helped us.</span> <span id="s3209">And we went again.</span> <span id="s3210">Our job mainly was disturbing, for inasmuch it was possible in all activities the German life.</span> <span id="s3211">Like I said to you, blowing the electric stations, disturbing traffic, robbing.</span> <span id="s3212">For instance the cigarette industry is a monopoly, so the Germans grabbed the Fabrique Cigarette, the cigarette fabrique [factory] in Riom.</span> <span id="s3213">It was only about two and a half hours going down the mountain.</span> <span id="s3214">They give to the French just enough tobacco to go by and they took everything for them to Germany for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s3215">So we made a raid on the cigarette factory, and we stole two truckloads of tobacco.</span> <span id="s3216">That was part of us; we attacked a couple of banks; we needed money.</span> <span id="s3217">Les Chantiers de la Jeunesse [youth work organization], that was Général Pétain had made that all the young people between the age of sixteen and twenty one, in view not to be taken by the Germans, to be sent away to work in Germany, he kept them, Chantiers de la Jeuness; they would do reforesting work, keeping the roads clean, and they were dressed in uniforms with sticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">JF: They were dressed in French...</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">BM: French uniforms, you know, green felt pants, black leather jacket, and the beret.</span> <span id="s3220">In fact, that's the uniform.</span> <span id="s3221">We robbed one of the--we didn't rob, we took, we attacked one of their stock centers, and we took the six watchmen and we tied them.</span> <span id="s3222">We didn't harm them, because they were youngsters.</span> <span id="s3223">We tied them, and we took out everything we needed, shoes without nails, and underwear, everything we needed, and we loaded ourselves because we had no transportation.</span> <span id="s3224">We were a nice group, maybe thirty people, and we all carried a bundle up the mountain.</span> <span id="s3225">Of course, later on, was the repercussion.</span> <span id="s3226">The town was punished for this and that, and they didn't get allocation of the milk or the butter or--there was always a punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">JF: This group that the town set by, were they under the auspices of the army, or they were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">BM: They were--there was no army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">JF: There was no army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">BM: It was under the government, the French wasn't allowed an army from the Germans.</span> <span id="s3231">The Germans did not allow the French to have any army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">JF: This was a government sponsored...</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">BM: Sponsored movement de Jeunesse, a youth movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">JF: And was this okay with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">BM: Yes, this they allowed, to repair the roads and the reforestration, and cleaning of the culverts, and things like that.</span> <span id="s3236">This was allowed.</span> <span id="s3237">But we had to have clothing, because the winters were getting rough, and we had nothing to wear.</span> <span id="s3238">So here was a storehouse, a warehouse full of stuff, so we decided with the authority of our commandant that we should take what we need.</span> <span id="s3239">We took more than what we needed, because it was inflicting damage to the collaborators.</span> <span id="s3240">And we came up and we dressed, and that was my uniform--leather jacket, green pants, boots.</span> <span id="s3241">My shoes were--oh, my heavens, I take six pounds a pair of shoes, so heavy it was, but when you are young, you don't pay attention to anything, you just, you carry everything.</span> <span id="s3242">And after this, we had missions to punish collaborators: we went down into the country, or up to the mountains, and we knew that--I was dealing with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s3243">You would say to the Nazis, whatever he had, instead of giving away to the Resistance or destroying, because greed is a big thing.</span> <span id="s3244">For money, many people would sell their soul away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">JF: So these collaborators you're talking about would give...</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">BM: Wouldn't give nothing--they would exchange to the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">JF: They would exchange with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">BM: For whatever privilege they would get from them.</span> <span id="s3249">They would get a barrel of nails, or everything, something to gain out of it.</span> <span id="s3250">If you give under duress and terror, is one thing, but at least you resisted it.</span> <span id="s3251">But if you are free, willingly dealing with them, just to make a fortune, this we made them pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">JF: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">BM: We took women who did it.</span> <span id="s3254">We shaved their heads, and we rubbed it with mercurochrome.</span> <span id="s3255">After the war, we paraded them stark-naked in the streets as traitors.</span> <span id="s3256">Have you read the book, The Sorrow and the Pity?</span> <span id="s3257">That was in our Maquis.</span> <span id="s3258">Volvic is mentioned there.</span> <span id="s3259">Madame Martinon and lots of children, and they were all taken to the concentration camps; only a few came back.</span> <span id="s3260">The Hotel Martinon was burned by the Nazis, by the Gestapo there, throwed thermal bombs to burn it up, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">JF: What did you do to the men who were collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">BM: I'd rather you don't ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">JF: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">BM: Please!</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">JF: But this was part of...</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">BM: Yes, that was part.</span> <span id="s3267">We could not resist revenge, because we had paid too dear of a price.</span> <span id="s3268">We had lost the best of mankind in that war against barbarie [barbarism], and like I said, I repeat again, it is not possible to describe the amount of myself who went out on those missions, because I am a Jew and I hate blood.</span> <span id="s3269">And I can feel for the guys in Israel.</span> <span id="s3270">We are not a murderous people; we don't want to fight.</span> <span id="s3271">If we can talk, we will talk.</span> <span id="s3272">But once we are pushed and we have to fight, then we are reluctantly doing what we have to, but we do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">JF: What was the attitude in the town or in the towns towards the collaborators when they were identified as collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">BM: When Hitler was in his glory everybody would keep quiet.</span> <span id="s3275">The collaborator would be riding and riding in a car with gasoline, and he was certain that Pétain and Hitler are going to win the war.</span> <span id="s3276">But those who in their heart had kept that spirit of freedom, unless he would jeopardize his life, he would be quiet.</span> <span id="s3277">Once in a while, a group of citizens would beat up some collaborators, without being recognized.</span> <span id="s3278">That was just to vent their disgust and their hatred for them.</span> <span id="s3279">You couldn't take revenge because you would have to take revenge on a tremendous amount of population, and not everybody has the fiber of patriotism, and not everybody is Jewish.</span> <span id="s3280">A Jew had to fight; he had no alternative.</span> <span id="s3281">Those who could fight, fought.</span> <span id="s3282">The Jew had a stereotype; we are not fighters, that's wrong.</span> <span id="s3283">We don't like fighting, we are against spilling blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s3284">JF: Was there a spy network among the French as there was in Germany in terms of turning people in?</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">BM: Yes, definitely, there was.</span> <span id="s3286">However, we knew of it, but I was remote from it, and again, like I said to you, previously, I regret now that I did not know that I would survive.</span> <span id="s3287">Had I known I would survive, I would have kept track of many things that today I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s3288">But I know that we knew, that it was a réseau, a network of spies, of people bringing information, and many have survived who have written many things about it.</span> <span id="s3289">However, like I said, I had to try to survive on my own, because I had to save my family, and when I was with anybody, my mind was never with nobody but my family, because I never knew what's happening there.</span> <span id="s3290">And like I said, my wife's French was like my English now...</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">Tape 5, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">BM: And that question of language was always bothering me, because I am native of Flemish, and her accent was French, and I was always afraid not of Belgian shouldn't come there, but luckily no Belgian ever came back to banker.</span> <span id="s3293">He was from Paris, and he came to Volvic with all the books of the bank.</span> <span id="s3294">And they rented a castle, the bank, and he was a high-falutin' person, and he looked down upon me.</span> <span id="s3295">How come I'm a Belgian refugee in Volvic, when he came with the bank and he was the Belgian!</span> <span id="s3296">So there was not too much conversation, but like I said, it was always in my mind, and therefore whenever, I had a chance, and not too often unfortunately, I would come down and see what's doing.</span> <span id="s3297">Armand knew that I was in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3298">Armand was already ten, ten and a half years old, so, when they were short of food, I had told him, "Armand," I said, "Take your bag on the shoulders and go up to the mountains, go to the farmers and ask them for food and tell them papa will pay, and tell them your papa is the Belgian."</span> <span id="s3299">I had a reputation the Belgian does everything, and so I was careful of my reputation, because once you make a boo-boo you sink.</span> <span id="s3300">So my reputation wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s3301">And Armand would go and beg for food.</span> <span id="s3302">As he was begging for food, from Volvic, they would ask, "Armand, where you going?"</span> <span id="s3303">And he would say, "I'm going to the mountains," and they would tell him, "You know what?</span> <span id="s3304">Go where Papa is, and bring that envelope to him."</span> <span id="s3305">Unknown, Armand would bring messages to us that somebody from Guillaume le Limousin, you know, Plaines de Limoge, where they brought and they would look for innocent people to bring it up.</span> <span id="s3306">And Armand would bring messages to us, and he was a very brave little guy.</span> <span id="s3307">And life wasn't easy, and he was really protecting and defending his sister, and he was going to school, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">JF: Was there any time that you discussed his Jewish background with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">BM: Never!</span> <span id="s3310">The whole time we were away we were speaking Yiddish, Armand and I, but it was called Flemish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">JF: You told the children it was Flemish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">BM: No, we didn't tell nothing the children, and they didn't even pay attention.</span> <span id="s3313">You see, if you don't pay attention and make a point of it, children ignore it.</span> <span id="s3314">So the children know one thing; that we lived in Volvic, we are refugees from Belgium.</span> <span id="s3315">And the main problems for Eliane was that on Sundays, she couldn't go to church, because mother never found her shoe, or her sock.</span> <span id="s3316">Because we didn't want her to go to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">JF: So you made up excuses?</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">BM: No, we looked for her shoe, every Sunday we looked for a shoe.</span> <span id="s3319">And until we found the shoe, when the first bell rings, then mother would find her shoe and it was Eliane's fault.</span> <span id="s3320">As a child, we told you to put your things away, although she may have put her things away, but we had to find ways of getting out from Judaism, for the time being.</span> <span id="s3321">Armand had friends from the village, and he became a village boy, Armand.</span> <span id="s3322">With the wooden shoes, with drinking the wine, eating cheese and the language and everything else.</span> <span id="s3323">We adopted the customs.</span> <span id="s3324">We are chameleons.</span> <span id="s3325">We take the spots of the animal where we are hanging in what tree, what color we need.</span> <span id="s3326">That was called survival.</span> <span id="s3327">That's another gift that I think my people has.</span> <span id="s3328">And if gypsies had a talent like that, they would have survived.</span> <span id="s3329">Unfortunately, the gypsies didn't have that talent; they were free spirits and they were killed like flies in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">JF: What experiences did you have with gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">BM: None, but we heard that the collaborators sold out a group of thirty four and we never saw any of them back.</span> <span id="s3332">And later, after we liberated our village, when we took the liberty to punish these collaborators, burned their farm.</span> <span id="s3333">I was part of the expedition.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">JF: Can you tell me other missions that you were on?</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">BM: Yes, later on, we had explosives, blowing up a tunnel.</span> <span id="s3336">Yes, I had worked on the railroad before the event.</span> <span id="s3337">I had worked on the railroad, and see, I needed work.</span> <span id="s3338">And in the village they were hiring men to work on the railroad, chopping around the trees from the ravines.</span> <span id="s3339">So I worked there.</span> <span id="s3340">And, to work in the ravines, you attach yourself on a rope and one tree; it was primitive.</span> <span id="s3341">You chopped the trees with one hand and the trees rolled down.</span> <span id="s3342">And later on you would load platforms, take the wood away, or they would make planks, or they would use them for firewood, or whatever it is; we didn't know, but we had to load the trains.</span> <span id="s3343">And I forgot, it must have been the winter of '40 to '41, I'm not so sure, for a certain time, and it was very cold.</span> <span id="s3344">And I forget, I didn't have proper food, either.</span> <span id="s3345">The blacksmith of the village had said, whoever can bring a piece of iron, he gives some wine.</span> <span id="s3346">So I found a piece of railroad laying there, maybe 500 kilos.</span> <span id="s3347">And the roads were frozen, and I took my red handkerchief, and I made some kind of a rope, and I pushed and pulled that piece of iron on the road and pulled it down to the blacksmith, a piece of railroad.</span> <span id="s3348">After I brought it down, he gave me wine and he gave me a hunk of fatback.</span> <span id="s3349">And I helped him to camouflage it because it was government property, so later on he used it for whatever he could, you know, he forged it and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s3350">Then I started working in the quarry because I, it was finished working on the railroad, and while I was working there the Germans wouldn't touch it, because it was public work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">JF: You were working where?</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">BM: On the railroad.</span> <span id="s3353">You know, chopping the wood was for the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3354">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">BM: It was part of keeping the trains free to travel.</span> <span id="s3356">Because they were afraid of sabotage from people in the woods.</span> <span id="s3357">So after we cleaned this up, and therefore, when we had a mission, I know the tunnel very well, I went in deep in it, like all those guys make a little fire to warm up.</span> <span id="s3358">You know, just until time, because we worked in very bad conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">JF: When you were working on the railroad, you were working...</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">BM: As a free refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">JF: As a refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">BM: As a refugee without anything connected to Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">JF: So, during the time that you were in the Resistance ...</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">BM: That was before anything happening.</span> <span id="s3365">Like I said, I'm jumping back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">JF: You're jumping back now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">BM: Of course.</span> <span id="s3368">I'm jumping back before we...</span></p> <p><span id="s3369">JF: Most of the time--oh, this is before...</span></p> <p><span id="s3370">BM: 1940, before Capitaine [Captain] Duhin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3371">JF: All right, when you were in the Resistance, though, you were not employed in any other kind of job?</span></p> <p><span id="s3372">BM: Of course not, the only jobs I had before the Resistance was in the factory and in the orthopedic shop.</span> <span id="s3373">Period.</span> <span id="s3374">That's all.</span> <span id="s3375">But after that, that's finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">JF: Then you were totally working...</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">BM: Totally finish.</span> <span id="s3378">My wife would receive her allocation from the Red Cross, and she was able to manage, and then whatever the priest would bring down, or whenever we were able to kill a cow, and bring down a piece of meat and I had found a way.</span> <span id="s3379">One day in the village, while in the Resistance, the farmers could not slaughter anything unless they would declare it, and they would remove the food stamps from what they had slaughtered.</span> <span id="s3380">So the mayor of the village, and the mayor in Europe is more important than a mayor here in that sense, no, not the mayor; the mayor was important, but that mayor was--he was the guy who could give the official stamp on everything you would need.</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">JF: He was the government representative.</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">BM: Like that, and he was with the Resistance, and he wanted to help a couple of Frenchmen to kill a cow or a bull.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">JF: The mayor was with the Resistance also?</span></p> <p><span id="s3384">BM: The mayor, yeah, of course, he was in his own way, you know, he was with us, sympathizer; he was not active, because he was responsible.</span> <span id="s3385">We needed somebody there that could take over the government.</span> <span id="s3386">In fact, he was part of the new government after the war, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s3387">So I heard him discussing about killing.</span> <span id="s3388">I heard, you know, from the grapevine, you hear; they want to slaughter a bull.</span> <span id="s3389">They don't know what to do, because the only way they know how to slaughter is with a sledge hammer, or with a gun, and both are very noisy, and both are dangerous because there is always in the village somebody, collaborators, who would spill the beans, or some Nazis going by who would hear the shot of a gun to kill the animal.</span> <span id="s3390">I remember from the shochet, the slaughterer in Belgium, how he did it, because like I said, for long years I would help my mother and I would buy the chicken, and I would go to the slaughterer and he would slaughter it for us.</span> <span id="s3391">Then I would also go and watch him, how he slaughters a cow, a bull, there is different ways of slaughtering.</span> <span id="s3392">See, when you slaughter a cow, you must stay ready with water; with the udder, let the milk run out, and the blood, then you see that they shouldn't mix, so with water you wash them both away.</span> <span id="s3393">And when he was killing a sheep, it was so sad, till they die, that big beautiful eyes you don't realize.</span> <span id="s3394">So later, I said to one fellow, if they would speak to me, I know a way, no sound.</span> <span id="s3395">So the guy said to me, "What, you're going to strangle it?"</span> <span id="s3396">I said, "No," I said, "but if they speak to me, I will do it my way--no sound.</span> <span id="s3397">I need six men."</span> <span id="s3398">So all kind of jokes were going around, and one of the fellows spoke to me, and I went to the blacksmith of the village, and I said to him "You make me a knife," I said, "that long."</span> <span id="s3399">It was a knife about 15 inches, and I said to him, "I want it in the shape of a razor, very thin, going up a little thicker, but I don't want it curved.</span> <span id="s3400">I want it straight like a triangle, but very sharp."</span> <span id="s3401">I told him exactly what I want, and I gave him a pack of my tobacco.</span> <span id="s3402">That was the most precious thing I had.</span> <span id="s3403">We smoked potato skins and corn silk, to keep the tobacco.</span> <span id="s3404">And the fellow did it.</span> <span id="s3405">He had a piece of steel from a tank, from the first World War, in front of his blacksmith shop, and from there he cut out a piece of steel to make me that knife.</span> <span id="s3406">After three days my knife was ready, and I sharpened it like the shochet would do, and it was a weapon.</span> <span id="s3407">The evening of the slaughtering, we took the bull, who was a longhorn, maybe six hands tall, six foot tall, and in his nose he had a ring, and with the ring we could control him, because he was a wild one; he was not a gelded one.</span> <span id="s3408">They pulled down the bull, and while he was controlled with that ring in the nose, four men attached ropes around his legs, and rope around his neck, and all together we pulled and we dropped him on the ground.</span> <span id="s3409">Where we dropped him, on the--not far was a stream of the water running down from Volvic, the well from Volvic, the spring.</span> <span id="s3410">As he fell down, we threw a burlap bag over his head, and I jumped on him with my knife and with two slices, I went through and I was stuck in the spine; no sound.</span> <span id="s3411">The blood gushing all over and he was thrashing, naturally, but he was attached.</span> <span id="s3412">So, with water, we were able to clean the blood out right into the stream, we yanked him up and I cleaned him.</span> <span id="s3413">With the same knife, I sliced him open, and collected the bowels; that means the kishke.</span> <span id="s3414">Well, they asked me "What do you want for your share?"</span> <span id="s3415">I was trying to be a diplomat.</span> <span id="s3416">I said, "Give me just the insides."</span> <span id="s3417">They wanted the liver.</span> <span id="s3418">I said, "Take the liver, give me the spleen, give me the lung, give me the intestines, the stomach, and give me the four feet, and the head."</span> <span id="s3419">Fair enough.</span> <span id="s3420">They did it.</span> <span id="s3421">I carried all night, bags of intestines, not cleaned, of course.</span> <span id="s3422">And I carried home the head and the hooves, and the hide.</span> <span id="s3423">I had skinned it; I had a good knowledge of it.</span> <span id="s3424">See, I was born in skin and leather when I was a youngster.</span> <span id="s3425">I worked in tanneries.</span> <span id="s3426">Belgium had a reputation for good sole leather, always had a good reputation.</span> <span id="s3427">And so I had brought it home, and my wife said to me, "Bernard, what are going to do with it?"</span> <span id="s3428">I said, "Leave me."</span> <span id="s3429">I had come down from the Maquis, and they gave me the time to prepare the food for my family.</span> <span id="s3430">I cleaned and washed all the intestines and the stomach.</span> <span id="s3431">I had seen that done by my mother.</span> <span id="s3432">See, I told you my mother was the daughter of a treberer [butcher who deveined meat], to clean out the veins from the body, to make the meat kosher.</span> <span id="s3433">My mother, during the first World War, whenever she was able to get a piece of kishke or a piece stomach, or a piece of udder, she would tell me that's the way you prepare, because that's the way my father taught me.</span> <span id="s3434">And he knew, because that was his profession in Russia.</span> <span id="s3435">And to this--but there was no salt--salt is a weapon, I don't know why, but the village grew lots of garlic.</span> <span id="s3436">I was able to get maybe 20 pound of garlic, ten kilo garlic.</span> <span id="s3437">I crushed that garlic, and I rubbed everything in garlic, and I put everything in huge pots, because in the other house--we had moved from the one room, and we had a three-room house.</span> <span id="s3438">One room on the second floor, a room on third floor, a room.</span> <span id="s3439">While I was working in the factory in Riom on doing sabotage, on the sides, the fellow, they would make a black market of a little electrical appliances, little stoves.</span> <span id="s3440">And we had an electric steamer.</span> <span id="s3441">We were allowed three hours of electricity a day.</span> <span id="s3442">Now the cables with the electricity run in front of the dirt floor room.</span> <span id="s3443">There was naked cable.</span> <span id="s3444">So the fellows had make for me a jimjig, like two hooks on a stick, and the electric cable connected to a little radiator they had put up for me, so that I could warm the room for Armand.</span> <span id="s3445">It was bitter cold, the winter was horrible.</span> <span id="s3446">In the room downstairs, when I was home, I would slide myself in the crib of the baby, to warm it.</span> <span id="s3447">The crib was immense; it was old fashioned.</span> <span id="s3448">I had everything in the house.</span> <span id="s3449">A pit--oh, I forgot, only a quarter a month, francs, that I had the rent from the Belgian Red Cross.</span> <span id="s3450">And the landlord was the guy from the grocery, Jean Lemme.</span> <span id="s3451">And he had gave me the house the way it came, with the pots and the pans, and I had pots from hundreds of years ago, big steel pots.</span> <span id="s3452">And those steel pots, I filled everything with clean kishke and stomach and tripe.</span> <span id="s3453">I wasted nothing, and I had to schlep the water from the fountain, because in the house I had a slab of marble like this, going through a hole in the wall like that, and that was my sewer and sink.</span> <span id="s3454">So here I was working, and I cleaned everything.</span> <span id="s3455">I worked two days and a night.</span> <span id="s3456">Now in the walls of the house, the walls were a yard and a half thick, it's lava.</span> <span id="s3457">And they are two yards high, like that table, black upon black.</span> <span id="s3458">And, inside they had carved out 800 years ago, niches.</span> <span id="s3459">And it was black, the whole inside is black.</span> <span id="s3460">That's the black lava from Volvic.</span> <span id="s3461">And the house is 900 years old.</span> <span id="s3462">The cellar is vaulted.</span> <span id="s3463">In the cellar I found a basket.</span> <span id="s3464">I found wood prints of the year 1780, of the fables.</span> <span id="s3465">I have them home, I'll show you later.</span> <span id="s3466">That was some experience, that house.</span> <span id="s3467">And there I picked everything else.</span> <span id="s3468">When it came to the head, I split it in two, with an axe.</span> <span id="s3469">And the eyes, the children would play with them instead of marbles.</span> <span id="s3470">And I removed the brains, that was good food.</span> <span id="s3471">I removed the cheeks, everything, we wasted nothing, and we lived for months on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">JF: This was during the time you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s3473">BM: In the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3474">I left my family with meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">JF: As a refugee, did you have to register with the mayor or...</span></p> <p><span id="s3476">BM: Of course, I was registered!</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">JF: All right, was there any problem then in them checking to see where you were during the time you were in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3478">BM: Well, the mayor was Resistance.</span> <span id="s3479">There was one before, who had blown his brains out, because he could not keep the position of being mayor, and transmit to the Nazis what they wanted.</span> <span id="s3480">So he blowed his brains out.</span> <span id="s3481">So we had another mayor, and he was an elderly man, and he was a little darling.</span> <span id="s3482">Whatever he knew, he knew, and he didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s3483">So we went through.</span> <span id="s3484">The village was 97% sympathizers to the Resistance, because they know we knew that Hitler is not going to win the war.</span> <span id="s3485">The French hoped that they wouldn't win the war.</span> <span id="s3486">The collaborators knew that he would win the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">JF: How did this mayor then handle the Nazis when they asked things of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">BM: He did the best he can and diddled-daddled; he was an old man; he did the best he could.</span> <span id="s3489">I had know him for years.</span> <span id="s3490">I have no women, I have no, and he did what he could.</span> <span id="s3491">He was village mayor.</span> <span id="s3492">But nevertheless, we had to keep track.</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">JF: Also, during that time that you were working in the Resistance, was there any way of you getting any news from Belgium?</span> <span id="s3494">Did you have any word?</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">BM: Nothing, nothing, because after I received a letter from my sister, back, I didn't know anything about Belgium, and I didn't want to know, because we only knew that the Führer was winning the war, and I had to make provisions to save my family.</span> <span id="s3496">So the less communications with Belgium; it was hard, but so it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">JF: When you were that involved with the Resistance, did you have any additional information about the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">BM: No, we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">JF: Even in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">BM: Nothing, because, like I said, we had no radio.</span> <span id="s3501">And if we had a radio, we only could take London.</span> <span id="s3502">That was our point of interest, the BBC, and anything else was never told to us, and we didn't have a radio.</span> <span id="s3503">So we didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">JF: Did you know anything about the camps in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s3505">BM: This we knew, because they had picked up Jews, and we know there was a Drancy, and there was a Gurs, and there was [unclear], this we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3506">JF: Did you know what was going on in those camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">BM: No, this we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3508">JF: And did you know anything about the transports out of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s3509">BM: This we didn't know, either.</span> <span id="s3510">We were completely in the dark; first of all, living in the mountains, and secondly, I have my own problems with my little family, keeping body and soul together.</span> <span id="s3511">You realize very well that I passed [over] most of the stuff, the baby, of aggravations of life cannot be told because first of all, they already forgotten, or they are so numerous that you could not.</span> <span id="s3512">The child needs a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s3513">So, I went to the blockmaker and I said make me a pair of sabots for Yvette.</span> <span id="s3514">He said, the sabots like that cost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s3515">I don't have lots of money.</span> <span id="s3516">I said let me work a day for you.</span> <span id="s3517">Not enough, you must come and work two days.</span> <span id="s3518">So I worked, it was tough.</span> <span id="s3519">Early in the morning, like just at the point of dawn, going to the forest and uproot an old walnut tree that you needed practically two men to hold around, uproot it, that means dig and cut the tiny roots, because it's the roots that made the good sabots.</span> <span id="s3520">You know what sabots are?</span> <span id="s3521">Over there on the ground, you see a pair of red ones?</span> <span id="s3522">Sunday shoes; I'll bring them to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">JF: These are wooden shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">BM: Wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s3525">[Worn by the peasantry in various European countries.]</span></p> <p><span id="s3526">JF: Sunday shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">BM: Sunday shoes, and I wanted for Yvette, and he made me pair for Yvette.</span> <span id="s3528">I needed for Armand.</span> <span id="s3529">So for Armand, maybe I could take from the rack.</span> <span id="s3530">So if I received from Belgian Red Cross, I would give away from me, because I could do without.</span> <span id="s3531">And so I was keeping-- there was a million problems: like we would speak Yiddish, and I had to give some hope to my wife.</span> <span id="s3532">"So," I would say, "Chanaleh."</span> <span id="s3533">You speak Yiddish?</span> <span id="s3534">I would say, "Tomorrow will be good."</span> <span id="s3535">And she would look on my face.</span> <span id="s3536">I weighed then maybe 145 pound.</span> <span id="s3537">I was green from terror, and I was--my eyes were always like a hunted animal, and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s3538">But I had to keep my sense of humor because the whole thing would have fall apart.</span> <span id="s3539">And I did keep my sense of humor, in adversity.</span> <span id="s3540">And, so we went through the war; we went to expeditions, we went to another mountain, helped them out to fight a group of collaborators who had sold out traitors.</span> <span id="s3541">And then at certain times, we found out they were sending away a train with travailleurs de forcé, forced work to Germany, so we derailed the railroad at night.</span> <span id="s3542">I didn't know where it was, but we went on expedition.</span> <span id="s3543">So climbing the mountains, I was good, I was very strong.</span> <span id="s3544">I had a varicose vein, the size of a big goose egg, hanging there until ten years ago.</span> <span id="s3545">Ten years ago I went for surgery.</span> <span id="s3546">There was a varicose vein like that, that I had climbing and carrying 40, 50 kilo.</span> <span id="s3547">I was so strong, and I didn't have the proper food.</span> <span id="s3548">I swear, it's a miracle that I am where I am.</span> <span id="s3549">We were drinking water; it was all in that region a lot of springs, like Saratoga.</span> <span id="s3550">You scratched the mountain, water comes out.</span> <span id="s3551">Stinks like rotten eggs, it's friginous [phonetic, probably means cold].</span> <span id="s3552">When you have to, you drink.</span> <span id="s3553">We would put snares and catch rabbit and skin 'em and cook 'em.</span> <span id="s3554">How much cooking can you do?</span> <span id="s3555">You don't want a fire to go so you ate raw stuff; same thing with a pig.</span> <span id="s3556">We saw pigs in the fields, and to smell a pig is not easy.</span> <span id="s3557">So a guy threw a knife and he got a pig.</span> <span id="s3558">So we stuck it while it was still squeaking we removed the ham, and with a bottle of brandy, we'd burn the silks, and make believe it's cooked.</span> <span id="s3559">And then we took pieces of meat and we ate, raw pork.</span> <span id="s3560">If I didn't die, I eat pork meat five years in the barrel, that's called salted pork, that's all the fatback, it is white like cream, and it's salted meat, with the rind on top.</span> <span id="s3561">And I ate a piece the size, Gotenu [dear God] a kilo practically.</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">JF: This was not cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">BM: Of course not!</span> <span id="s3564">It's raw salt pork.</span> <span id="s3565">And, you drink a bottle of brandy after that, and I tell you, there is a miracle, Al'vai veiter [would that it would continue], I have no stomach problems.</span> <span id="s3566">I have a high cholesterol.</span> <span id="s3567">I have triglyceride, I have everything that you have to have at my age.</span> <span id="s3568">It's normal, although we don't touch butter and things like that, you know, we have eggs and if we eat two eggs a month, that's a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">JF: Was your wife also eating pork during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">BM: No!</span> <span id="s3571">The poor thing, I don't know what she lived on.</span> <span id="s3572">She had the most beautiful complexion, always red cheeks.</span> <span id="s3573">She was eating a small piece of bread, and she would drink the toriani [phonetic] that was coffee, and the coffee was carbonized beans, carbonized grain, and corn, and every pound you had 12 beans of coffee.</span> <span id="s3574">So people would spread the coffee and take out the 12 beans, and through the year they had enough to make a pot of coffee.</span> <span id="s3575">It was sad.</span> <span id="s3576">So I don't know how she lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">JF: She wouldn't eat the pork.</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">BM: She wouldn't.</span> <span id="s3579">She wouldn't eat the rabbit, she wouldn't eat the crow, she wouldn't eat the donkey, nothing--it was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">JF: Now wait, did she not eat it for religious reasons?</span> <span id="s3581">Or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">BM: No, she couldn't.</span> <span id="s3583">She couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s3584">JF: She couldn't eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3585">BM: She couldn't.</span> <span id="s3586">My wife, should live and be well, she cannot swallow a pill mini.</span> <span id="s3587">She can't!</span> <span id="s3588">She chews an aspirin.</span> <span id="s3589">She couldn't eat...</span></p> <p><span id="s3590">JF: Could not eat...</span></p> <p><span id="s3591">BM: She helped me skin it and prepare it, and everything else.</span> <span id="s3592">She couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">JF: The children, then, were they...</span></p> <p><span id="s3594">BM: They ate everything.</span> <span id="s3595">I terrorized the kids.</span> <span id="s3596">I said, you eat, because I had in mind they must survive, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">JF: You started to tell me a story the other day about the seder.</span> <span id="s3598">Was this during this time, or was this later?</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">BM: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3600">JF: This was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">BM: That was the beginning of '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">JF: Could you go back for a minute and tell me that story about the Seder?</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">BM: I think I told you the Seder.</span> <span id="s3604">When we walked up to the mountains with Armand...</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">JF: You and your wife...</span></p> <p><span id="s3606">BM: No, my wife, no, just Armand.</span></p> <p><span id="s3607">JF: You and Armand.</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">BM: We climbed up to the mountains...</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">JF: He was about eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">BM: Seven, about seven.</span> <span id="s3611">We climbed up to the mountains, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">JF: How did you hear about the Seder?</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">BM: There was a young girl in the bus.</span> <span id="s3614">I had told you I was working then in the pocketbook factory in Clermont-Ferrand, and I had taken the bus.</span> <span id="s3615">And the bus was for 50 people, but being there was one bus a day, those who were lucky like I am, we taking the bus from Volvic and I was the first one standing on the street, because the bus driver lives on my street [unclear].</span> <span id="s3616">And everyday, when he walks out, and I would walk in front of him, to be able to get a seat.</span> <span id="s3617">So I always had a seat near the window, and when I sat down, there was two seats.</span> <span id="s3618">Now, there was three seats in a row.</span> <span id="s3619">So a fourth squeezed in and then going from village to village, we would take in more people, until we were 100 in the bus.</span> <span id="s3620">And the last village before coming to Clermont-Ferrand, we would stop and pick up about six girls, who would be working in different offices.</span> <span id="s3621">And I always looked for a very tiny one, because it breaks the legs to have a person riding in the bus with you, even if it's only 15-20 kilometers.</span> <span id="s3622">And I had a young girl, very charming, 17, 18, maybe; maybe it was affinity, she was Jewish, but I didn't know, and I was Jewish and she didn't know.</span> <span id="s3623">Until one day she said to me, just like that, "Are you a dentist?"</span> <span id="s3624">I said, "Yes, and you?"</span> <span id="s3625">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s3626">"Are you from Brittany?"</span> <span id="s3627">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s3628">"And I am a Breton also," I said.</span> <span id="s3629">She said, "You know, two weeks from now is going to be a big seder in Volvic.</span> <span id="s3630">And there is going to be somebody waiting," and she told me the time.</span> <span id="s3631">She told me how to go there.</span> <span id="s3632">"From Volvic," she said, "you take the road--" but I didn't want to take the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s3633">JF: She told you this on the bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">BM: On the bus, sitting on the bus; the driver, [unclear] and there's people speaking, and she was sitting on my lap, that side, and her mouth to my ear, you know, like that, speaking, and I made believe that we were kidding and I was smiling because people around, and you know, everybody was thinking, "Bernard has a pretty girl on his knee, the Belgian is a lucky guy," and I was hollering, "Don't tell my wife, don't tell my wife."</span> <span id="s3635">And, then before going down, she would give me a peck on the cheek.</span> <span id="s3636">Of course, like I said, I wasn't shaved, you saw my face.</span> <span id="s3637">I was not bad looking, too.</span> <span id="s3638">That's not my fault, because this has nothing to do--you know, I have never judged a person by their looks.</span> <span id="s3639">You cannot be responsible.</span> <span id="s3640">If we all would make ourselves, would be all the more gorgeous ones.</span> <span id="s3641">So a person is always good if it's a person.</span> <span id="s3642">And, then when I came back to Volvic, in the evening I said to my wife, of course, again, all the conversations were in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s3643">Oh, I regret you don't speak it.</span> <span id="s3644">It's so different.</span> <span id="s3645">But all right, I said, "You know, Chanaleh," I said, "there is going to be a Seder.</span> <span id="s3646">You know, the symbol of the Seder to us is very important, because this is really," I said, "the heart of our mystery.</span> <span id="s3647">That symbol of freedom.</span> <span id="s3648">We were slaves, we don't want to be slaves.</span> <span id="s3649">We want freedom for every nation, but most for us.</span> <span id="s3650">I want to go to that Seder with Armand.</span> <span id="s3651">I don't want him to forget.</span> <span id="s3652">Eliane is too small."</span> <span id="s3653">Yvette wasn't born.</span> <span id="s3654">She said, "I trust you, take Armand," and I said to Armand, "I had told you," I said, "that we are not Jews.</span> <span id="s3655">However," I said--he was not in my Seder, in my father's last Seder, he wasn't the son, I tell you in Belgium, because he wasn't well with that sunburn on the lungs.</span> <span id="s3656">The calcification.</span> <span id="s3657">So he was not at the Seder, and here I wanted him to see a Seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s3658">JF: And yet, you had not told him that he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">BM: Armand knew he was Jewish--I had told him to say that he was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">JF: Okay, he knew that he was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">BM: Of course!</span> <span id="s3662">Avrom--Abram, I had changed his name to Armand, but he was Abraham.</span> <span id="s3663">And he was very mature for his age.</span> <span id="s3664">A serious boy.</span> <span id="s3665">As we walked up he was questioning me, we were in the forest walking along.</span> <span id="s3666">I was explaining to him the history, Pharaoh in Egypt, the ten plagues, the miracles, what it means to be a Jew, that my ancestors fought for freedom, that my father fought in the pogrom in Kishinev.</span> <span id="s3667">"And now my son," I said, "we..." Tape 5, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s3668">BM: So I said to Armand that we have to remember that living as a Jew is not easy and I told him about the Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s3669">He was only a youngster, but I was feeling whatever I tell him, something would penetrate, in case I wouldn't be there forever, because everything was like an extra day to live.</span> <span id="s3670">And as we came higher, higher, it was already dusk, and I had a good knowledge of the forest, because we lived there already for a few months.</span> <span id="s3671">And I went through a winter and the forest was like a granary for me, a lot of grain, of nuts, a lot of berries, and wildlife.</span> <span id="s3672">I had put snares to catch rabbits, and I climbed the trees to go to the nest of the crow, twist the neck of the babies, and all food.</span> <span id="s3673">And as we come to an empty spot was a shack, and a man walking with a tool in front of the shack.</span> <span id="s3674">He was a bearded man, very odd, because beards were not in unless he was really 100% a Gentile.</span> <span id="s3675">So I go to the fellow and he said, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s3676">and I said, "Are you a dentist?"</span> <span id="s3677">He said "Yes."</span> <span id="s3678">I said, "Is there a Seder?"</span> <span id="s3679">He said, "Yes," and he let me into the shack where I saw a lot of men standing and everybody converged their eyes to us and they saw Armand, a child.</span> <span id="s3680">And the Seder was said in French on a few printed pieces of paper, and they had two matzohs, homemade not industrially made, and there was so much sadness in that Seder, and when it came to the four questions, all the eyes converged to Armand, but he didn't know the questions, he was too young to read.</span> <span id="s3681">So we all said the questions, we all gave the answers, and Armand was like paralyzed!</span> <span id="s3682">Standing, you know, looking up to all those men, and I realized that he was missing the most important part, so I took him and put him on my shoulders--he wasn't heavy--and I stood in the corner, where he could have a good picture of that oh, oh, a picture.</span> <span id="s3683">A couple of lit candles, and the walls covered with blankets, the windows, and you heard like a murmur, and then when it came to the plagues of Egypt, the one who was the official said, "We drink, we pour the wine and we don't drink it, in commemoration that Egyptians died and therefore, we don't celebrate with joy, just a commemoration.</span> <span id="s3684">And now," that man said, "we don't know where we are, but while we are together, we celebrate Passover, and we hope that we also will be liberated."</span> <span id="s3685">And instead of l'shana habah b'Yerushalayim [next year in Jerusalem] we said, "May we all next year go back to our homes."</span> <span id="s3686">And the tears were running freely, sobbing.</span> <span id="s3687">And then I took Armand, and it was already night, and there was not much light because we lived in darkness in Volvic, and I made a joke out of it.</span> <span id="s3688">We picked up a bundle of wood, in case anybody would ask me, "What are you doing so late in the street?"</span> <span id="s3689">So I'll never forget, we picked up a bundle of wood, a bundle of wood on the shoulders, and we came back home, and I said to Armand, "What you have seen now," I said, "it is being imprinted in your mind, but never speak of it--never!"</span> <span id="s3690">And so it was.</span> <span id="s3691">And from this, Armand has made graphics now.</span> <span id="s3692">And I think that in the summer he is going to have a show at the Y, a ceramic show depicting the pictures of the horrors of the Holocaust, and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s3693">JF: How many men do you think were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3694">BM: About 30, I would say, roughly 30 men.</span> <span id="s3695">That's all that could come in.</span> <span id="s3696">Mostly from Alsace-Lorraine.</span> <span id="s3697">From the east of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">JF: No women?</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">BM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">JF: Only men.</span> <span id="s3701">Were there able to be any of the traditional symbols of Passover in addition to the matzoh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">BM: Just the two matzohs and a candle.</span> <span id="s3703">That's all.</span> <span id="s3704">Bitter we had enough.</span> <span id="s3705">Our charoses, we passed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">JF: But one of the men had been able to make the matzoh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">BM: Of course, somebody made matzoh.</span> <span id="s3708">There were men not from Volvic; they were from the limits from Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s3709">So the hardship for those people to come up to Volvic!</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">JF: Did Armand ask you more questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">BM: I had told him not to.</span> <span id="s3712">Coming down I was explaining to him the history of our haggadah [book read at the seder], the symbols and the meaningful things, that since I was born, I always had a seder with my father, and we had a seder last year.</span> <span id="s3713">I regret you were in the sanitarium.</span> <span id="s3714">There was a seder with my parents.</span> <span id="s3715">In fact, in my book I have all chapters speaking about the S'darim.</span> <span id="s3716">In fact, I closed my stories, in my book, with my seder in America, my 35 years in America, and my seder, like my whole family gathered, we were in that room 38 people.</span> <span id="s3717">We had put--I have a long table downstairs, and the tables go from there.</span> <span id="s3718">Everything was removed.</span> <span id="s3719">The boys came and moved around, and we had tables going from here all the way down there.</span> <span id="s3720">And our seder this year was done in a rented hall, because we are kenahora [without invoking the evil eye] almost 50 this time, and sons and daughters have boyfriends, who are married already.</span> <span id="s3721">And the small children grew up to be young men, and so on.</span> <span id="s3722">So we went to the place and our seder was sad, because we recalled those who should be here and are not there, those who have been destroyed.</span> <span id="s3723">We speak of freedom and liberty, we speak of America the beautiful, where we have to fight to keep our democracy alive.</span> <span id="s3724">We speak of all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3725">JF: Were there any other occasions during those years in France when you were able to talk to Armand about Judaism or he asked questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">BM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3727">JF: That was the one time...</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">BM: That was the one time, and I avoided anything.</span> <span id="s3729">We never mentioned nothing; when I spoke, I spoke to my wife.</span> <span id="s3730">So that we should at least have something to go--God forbid, it turns out bad, the children don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3731">JF: What about the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s3732">BM: They didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s3733">Eliane and Yvette knew nothing.</span> <span id="s3734">Yvette at that time even wasn't born, but later on even didn't know anything until--she knew anything until we came to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">JF: She did not know that she was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3736">BM: She found out she was Jewish when she was understanding.</span> <span id="s3737">Five years old, then she found out on her brother's Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s3738">"What is that?"</span> <span id="s3739">So we told her: for Jewish people--What is Jewish?</span> <span id="s3740">It's a religion like there is Catholics and there is Protestants; there is Jews.</span> <span id="s3741">They have a church, we have a synagogue.</span> <span id="s3742">They have a priest and we have a rabbi.</span> <span id="s3743">And we make Bar Mitzvah, they make Communion.</span> <span id="s3744">We have to give the children what to go, you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s3745">They have Christmas, we have Chanukah.</span> <span id="s3746">Not that the analogy is equal, but children's minds, it meant something to be understood, and being that you did not want to go into too many details, that's the way you spoke.</span> <span id="s3747">So we came to liberations of different towns and cities around us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">JF: When were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">BM: Liberation means that when the Germans left because of the war turning against them.</span> <span id="s3750">It was after Normandy, it was after the debarquement [landing of troops], in Marseilles, the Italians were squashed already.</span> <span id="s3751">And there was much before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s3752">And Hitler needed all these forces together, being that he had 3,000 here and 5,000 there.</span> <span id="s3753">He had 50,000 here.</span> <span id="s3754">He wanted everyone to assemble.</span> <span id="s3755">And from London came an order, "Try to keep the Nazis where they are.</span> <span id="s3756">It's easier to fight a small group than a big one."</span> <span id="s3757">So in the--it must have been in August or September, the wheat was cut, this I remember.</span> <span id="s3758">We were laying in a plain of Limoges, after we came to contain the Nazis.</span> <span id="s3759">And my group in which I was with 17 fellows on a platform, two machine guns, and I had a bag of hand grenades.</span> <span id="s3760">I also had a bag of mashed potatoes, from the German grenades, the big stick that you hit and throw very good, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">JF: That was the nickname?</span></p> <p><span id="s3762">BM: Yes, the mashecrass patate [slang for mashed potatoes].</span> <span id="s3763">And so we divided eight fellows and nine fellows, and we received orders to see that they shouldn't move and they were stopped by wagons, loaded with hay on the road, and us, we made ourselves comfortable on top of a blanket.</span> <span id="s3764">Coming down from Volvic to Riom was like a parade, the French people throwing cigarettes and cheese and stopping to pour wine and brandy, and I didn't have in mind brandy and wine, so I collected cheese and butter, and I hollered, "I wanted milk", so they brought me bottles of milk.</span> <span id="s3765">And I had a spirit, maybe I'll be able to sneak away and run to the house, it's only three hours a run.</span> <span id="s3766">And I collected in my helmet, I had put leaves from the side of the fields, big leaves, cabbage or rhubarb, and that's where I was keeping the butter and the cheese, and I kept it from the sun.</span> <span id="s3767">But I didn't drink, because I could not afford to drink in case I lose control.</span> <span id="s3768">I had my family.</span> <span id="s3769">Otherwise, the most important thing in my mind was my family.</span> <span id="s3770">As we stayed there, and they directed us to keep that group of Germans not to come over to Riom.</span> <span id="s3771">We didn't know their strength.</span> <span id="s3772">The Germans were terrorized by us, because they know that we were trying to pay 'em back what they had done to us.</span> <span id="s3773">We had heard of villages burned by them, not far from Clermont from Riom in the plain of Limoges, there's a village called Oradour sur Glane, like another Lititz who was burned.</span> <span id="s3774">And there was sabotage against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s3775">They took the whole village, 1,600 people...</span></p> <p><span id="s3776">JF: How do you spell the name of that village?</span></p> <p><span id="s3777">BM: O-R-0-U-D, Oradour, I am very bad in spelling.</span> <span id="s3778">I am only 35 years in America.</span> <span id="s3779">O-R-A-D-O-U-R S-U-R G-L-A-N-E, that's in Le Limousin and Limoges and they took all the people and put them in the church, surrounded it with soldiers and threw fire grenades inside and burned the church.</span> <span id="s3780">Only a few people escaped alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3781">JF: This was around what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">BM: 1940, '43, '44.</span> <span id="s3783">Toward the end, they had nothing to lose anymore, and then that village has been cut off.</span> <span id="s3784">Now it is a monument, they never moved in that village, never rebuilt it.</span> <span id="s3785">The church stays there, just the rooms, and there is a big plaque, or there was, maybe they took it off now, because to please the Germans, because we forgive and forget now.</span> <span id="s3786">And it's said, "This is a symbol of the brutality of the Nazi order."</span> <span id="s3787">And this was an example of German justice.</span> <span id="s3788">So we stood there.</span> <span id="s3789">I would run to my son, and about 3:30 in the morning, from Le Cantal [there was another chain of mountains following the Puy de Dôme where we were operating] came down, huge trucks, with a lot of very heavily armed Senegali Blacks, part of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3790">And they came to take over that station that we were waiting.</span> <span id="s3791">The commanding officer came to us very angry; he said, "You imbeciles, do you know what you did?"</span> <span id="s3792">"We received orders to stay here."</span> <span id="s3793">He said, "Well there are 3,500 panzer division, 3,500 mens with heavy artillery.</span> <span id="s3794">You could have been smithered like that."</span> <span id="s3795">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s3796">So naturally, when we heard that, our heart fell out and we felt very weak.</span> <span id="s3797">So I said, "Okay," then he realized that he bawled us out for nothing.</span> <span id="s3798">So he said, "In fact, you deserve a medal for heroism."</span> <span id="s3799">Then, in my mind came "Ignorance is bliss."</span> <span id="s3800">We didn't know, so we weren't too much scared.</span> <span id="s3801">They took us away from there and they put us in positions where there could be an influx of German Army, in a fighting position to hold back the Germans.</span> <span id="s3802">In the meantime, the French were already in the southern part of France, with General--I forget names--and the Americans had to send--The Germans only wanted to surrender to an American.</span> <span id="s3803">So from somewheres around Marseilles, they found a corporal they send over, they surrendered to one.</span> <span id="s3804">Because the Americans observed the Convention of Geneva, they were treated with dignity, as prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s3805">We couldn't afford to treat them like that.</span> <span id="s3806">So they surrendered.</span> <span id="s3807">Then in the city of Riom, was a Kaserne, a camp, a military camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">JF: Excuse me, for one minute.</span> <span id="s3809">Was there any occasion in which you captured Germans, and did not observe the...</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">BM: Yes, we had a group of 20 that we had to convoy from Riom to Clermont-Ferrand, and outside the city of Clermont-Ferrand, in the fields, we told them to run; as they run, we shot them down.</span> <span id="s3811">Because they were escaping, that was our excuse.</span> <span id="s3812">Then when we had German prisoners, individuals, that we were able to collect, and we kept them in the jail of the Kaserne, where we were billeted, they hanged themselves.</span> <span id="s3813">They fought among themselves and they killed each other.</span> <span id="s3814">Of course, there was no better resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">JF: This was done by the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">BM: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">JF: But this is how it was reported?</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">BM: [Whispers] That's right.</span> <span id="s3819">Until we received very strict orders.</span> <span id="s3820">We are responsible for everyone of them, so they fell in the cages, and they hurt themselves.</span> <span id="s3821">And our desire for revenge was big because we found out then, later on atrocities.</span> <span id="s3822">Nothing yet from the concentration camps, but atrocities committed in our regions.</span> <span id="s3823">They burned up families, wives and the children, like they did in Hotel Matignon in Volvic, and they had killed so many men in that village because somebody had thrown a grenade.</span> <span id="s3824">And our desire for revenge was tremendous.</span> <span id="s3825">Even I became bloody, although like I said previously, it was not in our genes; but sometimes you lose control, and when you lose control, it is not to be explained, even psychologically, what makes you tick.</span> <span id="s3826">The adrenaline pumps, or there is a change in the hormones, or there is a bloody instinct.</span> <span id="s3827">You know that you go into danger, but you don't care.</span> <span id="s3828">Later on, before you go in, those are the two moments where you are terribly scared.</span> <span id="s3829">Once you are in, it's Kismet, that's all.</span> <span id="s3830">And later on, my children were asking me, when they were already young adults, "Papa tell me, were you afraid?"</span> <span id="s3831">One would say, "No, Papa is not afraid."</span> <span id="s3832">And I'd say, "Yes, child, not was I afraid, I was terrorized.</span> <span id="s3833">I had loose bowels.</span> <span id="s3834">I had a throat parched.</span> <span id="s3835">I had butterflies in my stomach.</span> <span id="s3836">I carried a bag with death, hand grenades.</span> <span id="s3837">And that was frightening.</span> <span id="s3838">But once I said, "You smell the odor of the explosions and you hear the shooting and everything else, what the heck, we all have to die.</span> <span id="s3839">We don't want to die young, because we want to see what life brings, but if you die young, that's it.</span> <span id="s3840">That's part of what's written in the book."</span> <span id="s3841">Later on, of course, we understand better and after that liberation, we occupied the Kaserne of Riom.</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">JF: When you were sent to be in a position to face oncoming German troops, was there an encounter then with those troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">BM: No, they were arrested by another group, much, much before us; we were a second line.</span> <span id="s3844">Then we were sent to the Kaserne; the Kaserne was liberated the day before our arrival from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s3845">So we had to look for booby traps.</span> <span id="s3846">But I was always food conscious, so the first thing, I made a beeline direct to the kitchen, with a neighbor of mine by the name of Kosicki, a Polish refugee from Alsace-Lorraine, a fellow who lived on the same street with his father and mother, brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s3847">And we went to the kitchen, and opened the refrigerator, and there was hanging a half a veal, a half a calf, and we found a bag of real coffee, and we found a barrel of rum, 40 liters.</span> <span id="s3848">So we called in a couple of guys and they took the rum, and they were billeted on the third floor of the Kaserne, huge steps to climb.</span> <span id="s3849">So two guys grabbed the barrel of rum and scadoodled it away.</span> <span id="s3850">And we took out our knives and we cut big slabs of the veal, opened the shirt and put it on our body and closed the shirt.</span> <span id="s3851">We were wearing pants with chains attached on the bottom like knickers, and we took the coffee and we poured it in our pants and dropped in the foot, that we had like big sausages around our legs.</span> <span id="s3852">So he said to me, "How long would it take us to run up to Volvic?"</span> <span id="s3853">I said, "How long," I said, Abut I don't want the meat to cook on me."</span> <span id="s3854">I must have left at least 15 pound of veal around my breast, my chest, and buttoned up and closed the leather jacket, and I had legs about 12 inches in circum--diameter from the coffee beans.</span> <span id="s3855">The coffee beans were--I never saw coffee beans for four years, and we both run up the mountains, let me tell that was an epic run.</span> <span id="s3856">Up-mountain running, that is something unheard.</span> <span id="s3857">As I run, my wife was accustomed to my step because I had an automatic step.</span> <span id="s3858">I made five kilometers an hour, three and a half miles an hour steady.</span> <span id="s3859">My step was tack-tack-tack-tack, and I was wearing open toes shoes.</span> <span id="s3860">As I come up, we came up, it was about sevenish, and it was getting dark already, dusk, and she opened the door.</span> <span id="s3861">"Bernard."</span> <span id="s3862">And I from far away, I said, in Yiddish, "Go upstairs and put a sheet on the floor."</span> <span id="s3863">She don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s3864">She goes upstairs, we had a [unclear] house, linen sheets handwoven, 100 years old, when you slept on it, you need no massage.</span> <span id="s3865">Your body was one piece of red meat from the linen.</span> <span id="s3866">She don't ask questions; she runs upstairs, on the floor put linen.</span> <span id="s3867">And I came upstairs, opened the belt, the chain from my pants on the bottom and stay and shake, and she sees coffee running out from there and then I opened my shirt and I gave her the meat, and she don't know what to say.</span> <span id="s3868">I said, "I cannot stay," and then I took a rag, washed my body, just, you know, I did not rest or nothing, wiped the stuff from the meat and the guy, Kosicki, he was ready and we run down the mountain.</span> <span id="s3869">We came back to the Kaserne before anybody missed us in the commotion.</span> <span id="s3870">When we came, they was throwing everything from the third floor outside.</span> <span id="s3871">They had mattresses, and blankets and beds.</span> <span id="s3872">Everything that belonged to the Germans; they was stealing 'em blind.</span> <span id="s3873">They would steal everything they could.</span> <span id="s3874">And the women, right away like magic, the women came out from everywheres, with carriages, with donkeys and everything else.</span> <span id="s3875">I had nothing to steal, because I, thank God, I had nothing to load myself, and I go to my third floor room where all the guys were.</span> <span id="s3876">They want that rum, that barrel of rum was almost empty, empty.</span> <span id="s3877">And they went around naked measuring the size of their penises, drunk.</span> <span id="s3878">Every obscene scenes, because they had not seen women for a long time.</span> <span id="s3879">So the alcohol whipped them up to obscenities.</span> <span id="s3880">Nothing to the extent of sexual contacts or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s3881">I came in and it was like a Dantesque picture to me, to see all those drunken Frenchmen running around naked.</span> <span id="s3882">All right, I'm not a saint, however, I'd still a symptom of civilization in me.</span> <span id="s3883">But you have to dance how the music plays.</span> <span id="s3884">So I came in, and I made myself--they poured me a glass rum, and I know I cannot afford to get drunk, and I screamed louder than them, and poured my rum right and left like a drunken sailor, and the Belgian is a regular guy.</span> <span id="s3885">I said I have enough, I go to sleep.</span> <span id="s3886">We slept on mattresses thrown on the floor.</span> <span id="s3887">I laid down on the mattress, and those guys come and grab my mattress and start jumping me, they, you know, jokingly.</span> <span id="s3888">Well, they made so much noise, until three-thirty in the morning, an officer came up.</span> <span id="s3889">Regular French army, dressed in a French uniform and he barked a few orders that "This is enough," he said.</span> <span id="s3890">"There is no more discipline consented."</span> <span id="s3891">Because our discipline was freely given.</span> <span id="s3892">Now, he said, "This is the French army."</span> <span id="s3893">And I was the one Belgian.</span> <span id="s3894">And I said nothing.</span> <span id="s3895">"Everybody down," he said, "15 minutes to go down."</span> <span id="s3896">I came down, pitch dark.</span> <span id="s3897">He said because of our miserable behavior, we are out to hunt collaborators.</span> <span id="s3898">So, we left that night on arm length, and we walked a chain maybe two mile long, with all the men, not from our battalion, all the battalions, and we were collecting collaborators.</span> <span id="s3899">We went through valleys and water and mountains and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s3900">JF: Now, how did you know the collaborators that you were to find?</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">BM: Somebody knew…</span></p> <p><span id="s3902">[multiple exchange] ... those who were there, because that's where we found a group of farmers who had sold out 30‑odd gypsies.</span> <span id="s3903">And the gypsies was shot on the spot by the Nazis, and that's what we were looking for.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">JF: Now, you were given the information.</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">BM: We were given information to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3906">JF: As to who to find?</span></p> <p><span id="s3907">BM: We--I don't know; officers knew.</span> <span id="s3908">Officers knew, but we didn't; we just had to make a net like.</span> <span id="s3909">We came back noontime, dead tired.</span> <span id="s3910">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s3911">JF: What was done with those collaborators, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">BM: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">JF: What was done at that point with those collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s3914">BM: This, we don't know.</span> <span id="s3915">They went to Clermont-Ferrand, because I don't think--but they burned the farm, this was done.</span> <span id="s3916">The farm was burned and completely ransacked.</span> <span id="s3917">We couldn't touch anything.</span> <span id="s3918">There was a French officer in the Army, they wanted to know, that's the reason they didn't trust the FTPF, the Francs Tireurs et Partisans Français, because you know there was political bickering then.</span> <span id="s3919">The communist wanted their share, and the socialists wanted, the liberals, so you know, General deGaulle wanted the whole pie for himself.</span> <span id="s3920">So what's happening is then, we came back, exhausted, and six of us were designated to be on the entry of the gate from the Kaserne, when you come in, to keep the police--the traffic, you know, you don't go in and out like there's a carnival.</span> <span id="s3921">We stood there.</span> <span id="s3922">In the meantime, the jail was connected to what's that was the local jail from the Kaserne, and that's where the first collaborators were brought in by the gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s3923">The French gendarmerie brought in the collaborators to us and that's where they start to let them have it.</span> <span id="s3924">Because we all had a lot of resentment.</span> <span id="s3925">That night we find out in the train station, we was like from here to Knights Road, was a old convoy with barrels of wine, stolen by the Germans going to Germany, and it came from the southern part of France.</span> <span id="s3926">So the fellows went out with huge five-gallon pitchers, and with a machine gun, vrrrp, made ninety little holes, and they brought back maybe 100 liters of wine.</span> <span id="s3927">Every wine from the south.</span> <span id="s3928">They started drinking like they're pigs.</span> <span id="s3929">And they became sick, and fell one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s3930">I didn't drink, again for the same reason.</span> <span id="s3931">The telephone rings.</span> <span id="s3932">The commanding officer: "Any of the men?"</span> <span id="s3933">I'm there.</span> <span id="s3934">I say nothing.</span> <span id="s3935">"I need a man."</span> <span id="s3936">So I run over to him.</span> <span id="s3937">He said, "What's doing, you?"</span> <span id="s3938">I say, "Everything is fine."</span> <span id="s3939">I don't say nothing, because--and I became his right arm.</span> <span id="s3940">I'm not a drinker, and that was unique amongst the French, not to be a drinker.</span> <span id="s3941">So that's where I had all those permit to travel back and forth between Clermont-Ferrand and Vichy, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s3942">I became his right arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3943">JF: He knew you were a Belgian?</span></p> <p><span id="s3944">BM: Oh, yes, of course!</span> <span id="s3945">Then a few days later, came an order, you must excuse me, and that order was for me to go to Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s3946">It must have been September, or October, or maybe--I cannot remember dates--and as I came into Clermont-Ferrand, I had a pouch full of mail from another outfit, and as I came out from the train station and I looked to the little streets, I see a couple of men wearing prayer shawls in front of a building, and my heart started pounding and I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s3947">I know it was liberation, but--And as I come to the men, I said, "Excuse me," I said, "what is that?"</span> <span id="s3948">The man was a little bit with fear and he said, "This is a prayer shawl," and I said, "So--" and he said, "This is today is Yom Kippur."</span> <span id="s3949">As he said, "Yom Kippur" the tears came out from my eyes.</span> <span id="s3950">Now, I am unshaved, I have eyes injected with blood, I am dressed like a guerilla, I carry a pouch, and I have a fearsome look on my face, and I have a weapon, and I carry--and I have two hand grenades and the guy couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s3951">He said, "We are Jews," he said.</span> <span id="s3952">And I said, "I'm a Jew, too!</span> <span id="s3953">In five years," I said, "in four years, I had lost completely contact."</span> <span id="s3954">The commotion became, the rabbi came out and there was a group of Jews from Alsace-Lorraine again.</span> <span id="s3955">But not the same, none of them from there.</span> <span id="s3956">So the rabbi took me in and I take off my weapons, put it near his little desk there, they gave me an aliyah [honor when the Torah is read], and I was completely lost--I became back with feelings of being a Jew, liberated.</span> <span id="s3957">Now, I have a desire for my people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3958">JF: How could these men survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">BM: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s3960">Hidden in the mountain maybe like I did; maybe working in factories around Clermont-Ferrand, but I have no idea.</span> <span id="s3961">I had no mind of asking anything.</span> <span id="s3962">Everybody embraced and shook hands and we thank God we found the next door Jew.</span> <span id="s3963">Then I accomplished my mission, came back.</span> <span id="s3964">The same day, in the evening, came an order.</span> <span id="s3965">And in the morning, while we were staying in the lines, he read the order, he said, "All those who are not French have the right to enlist; if not, they can go back to their previous activities.</span> <span id="s3966">All Frenchmen are automatically in the army."</span> <span id="s3967">Then I was debating myself, what to do.</span> <span id="s3968">But when I found out that I don't have to stay in the army, I said, "Fine, I want to go back to Belgium anyway."</span> <span id="s3969">So I came to the commanding officer and I told him my story, that I have a family in the mountains.</span> <span id="s3970">Nobody said I am a Jew yet, nobody knows I am Jewish yet.</span> <span id="s3971">Before that, we went and we made a raid, in almost the section where we lived, around Volvic, Chatel-Guyon, and Anval [phonetic], and we made a raid there trying to catch some collaborators.</span> <span id="s3972">Gunfight, gunfire was exchanged, but I came out all right.</span> <span id="s3973">We made a parade; we had national funeral for some heroes, you know, the pomp and circumstances, the glory, the flowers and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s3974">And I received my discharge papers, and I went back to Volvic.</span> <span id="s3975">And then, my wife and I decided that I will go to Vichy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3976">Tape 6, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s3977">BM: So the way I was in my uniform, and I had the privilege of riding the trains without paying, being in the Resistance, and it was old-fashioned.</span> <span id="s3978">There was a lot of glory attached now, everybody wanted to put his foot in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s3979">Everybody wanted to know he also has participated in the liberation.</span> <span id="s3980">I rode the train freely and I went to Vichy to visit the Belgian Consul.</span> <span id="s3981">The Belgian Consul see me coming in, and I present my papers.</span> <span id="s3982">In the meantime, Capitain Duhin was back in the French Army, and in that time he had written to me letters; I was smart enough and I kept the letters.</span> <span id="s3983">As of now, I have a whole file of letters, that in due time, if you are interested, we'll go through--that's another session.</span> <span id="s3984">And, I went to the Consul and I brought those letters with me.</span> <span id="s3985">Because he could have questioned it, "You're a Belgian.</span> <span id="s3986">What have you done all that time?</span> <span id="s3987">Where have you been?</span> <span id="s3988">You collected Red Cross money?"</span> <span id="s3989">So I brought the letters and I brought the discharge paper from the commanding officer.</span> <span id="s3990">The Consul was extremely pleased of having received the first Belgian who had served in the French Resistance and he wrote a letter to the Belgium authorities, like a passport: "I recommend very highly that young Bernard Mednicki..." that's the way he wrote down, so to tell you that I wasn't old--I find that letter for you.</span> <span id="s3991">I could spend all day going through my documents with you.</span> <span id="s3992">AI recommend to you very highly that young Bernard Mednicki, who has done very great honor to Belgium by serving side by sides with the French Resistance.</span> <span id="s3993">Please extend to him all the necessary courtesy to make his trip easy."</span> <span id="s3994">And he gave me a ticket for a round trip to go to Belgium, and back to Vichy.</span> <span id="s3995">And he gave me some money, because at that time, I had received money from the Resistance, but I wanted to leave it with my wife.</span> <span id="s3996">So I told him that I don't have any money.</span> <span id="s3997">And he gave me a few hundred francs.</span> <span id="s3998">The way I was dressed, I had nothing else to wear.</span> <span id="s3999">I took the train, and I said to my wife, "I don't know how long I will be away, but have confidence, I'll be back as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s4000">I must see what's doing on."</span> <span id="s4001">I took a direct train from Clermont-Ferrand to Paris, and from Paris to Brussels.</span> <span id="s4002">I didn't stop in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">JF: This was in what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s4004">BM: ...19--oh, I wouldn't remember.</span> <span id="s4005">Well, let's see now, quarante quarte, quarant cinq, that must be, '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s4006">JF: This was '45, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s4007">BM: Yes, that must be before the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s4008">Yes, that's before the Battle of the Bulge; I remember because I came to Brussels.</span> <span id="s4009">I had my leather jacket and I was not too warm, because in Belgium is always cold.</span> <span id="s4010">And I don't know where to go.</span> <span id="s4011">The trip was a horrible trip, because, first of all, there was no trains running, bridges were blown, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s4012">The trains, you had to take whatever you could, and I was in a train.</span> <span id="s4013">I was--The train was--the trip was terrible, but it was not the point, the point is I came to Brussels.</span> <span id="s4014">And I didn't know where to direct myself, so I looked where there was like a Jewish Community Center before, and I went there.</span> <span id="s4015">And I started asking questions.</span> <span id="s4016">And my sister was registered there.</span> <span id="s4017">That was called the REVJ, Help to the Israelites, Victims of the War.</span> <span id="s4018">Because a Jew in Belgium is called an Israelite, in French, too.</span> <span id="s4019">The word Juif is not a nice word, but in America, that's the way it goes.</span> <span id="s4020">Israelite is the right name.</span> <span id="s4021">So I go to them and I start asking questions and I found some people that I knew from before the war, and they asked me and I answered, and somehow the emotions is high.</span> <span id="s4022">They give me the address of my sister, that's all there is.</span> <span id="s4023">And they told me that my father and this one and that one, all of them have been deported in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s4024">JF: The whole family was deported...</span></p> <p><span id="s4025">BM: Deported in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s4026">JF: Did you know where?</span></p> <p><span id="s4027">BM: Not yet.</span> <span id="s4028">So I started looking around and someone gave me an address of my sister.</span> <span id="s4029">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s4030">JF: This is Rebecca.</span></p> <p><span id="s4031">BM: Rebecca, and she was married to a fellow from Antwerp, and she lived in Brussels.</span> <span id="s4032">Her husband was deported, and, in the beginning, and she took back her maiden name, not his name, and she became Rebecca Mednicki.</span> <span id="s4033">So then they were in view to escape the indignity of concentration camp and everything else.</span> <span id="s4034">She lost herself in a certain part of Belgium, the French Wallonie, that's in the French part of Belgium where there is a lot of forest, and she lived there with farmers.</span> <span id="s4035">She rent herself out doing odd things.</span> <span id="s4036">She was very fortunate, because my sister and I--we don't have the characteristics--or we did not have the characteristics looked upon by the Nazis or the collaborators, what a Jew has to look like.</span> <span id="s4037">We could blend with the public without being designated as Jews.</span> <span id="s4038">And she suffered a lot of hunger, bad weather.</span> <span id="s4039">When she came out from the war, she was hoping that somebody would come back.</span> <span id="s4040">In the meantime, my father and my brother and sisters, nephews, uncles and everybody that's from my side, plus my wife's side, all together 87 people were taken away, and none of them came back.</span> <span id="s4041">My brother-in-law Maurice lost his wife, my sister Rosa, and the children, of course.</span> <span id="s4042">How was he saved?</span> <span id="s4043">He was at work.</span> <span id="s4044">As he came back, the neighbors told him that the Gestapo came and took my sister away and the children, and told him, "Run and save yourself," so he went away and hid, and he also could pass for a typical non-Jewish person.</span></p> <p><span id="s4045">JF: Did Rebecca pass as a non-Jew, or was she hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s4046">BM: Rebecca was passed for a non-Jew but she hid herself, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s4047">JF: Was she hidden by Christian families?</span></p> <p><span id="s4048">BM: No, she was working for Christian families, and working for them, they did not know that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s4049">She had received the stamp in the beginning.</span> <span id="s4050">She worked for a while and then she just disappeared from the neighborhood, from the region, and she didn't go by train.</span> <span id="s4051">With trolley cars in Belgium you can go from one side of the country to another, cause the country is so small.</span> <span id="s4052">That's what she did.</span> <span id="s4053">She disappeared in the country, lived in the forest for a while.</span> <span id="s4054">When she came back, her body was decalcified.</span> <span id="s4055">That's where I found her.</span> <span id="s4056">She had rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s4057">She had some money from previous.</span> <span id="s4058">And she had found a job, she was a waitress.</span> <span id="s4059">She was in touch with Americans, right after the war, and she was trying to find informations about where the family is, because she knew exactly when they were taken, where they were taken.</span> <span id="s4060">The train was taken where she knew it.</span> <span id="s4061">After we met, of course, the joy of seeing each other was tremendous.</span> <span id="s4062">So she was asking me when do I bring my wife and the children, and I told her I didn't know anything, so I just came alone.</span> <span id="s4063">"And now that you are there," I said "there is a reason to bring the family back."</span> <span id="s4064">And while I was there, it was very sad times.</span> <span id="s4065">Couldn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s4066">Wherever I went, this one is gone, this one has been taken, this one didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4067">JF: Was this your first...</span></p> <p><span id="s4068">BM: ... first trip back to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">JF: ... the first knowledge that you had then of what had happened with the camps, and the death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s4070">BM: Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s4071">So, after being a while there I went back to Volvic.</span> <span id="s4072">Of course, there were adventures in the trains, and so on and so forth, I will pass up as no, no reportable story.</span> <span id="s4073">Came back to Volvic.</span> <span id="s4074">But before leaving, I could not leave the village without going to the priest and telling him that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s4075">Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s4076">JF: Why did you choose to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s4077">BM: He was a gentleman with me.</span> <span id="s4078">He was good with us, and I wanted him to know that we have survived, and something pushed me to tell him, not to leave on a lie.</span> <span id="s4079">You never know, you must always leave a place clean.</span> <span id="s4080">You never know if you have to come back.</span> <span id="s4081">That's an old story that my parents always said, "Whatever you do in your life, if you walk through the bus, leave in good terms; if you move in a house, leave the house clean.</span> <span id="s4082">If you deal with people in another town, leave the town without problems."</span> <span id="s4083">I think I'm the only one who left Belgium after paying all the taxes that they claimed for the years I was not in Belgium, in view to get the legal papers to leave the country to come to America.</span> <span id="s4084">When I left Belgium, before leaving, someone approached me from Antwerp, and wanted to give me 10,000 dollars to take with me in my baggage, a little purse, a little bag, full of diamonds, that I would not have to touch.</span> <span id="s4085">He would put it in my baggage and I could swear on my honor that I don't have anything that I know of.</span> <span id="s4086">And we decided to come to a new country, and we don't want to start out with the left foot.</span> <span id="s4087">Although we were completely destitute, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s4088">Just a few dollars I earned while in Belgium between '45 and '47, before we left.</span> <span id="s4089">And then I didn't work too much either, because who could work?</span> <span id="s4090">The mind was not at work.</span> <span id="s4091">We were completely [unclear], out of the context of life, then Americans were coming down, then ...</span></p> <p><span id="s4092">JF: You went back then to Volvic, and got your family...</span></p> <p><span id="s4093">BM: Listen, and get my family, came back to Belgium and the V-1's were still flying.</span> <span id="s4094">The Germans were still fighting, and the V-1's took away the roof from the house, and my wife said, "Bernard, we survived those years with Gestapo and fire, let's move."</span> <span id="s4095">So we smuggled the French border, and we came to the northern part of France, because we had a passport to come in, but no visa to go out.</span> <span id="s4096">So we smuggled a border, with a parcel, a human parcel.</span> <span id="s4097">And we came into the northern part of France to Lille; from there we took a train, we came into Paris, and my sister-in-laws were again waiting on the train station, knowing that we would escape, because we were like telepathically communicating.</span> <span id="s4098">They gave me a little room, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s4099">JF: This is still before the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s4100">BM: That was before the end.</span> <span id="s4101">The fighting is going on in Germany, and my sister-in-laws were back in their apartment.</span> <span id="s4102">My brother-in-law was still prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s4103">My nephew had fought in the Resistance, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s4104">JF: In the French Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s4105">BM: Yes, in the French Resistance.</span> <span id="s4106">He was 16 years old when he joined.</span> <span id="s4107">He was a student.</span> <span id="s4108">He came ...</span></p> <p><span id="s4109">JF: Had you known that before this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s4110">BM: Of course.</span> <span id="s4111">He came in Volvic.</span> <span id="s4112">I could--what a coincidence!</span> <span id="s4113">I came down for a night, and I was there.</span> <span id="s4114">It was tomato seasons, and on the way down I had brought tomatoes to the house.</span> <span id="s4115">And we were sitting down having a bite, and a knock on the door, I jumped and I hide myself in a corner, where it was dark.</span> <span id="s4116">And the door opens, and here is a young chap with black hair, no, with red hair, and he looks like David, my nephew from Paris.</span> <span id="s4117">And my wife says, "David?</span> <span id="s4118">," and he said, "Chana?</span> <span id="s4119">," he knows her from Tante Chana.</span> <span id="s4120">He said, "Ya", and then he came into the house, and in his pants, he had two American six-shooters.</span> <span id="s4121">He was part of the French Resistance.</span> <span id="s4122">They had committed sabotage on the outskirt of Paris, and there was a price on his head and the group; he was FTPF.</span> <span id="s4123">He was on the side of the left wing, with the students, of course, and they had committed all kinds of a sabotage.</span> <span id="s4124">And he knew my address, because I was sending food in the beginning of the war to his mother.</span> <span id="s4125">So he came just for a rest, his urge to take a breather.</span></p> <p><span id="s4126">JF: But not knowing that you were also in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s4127">BM: Of course not.</span> <span id="s4128">So the first thing, we took his revolvers; we put on the chimney, was a high chimney.</span> <span id="s4129">The chimney you could put a whole tree in it, the house was so old, 900 years old.</span> <span id="s4130">And he was there for a while with us for a few days.</span> <span id="s4131">I left and I left him with the family, and then later on, I found out, after two days he had left, too.</span> <span id="s4132">Because he didn't want to bring any problems to the house.</span> <span id="s4133">But he was black-haired, beautiful, a typical Jewish boy from Warsaw; he was born in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s4134">And then we met again in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s4135">JF: Where had your wife's sisters been then during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s4136">BM: One was in Paris…</span></p> <p><span id="s4137">JF: She was able to stay in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s4138">BM: Because her husband was prisoner of war, she had the right to be free.</span> <span id="s4139">The other one was hidden in a room, a little corner, three feet by three feet.</span> <span id="s4140">Was a bathroom, three feet by three feet...</span></p> <p><span id="s4141">JF: By a Christian family?</span></p> <p><span id="s4142">BM: No, by my sister-in-law, in the house where she lived, in the court, and she only at night, opened the window for some air, and during the day, she never opened nothing.</span> <span id="s4143">And my sister-in-law, having one ration for food, and there was very little.</span> <span id="s4144">She would collect from the trash cans, from the German restaurants, where the Germans would eat.</span> <span id="s4145">Then she would come home and she would cook it, and prepare and then she would feed her.</span> <span id="s4146">When the war was finished, my sister-in-law was yellow from liver disease.</span> <span id="s4147">And unfortunately, she died three years ago, after we took her one more time to Amsterdam, and to Paris.</span> <span id="s4148">She wanted to see her sister and brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s4149">That brother-in-law died last year.</span> <span id="s4150">They're all dying.</span> <span id="s4151">Not young, but they're dying.</span> <span id="s4152">All the sisters have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s4153">JF: But your one sister, Rebecca, is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s4154">BM: She is alive.</span> <span id="s4155">Then after I came to America, in '47, she didn't want to join us.</span></p> <p><span id="s4156">JF: Wait, before you get to your coming to America...</span></p> <p><span id="s4157">BM: So after being there, I came back to Volvic and I said to my wife, "You know what?</span> <span id="s4158">I must go to the priest and tell him a few things.</span> <span id="s4159">He was with us in the Maquis."</span> <span id="s4160">So I went to him and I said, "Father Matieux, can I speak to you?"</span> <span id="s4161">"Sure, my son," he said, "come in."</span> <span id="s4162">And he was a very jovial old man, white, quite young for his age, and in his rectory he had a big Christ hanging, and his little desk, a couple of chairs.</span> <span id="s4163">And I said, "Father, I'm ready to go back to Belgium."</span> <span id="s4164">And he blessed me and he said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s4165">I said, "But Father, I cannot leave with a lie."</span> <span id="s4166">"Now what kind of a lie could you have told me?"</span> <span id="s4167">he said.</span> <span id="s4168">"Well, Father, all the time you've known me for a Protestant.</span> <span id="s4169">Well," I said, "I am an Israelite."</span> <span id="s4170">And his mouth opened, and he stood up from behind his desk and came to me, and he hold me in his arms and gave me an accolade.</span> <span id="s4171">"My son," he said, "I am proud of you.</span> <span id="s4172">Our Lord, Jesus Christ, was a Hebrew too."</span> <span id="s4173">I said, "I know, Father," I said, "I know.</span> <span id="s4174">Unfortunately," I said, "he didn't fight back, and look what the Romans did to Him."</span> <span id="s4175">He said, "I'm proud of you."</span> <span id="s4176">And he said, "You have really shown that you are a living nation," and he came with me to the house and he blessed my wife and the children.</span> <span id="s4177">And he brought bars of chocolate for the children, and he brought a half dozen eggs that we should boil to take on the trip.</span> <span id="s4178">And then we took the bus.</span> <span id="s4179">We said nothing to nobody; we took the bus and went to Clermont-Ferrand, to take the train.</span> <span id="s4180">Came to Clermont-Ferrand, took the train; we had to cross bridges that were blown.</span> <span id="s4181">I carried Yvette on my shoulders and Eliane in my arms, and Armand was giving his mother the hand, and we made it to Paris.</span> <span id="s4182">We came to Paris; we found out there is no trains for civilian people.</span> <span id="s4183">And I had received a permit to take out from France toward Belgium.</span> <span id="s4184">Because I was from the Resistance, I had the right to take with me two bottles of pure alcohol, five kilo of walnut flesh, two bottles of--Well, anyway, I had a bundle of food to take with me.</span> <span id="s4185">It was still wartime.</span> <span id="s4186">And I come to the northern station to take a train to Brussels, everything is military.</span> <span id="s4187">The Americans are traveling from France to Brussels, from Paris--from Brussels to Paris.</span> <span id="s4188">And my wife gets excited.</span> <span id="s4189">I said, "You sit with the children."</span> <span id="s4190">And I go and look into a train.</span> <span id="s4191">And the trains--there is no train like that in America.</span> <span id="s4192">Two doors open in the center like a subway train, but modern and big.</span> <span id="s4193">And all the luggage of American soldiers are in one corner.</span> <span id="s4194">And there was young soldiers having a good time, eating chocolate, and I didn't see chocolate for five years.</span> <span id="s4195">And I go up to the train, and I am dressed still with my costume from the Resistance, and I go to one, I said, "Anybody speaks French?</span> <span id="s4196">," in French, of course.</span> <span id="s4197">And they start laughing amongst them "Frog legs, frog legs", but I don't understand, so [unclear].</span> <span id="s4198">Then one said, he speaks a little bit, and I explained to him, I said, "I'm the Resistance.</span> <span id="s4199">I want to go back to Belgium, but there is no room for civilians.</span> <span id="s4200">Would you help me take my family back to Brussels?"</span> <span id="s4201">He translated.</span> <span id="s4202">Well, in three minutes I had room for my family.</span> <span id="s4203">We put the children among the soldiers.</span> <span id="s4204">We mixed my baggage with their luggage, and we sit amongst the guys.</span> <span id="s4205">And that guy who spoke a little French, translated to me.</span> <span id="s4206">He said, "You make believe that you are part of us.</span> <span id="s4207">Don't move in case anybody comes in."</span> <span id="s4208">"That's my sister, Rebecca."</span> <span id="s4209">[Tape stops and starts] So my sister--I came back with my family and then we smuggled back the border.</span> <span id="s4210">My sister-in-laws gave us hospitality, and they had the spare room, but it was too small for the five of us.</span> <span id="s4211">So I took Armand and the young one to the Belgian Red Cross, who took the children and put 'em in a camp, like a vacation camp for children, like you would say in America; it's a camp, right, summer camp.</span> <span id="s4212">In French it's called, Une Colonie.</span> <span id="s4213">And the children were away about 60 miles out of Paris.</span> <span id="s4214">And in the meantime, I found a job in a pocketbook factory; I had learned a lot of skill, remember.</span> <span id="s4215">I was earning what to live--the winter came and it was a rough winter.</span> <span id="s4216">You know, we had left in the winter, and it was a rough winter.</span> <span id="s4217">One day there, I received a letter from a cousin who had found me in France.</span> <span id="s4218">I received a check from my Uncle Boris, also a letter; I must have told you, I received a check from America through American friends.</span> <span id="s4219">And there was one of my cousins in the army of General Patton, and because of that, he came to France with Patton.</span> <span id="s4220">And while we were in Paris, a letter followed us all the way from where I was in Volvic, telling us that he was with General Patton in Paris, and I should look him up, on this and this date, in this hotel.</span> <span id="s4221">The trains, the buses were all running and the trains and the subway was very hard to get, so my wife and her sister walked all the way from Port de Clingnancourt to Place De La Republique [in Paris].</span> <span id="s4222">That's a long trek.</span> <span id="s4223">And they came to the place where I was working, about three p.m. I read the letter, very excited, "You have a cousin who is looking for you from America."</span> <span id="s4224">Well, let me tell you the excitement; I became shaking.</span> <span id="s4225">I never had a cousin of mine, from my side.</span> <span id="s4226">While in Belgium we had no one, just my father and the children.</span> <span id="s4227">Then I had family from my wife.</span> <span id="s4228">That was a large family.</span> <span id="s4229">But it was my family because once you are my family, we don't go with third cousins, second cousins, fifteen cousins.</span> <span id="s4230">We are family, and blood is thicker than water.</span> <span id="s4231">And I started looking for my cousin and I came on Champs Elysees, Hotel Georges V, and I asked for Herman Atenson [phonetic], and the clerk spoke beautiful French.</span> <span id="s4232">He said, "Let's find out."</span> <span id="s4233">Loud speaker.</span> <span id="s4234">No Herman Atenson.</span> <span id="s4235">He said "Go look."</span> <span id="s4236">Go look if you don't know what you're looking for?</span> <span id="s4237">When I go look in the eyes of every American soldier, millions of them, maybe three million of them, on R&amp;R, and the street is full of them, and my heart is sinking; it's getting a little darker already.</span> <span id="s4238">In the meantime, my wife and my sister-in-law, they went back home, that was a long walk, and Yvette was left with a neighbor.</span> <span id="s4239">And I walk and I feel the tears coming up to my throat; I am ready to cry.</span> <span id="s4240">As I see this, I see three soldiers walking amongst the other soldiers, and unwillingly, I had a palpitation, like the adrenaline was pumping faster, for what reason, I don't know.</span> <span id="s4241">And as closer I come, I see one that the face is familiar to me, and I wonder where have I seen him before.</span> <span id="s4242">It hit me, my niece Cecile, looked like him.</span> <span id="s4243">And I go to the guy in the middle and of course, I speak not a word of English, and I said in Yiddish, "You are Chaim."</span> <span id="s4244">And he answered in the same intonation of Yiddish, same accent, "You are Bernard."</span> <span id="s4245">And we fall into the arms of each other, in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s4246">Right away, whole group of soldiers, hey, they were delighted that somebody found somebody; they were missing home, too.</span> <span id="s4247">And they were clapping in the shoulders.</span> <span id="s4248">We cannot speak, he is choked, I am choked.</span> <span id="s4249">In the meantime, from my pocket on the side, I take out the butts that I was saving from the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s4250">You have five butts, makes one cigarette and he said, "No," he said, and he takes out a pack of cigarettes and gives them to me.</span> <span id="s4251">Now to the Americans, cigarette is like candy.</span> <span id="s4252">So they all--they drove me wacky.</span> <span id="s4253">I shoved a couple of cigarettes in my mouth and start chewing.</span> <span id="s4254">Well, I choked on it anyway.</span> <span id="s4255">But it was a good feeling to know that I can afford to chew a cigarette.</span> <span id="s4256">And my cousin took me under his arm, was a strong guy, and he was like a god to me.</span> <span id="s4257">My flesh and blood!</span> <span id="s4258">My father's sister's son.</span> <span id="s4259">She went to America and my father wound up in Belgium on the same Kishinev pogrom.</span> <span id="s4260">And Uncle Boris who was in Belgium came to America a few years later.</span> <span id="s4261">And they had children; those children were the cousins.</span> <span id="s4262">And cousins were married; and they all decided that the rest of the family from Europe had to come to America.</span> <span id="s4263">We were five people.</span> <span id="s4264">Now I had nothing and I was working enough to subside.</span> <span id="s4265">I made a living while I was with my sister.</span> <span id="s4266">So he said to me, "Bernard," he said, in Yiddish we speak, "Now you must come to America."</span> <span id="s4267">I said, "Chaim," I said, "I don't know if I like to come to America because what we know from America is bluffers, gangsters and chewing gum.</span> <span id="s4268">That's all we know from America."</span> <span id="s4269">I had no more America in mind that you have in mind now to go to Guadaloupe, or Bekutchamba.</span> <span id="s4270">But seeing the cousin made another thing.</span> <span id="s4271">I said, "We have no mind of going to America."</span> <span id="s4272">And at that time, unknowing about the situation, I was praying somebody in Palestine--I would have loved Palestine, but there was no one.</span> <span id="s4273">And it was in the limbo, you know it was '45, and nothing was working.</span> <span id="s4274">So that cousin, Chaim, he said, "Let's go to my hotel room."</span> <span id="s4275">We get to the hotel room, and he gave a scream, and suddenly from all the steps they started bringing down cartons and boxes with bananas, dried, and food for the children, and tobacco, and cigarettes, and chocolate bars and soap.</span> <span id="s4276">That was a treasure.</span> <span id="s4277">I couldn't believe this is for me.</span> <span id="s4278">Then, after everything was done, he was able to muster a jeep and with three guys with him and me in the back, holding that treasure of boxes, of America, powdered milk, cereal, figs, dates, raisins, c-rations.</span> <span id="s4279">You don't know what it means.</span> <span id="s4280">We came to the court where we lived in Montmartre.</span> <span id="s4281">As the jeep stopped, the remainder of the Jews over there, made a circle, and it was like a beehive.</span> <span id="s4282">Somebody found somebody.</span> <span id="s4283">Everybody was envying me, and I took my cousin into my sister-in-law's little rooms.</span> <span id="s4284">Oh, a third of this, and they came in, they're not accustomed to that.</span> <span id="s4285">They didn't live in luxury, but they lived like menschen and my sister-in-law made him comfortable.</span> <span id="s4286">And they start smoking the cigarettes, those three guys, and half of them they throw out.</span> <span id="s4287">I gave them a big pot; I saved all the butts.</span> <span id="s4288">So under court was the concierge--you know what a concierge is--she was half decent enough paskudyak [disgusting unappetizing person] during the war.</span> <span id="s4289">My sister-in-law received normal food because she was a prisoner of war's wife, but she had black market, and my sister-in-law couldn't go black market.</span> <span id="s4290">So for the rations of my sister-in-law, she would give her the second brewing of her coffee, the grind from the second brewing.</span> <span id="s4291">She would get out of my sister-in-law whatever she could.</span> <span id="s4292">She had no heart, no heart.</span> <span id="s4293">Then when my cousins came and they had those butts, she came into the house, you know, very friendly, and I was a dog.</span> <span id="s4294">I said, "Sorry," I said, "this is a family affair," and I pushed her out.</span> <span id="s4295">And my sister-in-law couldn't understand, because that's not me.</span> <span id="s4296">Because I am a sharing person, but here I know what a horrible person she was during--I wouldn't share with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s4297">JF: Tell me when you were living in Paris, you lived there from '45 then until...</span></p> <p><span id="s4298">BM: To the beginning of '46.</span> <span id="s4299">To the end of '45, '45-'46.</span></p> <p><span id="s4300">JF: Was there any antisemitism toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4301">BM: No, there was not enough Jews left.</span></p> <p><span id="s4302">JF: And the French themselves were ...</span></p> <p><span id="s4303">BM: They had their own problem, they had too much collaborators.</span> <span id="s4304">If you were a collaborator you had to save your neck.</span> <span id="s4305">If you were Resistance, you were looking for collaborators.</span> <span id="s4306">They had enough to do with themselves.</span> <span id="s4307">You know the tale of Babylon; God decided that so many tongues, He's going to confuse them; so He did, he confused them, and they left us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s4308">JF: You also mentioned earlier that Armand was Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s4309">BM: Yes, well, let me tell you, in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s4310">JF: Oh, in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s4311">BM: In Belgium, he was Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s4312">He was Bar Mitzvahed in '46, but late.</span> <span id="s4313">The end of the winter, must have been in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">JF: Why did you go back to Belgium then, after this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s4315">BM: Because of my sister, Rebecca.</span></p> <p><span id="s4316">JF: You went back to be with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s4317">BM: Naturally.</span> <span id="s4318">After the war was finished, the Germans already surrendered, and I was an alien in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s4319">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4320">BM: You know, it's not like you live in Chicago, you come to Philadelphia, you're still in America.</span> <span id="s4321">You must have residence papers and passports and visa, and card d'identité and everything else, and then it was--I had better chance in Belgium, because it was still my homeland.</span></p> <p><span id="s4322">JF: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s4323">BM: I was an orthopedic technician.</span></p> <p><span id="s4324">JF: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s4325">BM: I was always, but I did everything else.</span> <span id="s4326">I could make a pocketbook, I could be a furrier, and I could be a baker.</span> <span id="s4327">I could--I was not lazy, and that was the part.</span></p> <p><span id="s4328">JF: Could you tell me how then, your son was Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s4329">BM: Well, at my son's Bar Mitzvah, there was not enough Jews in the city of Brussels, but in the whole congregation, Reformed.</span> <span id="s4330">So my family from Paris, we had an aunt and an uncle who survived, elderly people, and they lived somewhere in Provence, the whole time of the war.</span> <span id="s4331">She was French from six generations back, from Alsace-Lorraine.</span> <span id="s4332">Tante Michele, we called her.</span> <span id="s4333">There is only one daughter left and whenever we go to France, she is Miss Paris for us.</span> <span id="s4334">She knows France inside out, of course.</span> <span id="s4335">You know, she would never leave Paris, never.</span> <span id="s4336">So I worked in Paris.</span> <span id="s4337">And then that cousin had to leave, and then we came back to Belgium, already had given an address for my sister where she lived.</span> <span id="s4338">Then we came back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s4339">And I found employment in Belgium, gainful employment, and people wanted to go into partnership because I was a Belgian, and they had strict rules then, because they had to clear up the atmosphere of all those who had dealt with the Germans, who had made money with the Germans.</span> <span id="s4340">One morning, on a Monday morning, all the banks closed up; the Belgian money is of no value.</span> <span id="s4341">You have to bring all your money in, until 20,000 francs they won't question.</span> <span id="s4342">Above 20,000 francs, they like to know where your money comes from.</span> <span id="s4343">If your money is legitimate, you put it in the bank, they pay you an interest and within six months you can start taking your money out.</span> <span id="s4344">But in the meantime...</span></p> <p><span id="s4345">Tape 6, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s4346">BM: There was many Jews who in view to save their lives, in view to save their lives, had been obliged to work for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s4347">And they made mountains of money.</span> <span id="s4348">It would have been easier to say "no" and then maybe shot or deported, but they saved their lives and made money, and then they gave the biggest part of the money to the Joint Distribution Committee who came immediately after the Allies invaded, the countries where some Jews were remained.</span> <span id="s4349">And I had offers to go into partnership because I was a Belgian.</span> <span id="s4350">I could have opened any kind of a place.</span> <span id="s4351">But an alien could invest money and open a place under my name.</span> <span id="s4352">Now, I had no money, so people approached me, "Bernard, we'll give you 100,000 francs.</span> <span id="s4353">You declare it, you take 20,000 for you and when everything is cleared up you give me back sixty."</span> <span id="s4354">Well, I have never been used to do any shady things, because I was a working man all my life, and I didn't have a big interest of saving rich people's monies, either.</span> <span id="s4355">That's me.</span> <span id="s4356">I was a working man and made a very pleasant living, comfortable.</span> <span id="s4357">I worked out, but I never resented it.</span> <span id="s4358">I worked and I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s4359">In America I worked 23 years for one firm and I loved every hour of it.</span> <span id="s4360">And it was a lot of hard work.</span> <span id="s4361">Maybe you know the firm, Henry Simon Company, on 8th and Spring Garden, previously.</span> <span id="s4362">I was there when the oldtimers were there.</span> <span id="s4363">And then, one day, I get a letter from America.</span></p> <p><span id="s4364">JF: You were in Belgium, then, from the end of 1945.</span></p> <p><span

Hollander Shule [synagogue].</span></p> <p><span id="s4376">BM: In the Hollander Shule, and I was Bar Mitzvahed in the same shule.</span> <span id="s4377">You see, the Jews had two ceremonies.</span> <span id="s4378">There was a Bar Mitzvah, from the synagogue; and you remember I told you we had the religious school in our school system.</span> <span id="s4379">So Shavuot, the congregation would take all the children from the Jewish school to public and make a communion, in the Hollander school.</span> <span id="s4380">So we were all wearing little uniforms, collars with the black ribbons, little Lord Fauntleroys; and I remember, I'll never forget, I had high shoes with eight buttons, half leather, and the rest was--hey, I was born before the first World War!</span></p> <p><span id="s4381">JF: So you were not Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s4382">BM: I was Bar Mitzvahed in the synagogue, and then I was communioned [see footnote].</span> <span id="s4383">You know, the communion [see footnote] was the day of real Bar Mitzvah that they give you, that you fulfill your religious initiation, and in the synagogue you became a man, because you are Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s4384">Hot Potato!</span> <span id="s4385">That's it!</span> <span id="s4386">So when you made Bar Mitzvah, we invited Tante and Uncle Michele, my sister in-laws; my brother-in-law was not released from the army by then, he was still prisoner of war, and David came.</span> <span id="s4387">David is my nephew.</span> <span id="s4388">Then already, I had found my two nieces in the

then to being Bar Mitzvahed after all these years of not identifying?</span></p> <p><span id="s4402">BM: He felt good about it, because now he said, now I am myself.</span> <span id="s4403">Until

I drove my family up the wall, until I was able to get 'em to the point where some relatives were very influential.</span> <span id="s4450">They realized that to bring me over, they needed an
