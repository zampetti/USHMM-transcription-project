let’s go.</span> <span id="s2068">And then we left Lidice, and we started to walk, and we walked, and it’s mountain area, and it’s February, and it’s cold, and you go, and this assessment, they had luggage we should carry for them up.</span> <span id="s2069">So the head of this group, which was a sergeant or something, we called them the ___________.</span> <span id="s2070">Do you know what

September 9, the September first or the second came a group of people who were found that _________.</span> <span id="s2103">So here was this man, his wife and a child.</span> <span id="s2104">The

tell her, tell her.</span> <span id="s2114">I said, when he would come, a doctor, which is a military man, and I would suggest he will ask, is that your child?</span> <span id="s2115">Don’t say it’s yours.</span> <span id="s2116">Don’t tell them it’s yours.</span> <span id="s2117">It’s possible they would take away the child, but you would survive.</span> <span id="s2118">If you will keep the child, you will not survive.</span> <span id="s2119">You will go and the child will go.</span> <span id="s2120">So it’s a question.</span> <span id="s2121">I said according to my feelings, you have to give away the child only to survive because the Germans want to kill you too.</span> <span id="s2122">So they did.</span> <span id="s2123">And she did it this way.</span> <span id="s2124">She let the child go, and the child—and this couple, both of them, after the war, met and went to Israel.</span> <span id="s2125">But he had on his conscience that somebody—he meant—he couldn’t—he gave away the

underground.</span> <span id="s2144">This was murder.</span> <span id="s2145">The Pollacks, they were beating us up, because we came as old inmates.</span> <span id="s2146">I had such a career of three years already.</span> <span id="s2147">They just gave us a hard time and so on.</span> <span id="s2148">Also, one day, must have been an order not to make any tanks anymore for the army, so we were all assembled in the morning.</span> <span id="s2149">All from the 320 remained some 80 or 70, because the rest are somewhere on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: They died along the
