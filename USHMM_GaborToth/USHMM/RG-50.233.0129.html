contains formatting issues</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Abstract Harold Charles Spear (Szpiro) was born in Danzig, and confronted anti-Semitism by the time he was six and a half years old, in 1924-1925.</span> <span id="s6">His schoolteacher forced him to sit down on spilled ink one day, and threatened to make him sit on a hundred thumbtacks the next day.</span> <span id="s7">Charles ran out of the school and refused to return.</span> <span id="s8">His parents sent him to live with his grandmother in the predominantly Jewish town of Pluzga, Poland on the border with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Later, he went to Lodz, and eventually biked all the way to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s10">He had tried to get a passport to leave the country, but was refused because he was draft age.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">He was sent to various camps.</span> <span id="s12">The head of a transfer camp in Lublin shot anyone who looked him in the eyes.</span> <span id="s13">Harold managed to get himself and a friend sent back to their respective parents.</span> <span id="s14">But when Harold’s father told him Jews were not allowed to use sidewalks, Harold decided to go into hiding in Chisava, 20 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s15">He stayed with a farmer and then moved into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">His parents and little brother were put into a ghetto in Pluzga.</span> <span id="s17">Harold wanted to take his brother into hiding, but his parents refused because they thought Harold had a better chance of surviving on his own.</span> <span id="s18">They were taken eventually to an extermination camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">When Harold was taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, the first thing he saw was a corpse hanging on an electrified barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s20">Harold, a tool and die maker, worked in a machine shop.</span> <span id="s21">A kapo gave him 50 lashes with an electrical cord for helping a fellow prisoner.</span> <span id="s22">Harold became very close with a man so strong he could bend metal rods.</span> <span id="s23">The man, Moka K, saved Harold when he was trampled in a cattle car going to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s24">Its head SS man refused to take the prisoners, and suggested shooting all of them.</span> <span id="s25">Instead, they were marched to Rodhausen, where Harold worked on V-1 rockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">As the Russians approached, prisoners were loaded onto barges and then were marched about 7 kilometers to the North Sea, where they were put onto boats for a German prisoner-of-war exchange with British forces.</span> <span id="s27">After the war, he returned to Germany, where he found a cousin who was soon killed in a truck-train collision.</span> <span id="s28">Harold was treated for many months for a painful neurological condition, but was eventually cured.</span> <span id="s29">He emigrated to the U.S.</span> <span id="s30">He did not like the fast pace of New York City so he moved to the St. Paul, Minnesota area, where he joined a friend.</span> <span id="s31">Harold married and was about to celebrate his 40th wedding anniversary at the time of the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Tape I, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Question: This is an interview with Charles Spear and this is Jennifer Clayman.</span> <span id="s34">Today's date is May 16, 1992 (in Golden Valley, MN).</span> <span id="s35">I guess I'd like to start out with--we're going to backtrack a little bit from all this that you've been telling me.</span> <span id="s36">I'd like to know a little bit about your family, what kind of a life you led before the war, what your parents did, what life was like at your house, things like that.</span> <span id="s37">If you want to start with where you were born and just take it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Answer: I was born in a city by the name Danzig on the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s39">My father was a grain merchant and Danzig was on the Baltic.</span> <span id="s40">He conducted a lot of business, shipping grain from Danzig to East Prussia and to Germany.</span> <span id="s41">I remember good things about my early years until I started going to school and I started feeling that I'm in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s42">Somehow displaced, I didn't have anyone who would take my side when I went to school.</span> <span id="s43">I found myself standing up and the teacher told me sit down.</span> <span id="s44">I was only six and a half years old and I said I could not sit down because someone spilled ink on my seat.</span> <span id="s45">You better sit down or else I'll come over and help you.”</span> <span id="s46">So I had to sit down and mess up my clothes.</span> <span id="s47">When I came home and I told my parents what happened, they said maybe it's an isolated case and we'll see, maybe it will never repeat itself.</span> <span id="s48">The next day, I came and I found myself in my seat were thumbtacks one next to another where I was supposed to sit.</span> <span id="s49">Again the same thing, I was standing up and the teacher said “sit down.”</span> <span id="s50">I said I cannot sit down on a hundred thumbtacks.</span> <span id="s51">“You better sit down.”</span> <span id="s52">And I told him I'm not going to sit down on thumbtacks.</span> <span id="s53">He said “I'll come over and help you.”</span> <span id="s54">I ran out the school and I went home and I told my parents, I'll never go back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Question: You knew why?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Answer: It was already under the German occupation.</span> <span id="s57">That was after the 1933 plebiscite and that was the count, who they want to be under.</span> <span id="s58">The majority supposedly voted to be under the Germans.</span> <span id="s59">I started feeling the Germans in 1933 already when the first ugly faces started to show up in the ____ and all those other hordes that came marching down on that city.</span> <span id="s60">After that last episode, my parents decided that I'll have to go and live with my grandmother in the city of Pluzga (46) which was on the German border in Poland.</span> <span id="s61">They had a school that was just for Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s62">Pluzga had a population of 5,000 and the majority of the occupants were Jewish.</span> <span id="s63">It was probably 65 percent Jewish people.</span> <span id="s64">They were swarming into that city because it was on the border and they could conduct business.</span> <span id="s65">That was before the war.</span> <span id="s66">Pluzga didn’t experience any problems in the thirties until 1939.</span> <span id="s67">They could freely go across the borders by having a certain pass.</span> <span id="s68">They conducted business there and many of them were doing tremendously well.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Question: Just backtrack a little bit talking about--.</span> <span id="s70">You were 13 when you said---.</span> <span id="s71">Sixteen is that what you said?</span> <span id="s72">Because I thought you said six and a half, but then you said 1933 and I wasn't--and I know that you had to be older than that so--.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Answer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s74">That was long before and I must stand corrected.</span> <span id="s75">That's true.</span> <span id="s76">By not looking into what I wrote, it gets all confusing.</span> <span id="s77">It was long before the Germans even walked into that city; they already had their ugly faces.</span> <span id="s78">They were all pro-German.</span> <span id="s79">Even it was a city that was Polish and German.</span> <span id="s80">The Poles had their own rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s81">We lived in a German neighborhood and the street was Jundergasser (74) and that's where we lived.</span> <span id="s82">Yeah, I started school over there and that must have been probably in 1924 when I started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Question: When those things happened to you?</span> <span id="s84">Was that around 1924 or was that later?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Answer: Yes, '24, '25.</span> <span id="s86">I can't be too specific about it but that's when it happened and that's when I had to leave my parents and my younger brothers and go live with my grandparents in Pluzga.</span> <span id="s87">Lucky for me that I had a good school, right across the street from my grandmother's house.</span> <span id="s88">I was fortunate to meet some people, three sisters by the name of Landorf (88).</span> <span id="s89">They were graduates of a seminary, I don't know if that's how we called it, a teachers' college.</span> <span id="s90">But they couldn't get work in Poland because they were Jewish and they didn't hire Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s91">The only place where they did hire them was in a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s92">Like Pluzga, we had all Jewish teachers there and I was one of their students and the other one was another young lady by the name Lipcha (98) Boglen.</span> <span id="s93">They are from ________.</span> <span id="s94">Those are the two, they didn't do it for money, they were well-off because their father went to the United States.</span> <span id="s95">He was a graduate engineer and he got work and he was in Texas.</span> <span id="s96">He was doing very, very well and he helped them out.</span> <span id="s97">From what I remember, I used to go up to their apartment.</span> <span id="s98">I remember an elderly lady always standing near the stove.</span> <span id="s99">The three girls dressed very, very nicely and they were all trying to help out.</span> <span id="s100">They only took on kids who -- and I don't know how my name came up – maybe my grandmother passed the word that she would like I should get same help in preparing me for school because I was brought up with the German language and I wasn't quite prepared to take on a Polish school.</span> <span id="s101">Polish was the dominant language.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Question: But it was a Jewish school?</span> <span id="s103">Was it--?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Answer: The curriculum was Polish in accordance with all other schools.</span> <span id="s105">They had the same curriculum.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Question: The only difference was that the students were--?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Answer: Religion, which was compulsory.</span> <span id="s108">One religion, Mosaic, Moses they called over there, the religion of Moses.</span> <span id="s109">We learned the Bible, our Bible.</span> <span id="s110">And there was another school that the Poles attended and they had their own religion that they were taught.</span> <span id="s111">Poland did not separate state from religion.</span> <span id="s112">You had to attend a religious school.</span> <span id="s113">That school was, to me it was a Godsend, when I went in there.</span> <span id="s114">I was supposed to go in there right after I arrived over there but I wasn't prepared.</span> <span id="s115">I couldn't speak the language properly.</span> <span id="s116">I knew a few words but that wasn't enough not to be ridiculed by other kids.</span> <span id="s117">Those Landorf sisters prepared me to such an extent that I was above the first grade.</span> <span id="s118">The principal said, “I cannot put him into first grade because he knows so much more.</span> <span id="s119">He would be sleeping, he would have nothing to learn.</span> <span id="s120">So we'll start him out with the second grade.”</span> <span id="s121">And the same with that other girl, that Lipa…She also went into the third grade because she was a year older.</span> <span id="s122">My recollections from that school were all good.</span> <span id="s123">I met my life­long friend by the name Edek Z (140).</span> <span id="s124">He was from a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s125">They owned a large farm, farming community, everything, lock, stock and barrel.</span> <span id="s126">They had 20-some homes in that area and many acres of land.</span> <span id="s127">Mr. Z was a gentleman farmer and they called him all kind of names like lordship because he was one of the richest men in that city.</span> <span id="s128">He controlled so much business that they didn't know how to address him.</span> <span id="s129">After I met my friend Edek, I started going to their home.</span> <span id="s130">It was an elaborate home with many, many rooms.</span> <span id="s131">They had things that normally other people didn't have like a grand piano that took up half a room and all the kids got lessons in music, different--.</span> <span id="s132">My friend was not, did not _______ to music and he wanted to be free like a bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Question: So you were friends in school?</span> <span id="s134">Were you friends in school and--?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Answer: Yes, that's where we met and we are friends still today.</span> <span id="s136">He used to live in London, England.</span> <span id="s137">Now his residence is in Spain on the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s138">Then he got a home also on the west coast of England , where the weather is more to his liking.</span> <span id="s139">He suffers from arthritis and he cannot stand the weather in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Question: I want to talk to you a little bit more, just about school and--.</span> <span id="s141">Did you stay in school, in Pluzga and you went all the way through high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Answer: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Question: So you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Answer: I stayed there until I finished the seventh grade.</span> <span id="s145">The schools over there were seven grades.</span> <span id="s146">Our curriculum was broader than normal in other schools.</span> <span id="s147">We learned so much that it was almost like high school equivalency.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">(Tape is paused).</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Question: You were talking about school and about--.</span> <span id="s150">I asked you if you went through high school and you were saying you'd gotten to the seventh grade and were talking about--.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Answer: The school gave us an education equivalent to a high school.</span> <span id="s152">When I finished public school, grade school, and I came to Lodz to continue --.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Question: So you were really young when you went to--when you started in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Answer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s155">Seventh grade is about 13 or 14 years old.</span> <span id="s156">We didn't have a high school in Pluzga.</span> <span id="s157">It's not like the United States that any small community would have a high school or for that matter, a college.</span> <span id="s158">You have to go to the capital city to attend a college.</span> <span id="s159">We are not as progressive as other countries.</span> <span id="s160">Russia, they had higher education in smaller communities.</span> <span id="s161">If I wanted to attend another school, I had to go out of town.</span> <span id="s162">The same happened to my friend Edek.</span> <span id="s163">He went to college and he attended a school, a trade school over there where he took pre-engineering courses.</span> <span id="s164">I attended a school that I felt would help me if I ever should come to the United States, I'll be able to get the same kind of a job and be able to support myself.</span> <span id="s165">It was a school that was teaching people how to make nylon stockings.</span> <span id="s166">At that time, it was in its infancy.</span> <span id="s167">They just started making them and it was one of the most lucrative professions that if someone wanted to get into a good-paying job, to be a nylon maker, he had it made.</span> <span id="s168">The school for that was paid for by an American organization by the name ORT.</span> <span id="s169">My uncle's brother-in-law, rather sister-in-law, was the president of the ORT.</span> <span id="s170">Through her, I got a scholarship and I was able to attend because living in another city and paying for schooling, even though my parents were not poor but it was beyond their means.</span> <span id="s171">For me, it was like a Godsend I was able to attend that school.</span> <span id="s172">Also, in the evening, I went to classes which I learned things that, of higher education, before college, like a junior college or something of that sort.</span> <span id="s173">My time was quite taken up with school, trade school until about 2 o'clock.</span> <span id="s174">Then from 4 o'clock until 7 o'clock, I was in a junior high school, not junior high, junior college.</span> <span id="s175">I also went twice a week to Hebrew education.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Question: This was all in Lodz.</span> <span id="s177">How many years did you spend there?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Answer: I lived over there until the Germans marched in.</span> <span id="s179">I felt that Pluzga didn't offer me much.</span> <span id="s180">It was too small of a community.</span> <span id="s181">I used to go back for vacations.</span> <span id="s182">I spent a few months and then I had to go back.</span> <span id="s183">I saw my parents once or twice a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Question: How did your parents feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Answer: I lived there with a family and they rented a room to me.</span> <span id="s186">I ate over there, boarded.</span> <span id="s187">It wasn't an easy life but I felt if I want to succeed in life, I'll have to sacrifice something; that was playtime.</span> <span id="s188">I had many friends and the only time we could go out and have a good time was over the weekend like Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s189">We met and we used to go to a movie or some other place of recreation until the war broke out and that ruined everything.</span> <span id="s190">As a matter of fact, in between time, my relatives in the United States sent me some papers to come to the United States as a student.</span> <span id="s191">I had everything ready, the only thing that I needed was a Polish passport.</span> <span id="s192">Wouldn't you know, the Poles refused to give me a passport to go out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">(A pause in tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Question: I just wondered why you couldn't get a passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Answer: Everyone at the age of 15 was considered eligible for the draft.</span> <span id="s196">Consequently, I was in that age bracket and they refused to give me a passport.</span> <span id="s197">They said, “You cannot go away now, our country is in mortal danger of being overrun by the Germans and we need every able­bodied person.”</span> <span id="s198">They refused to let me go.</span> <span id="s199">I hired an attorney and I told them the army is going to exist without Harold Spear.They don't need me, it didn't help.</span> <span id="s200">I had to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Question: Where were you going to go in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Answer: To New York City.</span> <span id="s203">I had relatives who were quite well-off.</span> <span id="s204">They had a factory for men's clothing and _______.</span> <span id="s205">The gentleman who started the factory was my grandmother's brother.</span> <span id="s206">When I went over there finally, he was already dead and the children had control over it and especially one son, Norman Cohen, who was running that factory.</span> <span id="s207">He was empowered by his father’s Will.</span> <span id="s208">Norman Cohen promised to give me a job and educate me and teach me everything and advance me in the business.</span> <span id="s209">But that was only on paper and that's as far as it went.</span> <span id="s210">I don't know if I'm jumping ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s211">In order to clarify that, when I finally came to the United States, a letter was waiting for me that I have a job waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Question: The same job that was promised beforehand?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Answer: Yes, the job that I envisioned -- his father's Will specified there was a job that would advance me in that business.</span> <span id="s214">Every three months, I would go to a different place or they would put me into different areas of the business so I could learn it from the bottom up.</span> <span id="s215">When I started to work in accordance with the provision, I was supposed to be advanced every three months.</span> <span id="s216">It turned out I was working as a -- cutting cloth for the cutters to cut it down for jackets or coats.</span> <span id="s217">We had to unroll it and cut it into certain sizes.</span> <span id="s218">I was there four months and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s219">At one time, a fellow by the name Jacoby, a distant relative, came over and said to me, “You know, I feel sorry for you.”</span> <span id="s220">I said “Why?”</span> <span id="s221">He said, “You know you are starting out the same way I started out in that business.</span> <span id="s222">At that time Norman's father was running the business.</span> <span id="s223">He told me also that he's going to do this and that and he never lived up to it.</span> <span id="s224">The same thing is going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s225">What I’m doing now, this is my job.”</span> <span id="s226">He showed me a broom.</span> <span id="s227">He said, “You'll wind up doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s228">When they have no use for you, they'll give you a broom in your hand and you'll have to sweep the floors.</span> <span id="s229">You're young, run away from here.”</span> <span id="s230">This is my beginning coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">(Pause in tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Question: Okay.</span> <span id="s233">You left off with--you had just finished talking about your schooling and you finished describing what happened to you up until the beginning of the war, of being in school and all of that.</span> <span id="s234">Your script starts with your bicycling to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Answer: I see.</span> <span id="s236">I biked all the way to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s237">Is it down?</span> <span id="s238">Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s239">When I arrived in Warsaw with the bike, I had a reception committee of German SS people, who stopped everyone from coming into the city.</span> <span id="s240">They diverted all the people to a city by the name_____.</span> <span id="s241">It was a large city and there was a German outpost that screened everyone who came over there.</span> <span id="s242">Me being in the age that they thought maybe I would have been a Polish soldier,I disguised myself as a civilian.</span> <span id="s243">Actually they didn't care, all they wanted was people to go to work for them and clean up all of the work that had to be done in the farms.</span> <span id="s244">Because all the able-bodied people were in the war.</span> <span id="s245">I'rn not sure if I brought this up.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Question: It's okay.</span> <span id="s247">Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Answer: Well, when we went over there, they sent us by cattle car and the city was St (398).</span> <span id="s249">We were assigned to a camp, it was all built with tents and they put us up in tents.</span> <span id="s250">There were about 150 people assigned to each tent.</span> <span id="s251">The lodging was, we were lying on the ground with a little bit of straw as a mattress and one blanket for each person.</span> <span id="s252">At that time, it was already fall and the weather got very, very chilly at night and being that we were near the Baltic Sea, we felt it very, very badly.</span> <span id="s253">We had to make the best of it.</span> <span id="s254">I had a friend and we joined teams.</span> <span id="s255">He was a barber by trade and did barbering in the tent.</span> <span id="s256">Since money had no value for us because we couldn't buy anything for it, he was bartering a haircut or a shave for either bread or a blanket.</span> <span id="s257">Eventually, we wound up having enough blankets that we didn't feel the chill at night.</span> <span id="s258">Food was meager but we made it last.</span> <span id="s259">We got along just fine until one day Swiss Red Cross people saw us in those tents.</span> <span id="s260">They gave them a bawling out, “How can you do that, keeping those people in tents when you are freezing inside a house if you haven't got heat.</span> <span id="s261">That made them do double work and they put up barracks and we moved into the barracks around December.</span> <span id="s262">It was quite a difference from the way you lived in the tents.</span> <span id="s263">The tents, incidentally, had no sanitary conditions.</span> <span id="s264">We had to go out into a latrine that was in the open.</span> <span id="s265">That's what really stirred them up.</span> <span id="s266">They said a person could freeze by the time he goes and does his physiological duty.</span> <span id="s267">The barracks were put up at a very fast pace and we moved into them, only to find out a month later that we were going to be shipped back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Question: Where was the place where you were, were you stayed?</span> <span id="s269">Were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Answer: In Germany, yeah.</span> <span id="s271">That was near Stetten (465).</span> <span id="s272">Poland claimed that those are the occupied territories that they used to own at one time.</span> <span id="s273">They followed all the directions of Himmler on how to get rid of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s274">They put us up in rows and they made every Jew come forward.</span> <span id="s275">The gentiles were not touched, they told them to go back into the barracks.</span> <span id="s276">We were put up on trains and shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s277">We wound up in a city by the name Lublin and it was a miserable camp.</span> <span id="s278">The SS fuhrer of the camp didn't like anyone to look him in the eyes.</span> <span id="s279">That was a death sentence.</span> <span id="s280">If someone looked him in the eyes, he took out a gun and shot him on the spot.</span> <span id="s281">When I heard about it, I said I better stay a mile away from him.</span> <span id="s282">I started looking around and when I came to the office, I noticed a guy who looked familiar.</span> <span id="s283">I went over to him and I said “are you by chance Zweig (497) Silverberg?”</span> <span id="s284">He said, “Yes how do you know me?”</span> <span id="s285">I said, “You came once to our Betar (494) group in Pluzga and you made a speech and that's how I remember you.”</span> <span id="s286">“Oh,” he said, “in that case, you deserve something special.</span> <span id="s287">Do you want to go back to your parents?”</span> <span id="s288">I said, “Of course I would like that.”</span> <span id="s289">He said, “I'll work out the papers for you and you can go back in two days.”</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Question: Were you in a work camp in Lublin?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Answer: That was a transit camp where they kept on shipping people in different directions.</span> <span id="s292">If I would have told them that I don't have parents, that I don't have anyone to go to, I would have been shipped to a camp, a steady camp to stay there.</span> <span id="s293">But as long I insisted I wanted to go back to my parents, they made out the papers for me.</span> <span id="s294">Before I left his office, he said, “You know, looking at the listing here, I see there is another person here from your hometown by the name Josef U (529).”</span> <span id="s295">I said, “Oh my G-d, I know him very well.”</span> <span id="s296">The man said, “I'm going to make out the paper for you and him and you'll both go the same time.”</span> <span id="s297">Sure enough, two days later they put us on a horse and buggy and took us to the station.</span> <span id="s298">They told us to take off the yellow stars because we would have been harassed everywhere we would have gone.</span> <span id="s299">We went on that train and four hours later we were at our destination.</span> <span id="s300">The area where we stopped was never used for a stop except if someone wanted to get off at that place, otherwise it was going through with that area.</span> <span id="s301">We got off in there, nobody else.</span> <span id="s302">I was hoping that we might be able to find someone going the same direction to hitch a ride but luck wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s303">At that time, going at night was a no-no.</span> <span id="s304">If they caught somebody walking at night, they didn't ask questions, they just shot them.</span> <span id="s305">We took a great risk and we walked 11 kilometers to the city of Pluzga and luck was with us that we didn't see a single person.</span> <span id="s306">We went to our destinations; he went to his house, I went to my house.</span> <span id="s307">I knocked on the door and my father came to the door and said “Who is it?”</span> <span id="s308">I said, “It's me, Harold.”</span> <span id="s309">“Oh my G-d,” he yelled out.</span> <span id="s310">“You wouldn't believe it, our son is here!”</span> <span id="s311">He opened up the door and it was one o'clock and we spend maybe four hours overnight reminiscing about what had happened.</span> <span id="s312">We talked a lot and finally in the early morning, I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s313">I slept until about 8 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s314">They told me that in the morning, every able-bodied person had to go out and do some work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s315">They kept a close watch on everybody and if that person didn't come out, they wanted to make sure that he's not skipping town or trying to get away from working.</span> <span id="s316">My father told me, “You better go and be with the group.”</span> <span id="s317">Since I was new in that city, they ask me what kind of work I could do.</span> <span id="s318">I had a background in tool and die making.</span> <span id="s319">I told them that I took it up in trade school.</span> <span id="s320">They said “Oh, a guy like you, we could use.”</span> <span id="s321">They assigned me to organize a group of people who have some knowledge about how to fix their stuff that gets damaged.</span> <span id="s322">They said, “We can give you a lot of work and you'll be busy.</span> <span id="s323">You're going to have a better quality of living than all the others have because you'll be working for the German army.”</span> <span id="s324">That didn't impress me a bit.</span> <span id="s325">From the day I went over there, when I went out in the street, my father said, “You're not allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s326">You have to walk in the gutter.”</span> <span id="s327">Tape I, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Answer: When he told me that, I feel like someone would have jabbed me straight in my heart.</span> <span id="s329">“What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s330">I said.</span> <span id="s331">“Why can't I walk on the sidewalk?”</span> <span id="s332">“That’s the law.</span> <span id="s333">Go and argue with them.”</span> <span id="s334">So when I heard that, all the promises they made to me, that I'm going to have good eating and good lodging and whatever else, as I said, didn't impress me at all.</span> <span id="s335">I started to look around and see if I can find a place where I can hide out and be sure that I can maybe live through the war.</span> <span id="s336">I met a fellow who was working nearby where I was and he said, “I have the same idea, I would like to get away from the city.”</span> <span id="s337">Sure enough a few days later, we packed a few things that we had and we went 20 kilometers from the city.</span> <span id="s338">It was an area by the name Chisava (16).</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Question: Did your parents know that you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Answer: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">I told my parents.</span> <span id="s342">They tried to talk me out of it but they felt if I can help myself and hopefully survive, they said by all means.</span> <span id="s343">“We are too old to start a lifestyle like that, not to know where we are going to sleep tomorrow, where you'll be the next day.</span> <span id="s344">But if you feel you can do it, by all means go ahead.”</span> <span id="s345">I went with the fellow one night and we wound up there one early morning.</span> <span id="s346">We went to see some people who used to live there before the war, by the name Boldratt (26).</span> <span id="s347">They recommended staying with an elderly person who was handicapped and used a crutch.</span> <span id="s348">Boldratt said you may have to help him out many times because sometimes he cannot get off the bed but once he does get off the bed and you put the crutch under his arm, then he's all right.</span> <span id="s349">We stayed with them, with that farmer.</span> <span id="s350">Of course, we had to pay him and since we didn't have money to pay him and he didn't want no money ____.</span> <span id="s351">He said, “I can't buy nothing with the money that you'll give me.</span> <span id="s352">I need some provisions, something that I could use in the house.</span> <span id="s353">If you can give me something like meat or sugar or some other foods, that will be greatly appreciated.”</span> <span id="s354">So we bartered with him for the lodging and we stayed a few months with him.</span> <span id="s355">Until one day, when we went out, we saw a sign from the Germans that said anyone who could help deliver a Jew to them would get five kilos of sugar.</span> <span id="s356">I knew then that our stay over there would be limited, but we didn't give up.</span> <span id="s357">We went and moved into the forest, dug in there; we made a tent, improvised from some trees.</span> <span id="s358">We started housekeeping in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Question: It was still winter when you started, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Answer: Yes, what we did is, we dug an area that was maybe four or five feet into the ground.</span> <span id="s361">It wasn't easy because everywhere we put a shovel in, there was a tree in the way there.</span> <span id="s362">We had to chop it out and we didn't have tools, proper tools.</span> <span id="s363">But in order to feel warm, we felt that we’ve got to go under the ground so that will protect us.</span> <span id="s364">That's how we managed to build some kind of lodging that we could stay in there and feel that the elements are not going to be against us.</span> <span id="s365">I started going to a city by the name Bi (64) which was also about 25 kilometers from Chisava.</span> <span id="s366">That area was called by the Germans, it was not an integrated area that they claimed was their possession.</span> <span id="s367">Chisava was their possession, Bi they claim is a protectorate.</span> <span id="s368">They wanted to make the people vote for them in case it will ever come to a vote to show that they are willing to stay with them.</span> <span id="s369">That's why they're called protectorate.</span> <span id="s370">Germans were hoping that eventually the public was going to be voting for them to remain over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">I went over to that city and I had my father's cousin by the name Russik (76) and we were told that sugar is in abundance over there.</span> <span id="s372">You can get as much as you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">We figured out that I'm going to go, that my friend Bro (80) will stay in the place, just in case something, a message or something else, someone will have to be there.</span> <span id="s374">The first trip we had to cross a border and it was uneventful.</span> <span id="s375">It didn't bother us at all, we just slipped through the border and the Russiks were very nice and they accommodated me and helped me also to find the sugar that I needed.</span> <span id="s376">I spent maybe three or four days over there just to get a little rest and then I started on the way back.</span> <span id="s377">The way back was a little harder.</span> <span id="s378">We had to hire somebody who would transport the sugar and make sure that that the sugar was not going to be seen.</span> <span id="s379">He put some sheep in the wagon and hid the sugar under that double floor.</span> <span id="s380">We could not go with him because we were Jews and he was a Pole, and transporting Jews would have caused him problems.</span> <span id="s381">I went by myself and a number of other people who would try to cross the border with someone who knew the area and also knew when the guards were changing.</span> <span id="s382">We made it across the border and I met up with that man who was carrying that stuff.</span> <span id="s383">He was recommended by Mr. Russik, who knew him from before the war.</span> <span id="s384">He said “He is beyond reproach, you don't have to worry.</span> <span id="s385">When you get there, he'll wait for you and he'll have it for you.”</span> <span id="s386">Sure enough, when I went back to Chisava, he told me where he’s going to be.</span> <span id="s387">There was only one beer joint.</span> <span id="s388">He said, “I'm going to be in that beer joint.”</span> <span id="s389">I went over to him and he had that stuff for me.</span> <span id="s390">I paid him and I made arrangements that I'm going to use him again next time.</span> <span id="s391">My friend Bro and I picked it up and we took it over.</span> <span id="s392">People were already waiting for it.</span> <span id="s393">Of course, not for money but bartering for other foods.</span> <span id="s394">What we wanted mainly was bacon and ham.</span> <span id="s395">Those are the items that we are lacking, everybody was lacking.</span> <span id="s396">But the farmers had it in abundance.</span> <span id="s397">They're putting it away and hoarding it.</span> <span id="s398">For the sugar, we got all that stuff that we needed.</span> <span id="s399">I took off that stuff that we got and we hid it.</span> <span id="s400">A few days later, I had a message that my grandmother was very sick and she was not expected to live another day.</span> <span id="s401">I filled a knapsack with a number of provisions.</span> <span id="s402">My father and my grandmother were very religious and they wouldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s403">But the rabbi told them that if it is a life-threatening situation you are allowed to eat haza (pig).</span> <span id="s404">I brought it over and my grandmother, it was like she waited for me.</span> <span id="s405">She was still alive but she didn't last the next night.</span> <span id="s406">She just fell asleep and never woke up.</span> <span id="s407">We went to the funeral and my parents had some provisions.</span> <span id="s408">My father wouldn't eat any of that ham or bacon.</span> <span id="s409">My mother and my little brother had it.</span> <span id="s410">I didn't want to stay long because every so often the Germans used to come and see who is alive and who is dead, to keep track of how many people are still left.</span> <span id="s411">I was afraid that if they run into me, I'd be in bad shape because no young people were there, only elderly people.</span> <span id="s412">I slipped away the following night and I went back.</span> <span id="s413">Before I left him, my father told me news was spreading that they’re going to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s414">“It's only a matter of maybe a week, two weeks.</span> <span id="s415">I'll let you know.</span> <span id="s416">There are always some people that go over there and I'll let you know in plenty of time.”</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Question: Was this in Pluzga?</span> <span id="s418">A ghetto in Pluzga?</span> <span id="s419">I didn't realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Answer: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s421">They put them up in barns.</span> <span id="s422">My grandmother had to move out of her house that she occupied maybe for 50 years.</span> <span id="s423">Her children were born there.</span> <span id="s424">She was in very poor health.</span> <span id="s425">There was only one thing that they allowed her to take and it was --the German said, “I'm going to turn my back.</span> <span id="s426">You carry the bed out for the old woman.”</span> <span id="s427">He called her a very demeaning name.</span> <span id="s428">“Take the bed out but I won't see it.</span> <span id="s429">“ She lived in a barn with all the other Jewish people.</span> <span id="s430">There were maybe ten barns on one street.</span> <span id="s431">My parents, my grandmother and a few other people occupied one barn.</span> <span id="s432">Just like my father had said, they let us know that the ghetto will be liquidated.</span> <span id="s433">They would like very much to see me before they go.</span> <span id="s434">Again I went through the night and met with them.</span> <span id="s435">The following morning, just as scheduled, the horses and buggies were lined up for all the people to be taken away.</span> <span id="s436">I wanted to be with them as long as I could.</span> <span id="s437">The guy who carried my parents, I knew him from before but he pretended he didn't know me so I wouldn't ask him for any favors.</span> <span id="s438">I didn't need any favors from him.</span> <span id="s439">I just sat on that buggy of his.</span> <span id="s440">He said, “I don't know that you are there and I don't want to get into any trouble.</span> <span id="s441">If you see a German coming, jump off.”</span> <span id="s442">I only wanted to get closer to that village, Chisava so I wouldn't have to walk so much.</span> <span id="s443">I went back to say goodbye to my parents and I went back to Chisava only to find out that they were expecting to be overrun by the Germans.</span> <span id="s444">Apparently, the five kilos of sugar were too tempting to the Poles so they gave us up and told them where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s445">The following morning, the Germans came with the dogs.</span> <span id="s446">We heard the dogs from a distance so we had a chance to hide.</span> <span id="s447">We had a couple of guns, ammunition and some other things.</span> <span id="s448">We buried it at a distance so as not to be found with it because that would have meant a death sentence.</span> <span id="s449">They took us also by horse and buggy to a city nearby, where people from all the ghettos in the area were brought.</span> <span id="s450">When I went over there, a fellow I knew said, “You know, I just saw your mom and dad and your little brother.</span> <span id="s451">I saw them over there.</span> <span id="s452">If you go where I point, to a group of people, you'll see your father and mother are over there with your little brother.”</span> <span id="s453">I went over and I had a premonition that this would be the last that I will ever see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Question: Did you know where they were going to be going then?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Answer: I knew.</span> <span id="s456">Where we were living we was able to get newspapers.</span> <span id="s457">There was a little underground movement.</span> <span id="s458">We got some information through our radios that they're trying liquidate everything and they already told us, the Poles, that they are going to use gas to exterminate the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s459">I said, “My G-d, how could anyone do something like that?”</span> <span id="s460">Well, that's what they're planning to do.</span> <span id="s461">The first thing that we found out is that they were crude.</span> <span id="s462">They were taking in people into trucks and they had the exhaust pipe going into the truck so carbon monoxide they killed them in the truck.</span> <span id="s463">My parents were taken to a city by the name Helno (240).</span> <span id="s464">I didn't find out until I went to Israel and met a guy from that city where they brought all of them over there and shipped them to different extermination camps.</span> <span id="s465">He said, “I worked in that camp and I saw them.</span> <span id="s466">There was nothing I could do because about four people watched every Jew, so they shouldn't do anything that might jeopardize -­ might rescue somebody.”</span> <span id="s467">He said, “I can give you the exact date when they were killed.”</span> <span id="s468">He said it was Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Rosh Hashanah when they killed them.</span> <span id="s469">When I saw my parents, I begged them to let me take my little brother.</span> <span id="s470">He had so much to live for and I felt he was so bright, if he would have lived, he was a wizard in arithmetic, math.</span> <span id="s471">He could multiply something and give me the answer before I could even write it down.</span> <span id="s472">I felt it would be such a waste to let somebody like that fall into the filthy hands of the Germans.</span> <span id="s473">My parents said, “You by yourself have a better chance than with him.</span> <span id="s474">Besides, he's too young, he needs parents.”</span> <span id="s475">I didn't want to tell them what I knew.</span> <span id="s476">It would have only put fear into them.</span> <span id="s477">I left with that and said goodbye.</span> <span id="s478">I was loaded up on a truck and we went to the city of Lodz and my parents were taken away to that city of Helno, that was an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s479">When I came to the city of Lodz, I told the guy who was recruiting the people, a fellow by the name Beeboff (284), that I had a background in tool and die making.</span> <span id="s480">He was the head of the ghetto in Lodz.</span> <span id="s481">He said, “I could use somebody with your experience.”</span> <span id="s482">I went with a number of other people and we went into that ghetto.</span> <span id="s483">The first stop was the administration office for the people who were shipped into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s484">They put downeveryone’s names, where they came from, the age, profession, or what they can do.</span> <span id="s485">While I was looking at the people who came out of that office, I noticed my uncle, Morris Frelich (298).</span> <span id="s486">I tried to motion to him but he was busy writing but finally he noticed me and I went over to him.</span> <span id="s487">He said, “Oh no, you're not going anywhere.</span> <span id="s488">You're coming to our house and you're going to work in here.”</span> <span id="s489">I told him that I promised to work for a metal shop.</span> <span id="s490">He said, “Don't worry, as long as I'm here you can stay in here.</span> <span id="s491">This job is much easier than to go and work in a factory, a metal fabrication factory.”</span> <span id="s492">I was there with him probably two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Question: Two months before they liquidated--before the deportations started, is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Answer: No, the ghetto was not liquidated.</span> <span id="s495">The ghetto was still in existence I think for about eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Question: But before they started taking the ___(316)?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Answer: Yeah, so my job was to unpack the suitcases of anyone who came in.</span> <span id="s498">I didn't have anything, I didn't have to put anything down.</span> <span id="s499">But there were some people who came like from Vienna, from Rolland, from many other cities where they had lived a normal life.</span> <span id="s500">They were not persecuted as we were.</span> <span id="s501">They came with suitcases jammed with all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s502">I couldn't believe it, so much stuff.</span> <span id="s503">The Germans were standing there, trying to make sure that we are not going to swipe anything.</span> <span id="s504">They told us that if they catch anyone trying to take something from those suitcases and put it in his possession, they'll shoot him on the spot.</span> <span id="s505">It was so tempting and I knew if I could get my hands on something like that, I could probably live until the end of the war by bartering that for food.</span> <span id="s506">One time I had a chance, I took out some earrings and some other gems and I stuffed it in a crack of the table.</span> <span id="s507">Then, when we were done with the work, I took it out and took it into the office and hid it there.</span> <span id="s508">I thought what if someone finds it.</span> <span id="s509">Well, luckily it was a good hiding place.</span> <span id="s510">It was there when we finally got our papers that we were done with the work over there because nobody was shipped into that ghetto anymore and they were starting liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s511">I went to that office, took it out, put it in my pocket and walked home.</span> <span id="s512">I didn't say anything to my uncle.</span> <span id="s513">He was very fearsome and he told me time and time again, “Don't do anything that could jeopardize your life.</span> <span id="s514">I'm responsible for you so listen to me.”</span> <span id="s515">But I felt differently and I thought if I'm going to be able to take something like that, it will prolong my life.</span> <span id="s516">I hid it at their house where nobody could find it and it was there for a month.</span> <span id="s517">I started to work in that metal fabricating shop.</span> <span id="s518">The shop was just a shell, there was nothing in there because the machinery had been pilfered by the Germans.</span> <span id="s519">They took it out and shipped it to Germany.</span> <span id="s520">But since they wanted to have us work for them, they brought in new machinery.</span> <span id="s521">We had to mount that machinery back on the __.</span> <span id="s522">I was called in by a fellow by the name Pl ___ (374) who was the head of that department.</span> <span id="s523">We started mounting each of the machines.</span> <span id="s524">Because of that mounting, I went down underground because in order to have those machines sit stable and not move, we had to pour foundations, cement foundations.</span> <span id="s525">I saw that the place could be a terrific place to hide out in the future.</span> <span id="s526">I was only going around and thinking about how to evade them?</span> <span id="s527">How to get away from them without falling into their trap?</span> <span id="s528">Whenever I saw something, I made a mental note of it, to go back into that place.</span> <span id="s529">We finished mounting that machine and then they transferred me to a different department that was more the thing that I used to do.</span> <span id="s530">We were trying to make bottles for the Germans but the bottles that they were having made had to go through five or six different processes.</span> <span id="s531">It took a long time and many man-hours and they gave us an assignment to make bottles for the Germans that could be made in two operations.</span> <span id="s532">Sure enough, we worked out a design whereby we took a long piece of wire and with two hands, we bent that wire and we made that insert in the middle to buckle on the letter.</span> <span id="s533">They were very satisfied with that -- like I cared a lot.</span> <span id="s534">We made a good impression on them.</span> <span id="s535">Whenever they came, they said, “What you did; we are smart but you are smarter than we are.</span> <span id="s536">You knew how to do it in such a short time.”</span> <span id="s537">It tickled me.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">I worked in that department for a few months.</span> <span id="s539">When I went to work one day, I noticed some signs that said the ghetto was going to be liquidated and anyone who wants to get a real good job, the earlier he goes, the better the job prospect would be.</span> <span id="s540">For me, that was no inducement.</span> <span id="s541">I felt that as long as I can stay here, I'm going to stay.</span> <span id="s542">If I can stay until the war is over, that will be better yet.</span> <span id="s543">One day, our director from that factory came in and said we are going to stop work at three o'clock because we have to go to be present at a public hanging.</span> <span id="s544">I started to inquire, asking “What is that public hanging?”</span> <span id="s545">They told me there was a fellow from across the street.</span> <span id="s546">They were making for the horses--.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Question: Bridles?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Answer: Yeah, whatever.</span> <span id="s549">They used to get a lot of leather so they could make things for them.</span> <span id="s550">One guy who didn't have shoelaces cut a piece that fell off, so he tried to make a shoelace.</span> <span id="s551">They saw him and that was good enough reason for them to hang him for that.</span> <span id="s552">We went to a place in the ghetto where it was sparsely occupied because it was only land and it was called Marishein (470).</span> <span id="s553">All the goods for the ghetto were shipped in there.</span> <span id="s554">I always kept my eyes open.</span> <span id="s555">I wanted to find a place where I can hide that nobody will be able to find me.</span> <span id="s556">I saw over there they had some warehouses where a person could hide and probably live through the end of the war.</span> <span id="s557">We knew the war is coming to an end but we didn't know how long it's going to last.</span> <span id="s558">I told a fellow from our factory, “You see this place over there.</span> <span id="s559">It'll be an ideal place to hide out.”</span> <span id="s560">The first thing he asked me, “Where are you going to get the food from?”</span> <span id="s561">I said, “Well, that's something we’ve got to work out.”</span> <span id="s562">He said, “How’re you going to work it out?”</span> <span id="s563">I didn't want to tell him that I have some jewelry that I could barter, because you didn't know who you can trust.</span> <span id="s564">I decided that it's not going to work out for the simple reason that you just cannot get food.</span> <span id="s565">It was a bad time to barter because everyone was thinking about being shipped out and they didn't want to be caught with jewelry because right away they would ask them where they got it.</span> <span id="s566">Nobody wanted to buy it at that time or barter it for food so that fell through.</span> <span id="s567">When we returned the following day to the factory, that fellow that I helped to mount machinery came to me.</span> <span id="s568">He said, “You know we got an order to dismantle the machinery.</span> <span id="s569">They told us two weeks is all we are going to get.”</span> <span id="s570">I said, “You must be crazy, two weeks.</span> <span id="s571">The machines weighed tons, how can you--it's impossible.”</span> <span id="s572">He said, “That's what they told me.</span> <span id="s573">We started to dismantle smaller and large machines.</span> <span id="s574">By the time we got halfway, the two weeks were over.</span> <span id="s575">The German came in and started swearing and he said, “I'm going to shoot you all.”</span> <span id="s576">I knew he wouldn't do it because he couldn’t get anyone else to do it.</span> <span id="s577">He begged the Germans, that Mr. P ___ __ (538) he says, “Give us another two weeks.</span> <span id="s578">He said, “You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s579">I'll shoot you first before I'll give you two weeks.”</span> <span id="s580">We started working at a little faster pace than before.</span> <span id="s581">Two weeks went by and we still didn't have that done.</span> <span id="s582">Another two weeks and we didn't have everything dismounted.</span> <span id="s583">That Mr. P came begging us, “Please, please.</span> <span id="s584">They threatened me with execution if I don’t force you to work at a pace that will get everything out of here within a few days.”</span> <span id="s585">I knew that by cooperating with them, the sooner we get done, the sooner I'll have to go to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s586">I felt if I can prolong it for another week or two weeks or a month, that would be much better for me than going into the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Question: Had you heard, in the ghetto, had you heard about what the camps were like?</span> <span id="s588">You did know?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Answer: Yes, the Poles brought in some news.</span> <span id="s590">They were not the best source about anything that was adverse to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s591">They tried to shove it down our throat.</span> <span id="s592">“They are killing them by the thousand, by the millions,” they said.</span> <span id="s593">We didn't know whether we could believe it or not but it was the truth.</span> <span id="s594">They told us about a camp that I was going to be shipped to.</span> <span id="s595">They are gassing them by the thousands every day.</span> <span id="s596">One day I noticed that I had to go through a square, where all the people were going to be assigned to a camp.</span> <span id="s597">They didn't tell us we were going to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s598">They just said we are going to a war camp.</span> <span id="s599">I noticed there was information on the bulletin board that R ___ (599) was going with this transport today.</span> <span id="s600">Anyone who would like to be assigned to this same transport and be sure that they can get the same luxury as he gets, let them enroll.</span> <span id="s601">The fact of the matter was they didn't give him any time at all.</span> <span id="s602">They put him right away into the gas chamber, him and his wife.</span> <span id="s603">I outlived him.</span> <span id="s604">I stayed there I think for another two weeks.</span> <span id="s605">Finally, they stopped giving us the rations.</span> <span id="s606">They said, “Okay, you don't want to go to the transport, you won't get any food.</span> <span id="s607">That was -- (End of Side B, Tape l) Tape II, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Question: And so?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Answer: I felt that someone was looking at me and I turned my head and I saw a blonde young woman with a little boy next to her.</span> <span id="s610">I was sure, at first, that she must be a German.</span> <span id="s611">She didn't have a trace of Jew in her, blonde, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s612">She came toward me and she said, the first question, “Are you going with this transport?”</span> <span id="s613">I said yes.</span> <span id="s614">Then she introduced herself and said her name was Lessman ( 09) and this was her little brother.</span> <span id="s615">“This guy is impulsive.</span> <span id="s616">He doesn't listen and going to a camp where his life is going to be in jeopardy, I need somebody to keep an eye on him.”</span> <span id="s617">All of a sudden, I was appointed a guardian of a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Question: The boy's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Answer: Lessman, I can't remember his first name.</span> <span id="s620">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s621">She said, “I'll be eternally thankful if you could just make sure that he's not running off, that he's not doing things that he shouldn't be doing.</span> <span id="s622">I give permission to give him a kick in the pants if he does it.”</span> <span id="s623">She said goodbye and said she’s working for a tailoring factory.</span> <span id="s624">They're going to be another three weeks in the ghetto and then it will be liquidated.</span> <span id="s625">Theirs will be liquidated too.</span> <span id="s626">(Two ghettos?)</span> <span id="s627">The boy and I arrived the following morning at a camp.</span> <span id="s628">The first thing I saw was a human body stretched over the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s629">One of his hands was spread out like he was trying to conquer the wire gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Question: Where was this, where are you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Answer: In Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s632">On the front of the camp was a placard, Arbeit Macht Frei, work will free you.</span> <span id="s633">I knew we came to a place that it's not going to be so easily to get along with.</span> <span id="s634">I figure that here we’ve got to be very, very careful what we do.</span> <span id="s635">Otherwise, we are not going to survive.</span> <span id="s636">I told that little boy, “You better shape up.</span> <span id="s637">You are not at home, you cannot get away with it.</span> <span id="s638">If you want to live another day, listen to what someone tells you.</span> <span id="s639">I'm not trying to put the law down to you but I promised your sister I'm going to keep an eye on you and I mean it.”</span> <span id="s640">The following morning we came out in front of the barrack.</span> <span id="s641">It was a tent actually…</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Question: Is that where you stayed the night before?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Answer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s644">A tent, half-round tent and there were people sleeping on the ground from one side and the other side, maybe a hundred people in each tent.</span> <span id="s645">We were assigned to one of them and they started shouting “Rouse, rouse.”</span> <span id="s646">(52) to come out, a selection.</span> <span id="s647">They want to select who should live and who should die.</span> <span id="s648">They were doing the job of G-d.</span> <span id="s649">You learn fast when you are in a situation like that.</span> <span id="s650">I noticed that the little boy was put on the left side.</span> <span id="s651">We were told that the left side is the side that goes straight into the frying pan.</span> <span id="s652">I motion to him that he should crawl over to my side.</span> <span id="s653">He started moving and they hit him over the head but he didn't give up.</span> <span id="s654">When the SS man turned around, he ran to the other side.</span> <span id="s655">Then later he said, “I told you to stay over there.”</span> <span id="s656">I said, “This is my brother, I can't let him be without me, I’ve got to watch over him.”</span> <span id="s657">Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s658">He hit him over the head, he hit me over the head but he let us stay.</span> <span id="s659">I told him after that incident, “We’ve got to enroll to go out to work, not to be in this camp because any day, you escape today but you won't escape tomorrow or the next day.</span> <span id="s660">I said we’ve got to go out and work into a satellite camp where they haven't got extermination.</span> <span id="s661">He said, “Okay if I see something that's going on, I'll come and let you know to go over there.”</span> <span id="s662">He kept on looking all day and the following morning, when I was going to be tattooed, there was a line and I noticed a truck standing not far from over there.</span> <span id="s663">They were taking only people that had the tattoo so I went over to that truck driver and I ask him if he needs some people.</span> <span id="s664">He said “Yes, I need some people, carpenters, mechanics, all the people that could repair stuff that goes wrong in some of those mines where you dig the coal.”</span> <span id="s665">He said, “We have a big camp, a number of camps in that area and we are all working for that mine.</span> <span id="s666">If you can do the work that you claim you can, you can have a good position there.”</span> <span id="s667">He told me right after I get the tattoo, I can come over.</span> <span id="s668">I started looking for that Lessman boy, but he was nowhere to be found.</span> <span id="s669">I begged the driver, “Could you wait another half an hour?</span> <span id="s670">He promised he's going to come here.”</span> <span id="s671">He said, “No way, it's getting dark and I have to be on my way.”</span> <span id="s672">I got separated from him.</span> <span id="s673">I went to a camp by the name Fersengruber (lO 4) and when I arrived, I found out that I had a cousin in that camp.</span> <span id="s674">and then a second cousin who was a kapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">I tried to look up my cousin and his name was Kott, Dave Kott.</span> <span id="s676">(109) He looked just terrible like he's not going to last a week, his cheeks sunken and he had a yellowish complexion.</span> <span id="s677">I said, “What are they doing to you?”</span> <span id="s678">He said, “They're killing me day by day.</span> <span id="s679">I just cannot be in that mine.</span> <span id="s680">It's too much for me.”</span> <span id="s681">I promised him I'll see what I can do if I get assigned to one of those places that are going to make repairs for the mine.</span> <span id="s682">I'll see maybe I can push you in into that.</span> <span id="s683">I also promised myself I'm going to see that kapo.</span> <span id="s684">His name was Yanek Koltz.</span> <span id="s685">(121).</span> <span id="s686">I didn't wait long.</span> <span id="s687">I saw him marching down.</span> <span id="s688">I said, “Yanek.”</span> <span id="s689">He said, with his arrogant expression and filthy language, he said, “You so-and-so, what do you want from me?”</span> <span id="s690">I told him we are related and he said, “We are related?</span> <span id="s691">Comeon over here, let me give you a hug.”</span> <span id="s692">He lifted up his foot and gave it to me, oh boy!</span> <span id="s693">Knocked me down cold on the ground.</span> <span id="s694">He said, “If you ever come close to me, I'll finish the job on you.</span> <span id="s695">No relatives, nothing.</span> <span id="s696">I don't know you, you don't know me.</span> <span id="s697">Just get lost.”</span> <span id="s698">So I knew I had to keep a distance from him.</span> <span id="s699">A day or two days later, they called my name and said I should come this and this hour .</span> <span id="s700">They're going to take me to a shop that’s not finished yet but we have to start working on it.</span> <span id="s701">We have some work to be done for the mine.</span> <span id="s702">I went over there and there was another fellow by the name Adash Karp (141) and he was selected to be the foreman.</span> <span id="s703">I introduced myself to him and he said, “If you claim that you know all of that work that you said you do, we are going to be good friends.</span> <span id="s704">“ He didn't know too much but what he didn't know, he made up with his mouth.</span> <span id="s705">The first job was an elevator shaft that had to be repaired.</span> <span id="s706">One of the gears was stripped and we either had to buy another gear, which was not available because they quit making those.</span> <span id="s707">All of the factories were geared for production for the war.</span> <span id="s708">So, we had to improvise and put in two gears, teeth we called it.</span> <span id="s709">We had to take out those two that were stripped and file them down and put in two in their place.</span> <span id="s710">Since we didn't have anything to weld it, we had to drill a hole into that gear and then set it up with some screws so it will work for the time being.</span> <span id="s711">Then that other Karp came over and said, “Boy-oh-boy.</span> <span id="s712">You really surprised me.</span> <span id="s713">I don'’ know where you learned it but whatever you did, it's terrific.”</span> <span id="s714">They put it up and it worked and I didn't hear complaints for quite a while.</span> <span id="s715">We could weld to it and repairing it was no problem.</span> <span id="s716">The shop took shape.</span> <span id="s717">Each and every one had an assigned area that he worked from with the tools assigned to him.</span> <span id="s718">I tried to get my cousin to come in and I talked to that other Karp.</span> <span id="s719">I said the guy is dying by inches, couldn't you find something to do for him?</span> <span id="s720">He said, “If I take him in and he doesn't know the basics, you are not going to be hurt, I'm going to be hurt.</span> <span id="s721">I don't want to jeopardize my life for somebody I don't even know.</span> <span id="s722">“ That was the end of that.</span> <span id="s723">I worked in there for a number of months.</span> <span id="s724">One day, a fellow who worked across from me was bulging.</span> <span id="s725">I said, “What have you got in there?”</span> <span id="s726">He said, “I went to an Italian prisoner-of­war camp which was adjoining and they gave me some potatoes.”</span> <span id="s727">I said, “Empty out everything and put it in here in my workshop.”</span> <span id="s728">I thought that maybe I will be immune, but him, they would probably kill.</span> <span id="s729">Sure enough, a minute later the head kapo came in and said, “Where is that Jew who just took some potatoes from the prison-of-war?”</span> <span id="s730">I said, “I don't know.”</span> <span id="s731">He said, “You don't know?</span> <span id="s732">I can point him out to you.</span> <span id="s733">I have been watching him.”</span> <span id="s734">So he went to him and started kicking him and beating him, and asking where are the potatoes?</span> <span id="s735">He said, “I haven't got them.”</span> <span id="s736">It was true, he didn't have them.</span> <span id="s737">He had him on the ground, kicking him mercilessly.</span> <span id="s738">Finally, I went over to him and said he brought them over and he dumped them in my workshop.</span> <span id="s739">He said to come with him and he took me to his place.</span> <span id="s740">It was a tiny booth and somebody was holding my head.</span> <span id="s741">He kept on hitting my back with an electric cord.</span> <span id="s742">I felt the first ten, but then I didn't feel any more.</span> <span id="s743">Either I was numb or--he gave me 50 times in the back.</span> <span id="s744">He said, “Let it be a lesson to you.</span> <span id="s745">Don't help anyone out.</span> <span id="s746">If you want to be a good Samaritan, you will wind up dead.</span> <span id="s747">The next Saturday, we went to take a shower and when I exposed my back to the water, it's like a million pins kept on hurting me.</span> <span id="s748">All of a sudden, the SS men, the lagerfuhrer came in.</span> <span id="s749">He noticed the bruised back.</span> <span id="s750">He came over and asked who did it to you.</span> <span id="s751">I said, “Nobody did it to me, I had an accident.</span> <span id="s752">I fell and that's what happened.”</span> <span id="s753">He said, “I can tell, this is not a fall, someone must have hit you.”</span> <span id="s754">I said no.</span> <span id="s755">If I would have told him the truth, he would have gotten off scot free.</span> <span id="s756">He would have done nothing because he was the head of the kapos and I would be probably the one that could be dispensable.</span> <span id="s757">He could dispense with me but he couldn't dispense of him.</span> <span id="s758">So I figured I'll stick to the lie and I stuck to it.</span> <span id="s759">He said, “Well, have it your way.</span> <span id="s760">And for all your information I want to tell you, I'm here to dish out justice.”</span> <span id="s761">Justice!</span> <span id="s762">He said, “If someone beats you up like that, you come to me and I'll see to it that it won't happen again.”</span> <span id="s763">Go to him, to an SS man and seek justice.</span> <span id="s764">Well, that was in October, the month of October.</span> <span id="s765">During the night, we had been hearing from a distance thunder-like sounds and we knew that the Russians were coming close.</span> <span id="s766">We were told that they are going to liquidate the camp and we'll have to relocate somewhere else but it didn't happen until December.</span> <span id="s767">One night, they woke us up.</span> <span id="s768">We couldn't even dress ourselves properly and we had to march about 30 kilometers.</span> <span id="s769">That wasn't a march, that was a jogging, we kept on running like someone would be chasing us.</span> <span id="s770">We came to a city by the name Glivitz (263) that was German territory and it was a railroad hub where all the trains kept on coming from Poland, from Germany, from Czechoslovakia, they all came there.</span> <span id="s771">On the way to Glivitz, I noticed a guy where I was walking and minding my own business that he looked familiar.</span> <span id="s772">I went over to him and I asked, “Are you Myron Mak?</span> <span id="s773">(275).</span> <span id="s774">He looked at me and said, “Oh my God, yes, I am Myron Mak and you are Szpiro.”</span> <span id="s775">I said yes, I am.</span> <span id="s776">He looked like he's not going to last an hour.</span> <span id="s777">He was suffering from dysentery.</span> <span id="s778">He couldn't keep anything inside him, it kept on running out from him.</span> <span id="s779">I told him, “Lean against me and I'll try to walk with you.”</span> <span id="s780">But he was much taller than I was and he slowed me down because he himself couldn't walk fast.</span> <span id="s781">Finally, we came to the end of the line.</span> <span id="s782">There was an SS man by the name of Debrowalski (289) and he claimed he was from Romania.</span> <span id="s783">He said to me, “You schwartza Juda (290), you black Jew; if you are not going to move up, I'll shoot you and him together because once you come close to me, I have an order to shoot.”</span> <span id="s784">I tried to get Mak to cooperate, “Please let's walk a little faster.”</span> <span id="s785">But I couldn't carry him, that was impossible.</span> <span id="s786">Finally, it got to a point where the SS man with his gun came to me and to him and said, “All I have to do is pull the trigger and you'll be both dead.</span> <span id="s787">I'm giving you notice, move up.”</span> <span id="s788">When Mak heard that, something came over him, he started running toward the SS man and the SS man started shooting at him.</span> <span id="s789">The SS man grabbed a hold of him and threw him into the ditch.</span> <span id="s790">He told me, You better get lost from here because I have an eye on you.</span> <span id="s791">You'll be next.”</span> <span id="s792">I heard his advice and I got up into the middle of the line.</span> <span id="s793">I ran up close to my good friend, Moka K (317) while I was (almost?)</span> <span id="s794">trampled on the trip from Glivitz to Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s795">He said, “You stay with me, walk the same pace I'm walking and if you get tired, I'll help you out.”</span> <span id="s796">Coming back to that Moka K, the way I got acquainted with him.</span> <span id="s797">He was a man of immense power.</span> <span id="s798">He could take a bar, bend it and make a flower out of it, a heavy bar, an iron bar.</span> <span id="s799">He entertained SS people by showing them what he can do.</span> <span id="s800">Somehow, I couldn't believe it but they wanted to preserve him.</span> <span id="s801">One day, one SS man came into our shop and said, “You know that Jew that bends the bar?</span> <span id="s802">We would like him to come and work here.”</span> <span id="s803">So that other Karp said the only place that we are going to have available is when we get a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s804">If we get a blacksmith, he could work with the blacksmith and hit the iron while it's still hot.</span> <span id="s805">It took us a few days and we ran across somebody, a Jewish man who was a blacksmith from years ago from a city in Gloslavik (349) in Poland.</span> <span id="s806">He knew his trade and from that time on, the blacksmith and he got to be inseparable.</span> <span id="s807">I befriended him because when he didn't have much to do, he came over and talked to me and we got to be very, very close.</span> <span id="s808">He impressed me; I had never seen anyone that could do things like he did.</span> <span id="s809">The guy took a bar between his teeth and two people on each side were hanging from the bar.</span> <span id="s810">Didn't bother him.</span> <span id="s811">Coming back to that -- I walked with him until we got to Glivitz and when we arrived over there, they assigned us into open wagons.</span> <span id="s812">It was December; it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s813">We started out; they assigned, I think, about 100 people to animal wagons, the owners shipped animals with it.</span> <span id="s814">When they put us in, there was no room to turn around.</span> <span id="s815">We were packed like sardines.</span> <span id="s816">A few hours later, we started to notice that people had been trampled because if someone couldn't breathe properly, the mere fact that he was squeezed so tightly with others, robbed him of his breath.</span> <span id="s817">People kept on falling down.</span> <span id="s818">When a person fell down, the people kept on moving forward because the vacuum, they pushed one against the other.</span> <span id="s819">He was trampled, that person.</span> <span id="s820">There was no way to help anyone because you couldn't go and move ten or 20 people from the area, to get to the bottom of that guy.</span> <span id="s821">Toward morning, we came to Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s822">I said to my friend, Moka K, “You know, how often will I be in Prague?</span> <span id="s823">I'll take a look at what's going on, how the other half are living.</span> <span id="s824">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s825">There were hundreds of Czechs near that area where the train stopped.</span> <span id="s826">They kept on encouraging us to jump off the train and they're going to help us.</span> <span id="s827">It was sheer nonsense because every wagon had two SS men with machine guns on an elevation to watch that nobody jumps.</span> <span id="s828">They were even shooting at people who kept on throwing down a cup to catch some snow because everyone was dehydrated.</span> <span id="s829">They were shooting at the people who tried to get a little snow.</span> <span id="s830">I kept watching them but I said “It's a noble gesture but it's not feasible.</span> <span id="s831">In my condition, I couldn't even run ten feet.</span> <span id="s832">How can I outdistance a bullet?”</span> <span id="s833">While I was thinking about it, I felt enormous desire to fall asleep.</span> <span id="s834">I felt I kept on sinking and sinking.</span> <span id="s835">All of a sudden, I felt that I'm being trampled.</span> <span id="s836">I felt that someone was walking on my head, on my throat, on my body.</span> <span id="s837">I couldn't help myself; I figured well this is it.</span> <span id="s838">The next thing I knew I woke up and I was laying next to that Moka K.</span> <span id="s839">He made room for me to lay next to me.</span> <span id="s840">He pushed everybody from the whole--he threw them to get to the bottom, to get me out.</span> <span id="s841">He knew where I was; I pointed out to him when I came to the end of the wagon.</span> <span id="s842">I said, “I'm going to be right here” and he knew exactly where.</span> <span id="s843">When he saw people trampling on somebody, he kept on pushing them and throwing aside to pull me out.</span> <span id="s844">When I came to, he said, “You're a sight to behold.</span> <span id="s845">G-d almighty, you are swollen, your head is twice the size and your face is one great big bruise.</span> <span id="s846">Just stick close to me and I'll make sure that you'll get over it.”</span> <span id="s847">We went to a concentration camp by the name Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s848">Our SS man, that lagerfuhrer, the head of our camp, he was a shrewd fellow.</span> <span id="s849">He knew if he gives up that position to be lagerfuhrer, he will have to go to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s850">He tried in the worst way to keep us intact.</span> <span id="s851">He tried to make a deal with that Mauthausen lagerfuhrer to take us in and give him a position there.</span> <span id="s852">That lagerfuhrer told him, “My advice to you is take them into the forest and shoot them.</span> <span id="s853">So he said “No, this I'm not going to do.”</span> <span id="s854">We started from over there and we went to a camp by the name Rodhausen (481).</span> <span id="s855">Finally, he got what he wanted and that lagerfuhrer took us in and he tried to be very close to the group that he brought over.</span> <span id="s856">One day, he came to me and said “There is a position available.</span> <span id="s857">They are making the V-1 rockets here.</span> <span id="s858">I know that you were very good over there.</span> <span id="s859">Would you like to try it?”</span> <span id="s860">I said, “If you think I can do it, why not?”</span> <span id="s861">He recommended me to go and work with a German civilian.</span> <span id="s862">Every morning at six o'clock, that German civilian came and picked me up in his Volkswagen, a small, a templewagon (503) with three wheels.</span> <span id="s863">He picked me up and took me over into the mountains.</span> <span id="s864">They had thousands of feet of -- where they had been establishing an assembly in the mountains.</span> <span id="s865">They called it “Stchone” (513).</span> <span id="s866">I started to work over there and the work was so diversified that nobody knew what others were working on.</span> <span id="s867">Each person had a different assignment so that nobody would know to give out the secret.</span> <span id="s868">I had one assignment; I did wheels, had to calibrate them and make sure that they were to one thousandth of a millimeter tolerance.</span> <span id="s869">That didn't last long because at that time, the Russians kept on coming closer and the southern army kept on moving up.</span> <span id="s870">They decided they were going to ship us to a different place.</span> <span id="s871">They packed us one morning on barges that normally carry grain.</span> <span id="s872">It's not meant for human occupancy.</span> <span id="s873">We were traveling a night and a day on the Elbe River.</span> <span id="s874">One morning, they opened the doors, I couldn't get used to it, I was blinded by the light -- I hadn't seen any daylight.</span> <span id="s875">When I looked around, I saw dead bodies.</span> <span id="s876">People who were just dropping dead from -- they suffocated.</span> <span id="s877">We stopped at a city by the name Liebeck (559).</span> <span id="s878">We got out, whoever was still alive.</span> <span id="s879">One of the SS men said to the guy who was running the boat, “At least you are not going empty, you are going to have dead cargo on the way back.</span> <span id="s880">A cruel joke but--.</span> <span id="s881">We started walking from Liebeck until we came to an area S (573).</span> <span id="s882">It surprised me, this was an intersection in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s883">There was one big building, a barn and a house.</span> <span id="s884">I asked what is going on?</span> <span id="s885">One of the Ukrainian SS men said “This is the house where Schmidt, our SS fuhrer lives with his parents.</span> <span id="s886">He put us up in the barn because it was getting dark already.</span> <span id="s887">It's the only night I enjoyed a good night's sleep.</span> <span id="s888">I was sleeping with Moka K next to me.</span> <span id="s889">When I got up, I noticed a fellow who looked like one of the Goldrans brothers from (603) and I said, “Yurek, what's the matter with you?</span> <span id="s890">You don't look the same to me?”</span> <span id="s891">He said, “I'm so sick, I don't think I'll make it another day.”</span> <span id="s892">He had dysentery.</span> <span id="s893">I said, “Come on, get up because if you are not going to go and walk, they will shoot you in here.”</span> <span id="s894">“No,” he said, “I give up.</span> <span id="s895">I had it.</span> <span id="s896">This is the end of my line.”</span> <span id="s897">Sure enough, a few minutes later, they started shooting everyone that-- (End of Side A, Tape 2) Tape II, Side B We walked seven kilometers to the North Sea.</span> <span id="s898">It bothered me that I couldn't figure out what they want, are they going to push us into the sea?</span> <span id="s899">One of the Ukrainian SS men said, “You need a little recreation.</span> <span id="s900">You had a hard time, we are going to put you on a sea boat.”</span> <span id="s901">Then another one came and said, “We are going to exchange you for German prisoners-of-war with the English.”</span> <span id="s902">Nobody knew what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s903">We saw three ships in the distance.</span> <span id="s904">The biggest one we could see was the Capacorna (14).</span> <span id="s905">Next to it from the right-hand side was the Athens and the one behind the Capacorna we couldn't see the name because the Capacorna was the biggest and we couldn't see what kind of a ship it was.</span> <span id="s906">They took us and loaded us on those ships.</span> <span id="s907">They counted 100 people and we just -- I was separated at that point from that Moka K. I went to the Athens, Moka K went to the Capacorna.</span> <span id="s908">We were maybe 350 people in that ship, on the lowest deck.</span> <span id="s909">It was far from luxury.</span> <span id="s910">We were fed a very poor diet, you couldn't even, it was mostly water.</span> <span id="s911">We had been smelling the food that they had been making in their kitchen, the fresh bread and everything.</span> <span id="s912">That was only for them.</span> <span id="s913">The following morning, we heard airplanes flying over our ship and coming very close to it.</span> <span id="s914">The captain of the ship decided quickly.</span> <span id="s915">He said, “You guys from down below, whoever speaks German, come on up here to the upper deck.”</span> <span id="s916">I went up and a number of other guys went up.</span> <span id="s917">We were wearing those striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s918">He said, “During the day, you have to be on the top deck.</span> <span id="s919">When the planes go by, they will see that there are no soldiers on the deck and they won't bomb it.”</span> <span id="s920">He was smart.</span> <span id="s921">The Capacorna was not as smart and the next morning, when the English came, they started bombing the Capacorna and we could see from a distance, the ship was engulfed in fire.</span> <span id="s922">I don't know what happened to Moka K -- either he succumbed in there--.</span> <span id="s923">I had also a friend that I knew from the camp by the name Blockman (51).</span> <span id="s924">He came out with scars all over his back from the fire.</span> <span id="s925">He saved himself by jumping into the salt water, which scarred him for life.</span> <span id="s926">It didn't take long, a day at most, when we came up to the upper deck, we didn't see an SS man.</span> <span id="s927">I started looking around to make an excuse (?)</span> <span id="s928">and there was nobody in sight.</span> <span id="s929">I went into the kitchen and there was fresh bread being baked.</span> <span id="s930">Like a fool, I grabbed a piece of half-baked bread, hot, and I stuffed it.</span> <span id="s931">I got very sick, it didn't agree with me.</span> <span id="s932">But the English came on the boat and they said in German and Polish and English, “Be patient, we are going to bring boats and load you all up and take you off.”</span> <span id="s933">That took them maybe an hour, at the most two hours.</span> <span id="s934">They came with large boats and took us down.</span> <span id="s935">They were not organized because they were not prepared for what they saw.</span> <span id="s936">There were hundreds of people shabbily dressed in those uniforms.</span> <span id="s937">They said, “Frankly, we are not prepared for what we saw.</span> <span id="s938">We give you authority to go into any house (where?)</span> <span id="s939">that is deserted.</span> <span id="s940">If nobody's there, take it over.</span> <span id="s941">We'll support you, if someone comes and claims it, you just tell them to go to the authority.”</span> <span id="s942">I just didn't believe that this can be true.</span> <span id="s943">I didn't want to go to a house that maybe some SS man was occupying.</span> <span id="s944">I went to a barracks and I found a quiet corner and I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s945">It was a barracks for marines and I found a uniform, a marine uniform.</span> <span id="s946">I put it on just to get off from that striped cloth.</span> <span id="s947">The next morning, I went out and I start to look around to see what is going on.</span> <span id="s948">I met a fellow by the name K (89) who was married to a girl from our city.</span> <span id="s949">He was wearing a practically new suit.</span> <span id="s950">I said, “Where did you get that suit?”</span> <span id="s951">He said, “I found it in the house I occupied.”</span> <span id="s952">The suit didn't fit him.</span> <span id="s953">He was a tailor and I saw he had improvised -- shortened it and cut it down in width but it was still a fairly new garment.</span> <span id="s954">He said, “If you want, you can come and occupy the place with me.”</span> <span id="s955">I just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s956">I was still afraid that any minute the Germans were going to overrun the place and take us back.</span> <span id="s957">I went into the city and I met some civilians that the English brought over to take over, to make a camp for all the people that were liberated.</span> <span id="s958">He said, “These barracks here are going to be designated for all of you, where you are going to be put up.</span> <span id="s959">We'll try in the future to find out if any of you will be able to emigrate to different countries.</span> <span id="s960">In the meantime, the UNRRA which was our body of the world organization, the United Nations, will be helping you out, you're going to get food.</span> <span id="s961">Any one of you who is undernourished will go to a hospital and we'll build you up.”</span> <span id="s962">It started to look like it would be a long-range project and I started to feel a little better.</span> <span id="s963">After a few months, I ran across a guy who came from Italy.</span> <span id="s964">I talked to him and asked him about a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s965">He said, “I did run across your cousin.”</span> <span id="s966">He was from a neighboring town and he knew him.</span> <span id="s967">He said, “I saw him in Bari, where there was an Israeli legion.</span> <span id="s968">He was there with the Israeli legion.”</span> <span id="s969">I decided that I was going to look for him.</span> <span id="s970">A day or two days later, I was hitchhiking on the trains going down south until I came to Austria.</span> <span id="s971">From Austria, there were no trains going to the Alps and we had to go mountain-climbing to go across the border.</span> <span id="s972">I came to Rome and then from over there I hitched a ride to Bari, only to find out that he had been there and he left a short time earlier.</span> <span id="s973">They told me most likely he went to Ts (139), which was another side of the peninsula.</span> <span id="s974">That was an area where Jewish people were training future sailors.</span> <span id="s975">Was Palestine but they had long-range plans and Ts was the place where future sailors were trained over there.</span> <span id="s976">He wanted to go to Israel and when I came to Ts, they told me that yes, the guy was there.</span> <span id="s977">They said he wanted to go to Israel but “we cannot ship anyone to Israel.</span> <span id="s978">We ourselves have problems if we want to go back because the English are blockading the whole sea over there, the Mediterranean Sea.</span> <span id="s979">They won't let any boats go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s980">I decided to go back to Germany and I wound up in a camp Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s981">Most of the liberated people from that area were situated there.</span> <span id="s982">I ran across some friends I knew from camp.</span> <span id="s983">We four boys occupied a one-room apartment.</span> <span id="s984">We started making plans about what to do with our lives.</span> <span id="s985">One fellow by the name Alex Epstein (161) befriended a nice young lady, Sophia Levy.</span> <span id="s986">He got married over there.</span> <span id="s987">Blockman, I mentioned him before, had a friend in Sweden.</span> <span id="s988">The friend had been sent to Sweden because she was very sick and was taken there to be built up.</span> <span id="s989">Blockman decided he wanted to go to Sweden to marry her.</span> <span id="s990">I was left with one other guy --Fogel, Kubat Fogel.</span> <span id="s991">We decided at that point that since he wanted to go to Australia and I wanted to go to the United States and they didn't have a consulate over in Bergen-Belsen, so I'd have to move to Munich, where there was a consulate.</span> <span id="s992">About two weeks later, I found myself in Munich.</span> <span id="s993">I started to look around where many Jewish people congregated.</span> <span id="s994">There was a cafe by the name Grunwald and I started asking if they had seen my cousin.</span> <span id="s995">They said, “As a matter of fact, he was here a little while ago.</span> <span id="s996">If you stay here long enough or return tomorrow, you'll find him, for sure.”</span> <span id="s997">Sure enough, I ran across him the following day.</span> <span id="s998">We decided to move to a smaller community and it was about 10 kilometers from Munich.</span> <span id="s999">I mentioned (188) and we took a nice apartment and we lived in there for maybe seven, eight months.</span> <span id="s1000">During that time, my cousin found out that he has a brother in Engleberg, Sweden.</span> <span id="s1001">He had been sent to Sweden because the Swedes took in people who were undernourished or were too young to be on their own.</span> <span id="s1002">The brother was a youngster so Sweden took him in and sent him to a little camp, a school established to teach young people.</span> <span id="s1003">When we found out, we wanted in the worst way to go and visit him.</span> <span id="s1004">But we couldn't get a permit to cross the border, so we notified him that we were going to be at the border crossing.</span> <span id="s1005">He came to see us.</span> <span id="s1006">We spent a day with him.</span> <span id="s1007">He had to go back to be in the school.</span> <span id="s1008">About four or five months later, he got a permit to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1009">My uncle that lived in New York, and he worked out some papers to bring him over.</span> <span id="s1010">In between time, when he left, I went by train back to Bergen-Belsen mainly to do a little business because we lived privately and we were not supported by the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1011">We had to support ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">I got very sick one night and I had excruciating pain.</span> <span id="s1013">Kubat Fogel said, “You know that the only thing -- the best thing I can suggest is to take you to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s1014">I went to the hospital, I was limping I didn't know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1015">They diagnosed that I have sciatica.</span> <span id="s1016">They treated me like a guinea pig.</span> <span id="s1017">They kept on shooting me with novocaine and more novocaine but I didn't feel any relief.</span> <span id="s1018">For a few minutes, while the novocaine was working, I was all right, but then the pain started to come back.</span> <span id="s1019">While I was in the hospital, I got a message that my cousin was killed in an accident in Munich.</span> <span id="s1020">He was hitchhiking a ride from M -- (230) to Munich.</span> <span id="s1021">The truck that he hitchhiked on tried to cross train tracks ahead of an oncoming train.</span> <span id="s1022">There was no barricade to stop him.</span> <span id="s1023">The train hit the truck and killed him instantly.</span> <span id="s1024">They wouldn't release me but I told the doctor I'm willing to pay a nurse to go with me to Munich.</span> <span id="s1025">I said I would like to be at the funeral.</span> <span id="s1026">They assigned a nurse and I took a train and I went to Munich only to find out that I missed the funeral by six hours.</span> <span id="s1027">When I went back to our apartment, I couldn't believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s1028">Someone had pilfered the whole place.</span> <span id="s1029">I didn't even have a pair of shorts to change into.</span> <span id="s1030">I asked the landlady, “Who did this?”</span> <span id="s1031">She said the Yiddisha Geminda, the Jewish people assigned.</span> <span id="s1032">They organized a group of Jewish people and they made them (do it?)</span> <span id="s1033">, one said he is a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1034">The other said he is going to be the president, they appointed themselves!</span> <span id="s1035">When they found out my cousin had been killed, they came over and they said “We are taking possession of everything.</span> <span id="s1036">We are going to give it back to them when they come.”</span> <span id="s1037">She said that the Szpiro was going to come and he had to have the stuff.</span> <span id="s1038">He said they can come to us and we'll give it to him.</span> <span id="s1039">Only to find out that nobody claimed that they had it.</span> <span id="s1040">They hid it -- each one took something and I had to go out and buy everything from top to bottom to get dressed.</span> <span id="s1041">I didn't have anything to change into.</span> <span id="s1042">In the meantime, I had to have that nurse because every few hours, she had to give me novocaine.</span> <span id="s1043">I begged her to stay with me a little while longer so I could have something to change into.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">The second day, I checked into the Munich Nerve Clinic.</span> <span id="s1045">They considered that a nerve disease, something to do with the nervous system, was causing the pain.</span> <span id="s1046">They started treating me in an entirely different manner than I was treated before.</span> <span id="s1047">I was there six months and I didn't make any progress.</span> <span id="s1048">The doctor that was assigned to me said the only thing he could suggest was Badhaden (282), Baden-Baden?</span> <span id="s1049">which treats people who have rheumatism, arthritis and also sciatica.</span> <span id="s1050">Mud baths could help.</span> <span id="s1051">I went there and they gave me that treatments and I started to feel better every day, to a point that I didn't limp any more.</span> <span id="s1052">After three months, I was able to get discharged and go back to Munich.</span> <span id="s1053">When I went back to Munich, I found out that I had papers already to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1054">Six weeks later, I was already on my way to Bremerhaven, where I boarded a ship and I went to the United States.</span> <span id="s1055">My uncle and my cousin came to greet me.</span> <span id="s1056">I stayed with my uncle for about three months.</span> <span id="s1057">After that, I decided that I was sick and tired of New York.</span> <span id="s1058">It did not impress me too much.</span> <span id="s1059">In the morning at six o'clock, I had to be on the subway in order to make it to work that started eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s1060">I didn't get home until about six o'clock.</span> <span id="s1061">I could barely eat the food and I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s1062">It was a pace that I just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1063">I started to look around and see if I could settle some place that is not so hectic.</span> <span id="s1064">I found a friend who lived in St. Paul and I contacted him.</span> <span id="s1065">He told me you come, be my guest.</span> <span id="s1066">If you like it, you can stay.</span> <span id="s1067">If you don't like it, you can always go back.</span> <span id="s1068">I took him up on that.</span> <span id="s1069">I came on a Wednesday, and on a Thursday, I already had a job.</span> <span id="s1070">They hired me to work for Burt's Shoe Stores.</span> <span id="s1071">I was with them over a year.</span> <span id="s1072">In the meantime, I met my wife and we got married in 1952, August 24, 1952.</span> <span id="s1073">Soon, we’ll have our 40th wedding anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">(End of tape.)</span></p></body></html>
