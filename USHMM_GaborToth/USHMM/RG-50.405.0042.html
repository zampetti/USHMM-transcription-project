Snyderman (Vladimir, you're twenty years old.</span> <span id="s12">You were born in 1970 in Moscow.</span> <span id="s13">Can you tell me what you're earliest memories are growing up?)</span> <span id="s14">My very first memory, I remember how I was trying to climb the stairs or a chair, but that's not very clear memories.</span> <span id="s15">My more later memories were of some events when I hit my head or when I fell out of the train onto the tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">(How did that happen?)</span> <span id="s17">My father went from the train to buy something in the station and my mother didn't want me to go after him, but I ran out and there was some distance between the train and the platform and I fell between the platform and the train, and as far as I remember I lost consciousness and I was operated on, and I still have some of the scars.</span> <span id="s18">(How old were you then?)</span> <span id="s19">I was four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">(There was another child in the family?</span> <span id="s21">You're the second child?)</span> <span id="s22">Yes.</span> <span id="s23">My brother's name is Sergey and today he is twentyfive.</span> <span id="s24">(So he was about nine at the time.)</span> <span id="s25">He was there with my mother and he probably wasn't as daring as I was.</span> <span id="s26">(You were the troublemaker then?)</span> <span id="s27">I didn't think of myself then that I was, but probably yes.</span> <span id="s28">(So your earliest memory is being disobedient?)</span> <span id="s29">I think all of us were.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">(So you recovered from this... Then what do you recall?</span> <span id="s31">Did you grow up in the same household?)</span> <span id="s32">Yes, I grew up in the same household and the first years of my life I went to the schools and communicated, socialized with almost the same people all the time that were in my house-yard or in the school in this area.</span> <span id="s33">(What part of Moscow was it that you grew up in?)</span> <span id="s34">It was southwest part of Moscow where now are the streets Profsojuznaja and we lived on the street Butlerova, which is a small street between Profsojuznaja and Volgina Street.</span> <span id="s35">(Was there anything special about the area that would be interesting historically?)</span> <span id="s36">I can't think of anything because probably Moscow as far as I know is not strictly divided into areas like western cities are, so I'm not sure the area does give any color to the people or to anything in this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">(Were there other Jews in the area?)</span> <span id="s38">I was aware of some Jews who were in my classes, that live in this area, but it didn't make a big difference for me until probably I was already in my late teens, I think.</span> <span id="s39">(Just before you left the country....) Before I graduated from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">(You grew up in a household where there was some political interest and some activity.</span> <span id="s41">When did you first become aware of this political activity?)</span> <span id="s42">First I remember when I was probably, I don't even remember, maybe when I was nine or when I was eight, somewhere in between six and ten, I believe, that my parents were discussing the question of leaving Russia for America or for Israel.</span> <span id="s43">But it probably didn't have any political context.</span> <span id="s44">But politically speaking I think I became aware much later when....</span> <span id="s45">First I think I was more interested in Jewishness and I was beginning to become acquainted with Jewish traditions rather than with political ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">(How did that happen, that you were aware of Jewish traditions?</span> <span id="s47">Did your grandparents live with you?)</span> <span id="s48">No, my grandparents didn't live with us.</span> <span id="s49">But one of our grandparents would visit very often because she was retired and she would help my mother with the household business.</span> <span id="s50">(Which grandparents was this?)</span> <span id="s51">That was my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s52">And she would come.</span> <span id="s53">But regarding the question of political ideas, I think first I began speaking politically when our house was visited by some foreigners, like Western people, who would come to visit [us] as refuseniks.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">(Do you know how your family made its first contact with these foreign visitors?)</span> <span id="s55">I believe that we were put into refusal in 1979 when I was nine, and our first visitors were in 1983, so I think it occurred besides my parents awareness of that... I think that American institutions or organizations who had these lists of refuseniks and people who need help, and they finally got our name on these lists and we were probably called by phone or by whatever means, and my parents, I believe, met with them and that was our first acquaintance.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">(How did you become aware of your Jewishness?</span> <span id="s57">Was this a positive thing or was it negative?)</span> <span id="s58">I think it was... I knew that it all was positive.</span> <span id="s59">Another thing was that I had some experiences which were not positive, but it never occurred to me that I was ashamed or that I ever regretted that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s60">(How do you explain this, because many of the Soviet Jewish immigrants we meet say initially they were very unhappy at discovering that they were Jewish, that they were called bad names.</span> <span id="s61">Why is it different for you?)</span> <span id="s62">I think because of my parents, who, from the beginning, from the start when I began to deal with the fact that I was Jewish, they would explain or they would give me some things to read about Jews.</span> <span id="s63">So I read books like by Howard Fast, about [...], I don't know the name of the book.</span> <span id="s64">My Glorious Brothers, or something.</span> <span id="s65">(It was historical fiction based on....) based on the Macabee stories.</span> <span id="s66">And I read other books.</span> <span id="s67">I began reading the Bible, and I read the Israeli Russianlanguage journals like Israel Today.</span> <span id="s68">And it was very exciting for me, and it was even more exciting because it was forbidden to have these things, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s69">(So these forbidden things were being brought to you by these foreign visitors?</span> <span id="s70">Did they mail things to you?)</span> <span id="s71">No, I think usually they would come to us through other people who got them from somewhere, but I think that initially they were brought by some visitors from abroad.</span> <span id="s72">(So how old were you when you started reading these things?)</span> <span id="s73">I was ten.</span> <span id="s74">I remember exactly because that was the summer of 1980 when I was in the house of some people who had all this literature and I began reading it and I was very interested in all this stuff, and it was probably my beginnings of my selfenlightening education and interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">(Were your parents still working at this time, or were they allowed to keep their jobs once they became refuseniks?)</span> <span id="s76">Once they became refuseniks they changed their jobs.</span> <span id="s77">And actually, after this my mother gave birth to my younger brother who is now almost twelve, Michael.</span> <span id="s78">After that, he was born in February 1979, and we got refused in October 1979, and after that she wouldn't work.</span> <span id="s79">(She chose not to work?)</span> <span id="s80">She chose not to work, and probably wouldn't be able to if she did want to, so she knew that it was a dead end and she didn't work.</span> <span id="s81">(What work had she been doing?)</span> <span id="s82">She was in engineering construction, so she would make drafts and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">(And your father?)</span> <span id="s84">Before refusal, he decided to go by the path of not dissident, but, say, someone who thinks otherwise.</span> <span id="s85">He was an engineer in engineering chemistry, and I believe in 1977, two years before we applied for a visa to leave Russia, he had to quit his job because of the secrecy matters, which was the first job.</span> <span id="s86">And later he changed his job to a less profitable, but still he could support us partially.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">(So how did your family survive during this period when you were only supported partially by your father?)</span> <span id="s88">I suppose that a big chunk of it was aid from the foreign visitors, from Europe, from the States, and rarely, from Israel.</span> <span id="s89">And there were people who were helping us from the refuseniks community because they would get the same material aid from the West, so that's probably how we survived, because like once in awhile we'd get some presents which would support our life.</span> <span id="s90">(What kind of presents were they?)</span> <span id="s91">It could be clothing, like coats, like if we would get a coat that cost three months' salary or more.</span> <span id="s92">(In dollars what would that be equivalent to?</span> <span id="s93">A month's salary for your father at that time?)</span> <span id="s94">That's a hard thing to say because Russian rubles are quite different from dollars.</span> <span id="s95">Especially when it comes to paying the rent, say, if you should pay the rent in hundreds of dollars, there you should pay tens of dollars.</span> <span id="s96">Our apartment cost was about thirty rubles, whereas in the States the same apartment would cost like $600 a month.</span> <span id="s97">That was the main difference, probably, between the cost.</span> <span id="s98">Food would cost less than in the States as well, like maybe half as much, in the terms of one ruble to one dollar.</span> <span id="s99">But so my father's salary was like just enough to pay for the food and pay for the rent, nothing else.</span> <span id="s100">That wouldn't be enough for anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">(Did you feel deprived?</span> <span id="s102">Did you feel that you were missing things that you needed in your life at that time?)</span> <span id="s103">I knew that I was deprived, but thanks to my great parents who would raise me in a way that I would be happy with whatever I had, so I knew that I don't have those things, but I never felt it.</span> <span id="s104">I always was satisfied with what I had.</span> <span id="s105">(So you weren't hungry, and you had a roof over your head?)</span> <span id="s106">Yes.</span> <span id="s107">(And you were warm enough in the winter?)</span> <span id="s108">Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s109">Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">(Your sense of Judaism came from some religious observances, traditional observances.</span> <span id="s111">What kind of holidays do you remember being celebrated?)</span> <span id="s112">I believe that none of them were celebrated up until probably 1983 when I had bar mitzvah and my father would become acquainted with some religious leaders of the Jewish community in Moscow, and after that we celebrated some of the holidays, like Pesach, Purim.</span> <span id="s113">They were not like strictly observed by the rules of Jewish tradition, but we knew that they were holidays and we would have dinner or we would have some friends, or, say, American guests, or European guests who led the Seder or the Purim dinner or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">(So you actually had a Bar Mitzvah?</span> <span id="s115">I think you're the first young man I've met who had one in Russia.)</span> <span id="s116">I don't think that it was a really strict Bar Mitzvah in the religious terms.</span> <span id="s117">I didn't go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s118">I knew that I had twins in London and in Pennsylvania and in a couple more places around the world, who prayed in my name, but I didn't go to the synagogue and I didn't have any religious ceremony.</span> <span id="s119">(So you did not, for example, read from the Torah?)</span> <span id="s120">No, I did not.</span> <span id="s121">(Did you ever see a Torah while you were there?)</span> <span id="s122">Yes, I definitely saw.</span> <span id="s123">When I was thirteen, I believe, I saw one from a long distance, or I saw one in Russian translation which I read.</span> <span id="s124">I think, by the age of thirteen I read the Torah in Russian translation which was not quite Torah but the Christian Bible in Russian translation, but whatever.</span> <span id="s125">It was still a Torah.</span> <span id="s126">But later on I saw a Torah and I even read some of it, not before an altar, but just for myself.</span> <span id="s127">(Have you had an opportunity to study Hebrew?)</span> <span id="s128">That's a good question, because when I was fourteen I was very interested in Hebrew, and I found people in Moscow who were studying Hebrew, and who were teaching Hebrew, and I tried to attend a couple courses.</span> <span id="s129">And after that some way, I don't remember how, my connection with them was lost, and the only thing that I had in my hands was this selftaught book of Hebrew which I started, actually.</span> <span id="s130">I started by myself.</span> <span id="s131">And later on my parents, my father in particular, and my brother, were interested in Hebrew, and we got a teacher.</span> <span id="s132">But that was already later on, and by that time I already knew Hebrew enough not to have to attend these courses.</span> <span id="s133">In this particular case I think my story is quite different from what usually you would have in Russia with Hebrew and a Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">(So you had the advantage of knowing other people who had the same need to pursue the Jewish studies, the Hebraic Studies, to learn the traditions, and that was a support group, you might say.</span> <span id="s135">You all supported each other somehow.)</span> <span id="s136">Definitely.</span> <span id="s137">I think that being in refusal all these years was meant very much to have good friends, to have people who think alike and who have the same hopes and the same faith, who will help each other.</span> <span id="s138">(Of those people, what percentage of them has been able to emigrate to Israel and the United States?)</span> <span id="s139">I think by now if not 100%, maybe 95% of them have emigrated to either of these two countries.</span> <span id="s140">But back then in was not the case, and people whom I knew began emigrating in 198687, and by 1990 almost all of them have left Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">(How did being Jewish affect your thinking?)</span> <span id="s142">I think that first, it gave me a sense of responsibility, that I couldn't do something that probably other people could do, like steal, or do something that is clearly not advised or forbidden by the Torah, if I knew that.</span> <span id="s143">Because in Russia children don't have such a law as the Christian law because they have State law, but they would steal or something if they want to.</span> <span id="s144">And I remember sometimes that sometimes Jewish religion would prohibit it and I would stop doing it.</span> <span id="s145">(So you were tempted sometimes...) Yes.</span> <span id="s146">(For example...) Yeah, I remember how I would walk with my friends from grade school, and they would come into the store and would want to steal some buns or something, just to do it, because it was very easy to steal anything from the store.</span> <span id="s147">And I wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s148">I couldn't stop them all, by any means, but I remember how I thought of this.</span> <span id="s149">Here you have something where you should be different from these people, and have this moral idea behind that.</span> <span id="s150">Even though later I didn't think that I'm different in this sense that they can do it and I can't.</span> <span id="s151">(Were these all nonJewish friends who would do this, or were there some Jewish friends as well?)</span> <span id="s152">I didn't think of their Jewishness in particular at that time.</span> <span id="s153">I just knew that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s154">I think they were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">(Were you aware of your parents worries?)</span> <span id="s156">Sometimes yes.</span> <span id="s157">Sometimes maybe not fully aware, because I believe they always had some worries and not all of them they wanted to reveal to us, or even if they did, not all of them did I understand well.</span> <span id="s158">So I'm not sure I can answer this question, because I don't know all their worries.</span> <span id="s159">(Were you worried about anything?)</span> <span id="s160">I don't know, actually, because I didn't worry exactly.</span> <span id="s161">I knew that I did worry, but I don't remember how I worried.</span> <span id="s162">I remember that after I knew that our family wanted to leave, I knew that I wanted to leave, too, and I was looking to it every day, like checking my mailbox where the announcement for our permission to leave should have appeared.</span> <span id="s163">But I don't remember my exact worries, at least before I was like sixteen or seventeen I didn't worry much.</span> <span id="s164">Actually, I think I was pretty happy, because we had some purpose in life.</span> <span id="s165">We had some faith.</span> <span id="s166">We had people with whom we could share all that.</span> <span id="s167">So probably it was full of ideas and purpose and sense life.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">(Did your family worry about being watched by the secret police?)</span> <span id="s169">I think they were aware of it, but my father would often say that we didn't do anything against the law, so even though they felt they were being watched or being heard, I don't think my father was worried about what he was saying because we didn't go against the law even if we would express some unusual or nonconformist ideas.</span> <span id="s170">It was not against the law, and we didn't do anything against the system, besides probably being out of it, being exceptions to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">(He told me that when he was growing up, his older brother was brought in for questioning after demonstrations, but were there any incidents among your family or friends?</span> <span id="s172">Were they questioned or detained or followed?)</span> <span id="s173">I know that when I was in high school, there were people who were questioned about this and that.</span> <span id="s174">Our high school was a very good one.</span> <span id="s175">It was a math school where many Jewish people went.</span> <span id="s176">And that's why, probably, the principal of this school was very afraid that the authorities didn't like this school because of its Jewish population.</span> <span id="s177">They wanted to finish it by all means if they could.</span> <span id="s178">And the principal, who wanted to prevent the school from actual disaster, tried to eliminate all people or ideas which were nonconformist.</span> <span id="s179">So she expelled a couple of people because of their Zionist or religious activity.</span> <span id="s180">And she would ask other people if they know anybody who does that, but I think it was done with the great idea of preserving school from destruction from above.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">(You're saying that it was like a hotbed of dissidence.)</span> <span id="s182">Yeah, there was dissidence there.</span> <span id="s183">And the principal was trying to prevent this dissidence from going off the limits of the school building.</span> <span id="s184">Because in this case the school would be eliminated as a fact, and that's why she didn't want it, because it was a very good school.</span> <span id="s185">But many Jews went there and they liked it and that would be a disaster if officials would find some reason to dissolve it.</span> <span id="s186">(So was she effective in what she tried to do?)</span> <span id="s187">She was effective, yes.</span> <span id="s188">She expelled a couple of my friends.</span> <span id="s189">And she even wanted to expel me, but I stopped very quickly, and because I just know that it's better not to talk about Jewishness and not to have any propaganda or information about being Jewish in the religious or social matters.</span> <span id="s190">The school existed for study, not propaganda.</span> <span id="s191">So I stopped.</span> <span id="s192">But there was a time when they wanted to expel me for participating in like, Purim celebration, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">(So she was aware of meetings where you would have songs or parties?)</span> <span id="s194">Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s195">(Was there any printed matter?)</span> <span id="s196">No.</span> <span id="s197">No printed matter.</span> <span id="s198">(But the group was not secretive about it.</span> <span id="s199">They wanted a public...) Actually, it wasn't a group.</span> <span id="s200">It was just people who were Jews who sometimes would gather and sing songs, etc., and tell stories.</span> <span id="s201">And that was a little bit dangerous, probably, for the existence of the school itself, and that's why our principal wanted to prevent it from closing.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">(You were saying that this was a pretty good school and you didn't want to lose your place in it, and you wanted it to remain open, and the emphasis was on mathematics?)</span> <span id="s203">The emphasis of the study was on math, but all teachers, almost all teachers and subjects were taught very well, and their standards of education were very high.</span> <span id="s204">To get into this school, one had to pass three or four rounds of exams.</span> <span id="s205">(At what age did you take those exams?)</span> <span id="s206">When I was fifteen.</span> <span id="s207">So I was there at fifteen, sixteen and seventeen.</span> <span id="s208">Three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">(It was a competitive school.</span> <span id="s210">How did you do there?)</span> <span id="s211">I think I was doing well.</span> <span id="s212">I would not get worse grades than I got in other schools, and they were better sometimes.</span> <span id="s213">But it amounted to hard work, so I worked there as a student, and I studied hard.</span> <span id="s214">And I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s215">(Did you actually complete the course of study there, or did you leave before that?)</span> <span id="s216">Oh, I completed the course of study.</span> <span id="s217">And even after that I went to one of the higher schools in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">(Which school did you go to?)</span> <span id="s219">I went to the Institute of Railway Engineering, and my course of study was applied math and software engineering.</span> <span id="s220">(Do you think you would have been allowed to pursue the level of studies you wished there had you stayed?)</span> <span id="s221">I hope yes.</span> <span id="s222">I think so.</span> <span id="s223">Because even at that time there were some hints for the bettering or improving of the situation with respect to the antiJewish discrimination.</span> <span id="s224">(Who do you credit for that change?)</span> <span id="s225">I think I would credit the worsening of the Soviet economy, which was pushing the government for negotiations with the West, and the West pushing for the improving of human rights in the Soviet Union, and later the flexibility of the Communist leaders, who came to know that they need to improve something inside, like on the social level, and the economic level.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">(So that was perestroika, the restructuring, and glasnost - how would you describe glasnost?)</span> <span id="s227">I would describe it as everyone can try to say and not be afraid of saying that, and probably publishing it.</span> <span id="s228">Because in Russia even now I'm not sure exists the freedom of publishing whatever one wants.</span> <span id="s229">And the means of, say, publishing, mass production, and copying of the material is very limited.</span> <span id="s230">You couldn't find these photocopying machines like here, like xerox machines.</span> <span id="s231">And now I've heard that you can find it.</span> <span id="s232">But to make a copy it costs a lot and you're not able to make millions of copiesnot easily and freely.</span> <span id="s233">That's just an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">(But you were getting publications, prior to glasnost, you were seeing these forbidden publications?)</span> <span id="s235">Yes.</span> <span id="s236">(Was the Bible a forbidden publication or was it allowed to be read?)</span> <span id="s237">That's hard to say.</span> <span id="s238">I think it was allowed to be published, but as a member of Communist community, like if I'm in the Young Communist League or if I'm a socalled pioneer it's like boy scouts or girl scouts in Russia if I'm in this League, I'm not supposed to read anything that's connected to religion whatsoever.</span> <span id="s239">So if I'm reading this, I can have problems in ideological things, with the leaders of this league or the leaders of the community to which I supposedly belong.</span> <span id="s240">So actually, there was probably no prohibition for religious literature like the Bible, but there was very strong pressure not to pursue and selfeducation or whatever education connected with any ideology besides the main Communist one.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">(What books do you recall reading that were forbidden?)</span> <span id="s242">I think that all books which could; Howard Fast, I'm not sure there was not list of forbidden books, or whatever.</span> <span id="s243">Forbiddance is something for which you can suffer some losses, such as loss of freedom or loss of work, and probably Howard Fast could amount to these kinds of books because first, it was about Jewishness, so you can say if it's about Jewish people in particular, if there's something which is nationalist, and that which is nationalist is conservative, and if it's conservative then it's capitalist, etc.</span> <span id="s244">You can make a chain of words such as capitalist or nationalist and conservative and Zionist, and that would lead to antiSoviet.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">(How about some titles even Soviet authors who were forbidden to you that you might have read when you were of schoolage?</span> <span id="s246">Whom might you have read at that point?)</span> <span id="s247">Actually I didn't read many books which were forbidden because... I knew, I was aware of the existence of these books, but I tried to spend my reading time reading classical literature, which was not forbidden usually, as dissident literature.</span> <span id="s248">I read Solzhenitsyn, but I read One Day in The Life of Ivan Denisovich, but it wasn't forbidden because it was published in Russia.</span> <span id="s249">By that time I already lost my basic interest in Jewish not Jewish, but any dissident literature, because I was a little bit already educated enough not to read about, say, antiSoviet things.</span> <span id="s250">I knew that it is bad there, so I didn't want to disappoint myself.</span> <span id="s251">Then, on second thought, maybe I was trying to read good quality literature, but not just interesting literature.</span> <span id="s252">(So who were the writers you were reading then?)</span> <span id="s253">Many writers, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s254">(You said the classics...) I'm talking about Russian classics, or even American classics.</span> <span id="s255">I read almost all of Jack London, almost all of Jules Verne, and I was reading Mark Twain and Galsworthy.</span> <span id="s256">I read Salinger.</span> <span id="s257">I was reading Russian classics, from Chekhov to Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, all the big names.</span> <span id="s258">Bulgakov and many names that maybe are not as well known.</span> <span id="s259">I read Graham Greene from this century, as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">(And this was reading that was assigned in school, or...) No.</span> <span id="s261">I'm talking about reading that I was doing for myself.</span> <span id="s262">If I had time.</span> <span id="s263">(Was Shakespeare part of the curriculum?)</span> <span id="s264">No, it was not, but I read, not all of Shakespeare, but his basic plays.</span> <span id="s265">Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear.</span> <span id="s266">And it was by myself.</span> <span id="s267">I would prefer to read this stuff but not dissident literature which was not very good literature as literature, but was very pungent by that time, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">(With the advent of the greater flexibility, the term you used, in government, did you see some change, did you see people responding to this?</span> <span id="s269">What kind of response did you see to the government change in terms of the people around you, even in school the teachers.)</span> <span id="s270">I think from the teachers' point of view, there was a big change when it came to the teachers of ideological subjects as history or political science.</span> <span id="s271">We didn't have the term sociology, but there were some courses which had some sociology, probably, in them.</span> <span id="s272">And these teachers would be very confused.</span> <span id="s273">They didn't know what to teach, how to teach history, say and Marxism.</span> <span id="s274">They didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s275">That was very funny to see because sometimes we would have some materials in our textbooks canceled as wrong or oldfashioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">(Give me an example of a teacher floundering with some material?)</span> <span id="s277">Okay.</span> <span id="s278">We had that in 1936 the Communist Party adopted a new constitution.</span> <span id="s279">I don't know if you have this, under Stalin's purges.</span> <span id="s280">But in 1936 Stalin adopted a new constitution and in our constitution of developed socialism in which it was taken that the Soviet country and the Soviet economy came to the point where they have already achieved the Communist basics from which we can build Communism and all this.</span> <span id="s281">I don't know the decent word in English which would describe it.</span> <span id="s282">All this rubbish.</span> <span id="s283">And usually we would learn that in these years from, say, 1932 to 1936, there was a great achievement in all levels of industry and agriculture, etc., etc., and after that they finished with this constitution and everybody in the Soviet Union was utterly happy and utterly satisfied, and everybody was ready and all this rubbish.</span> <span id="s284">But when it came to perestroika in 1986, we already knew that there was beginning to be published the materials about the purges which began, I believe, in the 1930s for whatever history, and we knew about the Thirties.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">And we knew about famine which was in 1932 when millions of people died.</span> <span id="s286">And we knew about the concentration camps and about the cost which was paid for industrializing the country.</span> <span id="s287">Because the whole country was industrialized in ten years, which was by all standards, Soviet and nonSoviet, a miracle.</span> <span id="s288">The production grew like 500% in ten years, or something.</span> <span id="s289">But we knew that all that was achieved by killing slave laborers who worked in all this construction.</span> <span id="s290">And the constitution which proclaimed the freedom, liberty and quality of rights, you know, good words that were in the constitution.</span> <span id="s291">And the chapter of this history book was about the achievement and all the good words about the constitution.</span> <span id="s292">And so we would just skip this chapter because the teacher didn't know what he's supposed to talk about.</span> <span id="s293">And to learn what's written in the book was a waste of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">(So the teacher simply skipped a chapter that he'd done the previous year.)</span> <span id="s295">Even more, in regard to the final exams, all questions regarding the Soviet period of history, that is, from 1917 when the Bolshevik revolution was until, say, 1970 or even 1980, was just skipped.</span> <span id="s296">And we would answer only about the Tsarist Russia or everything that was before the Bolshevik revolution.</span> <span id="s297">I mean, we were lucky, because we had to write questions with less material to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">(Were you aware of people being released from prisons or being brought back from exile?)</span> <span id="s299">There definitely was, because I was very well acquainted with the son of Joseph Begun.</span> <span id="s300">My parents were very good friends with the Slepaks, who were in exile, and other people, so we had some contact with people who were in exile and in prisons, and we knew about the release of most of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">(What about Chernobyl?</span> <span id="s302">When did you first learn about it?)</span> <span id="s303">I think about when it was published, or when I heard the rumor that Swedish radio station was panicking that the Chernobyl cloud is over it.</span> <span id="s304">I think we learned about Chernobyl about three or four days after it exploded.</span> <span id="s305">It exploded on the 29th of April.</span> <span id="s306">On the 30th they didn't say anything, probably because of May Day, which is a national holiday in Russia, so they didn't want to spoil the holiday for the Russian people, or they just wanted to deceive and not to show it.</span> <span id="s307">I don't know.</span> <span id="s308">There wasn't a very big understanding of what had happened.</span> <span id="s309">We found out what happened much later.</span> <span id="s310">The first day when it was reported there was like a ten or fifteenline column in the back of the newspaper that said that one of the reactors in Chernobyl blew up.</span> <span id="s311">And there wasn't a big fuss about it.</span> <span id="s312">So we supposed that it could be a big disaster, but it wasn't presented in a way that one would think that it's really big disaster, a big tragedy.</span> <span id="s313">And [blurb] would only know about the consequences.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">(When you understood, was it months later?)</span> <span id="s315">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s316">It was later.</span> <span id="s317">Even the central authorities began reporting on it more and more, and afterwards we would have the different stories in newspapers and journals about people.</span> <span id="s318">It came later on, after Western pressure.</span> <span id="s319">Not the same day.</span> <span id="s320">(Did you notice any kind of an emotional reaction once people understood?)</span> <span id="s321">I think not in Moscow.</span> <span id="s322">Usually it would be many, many jokes about it, about twoheaded people or something like that.</span> <span id="s323">(People chose to laugh about it rather than cry.)</span> <span id="s324">Yes.</span> <span id="s325">Moscow is far, and you never perceive it as a real thing, and that's why there were many jokes.</span> <span id="s326">People would say there's a gay radio active and gays radio passive or something.</span> <span id="s327">(Say that again...) It was one of the jokes of that period that there are two gay men who go in the streets of Kiev, which is not far from Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s328">One is gay is radioactive, and the other radiopassive.</span> <span id="s329">There are active gays and passive gays.</span> <span id="s330">So that was one of the jokes.</span> <span id="s331">There were many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">(When did you first learn that you'd received the permission to leave?)</span> <span id="s333">I believe it was the same day that we got it.</span> <span id="s334">The person from the emigration office, which is OVIR in Russian, called my mother and said that we should collect all documents together to get the visa and that was permission.</span> <span id="s335">That was on October 6, 1988.</span> <span id="s336">(How long did it take before you actually left?)</span> <span id="s337">From October 6 until January 22.</span> <span id="s338">Like three months.</span> <span id="s339">(Was there anything special you felt you must take with you?)</span> <span id="s340">Maybe only people.</span> <span id="s341">There were people I left behind.</span> <span id="s342">(Who remained behind?)</span> <span id="s343">My friends.</span> <span id="s344">I had a very good girlfriend.</span> <span id="s345">There were people.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">(Do they have a chance of getting here?)</span> <span id="s347">Oh, definitely, they do have a chance.</span> <span id="s348">(They are on the list?)</span> <span id="s349">No, they have not yet applied, but they are going to.</span> <span id="s350">And there are many of them.</span> <span id="s351">Not all of them are going to leave.</span> <span id="s352">I found out that one of my friends is going to come here as a tourist, so we're going to try to keep him here.</span> <span id="s353">But it's not easy.</span> <span id="s354">And that's only one.</span> <span id="s355">And I have very many friends.</span> <span id="s356">I was in many schools, and in all schools I was kind of a popular person.</span> <span id="s357">So I have many friends, very good ones, whom I probably miss more than anything else which I left there.</span> <span id="s358">I'm not very patriotic.</span> <span id="s359">I don't have any nostalgia over the country itself.</span> <span id="s360">(You don't miss the country itself?)</span> <span id="s361">Almost not at all.</span> <span id="s362">I miss that I can't walk the streets that I do like in Moscow or whatever, but for me it's not as important as my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">(What have you gained by coming here?)</span> <span id="s364">Hopes for the future, I think.</span> <span id="s365">And I think that probably there are some ideas or a new perception of life purpose or some idea of freedom in choosing something and doing it, even though I'm not sure that I'm doing the right thing, but still, I have this freedom.</span> <span id="s366">And something that I see that I can achieve by going to it, like some purposefulness.</span> <span id="s367">And freedom of movements I can go wherever I want, I can do whatever I want.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">(Do you think you have a better chance here of fulfilling your career and intellectual aspirations than you did in Russia?)</span> <span id="s369">I'm not sure about intellectual aspirations.</span> <span id="s370">I'm just not sure exactly what you mean.</span> <span id="s371">But about the career, definitely.</span> <span id="s372">Because in Russia there was always a dead end, some point where you're not going to go anywhere, and even we have a friend who visited us this Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s373">He left Russia in 1972 and he went there for the first time this year, so it's 18 years after he left.</span> <span id="s374">He saw his old friends, and saw that they were in the same place doing the same thing and getting the same money and having almost the same situation [as before].</span> <span id="s375">The only change was that they had children which were taller than him already.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">(What do you want to do?</span> <span id="s377">What do you feel is available to you that might not have been in Russia?)</span> <span id="s378">First, I thought of doing some computer and mathematical work.</span> <span id="s379">Now I'm thinking of doing more like Business or International Relations work.</span> <span id="s380">That's absolutely different from what I could do in Russia.</span> <span id="s381">(So if you could see yourself ten years from now, what would you like to be doing?)</span> <span id="s382">It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s383">I don't know.</span> <span id="s384">Working.</span> <span id="s385">I'm not sure that I know.</span> <span id="s386">But definitely I want to advance in what I'm doing all the time, but not till like I'm thirty and then fiftyfive or until I'm sixty doing the same old things.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">(What would you say is the most important thing about your story thus far?</span> <span id="s388">I know that your life is really just starting to open up from the adult perspective, even though you are mature and have thought about a lot of things and have read a great deal for someone your age compared to your peers in this country What do you think is the most important thing about your story thus far?)</span> <span id="s389">Hmm.</span> <span id="s390">That's a very broad question.</span> <span id="s391">But I can say that important is the support of other people like my parents in all stages of my life, wherever I was I had parents who would help me in educating or enlightening me, or just in their presence, so I can say that was very helpful for me.</span> <span id="s392">What else can I say?</span> <span id="s393">Another thing that I probably should say, too, is that we shouldn't judge anything too harshly, like Russia or the situation here, by the same standards.</span> <span id="s394">Like my story is maybe absolutely different from another story, and we shouldn't say everything that was in Russia was bad everything here is good, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s395">We can't judge because there were good things there which are bad here and vice versa.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">(What about being Jewish?</span> <span id="s397">Is that going to be an important part of your life now that you don't have to fight to be Jewish?)</span> <span id="s398">I think, I hope it will.</span> <span id="s399">But, I was in Israel, and I'm trying now to go there and be active in different Jewish activities like I was participating in fund-raising, going to different universities and giving speeches there.</span> <span id="s400">I went to Northwestern and the University of Chicago, and I went to other places just to collect money for Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s401">I hope I will have some connection with the Jewish community, because for me it's first not religion or race or... it's just something that can support you, from the inside and hopefully from the outside.</span> <span id="s402">So the same idea of supporting, because people should support them because alone it is very hard to do anything.</span></p></body></html>
