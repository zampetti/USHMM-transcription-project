<p><span id="s22">A: I was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, southern Germany, Baden; February 19th, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your family history.</span> <span id="s24">How long had your family, either on your mother or your father’s side, been in – in that locale?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, I can’t tell you exactly, I – well, my – both my parents were born and grew up in a place called Breisach on the Rhine, and th-their families go back for quite a while in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: There was David, my father.</span> <span id="s28">My mother’s name was Paula; her maiden name Kleefelt, k-l-e-e-f-e-l-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Well, my father was – ha-had in Europe a plumbing supply business, which at one time arranged over parts of F-France, Switzerland and Germany.</span> <span id="s31">My mother helped him, worked with him in the business, or was at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: D-Do you, or did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I have one sister, Margot.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Is she older or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: She is five years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: So, would you describe your family as upper class?</span> <span id="s37">I mean, your father sounded like a suc-successful businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I guess everybody more or less describes themselves as middle class, and I’ll go along with the same thing.</span> <span id="s39">Yeah, I would say solid middle class.</span> <span id="s40">Both my parents came from rural town – from a rural town, and – but then, as I say, had this business, which was first loca – was initially located in Freiburg, in – where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you live right in the city, or on the outskirts?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: We lived on the edge of the city, let’s put it this way, in a re – in a residential area.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Was this in an apartment, or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: It was an apartment, it was an apartment in a – one of the typical houses, cou – la-large houses, in which there were, I think, two or three apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Was the neighborhood a mixed neighborhood, made up of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I really don’t know, it certainly was not a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s47">Since I left there by the time I was about six or seven, I really don’t know very much about the religious make-up of the area, but I would say it was – it was a – a typical urban area, and certainly not a Jewish area.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So you say you moved from that location at the age of six, so that would have been in 1931.</span> <span id="s49">Do you have any memories up to the age of six of the friends there, or anything that happened at that – you know, up to the age of six.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Let me amend that, actually was 1933, so by that time I was eight years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Did – and so you started school in that location?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I did start school in that location, went to primary school there, yes.</span> <span id="s53">I remember quite well, I – I do remember c-certain bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s54">I can vi-vividly recall the area, of course especially so since I’ve visited it since then again.</span> <span id="s55">It was – it was a good life.</span> <span id="s56">We – we had household help, and as I say, my parents – my dad used to be traveling quite a bit as a – selling for his business, but my mother was home all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I would say nominally so, for the holidays, and went to the synagogue occasionally, or on Saturdays, regular Saturday services.</span> <span id="s59">So I would say sort of – well, how would you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So did you observe the Sabbath, did you observe Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Oh yes, all the holidays were observed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you have any Hebrew school training before the – up to the age of eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, I don’t – not – not that I recall, no, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Was there a large extended family, either or your mother or father’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, there was a fairly sizeable family, not in a town where we lived, but where my parents had come from, and that – since that was only about 20 miles away.</span> <span id="s66">There was, by today’s standards, a very close, nearby extended family.</span> <span id="s67">Of course, in those days 20 miles was a fairly substantial distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So did you get together with them at special holidays and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Oh yes, we often did.</span> <span id="s70">And in addition to that actually, one of my uncles, at times worked with my father in his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Was your father very politically oriented, or your mother at that – at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, neither one, I would say, was either p – was really politically oriented or – or active.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: And were – were your parents Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No, they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: We spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: So from 1925 to 1933, you were in this location.</span> <span id="s78">Is there anything else you wanted to say about that time, before we move on?</span> <span id="s79">Wh-Wh-When you were in school, up to the age of eight, did you have any unpleasant experiences, or any unpleasant experiences in the street with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Ye – well, some, not very much.</span> <span id="s81">I mean, we’re – we – since we left in April of 1933, this was very shortly after Hitler’s actual rise to power, there wasn’t really all that much.</span> <span id="s82">Yes, there were the – there was the occasional bully, but actually I ran into that later on, much more so.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Okay, well, let’s now move into 1933, and in January Hitler came into power as chancellor.</span> <span id="s84">And so, how did that affect your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, on April 1, 1933, there was a boycott of Jewish business in Germany, which was actually one of the – the first centrally orchestrated anti-Jewish outbreak or outburst of activity.</span> <span id="s86">And we packed up and went off to Switzerland, where by that time a ma – a major branch of the business was located in Basel.</span> <span id="s87">So in 1933, we went – went off to Basel, Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So from 1933 on, you were in Basel, or did you return?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, it was – it wasn’t all that cut and dried.</span> <span id="s90">We stayed in Basel for a while.</span> <span id="s91">As best as I recall, we did not get permission to stay permanently in Basel.</span> <span id="s92">I remember we lived in a hotel for quite a while.</span> <span id="s93">And then we moved to France, across the border into France, into Saint-Louis.</span> <span id="s94">Again [indecipherable] across the border from Basel.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Okay, we’ll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s96">When you had to move, what did your parents say to you, why did you have to move?</span> <span id="s97">Here’s an eight year old child, how did they phrase it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: I really can’t recall.</span> <span id="s99">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s100">But to my – well, it was an interesting adventure.</span> <span id="s101">I wasn’t that wild in – being in school, and I was being pulled out of school, and off we went to Basel.</span> <span id="s102">So I really – I must admit, I do not know.</span> <span id="s103">I do not recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did this man Hitler mean anything to you at age eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Oh, I’m sure – I’m sure he did, but exactly what he meant to me at that point, I mean, I’m sure it was not – I wa – I mu – I must have picked it up from – I mean, I wa – I was receptive enough, I think, to pick these things up from my surroundings, but if you asked me what I thought of them exactly, and – and what way it came to me, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: How would you describe yourself as a child?</span> <span id="s107">Were you very independent, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: That depends whom you ask.</span> <span id="s109">No, I don’t think I was really all that independent.</span> <span id="s110">I had a – well, I – I liked being by myself.</span> <span id="s111">I was probably rather introspective, and like at that point already, and this came out much later, we liked reading a great deal, liked playing with construction toys.</span> <span id="s112">In other words, activities that are usually singul – done by one person.</span> <span id="s113">I can’t recall ever having though, certainly at that time having a – a circle of friends.</span> <span id="s114">I mean, I knew people, but nose – no big circle of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So you packed your bags to go to Switzerland with your family.</span> <span id="s116">What is – what di – is your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Margot.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Oh, Margot.</span> <span id="s119">So you and Margot and your parents.</span> <span id="s120">Any extended family, or just the four of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: No, just the f – no, just the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And you don’t remember this being particularly upsetting, having to leave friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No.</span> <span id="s124">As I say, I don’t think I had a very large, or a circle of friends at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And Freiburg is – is not that far from the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s126">So what about the journey there, do you remember anything about that?</span> <span id="s127">And then where did you first settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well, we settled for a while in the hotel in Basel.</span> <span id="s129">And after that when – apparently my parents did not get permission to stay in Basel, or they – or thought it appropriate otherwise.</span> <span id="s130">I must admit I never did find, never did ask.</span> <span id="s131">We moved across the border to Saint-Louis, which is in France, and lived there.</span> <span id="s132">And I went to school in Saint-Louis, both my sister and I did, in a local school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What was that like for you?</span> <span id="s134">Did you have any idea of the language in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s136">Well, you know you, a-at that age if you get thrown into this sort of environment – the people there obviously do speak German or a Swiss dialect, or a Swiss type of dialect, or whatever you want to call the Alsace – the Alsatian manner of speaking.</span> <span id="s137">And so – but French obviously was – was – was difficult, and we had a – we spent a limited amount of time in Switzerland – in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: How long were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: To the best of my recollection, un – until late – sometime middle, late 1934.</span> <span id="s140">In other words, about – I would say about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Any – any unpleasant experiences there where you would – did they know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No unpleasant experiences to the extent that I know now – that I can recall, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And were you very close to your parents, did you have a very good relationship with them, or were they open with you about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Or did you not question?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: A, I probably didn’t question it too much.</span> <span id="s147">B, I guess at that time already, my parents were under a great deal of strain, certainly a lot more than I was.</span> <span id="s148">And while one develops a certain type of closeness as a result, it’s – it’s not quite the same as a – as a closeness which develops in – in tranc – peace and tranquility.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Were you able to voice your fears to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I don’t recall that I had any fears.</span> <span id="s151">I suspect that my parents probably were anxious to – limited my fears to the maximum possible, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Did you talk things over with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No, we were a little bit – we were apart – five years apart.</span> <span id="s154">I would say that communication is prob – was probably more – even more difficult tha-than with my parents, because the – the – the five year age difference between the youngsters is – is pretty substantial.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So, after the year was over, then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, in 1934, I believe it was, the French, having received a large number of refugees – at this point we had largely given up our business in Freiburg in Germany, and still had the business in Switzerland and in France.</span> <span id="s157">At that point I believe it was that the French authorities basically said to the refugees in – many had settled along the border here, that it was necessary for them to go inland a certain distance, or to leave.</span> <span id="s158">In other words, residence along the border was not – was frowned upon, or in fact, forbidden.</span> <span id="s159">And so my parents really had a choice to make; do they want to go inland?</span> <span id="s160">And is – if I remember correctly, I think the closest they could go to would be the city – the town of Merceuil or, do they want to leave – and, which would of course made pretty well impossible the business – maintaining the business in Switzerland, and while he – to a certain extent, the business in France, which was also very close to the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So your father was still actively working at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Oh yes, we – we still had our business.</span> <span id="s163">And so we packed up and moved back to Germany.</span> <span id="s164">And we did not move back to Freiburg, we moved to a town called Loerrach, l-o-e – double r-a-c-h.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Is that near Freiburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: That is – well, everything is n – well, a-again, it’s one of those things that today it’s very close, in the old days it was quite far.</span> <span id="s167">It’s only about two miles from the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s168">It was about three miles as the crow flies from Saint-Louis.</span> <span id="s169">In other words, they were all [indecipherable] or not, at the point where the – the Rhine River makes its bend, where the free countries meet.</span> <span id="s170">It was about, oh I would say, 40 - 50 miles from Freiburg.</span> <span id="s171">So we – we got back there fairly frequently, but it – it still – in those days it was a fairly long distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Was it hard going over the borders at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: No, it was quite easy.</span> <span id="s174">A-Again, for a time we lived in a guesthouse, a – a local hotel near the swi – again, very close to the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s175">I would say – as I say, about the mile.</span> <span id="s176">And then eventually moved into an apartment in the center of town.</span> <span id="s177">And that must have been either 1934 or early 1935.</span> <span id="s178">By that time my sister did not come back, or came back and then she was sent to a school in France, a – what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Boarding school in France, and she went there.</span> <span id="s181">A place called Remy Achmont(ph).</span> <span id="s182">And I started going to school in Loerrach.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And things started to tighten up, and Hitler was gaining more and more power.</span> <span id="s184">Did you have a sense of this tightening up?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, at that point things obviously started tightening up i-in – in many different ways.</span> <span id="s186">The business was still going, the German business was still going, although by that time I – I think the – the main part – we-well, the – or no, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s187">There was no more business in Germany, the business was largely in Switzerland, and probably to a much lesser extent in France.</span> <span id="s188">But we lived.</span> <span id="s189">It was a nice, large apartment in a big apartment house.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Was your father able to go back and forth to Switzerland and France at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">To – whether or not he went – yes, I’m quite sure he went back to France as well, but I do know he went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s193">And he would travel in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s194">I would sometimes go with him, and we often went to Basel, it was the ni – the closest large city.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Well, now you’re getting older and it’s, as you say almost 1935, so you’re 10 years old, and you di – when you would see signs on the street, derogatory signs or anything anti-Jewish, how did that strike you as a 10 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Well, you – you – you – you begin to notice things like this, but one of the things, I mean, in – in that part of Germany, anti-Semitism wasn’t probably quite as virulent as it was in other parts of Germany.</span> <span id="s197">In other words, the – in the s – in the southwest of Germany, I think people were slightly more relaxed, and I think this was true for quite a bit of time.</span> <span id="s198">And – but yes, there were obviously signs.</span> <span id="s199">I knew I was Jewish, I went to a German school.</span> <span id="s200">I went – first finished sec – f – well, by that time I guess I had – I’d finished secondary school – primary school, I was then in the [indecipherable] schule, secondary school.</span> <span id="s201">I had a number of friends, but it was – it was obviously noticeable.</span> <span id="s202">One didn’t count the certain problems.</span> <span id="s203">You had the normal sort of bully.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Such as?</span> <span id="s205">Can you describe an incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, I guess bullies are probably pretty well the same all over.</span> <span id="s207">No, not – nothing particular.</span> <span id="s208">I do know that after the war I went back looking for him, but he wasn’t there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Did they call you names?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No, not that I recall, not that I recall.</span> <span id="s211">I was not, you know, a – it was, again, I was probably rather introspective, I was not very good at sports, so even if, you know, if you – if they chose sports teams or teams for games and so on, I was usually one of the last picked.</span> <span id="s212">However, I do not attribute that necessarily to my being Jewish.</span> <span id="s213">I suspect I just wasn’t very good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: How did you feel about being Jewish at that point, when you know it meant difficulties?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: It was no – there was no resentment or anything like that on my part.</span> <span id="s216">I felt I was Jewish, and that’s the way things are, and I was perfectly – perfectly satisfied and no – no s – no special feelings about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Did you have any hobbies?</span> <span id="s218">You said you liked to read.</span> <span id="s219">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well, actually, at that point, mainly I would say I liked construction toys.</span> <span id="s221">We – the family often went out for walks, that wasn’t necessarily what I would have chosen to do, but that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s222">No, no other great hobbies.</span> <span id="s223">I did have a – at that – during this period, I ha – which actually lasted for a long time, I had a neighbor, next door neighbor, a – a young, a friend, an Aryan, German, with whom I was friendly until we left eventually Germany, and he joined eventually – he – I think he became a Hitler – member of the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s224">But you know, that was just one of those things that one had to do, or did, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So you felt comfortable in his house –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: – did you go play with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Oh yes, oh yeah, he felt comfortable in our house and I felt comfortable in his.</span> <span id="s229">I had some Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Was the school a mixed school?</span> <span id="s231">This was Jewish and non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Well, yeah, it was – it was the local –</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: [indecipherable] public?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was the local public school, and there was not a very large Jewish presence in that town, yes.</span> <span id="s235">So it was – it was – I mean, I – I don’t know how many – I suspect you had less than one percent or two percent Jews in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And the tea – the teachers treated you well?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Some – I would say yes, I had a couple of teachers who were, I felt probably went out of their way to be nice.</span> <span id="s238">That actually came, I guess a bit later, but I had one teacher who, if you wanted to, I mean – I don’t know what – you know, I – I – maybe I’m – I’m in a minority.</span> <span id="s239">I – you can find anti-Semitism anyplace if you look for it hard enough.</span> <span id="s240">That assumes that nothing bad ever happens to anybody who’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s241">In other words, you know, a teacher can be mean, or – or you can attribute to anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s242">On the other hand, they’re mean to other kids as well.</span> <span id="s243">So, to answer your questions, it wasn’t terribly bad, in th – I had some teachers, a couple of teachers that I would have preferred not to have.</span> <span id="s244">On the other hand, I had a couple that in retrospect, I think went out of their way to be nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Was there a picture of Hitler in your classrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Oh, there must have been.</span> <span id="s247">I’m sure there was.</span> <span id="s248">Can’t recall, but I’m quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did you have to salute him, or say heil Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, no, we di – we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: So when you would look at a picture of Hitler, any specific reaction on your part?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Gee.</span> <span id="s253">Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s254">It’s kind of difficult to – to – wha-what one felt like at that point.</span> <span id="s255">Obviously I knew my – my folks were having increasing problems.</span> <span id="s256">This became very obvious, a lot more obvious as my mother became more and more tense.</span> <span id="s257">My father was perhaps somewhat more relaxed, but my mother certainly became increasingly tense.</span> <span id="s258">So one picks it up, it’s not very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: How did it manifest itself with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, a nervousness, a sort of a – she, I think, developed stomach ulcers, had other problems.</span> <span id="s261">But for instance for – I remember for stomach ulcers she went to Switzerland to get treated.</span> <span id="s262">So it was still quite possible to go back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: And now it’s, let’s say 1936, and you’re just leading your life as it is.</span> <span id="s264">Did you hear about the Olympics then?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Oh heavens yes, that was – I may not have been very good at sports, but I’m a great spectator or listener, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What were your impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Well, I – I sort of had, I remember I sort of had mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s268">On one hand, I was still interested in the German athletes.</span> <span id="s269">On the other hand, you liked to see them occasionally get beaten.</span> <span id="s270">I – I didn’t – I looked at it purely or primarily as a sports event, not as a political event at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Did you sent – sense any anti-Jewishness among, you know, permission of athletes to compete.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No, at that time I – since I knew nobody – what I found out in the meantime, learned in the meantime is one thing, but at that point I did not know.</span> <span id="s273">I mean, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: What is it like for a 10 year old boy to see people on the streets in uniform?</span> <span id="s275">Did you admire them, were you frightened of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, no, and obviously didn’t admire them.</span> <span id="s277">But one had a healthy respect for – you can call it fear, or whatever it is, yes.</span> <span id="s278">And of course, starting about 1936, then things started getting tougher.</span> <span id="s279">As I say again, until 1936, it wasn’t all that bad in that part of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: In what way did things get tougher?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well, then of course things started with ’37 - ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: What were some of the restrictions that you lived under?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: None that I can recall, that we had particular restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did you have any curfews, or were you restricted to going to any places?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No, but I suspect they was somewhere my parents felt they weren’t – they weren’t welcome, and we wouldn’t go there.</span> <span id="s286">I certainly didn’t know of any place.</span> <span id="s287">I mean, I – I – I was aware of course, then came the Nuremberg laws about then.</span> <span id="s288">I was aware of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: How did that strike you?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Pretty weird.</span> <span id="s291">You – you – you begin – I wouldn’t say one begins to accept it, but one lives with it, and it’s amazing one does.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did you think Hitler would eventually just go away?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I don’t think I had any particular feelings about that.</span> <span id="s294">I mean, I would – I suspect, as I know a lot of people did, as perhaps my parents or my father did, and – but even that he – no, I can’t recall him expressing that, but I would – I wouldn’t have been – would – wouldn’t be surprised if he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Jews were then classified as second class citizens.</span> <span id="s296">Did you feel second class?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: No, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s298">I was living in a slightly different world, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s299">A world that was not in the mainstream, but it was still at that point, normal enough to feel that, you know, one – one – one just lived in a – in another group, which obviously was being – was disadvantaged to a certain extent, or being – being – oh, how should one say?</span> <span id="s300">Considered not quite on the same level, but I tha –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: But you didn’t feel yourself inferior?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: No, I definitely did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Any particularly frightening experiences in ’36 and ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, not that I can recall.</span> <span id="s305">Things did happen in ’38 which were obviously frightening, but ’36 - ’37, not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Okay, now comes 1938, and it’s the anschluss.</span> <span id="s307">Do you have any mem –</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: – recollection of that, or anything preceding that?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Actually, preceding that, I guess I should say, I was sufficiently aware when the Rhineland was being – being occupied, that my antenna sort of perked up, and at that point began to realize that there were certain problems in the air.</span> <span id="s311">In 1938 of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Before we go a little further into 1938, I – I just realized that your Bar Mitzvah would have come in February ’38.</span> <span id="s313">Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes, I – yes, yes, I did.</span> <span id="s315">I had a Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Please talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, it was a Bar Mitzvah, it was in – in Loerrach.</span> <span id="s318">I remember I got a bicycle.</span> <span id="s319">Now this was obviously not the most important thing, but it’s one of the things I still remember.</span> <span id="s320">Yes, and the other day actually, somebody showed me a picture of me at my bar – taken at my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s321">So yes, it was the relatives, to the extent that they had not yet left.</span> <span id="s322">Now, in the meantime I should say this: in 1936 or ’37, my sister – I guess 1936, my sister left from – came back from her boarding school, and then went off to the United States.</span> <span id="s323">My parents sent her to the U.S., and she –</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Ho-How did they get the – th-the papers to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, we had relatives – by that time we had certain relatives that had in the meantime, left Germany.</span> <span id="s326">And we had relatives who lived here long time, and she got her affidavit that way.</span> <span id="s327">And so she came to the United States, I believe it was 1936.</span> <span id="s328">We had some other relatives, an uncle who left there.</span> <span id="s329">I think they probably left in 1937.</span> <span id="s330">My mother’s stepmother – in other words, my grandmother, she left and joined two of her – one of her daughters.</span> <span id="s331">So the family at that point was leaving.</span> <span id="s332">In fact, the only ones that were le – staying behind was our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did your parents say why they weren’t trying to leave?</span> <span id="s334">Or were they trying to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Well, they were trying to leave.</span> <span id="s336">I think one of the key problems, of course, was having a business.</span> <span id="s337">The Germans were very reluctant.</span> <span id="s338">They were – they were perfectly willing to let them go, provided that they were sure that all foreign exchange had been repatriated to Germany, and exchanged into good German marks.</span> <span id="s339">And to convince them of that, of course took a long time.</span> <span id="s340">So I would say my parents probably applied for a – for emigration to the United States probably in – I would – my guess would be 1937 or early ’38.</span> <span id="s341">One of the problems, of course at that point is my father had been in the German army, had been wounded in the army, earned str – in fact, he had been wounded three times, he had earned the Iron Cross, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s342">And as the Germans were wont to say, the thank of the Fatherland, you can be assured of the thanks of your Fatherland.</span> <span id="s343">And a great many actually, I think, World War II – World War I killed a lot of people, and that World War II people, who felt that they were safe, because of the big to-do that the Germans always made about their World War I soldiers.</span> <span id="s344">In fact, the other day I ran across, in going through some of my father’s things, a certificate.</span> <span id="s345">In 1936 he received a special medal, which apparently at that point was being given to all former front line soldiers in World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Gerald Schwab.</span> <span id="s348">And you were talking about your father’s experience in World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: So, in World War – as I say, perhaps among former German frontline soldiers, the urgency, the feeling that they had to get out of Germany was not quite as great as it was among the general po – Jewish population.</span> <span id="s350">But anyhow, by that time, of course, then in 1938, a great many things happened.</span> <span id="s351">By that time the – I think it was probably in 1938 that the French – the Swiss started restricting access to Jews.</span> <span id="s352">This is when passports were stamped with a big J, although that may have been in 1939.</span> <span id="s353">I do know that my father started encountering problems of driving – of going into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s354">About that time, and again I can’t recall exactly whether it was before the events of November 1938, or after, Jews, the – the use of cars was restricted.</span> <span id="s355">In other words, things started getting pretty rough.</span> <span id="s356">In 19 no –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Can we back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s358">I just was asking about your Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s359">Were there any problems, did you feel any restrictions there, or were you able to celebrate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No, no restrictions, we celebrated it.</span> <span id="s361">It was not a big festivity, but it was – there was – I mean, one – one didn’t – you certainly didn’t do anything ostentatious at that point.</span> <span id="s362">But as I recall, it re – it was celebrated and it was – we had a –</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: So you felt comfortable going to the synagogue and participating in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s365">No, no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: All right, now – then Hitler marched into Austria.</span> <span id="s367">Do you have any recollection of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No – well, I have a recollection of it happening, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: What was your parents’ response to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I’m not sure we talked about it.</span> <span id="s371">I’m not sure we did.</span> <span id="s372">Keep in mind again, parents at that point were somewhat wary as to what they said to their kids.</span> <span id="s373">They really didn’t know – I mean, you were always – at that point, it had gotten to – by ’37 - ’38, it had gotten to the point where one watched very carefully what one said, and had to watch carefully what one said.</span> <span id="s374">Things change really substantially after around ’36 - ’37.</span> <span id="s375">And therefore – well, parents obviously alerted their children, as my parents did me, what I should or should not do.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, I mean, just watching what you do, where you go and what you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: When you say watching where you go, such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Well, you – you – you – you obviously did not go to large demonstrations or marches through town an-and – and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Were there many of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, not too many.</span> <span id="s382">No, not too many.</span> <span id="s383">Except the regional Hitler Youth headquarters was about a half a block from our house, and I remember Baldur von Schirach, who at that point was the head of the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s384">Yes, I remember seeing him from a distance.</span> <span id="s385">The next time I saw him was 1946 in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Was it frightening to see uniforms on the Hitler Youth?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, at this time you became more wary, you – you did.</span> <span id="s388">I mean, you started associating it obviously with – with certain events, things that took place, fears.</span> <span id="s389">Whether you yourself experienced them, or others did.</span> <span id="s390">At that point you started seeing “Der Stürmer,” Streicher’s newspapers on display all over town – various parts of town.</span> <span id="s391">And so yes, at that point things started getting – getting a lot – lot tougher.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Did you see any physical incidents on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: No, except, as I say, my one personal bully.</span> <span id="s394">But even that was limited.</span> <span id="s395">But yes, I would – I can’t really recall any physical problem.</span> <span id="s396">I do know that fairly frequently I would take different routes home, to get home, get out of his way and so on.</span> <span id="s397">I cannot recall they were being attacked, and I’m sure I would remember that.</span> <span id="s398">So – but you know, the-there was a definite fear there.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Did you feel German at that point, or just Jewish, or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, I felt both, I would say.</span> <span id="s401">Yeah, I would say you – you – you feel both.</span> <span id="s402">You do – you – keep in mind, we did not have that large or active a Jewish population.</span> <span id="s403">There was no Jewish area in the town.</span> <span id="s404">The number of Jews living in – in town, you could count on – on – on a couple of fingers.</span> <span id="s405">I did have, as I say, I had one Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s406">He and I got together fairly frequently.</span> <span id="s407">I would say I – actually I had two friends, one German, one – one Aryan and one Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: But there was a synagogue that was supported by the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s410">The synagogue was supported, and we would often go to Saturday morning services, certainly every holiday, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: What was Passover 1938 like for you?</span> <span id="s412">Do you have any recollection of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Now you’re asking something that I really don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: I was just thinking it was such a pivotal time.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, it couldn’t have been terribly good, because at that point my sister was in New York, most of my re-relatives had left the country.</span> <span id="s416">My dad’s ability to earn a living had pretty well shrunk to probably virtually zero, or certainly not much more than that.</span> <span id="s417">So it could not have been a joyous occasion, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s418">And I guess we said next year in Jerusalem probably with a little more fervor than we had in the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: And then the summertime came, what did you do in the summer of ’38, anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Gee.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t recall any particular time.</span> <span id="s422">I was still going to school, I was still going to the German school.</span> <span id="s423">As a small child, when we were living in Freiburg and probably early Loerrach, I used to go to a – a Jewish summer camp.</span> <span id="s424">But certainly not at that point any more.</span> <span id="s425">So I probably got into a certain amount of mischief and spent the summer that way with my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You said you had a Jewish friend at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Did you and he talk about what was happening?</span> <span id="s429">Was that something the children talked about, or were you just involved in children’s activities with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Well, I’m – again, I’m quite sure we were talking about it, but it was – I don’t – I w – I would say it was one of the subjects, it was certainly not the subject of conversation.</span> <span id="s431">But he – he and I got along quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Peter Wyle(ph).</span> <span id="s434">Peter and I got along quite well, we – we played together, we met after school, etcetera.</span> <span id="s435">If I recall correctly, he went to – I can’t recall whether – he didn’t go to the same school I went, I can’t recall where he went.</span> <span id="s436">But anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Were you a – a strong child?</span> <span id="s438">I know you said you weren’t that much into some physical activity, but were you – were you small for your age, or were you – look older than you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I was a shrimp.</span> <span id="s440">No, I was very small, yes.</span> <span id="s441">Actually I was – any picture you – I have, it’s hard to believe at this point.</span> <span id="s442">I was very small, yes, and very – and actually the only – I only started growing about 1941 - ’42, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: All right, and then you started school in the fall of ’38, and then comes kris – Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Then – then, of course, comes Kristallnacht, and the day my parents went off, having heard – I’m sure having heard that men were being picked up, being arrested at that point, my parents left town.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: How much damage was done in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: In our town not very much.</span> <span id="s447">The synagogue was – the synagogue was burned – was – I bel – yes, the synagogue I think was destroyed, it wasn’t burned or – damaged, trashed.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: When you saw that, what did that do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Well, at that point, of course, one was getting used – not getting used to it, I mean, this was just one of many.</span> <span id="s450">But more importantly, my parents left Loerrach to go to Freiburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: With you?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No, without me.</span> <span id="s453">I was staying in Loerrach, I was staying at home.</span> <span id="s454">And my mother came back alone, my father was recognized on the street in Freiburg and arrested.</span> <span id="s455">And he was then off to Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s456">Now that – at that point, things were obviously very bad, so I was at home with my mother.</span> <span id="s457">Of course, at that time we were – school was no longer – you – Jews were no longer welcomed in – in – in – in the local schools.</span> <span id="s458">So that didn’t particularly bother me, I wasn’t that great a student anyhow.</span> <span id="s459">In fact, if I remember correctly, I probably would have flunked Latin in that year, if it hadn’t been for that.</span> <span id="s460">And, but then yo –</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: So you didn’t feel cheated out by not having to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No, I did not feel cheated at that point, but as I say, my – my dad was now off in concentration camp, and my mother and I struggle along at home.</span> <span id="s463">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: How – how did she cope with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Well, under – under the circumstance I guess she coped very well, but she was not easy to live with, and I don’t see why she should be.</span> <span id="s466">I mean, you know at that stage of the game, the – the woman had a pretty tough time.</span> <span id="s467">I mean, I had it tough, but she had it a lot tougher.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Did she have enough money to – for living expenses, for food –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: – was tha-that ever a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yeah – no, that was not a problem at that point.</span> <span id="s472">And then of course, probably – well, it was about the middle of December, about five weeks after, we – I remember vividly at getting a phone call at 11 o’clock at night, my father saying he’s at the railroad station in Munich, and he’s coming home.</span> <span id="s473">There’s certain things that one remembers vividly, and this was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Had you any communication while – with your father while he was in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, we – we knew where he wa – I mean, we – he may have written once, but we knew where he was, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Why had your parents originally gone back to Freiburg?</span> <span id="s477">They said – you said they left you in the town and then the two of them went to Freiburg.</span> <span id="s478">Why did they make that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: To get away – presumably to get away, in the event – because word was around that they were picking up Jewish males.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: So they though they’d be safer in Freiburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: So they thought – so they thought they’d be safer in Freiburg, and of course, having previously lived in Freiburg, somebody obviously pointed them out to somebody, and he was arrested on the street.</span> <span id="s482">And as a result, my mother, who was not a very good driver – we – well, actually, she was, she had to drive home by herself.</span> <span id="s483">Come back by car, driving home, which must have been quite a – quite an experience.</span> <span id="s484">About that time my father was no longer able, even before then, if I remember correctly, he was not – no longer able to go into Switzerland occasionally; my mother and I would go.</span> <span id="s485">But of course, after that, no, that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: What did your father look like when he came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: My father was in pretty bad shape.</span> <span id="s488">He had frozen le – his legs were frozen, his hands were – had frost – heavy frostbite.</span> <span id="s489">He looked in pretty bad shape, I remember that.</span> <span id="s490">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: How old a – how old a man was he at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Well, at that point he was in his mid-50s.</span> <span id="s493">No, mid’40s, late 40s.</span> <span id="s494">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did he talk about what happened at Dachau at all?</span> <span id="s496">Did he tell you anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Not at that point.</span> <span id="s498">Again, that’s – you know, they wer – they – they used to be – there used to be a standing joke in Germany that where one man meets somebody who has just come back from concentration camp, and he said, how was – his friend asks him how was it.</span> <span id="s499">And the fellow who was there says, it’s great.</span> <span id="s500">You know, they woke us every morning with – with Beethoven’s Third Symphony, and then we had a leisurely breakfast, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s501">And of course his friend said, gee, that’s not the way my other neighbor tells it.</span> <span id="s502">He says yes, but he’s there again.</span> <span id="s503">So, you didn’t talk terribly much about it.</span> <span id="s504">This of course was the – th-the word – at that point things became terribly oppressive, and as a – as a – as a youngster you – you – you – you knew it, and you started – you lived with it, and you – that was – that was the – you knew you – one wrong step might be dangerous to you or to your family and so on.</span> <span id="s505">An-And that’s – that’s pretty tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Did you feel like a child then, or did you feel very old because of that tension?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, I feel I’ve really – to go to – in retrospect, I mean, we lost much of our childhood, after, I would say from – from age 10 on, there wasn’t all that much of a childhood – normal childhood, of course.</span> <span id="s508">We had one interesting experience about that time, and that is we had the Gestapo in our house.</span> <span id="s509">Now my experien – this is an experience that this was actually – may have been shortly before or after my dad was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s510">We had our books at home, and we – they came in and started going through our – our books.</span> <span id="s511">And they acted just like CPAs did, and it was perfectly – I mean, it was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: The-These are financial books you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s514">Our fi – I mean, this is what – this is what the Germans were interested in, of course, in our family.</span> <span id="s515">And so, you know, th-they were in our house, and they were – I mean, I can’t say pleasant.</span> <span id="s516">They were – they were – there was no problem, I mean, other than uninvited CPAs, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s517">So, it’s another phase of what the secret police did, you know, it’s – it was the financial secret police, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Did they take the books with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, they just sat there and went through them, went down there.</span> <span id="s520">They may have very well taken some along.</span> <span id="s521">But then –</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So now your father’s back from Dachau.</span> <span id="s523">Did his health improve after he got home?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, we – we did have a non-Jewish doctor, if I remember correctly, who treated him and his health did improve, but – and actually, I think he survived that – both physically and psychologically, extremely well.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Was that against the law for that doctor to treat you, the non-Jewish doctor, it was still okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, I Don’t think so, not at that point.</span> <span id="s527">And then in 19 – comes 1939, and about mark –</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Wha-What did you do with yourself, since you couldn’t go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Well, I guess the same thing I did during vacation.</span> <span id="s530">I mean, I played, I maybe went to a certain extent, etcetera.</span> <span id="s531">There wasn’t – I – oh yes, I did go to – I went to work.</span> <span id="s532">There was a Jewish printer in town, and I did – did some part time work over there, trying to ki – my parents obviously try – I – tried to keep me busy, which was pretty valid.</span> <span id="s533">And so I remember working – working there.</span> <span id="s534">This was a f – a family that I worked for, they had this print shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So this Jewish printer was able to keep his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah, at that point they still were.</span> <span id="s537">This however, may also have been earlier, just may have been in 1938, but I suspect it was probably in early 1939 that this happened.</span> <span id="s538">And then in April of – about April of 1939, I went off on the Kindertransport to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: How did your parents arrange that?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: You know, we’re still try – I’m still try – I’m currently trying to find that out.</span> <span id="s541">It was a – not a large transport, it was – especially since we lived right on the Swiss border, I remember I was picked up, I was taken by my mother, I believe, to the railroad station, somebody there on the Swiss side, picked me up, took me on to Zurich and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: How did your parents prepare you for that, t – and tell you that you were going to be leaving them?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s544">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s545">I do know I – no, I – I really – I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s546">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And you –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: We must have talked about it, they must have said this is probably the best thing you can do.</span> <span id="s549">It isn’t – since you can’t go to school, there is no Jewish – no Jewish school locally.</span> <span id="s550">There is – was no really that – terribly much choice, if you had a choice, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: And how does a 14 year old boy react to knowing that he’s going to have to leave his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, knowing that I’ve – I – I don’t recall that.</span> <span id="s553">I know how I reacted after I left.</span> <span id="s554">I ended up in a small, Swiss town, and I’m – well, that’s not even a good size village [indecipherable] in a tiny little Swiss village with a Swiss farmer who had just a little before that, lost his boy in an accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Had you taken anything special with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: No special toys, or books, or whatever.</span> <span id="s558">Did your mother and father say anything that you can recall when they – when you had to leave them at the station?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s560">Chances – well, at that point, of course, we all were trying, I knew w-we were all trying to get out.</span> <span id="s561">And so anything I could do to get out, and I have just recently found something that somebody gave me, a postcard I wrote from Switzerland saying please, check on – on – on the – the affidavit, which my parents needed, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: How many children were in your group, leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: That we – we were not a group, I was an individual.</span> <span id="s564">I was all by myself.</span> <span id="s565">No, this was not a big transport, this was arranged – in fact, just a few weeks ago, I ha – had a chance to meet with somebody else, whom I got to know there, and they are currently trying to find out under what auspices – I don’t even know under what auspices I went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s566">All I know is I all suddenly found myself in this little Swiss village with a farm family.</span> <span id="s567">And that – that was – that was tough.</span> <span id="s568">Here comes – I mean, here comes – comes the city boy, and he suddenly finds himself in this tiny Swiss village with a – out – out in the – out in the country, and it was different.</span> <span id="s569">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s570">I was not – I mean, for a while there I – this must have been about April, March - April I joined them, and they treated me like their son, and it sort of reminds me of the old story, I treat everybody same, like dogs.</span> <span id="s571">Not quite as bad as that, they meant well.</span> <span id="s572">They meant extremely well, and they were very, in their own way, quite kind, but they weren’t quite attuned to me, and vice-a-versa.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Did they have any other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No, they had lost their one child.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Wha-What village was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: This was a little town called Munch Altdorf on Lake Zurich, about 20 miles outside of Zurich.</span> <span id="s577">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And they spoke German?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Well, as good as the Swiss – German Swiss talks German, yes.</span> <span id="s580">Yes, they did talk a certain type of German, which I picked up and have retained.</span> <span id="s581">I stayed wi – lived with them, and then it came fall, I re –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: What – what was the family name?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Fuerst.</span> <span id="s584">F-u-e-r-s-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And did they – how did they respond to your Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: As best they could.</span> <span id="s587">I mean, they knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s588">I was probably the first Jew they’d ever met.</span> <span id="s589">And there was obviously no Jewish family nearby.</span> <span id="s590">In fact, I don’t think that – well, there was a Jewish family, these are the people I met again not too long ago.</span> <span id="s591">They were about 10 - 15 miles – 10 miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: But when you got on – you said you were the only child traveling, and you traveled alone to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s593">Who met you when you got into Switzerland?</span> <span id="s594">Or was there anybody on the t-train with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Oh no, there was somebody on the train, there was somebody who met me and then arranged for me to go on.</span> <span id="s596">I don’t recall whether they went with me, and I was sort of passed on from one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So you were never by yourself until you got to the family.</span> <span id="s598">Did you have communication with your parents while you were with the Fuerst family?</span> <span id="s599">A: Oh yes, oh yeah, I would write, occasionally I would call.</span> <span id="s600">My parents had the telephone yet.</span> <span id="s601">And we would be – we would be in touch.</span> <span id="s602">And it was – it – that summer, I remember I agitated for going back to school.</span> <span id="s603">The Fuersts weren’t particularly – I wouldn’t say anxious, but they – they weren’t – they – they just hadn’t given it too terribly much thought, and I didn’t – did go to a school locally, starting that summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Did you work on the farm, and if so, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Oh God.</span> <span id="s606">Well, let me put it this way, yes I worked on the farm.</span> <span id="s607">We did – it was – it was a dairy farmer, he had cows, a few cows, about 15 - 20.</span> <span id="s608">And so it was dairy, we lived across the street from the dairy co – the milk collection point.</span> <span id="s609">And yes, I was supposed to watch the cows out in the field, wasn’t very good at it.</span> <span id="s610">Couple times they got away from me, and of course they knew where home was, and they just – the fee – and the Swiss village, the village in the center, and then fields around it, and like most European farms, the f – the – the fields were sort of divided up.</span> <span id="s611">In other words, your farmer would have one field east of town and maybe another one north of town and so on.</span> <span id="s612">So we had these cows out there and every now and then when the cows wanted to go home and nobody came to get us, the cows just went home.</span> <span id="s613">I mean, I was not terribly successful as a cow herder.</span> <span id="s614">And every now and then I would trail the cows into town and shoo them in the other way around.</span> <span id="s615">I was supposed to lead them back.</span> <span id="s616">But, every now – and of course when they go, they won’t go in a straight line, which means they go across the fields of the neighbors and so on.</span> <span id="s617">We did a certain amount of damage.</span> <span id="s618">I was not – I was not a great asset to the family, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you miss your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes, very much so, obviously.</span> <span id="s621">I mean, as I say, these people tried very hard, and I – I – you know, you – you – you – they – they did it, they had received no pay, they did it purely in order – and I don’t think they did it in order to get another farm helper, I mean, that was not their – that – that was definitely not their reason.</span> <span id="s622">If they did, they sure lost out.</span> <span id="s623">No, they did it for humanitarian purposes.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Were they a very religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No, they were not.</span> <span id="s626">She was more religious than he was, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: But they didn’t try to convert you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: They definitely did not try to convert me.</span> <span id="s629">And then of course it was there that the – the ki – the social center of a very small Swiss village at that point, was the collection po – the dairy collection point, the local dairy, where everybody came every morning and every evening to deliver their milk.</span> <span id="s630">So if there were any announcements of anything, this impor – of importance, this is where it would take place.</span> <span id="s631">People didn’t have telephones.</span> <span id="s632">And, in fact, I used to have to go to the post office to make phone calls home.</span> <span id="s633">And it was – I’m – I must say also, I had relatives in Zurich, so I had somebody that I could be in touch with, it wasn’t that I was completely alone in that respect.</span> <span id="s634">One of the most – the things I remember most distinctly, and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming interested in history and politics and so on, cause I remember when – when the German Russian non-aggression pact was signed, I prin – I announced that this means ya – war in Europe.</span> <span id="s635">Then of course I few week – couple weeks later, it actually started.</span> <span id="s636">And the announcements for – mobilization announcements of course were posted at the milk collecting station.</span> <span id="s637">This is where everybody came to.</span> <span id="s638">That was early in the morning when we got up and by noon everybody was getting on the local streetcar in a – in a uniform.</span> <span id="s639">So, you know, Swiss – Swiss males took their uniforms home and their wife will sew them after doing their military service.</span> <span id="s640">So it was a matter of – within a matter of hours that they had – could mobilize the troops.</span> <span id="s641">Actually, the kids were mobilized too.</span> <span id="s642">I remember that at that point the swi – the kids were organized through the school, and I think I was part of the group that was supposed to help drive the cattle into the mountains.</span> <span id="s643">Judging from my experience in cattle driving before that, I’m not sure I would have contributed very much to the Swiss war effort, if it had of come to that.</span> <span id="s644">But it – fortunately didn’t.</span> <span id="s645">So I stayed there, but as I say, there were certain – the – we – we – we had certain, how shall we say, there were cer – a certain amount of friction between the family.</span> <span id="s646">I’m not – I don’t know who – to whom to attribute it, I’m sure I shared it, I probably was a disappointment to them.</span> <span id="s647">I was not being ruralized very quickly while I was there.</span> <span id="s648">And so I think in December of 1939, I was move –</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: What – were you still in contact with your parents once war broke out in September?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s651">Certainly by mail, prob – also later on certainly, but I remember making at least a couple of phone calls, yes.</span> <span id="s652">And then I was moved to another family, they arranged for me to be transferred.</span> <span id="s653">And I was then moved to a family, about December, on the other side of Lake Zurich, up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s654">A fundamentalist Christian family.</span> <span id="s655">They li – he was a – he was a gardener, and sold flowers and sold – an-and raised flowers and so on.</span> <span id="s656">And that was a totally different experience.</span> <span id="s657">This was a refined family.</span> <span id="s658">And again, absolutely no effort made to convert me.</span> <span id="s659">They bent over backwards to respect my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s660">And I stayed with them until May of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Were you hearing what was happening during – during the war at that time, what was happening in Poland, and others?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Oh yes, I became an avid newspaper reader.</span> <span id="s663">Have be – have been one ever since, yes.</span> <span id="s664">No, no, I ke – I kept pretty well up to date.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Did that put you more on edge, knowing what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s667">Well, you didn’t need that, but – but obviously then.</span> <span id="s668">Of course, one had no – what was happening to Jews was not at that point front page news.</span> <span id="s669">It of course hadn’t – also hadn’t started that way, you know.</span> <span id="s670">Germans were still – at that point were still encouraging emigration.</span> <span id="s671">And – but what was happening, yes, very definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: And also, while you were with the second family in – in meeting other people in their town, did you sense any difficulties cause you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: You were fully accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Oh yeah – well, I wa – I wasn’t there that terribly long, but the family certainly fully accepted me.</span> <span id="s676">And I did not – at that point I did not go back to school once I – having been up there.</span> <span id="s677">I think I helped them in – in their business and so on.</span> <span id="s678">I knew I would be leaving quite soon, or I assumed I would be leaving quite soon.</span> <span id="s679">But no, it was – it was my f – in neither place did I encounter the slightest anti-Semitism or – or feeling of – of – of not being wanted or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: So you felt safe in these two homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Oh yes, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s682">First one not necessarily very happy, but safe, yes.</span> <span id="s683">And as I say, the – the second family was totally different.</span> <span id="s684">In fact, I think they continued sending me “The Watchtower” for about 20 years.</span> <span id="s685">No, they – they – they – they were a lovely family.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: What – what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I was afraid you were gonna ask that.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Okay, it’ll come to you.</span> <span id="s689">So you stayed with them until?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Well, then came – then came the next thing, and that was in May of 1940, my parents were called to Stuttgart to get their American visa.</span> <span id="s691">And I went back to Germany to also get my visa.</span> <span id="s692">We got back – I got back to Germany, it must have been about the sixth or seventh of May.</span> <span id="s693">We went off to zi – to Stuttgart where the American consulate was located.</span> <span id="s694">I remember reading on the morning of May 10th, a German newspaper in – while sitting in the American consulate.</span> <span id="s695">There was a newspaper it said that a silly be – it was a German newspaper, obviously.</span> <span id="s696">But this silly rumor was circulating that Germans were amassing troops f – aga – against the western front.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab.</span> <span id="s699">This is tape number two, side A. And you had returned from Switzerland, and you had gone with your family to Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Well, as I say, sitting in the waiting room of the American emb – American consulate in Stuttgart, I was reading the newspaper, which said that foreign sources had reported that German troops were massing on the western front, and the German news agency had obviously said this was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s701">That was the day in which the Germans invaded the lowlands.</span> <span id="s702">So that was May 10th, 1945 –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: 1940 is right.</span> <span id="s705">1940, and that’s the day we got our – our visa.</span> <span id="s706">We then scooted back to Loerrach, stayed there I believe about two or three days.</span> <span id="s707">In the meantime, Freiburg had been bombed, the first German city to be bombed in response to the invasion of the lowland; I think three planes came over.</span> <span id="s708">And we were then, I believe, about the 15th of May we were in Genoa, in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Wai-Wai-Wai-Wait, let’s not go so fast.</span> <span id="s710">You heard that Freiburg was bombed, and you had been born there.</span> <span id="s711">Any thoughts, any reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, actually, we knew Freiburg had been bombed because the train took us through Freiburg, but you couldn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s713">No, not – not particularly, at that point I think I felt this is a pretty good idea.</span> <span id="s714">It was not much of a bombing, as bombings went later on, as I say.</span> <span id="s715">Three planes apparently came over, and since any time a place in Germany was bombed, it was bound to hit a hospital or a school, if you listened to that, and I think they said a school had been hit.</span> <span id="s716">But anyhow, very few people, very few casualties.</span> <span id="s717">But it wa – it was – it was – I didn’t feel any particular regret, let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s718">Interesting –</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: You didn’t feel regret about what?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: About the bombing having taken place [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Well, at that stage of the game, I certainly no longer felt like a German, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: What did you feel like?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Gee, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s725">I couldn’t – I d – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s726">But anyhow, what was interesting was tro – taking the train from Freiburg or from Loerrach.</span> <span id="s727">The train goes a – went along the Rhine River, going north before it turned eastward to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s728">This was the border between France and Germany and of course this was before be – this being the ninth – May eighth or ninth.</span> <span id="s729">This was during the days of the – of the so called Sitzkrieg and nothing going on.</span> <span id="s730">And you could easily look into France.</span> <span id="s731">And the French obviously saw the train on the German side, and nobody did anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s732">Going back, it was quite different.</span> <span id="s733">Going back, whenever you ca – when you came to – near the Rhine, the train stopped, and then you were bused to a place where the Rhine – no longer the border, or the train was no longer within view of the tra – of the – the – the French military.</span> <span id="s734">In other words, they finally started shooting at each other a little bit.</span> <span id="s735">And this started on the 10th of May, of course.</span> <span id="s736">But anyhow, we went back to Loerrach.</span> <span id="s737">Presumably – I can’t recall, but we collected some effects, things had been packed already and so on, and – what hadn’t been sold or given away.</span> <span id="s738">And we went off, over the Brenner Pass to Italy, to Genoa, and I think we arrived there about the 15th.</span> <span id="s739">Now one of the things that had been – we also did while we were in Stuttgart was, my father went to the Italian consulate to get a visa for Italy.</span> <span id="s740">He speeded things up by making a quote, charitable contribution, unquote, to some Italian charity, and he got his visa the same day.</span> <span id="s741">This was on the 10th of May.</span> <span id="s742">And by the 15th we were in Italy, and by the 18th we were aboard ship, on our way to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Was this a very stressful journey for you, the wa – going through ital – you know, the Brenner Pass in-into Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Stressful – well, until you were – you were across the border, obviously at that point, I mean, yes.</span> <span id="s745">You were stressful if – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: What were the border crossings like?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: I – nothing.</span> <span id="s748">I mean, it was – it was like any border, it was a border crossing in Europe in the old days.</span> <span id="s749">It was a fairly careful control, but that was – that was something one was used to.</span> <span id="s750">In other words, the – the days of easy – this was not the days of easy border crossings for anybody.</span> <span id="s751">And so they would check the luggage, and they would check the passports, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Did your parents give you any advice about what to say, or what not to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I’m sure my parents did.</span> <span id="s754">I don’t recall what it was, but I’m sure they did.</span> <span id="s755">But you learn, by that point, not to open your mouth unnecessarily, even though that was difficult sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So you said you were happy to leave the country of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Oh yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s758">Yeah, at this point, I mean, it may have been the – the country of my birth, but I certainly had no warm feelings towards it, that – that’s the nature of the game.</span> <span id="s759">Th-The events of the past two or three years had pretty well taken care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Had your awareness of being Jewish intensified at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I don’t think that there was any need for that, or – or – I mean one – it was part of one’s make-up, and I would say no, probably not.</span> <span id="s762">But it hadn’t decreased either, I mean, it hadn’t – it had stayed pretty – pretty well the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So now you get on the boat to come to the United States, which boat was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Which what?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: What was the name of the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: The George Washington.</span> <span id="s767">Good name.</span> <span id="s768">And of course, while we were in the high seas, Italy –</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: What – what line was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: It was a U.S. line, I guess United States line, I’m not sure, but – and while we were in the high seas, of course, Italy declared war on France, which would have cut that route off, so it was the last ship, or one of the very last ships to leave Italy for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Were there many other Jewish refugees on the boat with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes, I believe – well, there were quite – I would say there were a number of them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did you all stay together?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s775">I wa – I was too busy exploring the ship and so on.</span> <span id="s776">I mean, I was the – I was rather inquisitive and there was – there was too much to be – to be explored, too many things to be done, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Were there many other teenagers?</span> <span id="s778">You were 15 years old, were there many other children your age bracket?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s780">I mean, we were not – we – I – I believe there were, and – but I don’t – really don’t recall any specific group or people or so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: What countries did the other refugees come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No idea.</span> <span id="s783">Don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: And so how long was the voyage?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Well, in those days it probably was seven to eight days.</span> <span id="s786">Got to New York –</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What was that – what was that like to put your feet on – what – what had you – been your thoughts on the United States by the – at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Well, it was – it was recognition of a new beginning, it was a recognition of it being something totally different.</span> <span id="s789">And it was – it was an on – a – a new adventure, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Was it very emotional for your parents to put their feet down on – on the American ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: You mean at the very beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Yeah, o-on – upon arrival.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: No – yeah – no, I think at that point they had cut their – they – they had emotionally cut their ties with Germany, with – you know, completely.</span> <span id="s794">I mean, they – they did not pine for the old country, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s795">No, they – they were ready to make the change and they – they – they were ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: What was your first sight of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I think it probably was the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island or whatever.</span> <span id="s798">But – and then of course it did – it was – it was all a – a – sort of a blur at that point.</span> <span id="s799">Of course, we were met by all our relatives, who in the meantime had gotten together in New York.</span> <span id="s800">They als –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: This is wha-what day in May 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: What – what day in May of 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Well, it must have been around the 27th, 28th of May.</span> <span id="s805">And they met us, and then we moved in with one of my uncles and aunts – one of my uncle and aunt, who they had come to the U.S. earlier, and that’s where we went first of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: This is in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: In the – in New York City, in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s808">Very much in the Bronx, yes.</span> <span id="s809">And then it was a matter, of course, getting acclimated, or getting acclimated and getting used to this city.</span> <span id="s810">I mean, you have to keep in mind, Freiburg is a sm – is a town, Loerrach is a small town.</span> <span id="s811">The places I was in Switzerland were tiny villages, and then you had New York.</span> <span id="s812">So it wa – it was – it’s a shock to the system, but not a negative one, it’s just a plain shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Did you know any English at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s815">I did try out a new word on one of my cousins, took me down to the street and I can’t recall what it was, we met some kids down on the street in front of the house, in front of the apartment building, and I tried out another word, and that’s when I discovered that that probably was not the appropriate one, because he just hit me in the side of the head.</span> <span id="s816">I got a nice big lump on the side of my head.</span> <span id="s817">My mother almost fainted when she saw it.</span> <span id="s818">It looked a lot – I’m sure it looked a lot worse than it was.</span> <span id="s819">But anyhow it – he taught me very quickly that words and language, necessarily – just because you know the word does not necessarily mean that it’s appropriate.</span> <span id="s820">Then of course, I think we stayed there about two weeks and then something happened to me that was probably of great value to me.</span> <span id="s821">I had another uncle and aunt – an aunt.</span> <span id="s822">She had come to the United States already in the 20s, so they both had come to the States in the 20s.</span> <span id="s823">And they were great outdoors people, they loved hiking.</span> <span id="s824">And they took me, within about two weeks of arriving in the States, they took me out for a two week hike in the mountains, in the Adirondacks or someplace, and told everybody, or every one of their friends to talk only English to me.</span> <span id="s825">So this was what we would today call deep immersion, and it was great because after two weeks I had a fairly decent command of the language.</span> <span id="s826">That – you know, the – it was – it was a little rough at the time, because you get frustrated in going through it, but in retrospect, or even at that point, I mean, immediately afterwards, or even at the time, you recognize that this is the way to go.</span> <span id="s827">And then things happened fairly quickly after the – went in fairly rapid succession.</span> <span id="s828">I remember my mother went to work in one of the New York sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where one of my aunts worked, and she – that was her first job.</span> <span id="s829">That’s one the real, I wouldn’t say untold stories, but it’s one of the things that I must say we have not given quite enough recognition to it, although I’m sure it happens even today that some of these people make these changes and they’re tremendous.</span> <span id="s830">I mean, adapted in ways that is unimaginable perhaps to us today.</span> <span id="s831">Although I’m sure that a lot of ref – other refugees, refugees today, who may be doing the same thing I do.</span> <span id="s832">Anyhow, my mother went to – did this – did – became a sewing machine operator.</span> <span id="s833">And then we moved to Long Branch, New Jersey, where I went to school, and my mother and father worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family, with a New York lawyer.</span> <span id="s834">And, now, it was amazing that my mother could do it, but the fact that my father suddenly became a sort of handymaid – handyman-chauffeur and jack-of-all-trades was also quite amazing.</span> <span id="s835">And we stayed there, I remember I went to school there.</span> <span id="s836">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Were you accepted by the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: They didn’t tease you about an accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Well, well, no.</span> <span id="s841">One reason of course was when you enter a school at the middle of the year and so on, and most of these schools, there are already groups and cliques, you’re – you’re pretty well on your own.</span> <span id="s842">Kids don’t really take terribly much notice of you, unless you want to be noticed.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Were you hearing about what was happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, at that point I certainly did.</span> <span id="s845">I was an avid newspaper reader, listening to the radio and so on.</span> <span id="s846">Beside going to school, I worked.</span> <span id="s847">I became a – setting up pins in a bowling alley.</span> <span id="s848">Those were the days before the automatic pinsetters.</span> <span id="s849">Broke a finger in the process, you catch it between two bowling balls.</span> <span id="s850">It was a fairly dangerous sport.</span> <span id="s851">I worked on the beach in Long Branch, dishing out ice cream during the summer.</span> <span id="s852">That sort of thing.</span> <span id="s853">And then my parents, I think this family no longer could afford a couple – he – they were – he had once run as ri – congressman in a – for congress in a heavily democratic district in New York – of course, he was a republican, so he only ran, he never did get – he didn’t get elected.</span> <span id="s854">He was – they were – seemed to be very nice people.</span> <span id="s855">And at that point my parents then went and went to a training school, run by either the Joint or somebody like that, and they became farmers.</span> <span id="s856">They became in poultry farming.</span> <span id="s857">Now this wasn’t quite as wi – far removed as being a butler and a handyman, because my parents, the town they had come from, the parents, the – their parents were involved in – in cattle dealing and so on.</span> <span id="s858">So it was a farm community.</span> <span id="s859">And lo and behold, after they – they did this and I think they went through training, there was a training unit near [indecipherable] New Jersey, and – or Bound Brook, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s860">And after that, they – with the aid of – of the Joint, they bought a poultry farm in a place, in Cranberry, New Jersey, which is next to Hightstown, which is near Princeton.</span> <span id="s861">And that was in 19 – that must have been in 19 early ‘40 – I guess late ‘40 – middle ’41.</span> <span id="s862">And they then – I went to school there, and they had the poultry farm there.</span> <span id="s863">I went to Hightstown first – well, now I actually – I guess I went to Hightstown High.</span> <span id="s864">Must have been in the fall of 19 – hm.</span> <span id="s865">No, we – yeah, must have been in spring of 1941, because we were already there when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s866">Well, it – certainly in ’41.</span> <span id="s867">I went to high school there, had a – you know, I was – I was a new kid in town, it was pleasant enough.</span> <span id="s868">I went to Hightstown High.</span> <span id="s869">Had no untoward experiences there except apparently the English teacher told another class that she didn’t believe what I was saying about having left Germany in 1940, because my English was too good.</span> <span id="s870">And we were then there in June of – I remember in June of 1941 when the war broke out with the Russians.</span> <span id="s871">The German-Russian was broke out.</span> <span id="s872">I believe that’s where we were.</span> <span id="s873">Anyhow, in 19 – some time in 1941 because I do remember distinctly where I was on Pearl Harbor Day.</span> <span id="s874">And my folks then ran this farm, which at that time – this was the days before the cholesterol scare, and reduced meat production, so the egg business became a very – quite a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: And did you work on the farm with them, or did you just go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Oh no, I – I did work on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: And any connection with family back in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: No.</span> <span id="s879">At that point we really had – no, we were very fortunate.</span> <span id="s880">We had no close family in Europe any more.</span> <span id="s881">We were basically the last ones to get out.</span> <span id="s882">I mean, there were obviously family and acquaintances, but no close family, and there was no contact with anybody any more, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: So then life continued on with you til you graduated from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: No, I actually had two years of high school.</span> <span id="s885">I – til 1943.</span> <span id="s886">At that point my father prevailed upon the local draft board not to draft me because I was needed for farm work.</span> <span id="s887">And before too long I decided I looked like I was gonna miss the war, which I did not want to miss.</span> <span id="s888">And I went to the draft board and says, I’m ready.</span> <span id="s889">And actually then was called up and went – went off in – in middle of 1944.</span> <span id="s890">Joined the briga – joined the army, basic training, Camp Blanding, Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Were you a citizen at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No, I got my citizenship I think in Jacksonville, Florida while in the army, while in basic training.</span> <span id="s893">It was a – a-any day that you could get out of basic training was a day won.</span> <span id="s894">So, you know, it was great becoming an American citizen, it was equally great to get out of one day of basic training.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: How did it feel to put on an American army uniform, after you had escaped from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Oh, it felt great, it felt absolutely great.</span> <span id="s897">I later on wore it back to – even though it – well, we’ll get to that later, but anyhow I – I did wear it back to Loerrach, in the – even though that was in the French zone.</span> <span id="s898">I wore it in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s899">Oh yes, it was – it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So you’ve completed basic training, and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Well, then I c-completed basic training, I was supposed to go out and suddenly the army just ad – I was asked, just as we were shipping out to basic training, I was a-a-asked where my second pair of glasses were.</span> <span id="s902">Well, the army had issued me one pair, but I had never gotten a second pair.</span> <span id="s903">And I was heartbroken to find that I could not ship out with – with the people I trained with.</span> <span id="s904">They me – they were sent overseas and before long they were caught in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s905">I, on the other hand, stayed around for two more weeks.</span> <span id="s906">At that time they didn’t have this one hour eyeglass service, otherwise I would have also been probably in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s907">And I got, about two weeks later, I – my second pair of metal rimmed glasses, and I was off to Italy, and became a member of the 10th Mountain Division.</span> <span id="s908">And as I say, joined the 10th Mountain Division and was in the 87th regiment, E company, and saw combat with them in northern Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: So y-y-you were actually in combat, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s911">[indecipherable] We ended up, after the war, or when the war was over, we were in northern Italy.</span> <span id="s912">We were in – on Lake Garda when the war was over.</span> <span id="s913">And about five days later, while sort of trying to recuperate from what had been a fairly strenuous few weeks, I got orders to go down the Fifth Army headquarters, where I became an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: What was – do you think your experience in combat was different because of where you had come from, what you brought with you – you know, your experience with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Well, my experience in combat was different because we had a crazy command – battalion commander, who decided that patrols going out at night would be greatly enhanced by having a German speaker with them.</span> <span id="s916">And regrettably, we only had two men in the battalion who spoke good German.</span> <span id="s917">So either he or – or I went out in most patrols at night.</span> <span id="s918">I mean, I – I would go out and patrol with our own comp – for – for me – patrol for my own company, and for other companies.</span> <span id="s919">And then he had an accident and shot himself, or shot ca – shot himself through the hand, so then there was one of us.</span> <span id="s920">So I never needed to use – or never did use my German in patrol at night.</span> <span id="s921">But the experience, yes, I had a few interesting incidents.</span> <span id="s922">I mean, one particular thing, we were the first unit to cross the Po River in northern Italy and marching along either side of the road with the – in – in – sort of in a ditch, and I was at the head.</span> <span id="s923">I must say, I didn’t volunteer for these things, I usually was volunteered.</span> <span id="s924">And a bicycle rider came down the middle of the street, uniform, and coming towards us.</span> <span id="s925">And he came and came bef – I thought somebody was going to shoot the poor guy, because he obviously didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s926">And finally I jumped out of the ditch and went up and in my best German stopped him.</span> <span id="s927">And he started arguing with me in German because the 10th Mountain uniforms were very much like German parachuter uniforms, and he thought he had encountered another amer – German unit, and he was telling me that he had a very important message for the commanding general.</span> <span id="s928">Well, we were obviously very interested in that.</span> <span id="s929">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: So you captured him?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s932">And so we – it was – you know, there were some incidents like that, but – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: W-Were you involved in actual fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Were you involved in actual fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I – I ended up with the – with the – with the – with the infantryman’s badge, and all this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s937">Which was actually the nicest thing you could get in the U.S. Army, in – if you had to be in combat, because it meant 10 dollars a month more in your pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Did you take any German life?</span> <span id="s939">Did you take any German life?</span> <span id="s940">Did you shoot at any Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Did I that I know of?</span> <span id="s942">You know, war very frequently is, except for hand to hand combat, which we did not get into, war is very impersonal.</span> <span id="s943">So to answer your question, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s944">But that wouldn’t have bothered me one iota.</span> <span id="s945">But no, we then, as I say, after the war was over, I got transferred to – I was told to go on detail to Fifth Army headquarters and there I became the – one of the interpreters in Mark Clark – General Mark Clark’s staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: What city is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Well, the – this was on – in Gardone Riviera, right on Lake Garda, one of these great big magnificent hotels.</span> <span id="s948">Three months of it, a real tough life.</span> <span id="s949">And they had a German general staff unit there.</span> <span id="s950">The Colonel Schweinitz was in charge.</span> <span id="s951">This was a German unit that was responsible for getting the Germans out of the northern Italian Alps to surrender, and to organize it.</span> <span id="s952">And so they had – they had a staff there, and I was basically the interpreter between the Americans and the Germans there.</span> <span id="s953">American units and German units.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: You are what, 20 years old now?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yeah, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: And you are interrogating these German officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Or transla – translating.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Oh yeah, I was translating actually.</span> <span id="s960">I was – I was interpreting between them and you know, they’re pretty high level in the German army, and they often wanted to know why I spoke such good German.</span> <span id="s961">I made absolutely no secret of it, and it was an interesting sp – probably the funniest experience there was, sitting once in the car between two – two generals, and at that time I’m [indecipherable] I mean, I had been promoted at that point to private first class.</span> <span id="s962">And I suddenly burst out laughing.</span> <span id="s963">Now, one doesn’t do that when one is a PFC between two generals, but I – I burst out laughing, and they both wanted to know why.</span> <span id="s964">And I said, well, it’s a pretty silly – funny situation, because the one man on my left was the German chief cha – chief chaplain of the German army in Italy, and the guy on the right was the chief chaplain of the American army.</span> <span id="s965">And I basically said, you know, it’s kind of [indecipherable] to have a little Jew in between you, and you need me to get together.</span> <span id="s966">So that was one of the more – that was – that happened during that period.</span> <span id="s967">My German was good, but it was certainly not technically all that great.</span> <span id="s968">It was, you know, 15 year old boy’s German.</span> <span id="s969">But it got me into some interesting places like the German underground communications facilities in Verona, where all the German telephone lines and so on came together.</span> <span id="s970">Then one side you had the chief American engineers and the German engineers and I was in between.</span> <span id="s971">Fortunately, when it came to technical terms they were able to – to communicate without me.</span> <span id="s972">I sort of filled in the gaps in between.</span> <span id="s973">But I was there for three months, and then was transferred to a – to something called USDIC, United States Detailed Interrogation Center.</span> <span id="s974">This was a – an interrogation group, which at that point was located in Verona, Italy, and from Italy we then transferred and we moved to Austria, town like – the name of Gmunden in upper Austria, where we set up an interrogation center.</span> <span id="s975">And most everybody in that unit spoke German, or a great many spoke German.</span> <span id="s976">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Were many of them refugees like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s979">I mean, the United States didn’t have all that many people at that point who were pro – sufficiently proficient in English and German, and knew something about German army, you know, ger – you know.</span> <span id="s980">And the USDIC in Gmunden was set up to this interrogation center, held VIP or medium VIP prisoners for interrogation.</span> <span id="s981">They were interrogated there, and we had a large number of cells.</span> <span id="s982">And I guess I’m not revealing any mo – anything that’s secret any more, but at that point, we had concealed microphones built into the individual cells, and I spent most of my time sitting with earphones, listening to these conversations, or recording them.</span> <span id="s983">Some of them were – some of them were quite interesting.</span> <span id="s984">And so I spent – that started about July 1940 – or must have been August, I guess, 1945, so – in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: When you say they were interesting conversations, can you say anything about that, or you’d rather not?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Well, it got pretty crude when you have two female German youth leaders talking about their sex life, for instance, or – all sorts of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Did they talk about Jews at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: No, at this point they didn’t.</span> <span id="s989">Not – not really.</span> <span id="s990">There was nothing – it was basically material that you wanted to give – provide to the interrogators, to probe, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: What was your response after the war when you learned of what had happened to the Jews, and the camps had been opened?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Well, at that point of course, we had – near where we were, we had Ebensee, the camp.</span> <span id="s993">Mauthausen was not too far away.</span> <span id="s994">Oh, I guess, what can you describe it?</span> <span id="s995">Anger, frustration, rage, you name it.</span> <span id="s996">I must say that this – I had great problems as far as the Austrian concerned.</span> <span id="s997">In my book I once wrote that what took Germans six year – t-t-took six years to establish certain measures against the Jews, the Austrians were able to do in six weeks.</span> <span id="s998">And it was – w-we got – the whole unit, I would say, got pretty sick and tired of being told how glad they were to see us, and how they had suffered under the Germans, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab.</span> <span id="s1001">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: In fact, we had a theater in town, in Gmunden, which was alternately being used by the Austrian population, a movie theater, and also for plays, and as a movie house for the American troops, the 10th Armored Division was in the area.</span> <span id="s1003">And we finally in – in – in – in the USDIC we finally got sick and tired of being told of how the Austrians had suffered, that we found a newsreel of Germans – troops marching into Gmunden, and we told the projectionist to play it in connection, without any comment, in connection with the next time he was – had a movie showing for the local audience.</span> <span id="s1004">And it was interesting, it – word got around town very, very quickly, and we didn’t hear this for quite awhile any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Then you stayed in that location for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Well, I stayed there until December 1945.</span> <span id="s1007">At that time I got, on two days’ notice I was told I could go back to the U.S. on R and R, rest and recuperation.</span> <span id="s1008">I had the requisite number of points.</span> <span id="s1009">You – you were given points by – for – for overseas duty and combat and so on, and they were taking people back to the States for rest and recuperation.</span> <span id="s1010">So off I went and came back to the States, surprised my folks, and then went back.</span> <span id="s1011">In the meantime I had decided I wanted to go to work at one of the war crimes trials.</span> <span id="s1012">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: You decided this?</span> <span id="s1014">Y-You say, y-you made the decision.</span> <span id="s1015">Why?</span> <span id="s1016">What brought you to that decision, or what factors entered into that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Well, I decided it would be a fairly interesting closure.</span> <span id="s1018">I mean, it would be an interesting experience.</span> <span id="s1019">And it would be the sort of thing I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1020">Now, I did ha – well, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Was this from a historical prospective, or emotional prospective?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: I would say both.</span> <span id="s1023">It was both.</span> <span id="s1024">But when I got to the States, and I remember I got back to Fort Dix, ready to get on the next ship to go back overseas, I was told, I’m sorry, you will re – you can’t go back overseas.</span> <span id="s1025">Why not?</span> <span id="s1026">He says, well, the – with the war over in the Far East, and all this sort of thing, the only way you can go back overseas is if you re-enlist.</span> <span id="s1027">Otherwise, you can’t go back.</span> <span id="s1028">Well, I wanted to go back pretty badly, I wanted to go back to my unit.</span> <span id="s1029">And so I did something in a moment of youthful exuberance, I re-enlisted, and signed up, and they changed the orders and they – I said, you – they – go back.</span> <span id="s1030">And I went back, came back overseas.</span> <span id="s1031">Got to Cherbourg, and there they had me going to some other unit in northern Germany or someplace, and I screamed and yelled as much as a – at that point I’d been promoted to corporal – as much a corporal can do.</span> <span id="s1032">And they said all right, they finally – I remember, I think I had to change a couple hundred orders, because they had about a hundred, couple hundred people on – on these orders to a certain place, and I had to go through each and every one of them and rule out my name; they let me do that.</span> <span id="s1033">And so they sent me back, they said fine, you can go back to your unit in Austria.</span> <span id="s1034">And I got to Paris and in Paris I stayed at the enlisted men’s billets in Paris, and this was – the gods really took kindly to me because when I was – I stayed there for two days, and I was then ready to go back to Austria.</span> <span id="s1035">I tried to get my duffel bag, and lo and behold, it had been stolen.</span> <span id="s1036">Now this wouldn’t normally be a tragedy except all my personnel papers were in there.</span> <span id="s1037">So I got some temporary papers, went back to Austria and of course I forgot to tell them that I had re-enlisted.</span> <span id="s1038">So I guess I’m a fugitive from – from – from military justice.</span> <span id="s1039">And got back to – to Austria, stayed there until – in the meantime I – I traveled to both Dachau and to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: This is traveled on your own?</span> <span id="s1041">Was this your first time back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Oh no, oh no, I had – my first time back in Germany was in – when I was still in – I guess probably when I was in Verona, so it must have been about August.</span> <span id="s1043">I traveled to Germany, and I traveled to Switzerland in uniform.</span> <span id="s1044">At that point you could go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1045">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: You – you had mentioned that earlier, so if you can expand a little bit about coming into Germany wearing an American army uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yeah, I sort of strutted around.</span> <span id="s1048">I went back to Germany, to my old haunts, met a few people who knew me.</span> <span id="s1049">Noticed that there were a lot of people behind curtains looking at this weird American walking in the street.</span> <span id="s1050">Keep in mind you’re in the fr – I’m – I was in the French zone, I did not look like a French soldier.</span> <span id="s1051">Wandered around, went to Breisach where my parents had lived and were born, and went to Freiburg.</span> <span id="s1052">Met – as I say, met some people.</span> <span id="s1053">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Do any of them – any of the Germans whom you knew – who knew you before say anything to you, especially?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Oh yeah – well, you mean, before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Oh yes, oh yes, especially in Breisach and in – in – in Loerrach, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1058">These were people who knew me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Were they welcoming to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Oh yeah, those people were.</span> <span id="s1061">The others stayed out of – I assume stayed out of the way because I didn’t run into any of the others.</span> <span id="s1062">The one person I looked for, I couldn’t find.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Did you feel like you belonged in these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Oh heavens no, I wa – I felt like a conquering hero.</span> <span id="s1065">No, I felt anything but.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Did you feel very – very American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s1068">About 150 percent.</span> <span id="s1069">Yeah, it’s – it’s pretty heady for a 20 year old, you know, I mean, it’s – when a want – when you sort of run at age 15 and come back as – as a member of – of – of a victorious army, oh yeah, it feels very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Did you go about it – back to Dachau because of your father’s experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: No, I went to – because the set of trials were coming up there.</span> <span id="s1072">And I went there and then I decided I would rather go to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Well, it seemed like the more interesting, more – historically more interesting sort of thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Was it painful for you to be at Dachau when – knowing your father had been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Yes, well, painful n – well, I don’t know whether you would call it painful, it was – it was emotionally wrenching, but not – you know.</span> <span id="s1077">But anyhow, I went back to my unit, arranged to get my army discharge in Vienna, and off I went to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: So you went as a civilian to Nuremberg, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s1080">I left the army in – in – in – in Vienna and – in May of 1946, moved to Nuremberg as a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: And what happened when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Well, you know, you were assigned billets, you were – they had previously gi – tested me, they had decided that I probably wouldn’t make a terribly good – which I agreed with – a terribly good court interpreter, or an interpreter in the court, but they did decide to use me as an interpreter where you had consecutive interpretation, and I basically spent all my time either as a translator, which means on written documents, or as an interpreter working – well, here I should digress.</span> <span id="s1083">The Nuremberg Trials actually had 22 main defendants, but in addition to that, it had seven organizations which were on trial.</span> <span id="s1084">Things like the SA, the SS, the general staff, the Reich’s cabinet.</span> <span id="s1085">The idea being that if the members of the organization, if the organization were declared as guilty of war crimes, then members above a certain level, or maybe at any level, would automatically be considered as – as guilty.</span> <span id="s1086">And now, since however there were too many people that either wanted to testify, or provide affidavits, or statements in connection with these things, separate hearings were held, in a separate room, before a public, but they were done in German and English.</span> <span id="s1087">And so you had, there you had, before a commissioner, the chief commissioner was an Englishman who later on met an untimely death as being a – he was a secretary for northern Ireland in the British cabinet, and his car bl – got blown up.</span> <span id="s1088">And so you had th-the – you had four, actually four commissioners; you had an American, you had a Britisher, you had a Frenchman and you had a Russian.</span> <span id="s1089">But all the discussions, all the ti – the – the testimony was in English and German, and instead of having immediate translation, simultaneous translation, you had consecutive.</span> <span id="s1090">But you had only one interpreter, so you – you had one person doing English to German, ger – and German English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Wa – were these additional trials called the subsequent proceedings, or that was something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: No, this was part of the first, main trial, where you for instance had – and you had actually then, decisions of guilt and innocence of these various organizations, like the German general staff, and by virtue of sort of concentrating, these were the people that were on – were being heard at that point.</span> <span id="s1093">I spent much of my time working with witnesses for the German general staff.</span> <span id="s1094">People like von Rundstedt, Kesselring, Manstein, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1095">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: So what kind of contact did you have, or was this strictly during the hearings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: No, this was one of the nice things in this, because A, the interpreter sat right next to the witness.</span> <span id="s1098">These were not defendants, the main defendants never came.</span> <span id="s1099">These were people that testified.</span> <span id="s1100">Some of them were subject later on to subsequent trials.</span> <span id="s1101">And others then were, for instance, [indecipherable] Dieter Wisliceny, who was – was what’s his name’s deputy.</span> <span id="s1102">Heydrich.</span> <span id="s1103">No, not Heydrich, Eichmann’s deputy was one of the people that testified, and he later on was sent off to Poland, where he was executed.</span> <span id="s1104">One of the nice things was that the interpreter sat right next to the witness, you weren’t separated by a glass wall.</span> <span id="s1105">There was no microphone or anything like this, and you had – could have conversations with him during the break.</span> <span id="s1106">In addition to that, your work as a – an interpreter usually, maximally you could do this for – it was for about an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s1107">It was fairly strenuous.</span> <span id="s1108">And you would sit – either you’d sit in the room itself, in the courtroom, or you would sit in a waiting room, and that’s where, usually, the next witness was waiting with a guard.</span> <span id="s1109">And so you could sit there and talk and – yeah, had some interesting conversations.</span> <span id="s1110">I had – Kesselring once asked me, Field Marshall Kesselring, he and I, we – we sat there waiting to go – go onstage, and he wanted to know where I – well, first – first we – where I’d been, and I’d been, of course, in Italy, and he had been in Italy.</span> <span id="s1111">Now, slightly different positions obviously, but we discussed military strategy in Italy to the extent that I was able to.</span> <span id="s1112">He then wanted to know where I’d learned my German, and I told him.</span> <span id="s1113">And his reaction was, well, that must be a great satisfaction for you to be here.</span> <span id="s1114">And I said, it certainly is, Field Marshall.</span> <span id="s1115">So, you know, some of these – Rundstedt once talked – gave his testimony, and he talked for – we had – we had told him, look, I can take about four minutes, five minutes maximum, but after that I can’t do any more.</span> <span id="s1116">And so he made a 10 minute speech, and then turned to me, and I sort of shrugged my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1117">And I turned to the judge, who in turn said, well, we can have the court reporter read it off, and then we’ll translate it from that.</span> <span id="s1118">The court reporter said, I couldn’t follow him either, I was hoping the interpreter could.</span> <span id="s1119">So we all turned back to Field Marshall Rundstedt, who then said – gave the exact same speech, broken into two parts.</span> <span id="s1120">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s1121">This man – I mean, he – I wouldn’t say it was rehearsed, but he gave exactly the same thing all over again.</span> <span id="s1122">So anyhow, so it was – there were some interesting experiences, the – the last head of the SA gave testimony about Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s1123">And actually, I prefer to call it pogrom of 1938.</span> <span id="s1124">And he was telling how the SA really was a, more or less a social organization whose main task was to protect Jewish lives and property during – during this period, during Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Miller.</span> <span id="s1127">Good German name.</span> <span id="s1128">And he was – was going on, and then came the break and then this man really was hiding behind the door when brains were handed out, because he turned to me, and he says, you speak excellent German.</span> <span id="s1129">I say, thank you.</span> <span id="s1130">And you have to be – you have to try to be neutral.</span> <span id="s1131">I mean, you can’t, obviously your – your – your job is to translate.</span> <span id="s1132">Well, you speak excellent German, thank you.</span> <span id="s1133">Where did you learn it?</span> <span id="s1134">Or when did you learn it.</span> <span id="s1135">So I told him when.</span> <span id="s1136">Where did you learn it?</span> <span id="s1137">I says well, you know, I sort of learned it.</span> <span id="s1138">Where did you learn it?</span> <span id="s1139">I said, in Germany.</span> <span id="s1140">When did you learn it?</span> <span id="s1141">At that point I couldn’t take it any longer, I said, up til 1939.</span> <span id="s1142">Which of course was after the period – and he finally, I think the lights finally went on.</span> <span id="s1143">This man had no idea.</span> <span id="s1144">He had no idea what I – who I was, or what I was doing, or where I had learned my German or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1145">He just probed until I really couldn’t evade the answer any more.</span> <span id="s1146">But anyhow, so the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: This man’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: His name was Miller, he was – no, no, wait a minute now –</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: No – was it not Max Jüttner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: No, not ma – who?</span> <span id="s1151">Jüttner?</span> <span id="s1152">Yeah, well, it-it-it may well – in fact, a-as – I’m checking with my book.</span> <span id="s1153">It must have been Max Jüttner.</span> <span id="s1154">He was – he was the – the former head of the SA was Lutze, who died in 1943 in an automobile crash probably caused by a strafing attack, and he sort of followed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: How – you said you had to be neutral, that was part of your directions.</span> <span id="s1156">How could you be neutral after what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Well, your job was to translate, it was not to make, at that point not to make judgment.</span> <span id="s1158">And you had to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: H-How did you keep your distance then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Well, you – you concentrated on – on – on translating and translating correctly, and that was difficult enough without making either sneers, sarcastic comments, or faces, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1161">You – you had to, I mean, there’s a certain professionalism involved an-and I don’t think you – well, I didn’t find that terribly difficult.</span> <span id="s1162">I mean, I may – might have had my own thoughts about it, but that was about the only time that I ever would reveal this to somebody who didn’t ask me.</span> <span id="s1163">And even he did, actually, in a way he did too, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Did you – did you ever feel that you just had to release your anger at these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No.</span> <span id="s1166">Privately, to my – within me, yes, but certainly not that ti – no.</span> <span id="s1167">But then – but then, you know, at that point, they looked – they looked – how should I say, I – an example was in 1940 – end of 1946, I went to Paris to see – to I – I – at that point I was already working on the subsequent trial – let me just digress a minute – and I went to see – went to Cherche-Midi prison, the French prison, which a number of German war criminals were being held, or potential.</span> <span id="s1168">And I had to get a deposition from two people.</span> <span id="s1169">One was General Stülpnagel, who was the commander in Paris from 1940 to 1942.</span> <span id="s1170">He – there were two Stülpnagel gen-generals, Stülpnagel; one of them was involved in the – the attack on Hitler, this was not the one.</span> <span id="s1171">And I think the French eventually probably even let him go.</span> <span id="s1172">The other was hama – Helmut Knochen, head of the SD, who was Klaus Barbie’s boss; probably one of the most hated men in France; the man who implemented the Night and Fog decree, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1173">Now I saw Helmut Knochen before that, in Nuremberg, and in Nuremberg it was very interesting because in Nuremberg the French prosecutor had a number of questions to ask him.</span> <span id="s1174">And he would ask Knochen and Knochen, who, by the way, had it – a PhD in linguistics, would deny that he ever heard of this, and the French prosecutor, man by the name of Monterey(ph) would pick up a piece of paper and say well, is this your signature or not, and the man would say yes.</span> <span id="s1175">And he’d ask him another question, Knochen would deny it, Monterey(ph) would hand him a document, says, is this your pre – piece the – is this your signature?</span> <span id="s1176">Yes.</span> <span id="s1177">Well, after that it was almost like Pavlov’s dog, because all that Monterey(ph) had to do is pick up a piece of paper and Knochen would admit everything.</span> <span id="s1178">Well, when I got to Paris, here was, in Cherche-Midi prison – Cherche-Midi Prison looks something like a – we sort of imagined French prisons to look in the 18th century.</span> <span id="s1179">You – when you knocked on the gate, somebody would come with a key about a foot long, and there wasn’t very much oil in the lock, and they would open it, and then you’d walk in, and then there’s a room full of French prison guards and one of – couple of them were getting haircuts, in another part they were – some were playing cards.</span> <span id="s1180">And so you finally get to this guy, you get to the prosecutor’s office, and they would bring in Helmut Knochen.</span> <span id="s1181">This was in 1946.</span> <span id="s1182">Well, they’d given helm – it was cold, it was December.</span> <span id="s1183">Helmut – they had given Helmut Knochen – they must have given him one shaving – one razor blade a month there, because he had a stubble beard.</span> <span id="s1184">He had a French army overcoat that was about four sizes too big.</span> <span id="s1185">He looked pretty sad at that stage of the game, let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s1186">He did not look like the sort of Aryan superman, you know.</span> <span id="s1187">So now many of the – you – you could – you could – you had to maintain your distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Did you have to do a lot of research to do this kind of translating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Only on German military trans – when I did the general staff on – on things like military matters.</span> <span id="s1190">And there was a certain amount of it, and of course, the German language being what it is, where you can take any two words and make a third word out of it, you were very often – and in my case it was a lot easier than in the main courtroom, where they didn’t have time to think, but, you know, you – you – when – when a group like the SA, the Stormtroopers were up, and a word like wehrsport comes in, wehr means defense, army, military.</span> <span id="s1191">Sport means sport, it’s things like hand grenade throwing, and forced marches with packs.</span> <span id="s1192">These were – these were like the – the military pentathlon in – in – in – in the Olympics, these were semi – quasi military activities now.</span> <span id="s1193">And then you were forced to make a translation of that into English, and the translation is extremely important.</span> <span id="s1194">I mean, you translate as military sports, and they don’t like it, because – but that’s what you come up with.</span> <span id="s1195">But there is no such word in the English language.</span> <span id="s1196">So, you know, you try to prepare for it, but you never could for everything.</span> <span id="s1197">I mean, you would – you would be blindsided every now and then by some phrase.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Did you have any contact besides the – wi-with these witnesses or defendants, besides the – the – the two incidents that you talked about?</span> <span id="s1199">Did you have any other out – outside contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Outside, or inside?</span> <span id="s1201">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: I mean, when they weren’t testifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: When they were not?</span> <span id="s1204">No.</span> <span id="s1205">No.</span> <span id="s1206">No, the-th-they were – they were locked up when – and I had no dealings in the prison itself.</span> <span id="s1207">We did have one interesting case, and that was when one man came up and that’s where I get s – blindsided by the prosecutor who didn’t warn me in advance, because they asked him, do you know anything about the Gleiwitz radio station attack?</span> <span id="s1208">Well, Gleiwitz – Gleiwitz radio station was a German radio station on – right on the Polish border, and just before the war broke out between Germany and Poland, there was an attack on this German radio station by Poles and Hitler gave it as one of the main reasons for attacking Poland.</span> <span id="s1209">And the witness, who was a member of the SD, German counterintelligence, said yes, I know something about it.</span> <span id="s1210">Says, what do you know about it?</span> <span id="s1211">Says, I was in charge.</span> <span id="s1212">Well, no – there are times when you wish that the prosecutors would let you know something like that.</span> <span id="s1213">They knew what was coming up, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1214">I knew from history what the Gleiwitz radio station attack was, but you know, this was the first indication I ever got that it was – it – it was a German a – attack.</span> <span id="s1215">I mean, you suspected it, but you never suspected to meet the man that was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s1216">So, there – those times it’s difficult to keep a straight face, but you try, you do your best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Did you ever hear any testimony regarding Jews and actions against Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Oh yeah, certainly with Dieter – Dieter Wisliceny, as I say, who was Eichmann’s deputy.</span> <span id="s1219">There were a number of them, but D-Dieter Wisliceny was the – the – was the – the most important one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: But then, what did he talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: What were some of the things he talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Ah, there I have to go back to my notes.</span> <span id="s1224">But they were talking about that the – the – the Wannsee Conference, of course, the protocol – I’m not sure whether the protocol at Wannsee Conference had been found by that time, or had been located by that time.</span> <span id="s1225">But he talked about that.</span> <span id="s1226">At that point, Wisliceny knew exactly what was going on, the court knew that he knew, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: And again, were you able to just keep your emotional level down when you would hear testimony about Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yeah, you did.</span> <span id="s1229">You have to.</span> <span id="s1230">I mean, there’s a certain professionalism involved, you’re – you’re there for – to do a job and it’s up to the court to make the decision, and regardless of how you feel, you have to maintain your – oh, how should I say, equilibrium.</span> <span id="s1231">You have to be straight and translate it just as it was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Is your translation then, a part of the official records, part of the official testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Some of it is, some of it is what was retained.</span> <span id="s1234">The – the – there wa – it was a record made, of course, at that point, of the – four commissioners then made a recommendation to the main court, and some of those witnesses that we heard, were then heard in open court as well.</span> <span id="s1235">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1236">No, it is, but many more da – many more things – things that I did subsequently, the next – working on the subsequent trial where I abstracted documents for future trials, and I still run across those in my research every now and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: So you – you were working on the documents, and writing the abstract?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Well, this was after I left – I left Nuremberg on the day – on the main date – the main defendants in the main trial were executed, and went to Berlin and then worked there as a junior research assistant in Berlin, in the Berlin document center, working on subsequent trials, on prep-preparing subsequent trials.</span> <span id="s1239">And there, of course, you tried to identify mater – at that point your job changed, you were no longer neutral, you were trying to help the prosecution to the maximum extent possible.</span> <span id="s1240">And you identified documents, and wrote abstracts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: How – how did – what were your thoughts when these wit – when these defendants were executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Oh gee, great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Was it a cause for celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: No, I wouldn’t say of celebration, no.</span> <span id="s1245">No, it was, well, fine.</span> <span id="s1246">I mean, you – you had your own ideas about some of them, you were surprised at some of the – the – the trial – the outcome, but no, I don’t – I wouldn’t call it celebration, but you – there was a certain degree of satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Did you sit on any of the Nuremberg – the court proceedings at Nuremberg – of the big – of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: The main court?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: The main court.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Yeah, I sat in the main court whenever I – whenever I wasn’t working myself, I would sit there and watch in the – in the gallery, oh yes, oh, quite frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: And you felt justice was being done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Well, you wondered whether justice could be done.</span> <span id="s1253">I mean, how can you – what – what – what does justice mean?</span> <span id="s1254">Justice means that an appropriate sentence or decision, or something appropriate to what had transpired, what they were guilty of, and that obviously wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s1255">But no, I recognize – I mean, the reason I went to Nuremberg, I re – I recognize that this was something which history would, rightly or wrongly, or – either applaud or not applaud, but would consider a major historical event, and there was – it was interesting being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Are there any particular defendants that you – that – that you remember, anything specific of any of these particular people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: No, I mean, I remember all of them – I mean, these were people whose name I had heard for a long time, and so with the possible exception of Fritsche, who was the propaganda ministry de-defendant, who really didn’t belong in this group, because the people who did belong in this group either were dead, or they were hiding out, masquerading as farmers in the Bavarian mountains.</span> <span id="s1258">He didn’t really belong, and he’s the only person I hadn't really – couldn’t identify immediately as to who they were or what they were and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: What was it like to, again, live in Germany?</span> <span id="s1260">You were living in Nuremberg, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Oh no, I was living in the – in an American or in – in a foreign co-cocoon there.</span> <span id="s1262">It was not living in Germany, I mean – it was delightful, I mean, the thing I went back – we – you know, when, for instance, I went to Freiburg or Nuremberg, you know, you stood on the – on the – on the – an apple crate, and you could look over most of the town, and you didn’t – you felt this – this is just the way it ought to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: You’re talking about the destr – destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1265">But, no, you didn’t – you didn’t live on the – I mean, you – y-you mixed obviously more than many other people.</span> <span id="s1266">I remember while being in the army in Austria I went to – I was in Vienna one time, and there was a show in one of the parks, and there was a – especially one of the things, one of the – the acts was a comedian who was telling jokes about the war, and half the audience was watching the stage, and the other half was watching me.</span> <span id="s1267">Well, I was in an American uniform, what was he do – this was in Germany, you know.</span> <span id="s1268">So you did – you did have a certain amount of contact with local population, but it was on a totally different level, I mean you – you did not feel you’re home.</span> <span id="s1269">There was no – no such feeling whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: So then you said you went to Berlin, to the documentation center?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Then I – then I went to Berlin to the documentation center, and I started – we started working, I remember, on the subsequent trial.</span> <span id="s1272">And the first one I think I started working on was the justice ministry trial.</span> <span id="s1273">And after working on about three months from the Ministry of Justice, we discovered that he had committed suicide two months earlier, but they had forgotten to tell us.</span> <span id="s1274">So that was a waste of time.</span> <span id="s1275">But – End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab.</span> <span id="s1277">This is tape number three, side A, and you had said that you had arrived in Berlin, to the documentation center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yes, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Th-This is October 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: October 1946, and for the next number of months, about six months, I was looking at documentation, at documents, abstracting things for the use in some of the subsequent trials.</span> <span id="s1281">This is where I came across, personally came across some of the devastating materials.</span> <span id="s1282">I mean, there’s the – the register, I remember distinctly the register from a – one of the – the German quote, hospitals, unquote, which were – were the mentally deficient or mentally ill people were killed, and I remember seeing the death register.</span> <span id="s1283">This was in the case of the – I think it was the justice trial, where the head – at the top of the page it would list the name, and it would list the time of death, and then it would list the place of death, and the cause of death.</span> <span id="s1284">And then under that you had a list of maybe 30 - 40 names, however long the register was, and ditto marks under everything else.</span> <span id="s1285">So everybody died at the same time, of the same heart failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Was this Hadamar?</span> <span id="s1287">Am I pronouncing it right?</span> <span id="s1288">H-a-d-a-m-a-r building –</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: I don’t re –</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: I don’t remember which – which institution there was, but it was one of those things that, you know, they – they had to fill out a death register, and this was the way to do it.</span> <span id="s1292">I mean, Germans were very precise and practical.</span> <span id="s1293">Law requirement was to have a registry.</span> <span id="s1294">And they had one, but they didn’t want to spend all that much trouble, to invent a new cause of death for each case, so they make ditto marks.</span> <span id="s1295">They gave the name and then a ditto mark under it.</span> <span id="s1296">This is where, as I say, so many of the – some devastating materials of that type were found.</span> <span id="s1297">Orders which were signed by officials.</span> <span id="s1298">One of the nice things the Germans did as far as the prosecution was concerned, was that every leading official had his own – had – had an initial.</span> <span id="s1299">Well, those are very frequently difficult to decipher.</span> <span id="s1300">But what was nice, they all used different colors.</span> <span id="s1301">So if you saw a blue initial, let’s say, in the – in the Ministry of Justice, you know exactly who saw it, and if you saw a red one, you know who saw it.</span> <span id="s1302">So it wasn’t just you – you could identify the individual, and we’re talking here at the top level obviously, at the sub-ministry level, and the sub-minister level.</span> <span id="s1303">And this is where, in going through the Ministry of Justice files, I had an interesting experience, because having lived through Kristallnacht, I decided this was a good time to look at some of the files having to do with Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s1304">And the document center had a lot of German employees, who we would indicate from registers what documents we wanted, or what folders we – what folders we wanted, and they would bring it.</span> <span id="s1305">And one day this gentleman brought me some files, I started getting some files having to do with – with Herschel Grynszpan and the – the Crystal Night events and afterwards.</span> <span id="s1306">And he said to me, I see you’re interested in the events in Paris in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was.</span> <span id="s1307">And at that point I had in front of me a – the future – the trial schedule.</span> <span id="s1308">The Germans had planned to put on trial Herschel Grynszpan after he had been turned over to the German authorities in 1941, after the fall of France.</span> <span id="s1309">And two of the witnesses were going to be members of the germ – the embassy staff in Paris, namely – I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at the front gate when he came in, when Grynszpan came in to – and the other was the clerk at the information desk who, in fact, took Herschel Grynszpan to see vom Rath, the German third secretary who then – and he subsequently went and shot him.</span> <span id="s1310">And this, of course triggered, or was used as an excuse for the events of Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s1311">And I – the trial preparation called for these two clerks to testify.</span> <span id="s1312">I asked them whether he knew Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph), clerk so and so, and he says yes, I knew him quite well.</span> <span id="s1313">I said, well, what about Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph) or clerk Nagorka?</span> <span id="s1314">He was the man who – to whom Herschel Grynszpan said whom he wanted to see.</span> <span id="s1315">This was a fairly important bit of evidence because of some of the – th-the arguments being made whether or not vom Rath was the actual intended victim, or the accidental victim.</span> <span id="s1316">And the clerk said well nag – clerk Nagorka, that’s me.</span> <span id="s1317">So that was a rather startling bit of information, but anyhow, he provided me the information that I wanted.</span> <span id="s1318">And this was a – basically the beginning of the – the beginning of my research for a book which I finally finished about 40 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Well, I guess we can talk later about what kind of information he gave to you.</span> <span id="s1320">Well, what did he tell you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Well, he confirmed – well, let – let me go back.</span> <span id="s1322">The question was, did – at that point Grynszpan was asking – this was in 1942, after he had turned over to the Germans of ’41, he claimed that he shot vom Rath for personal reasons.</span> <span id="s1323">And so the question was, the key question was, did Herschel Grynszpan ask for vom Rath in person, or did he just ask for a German clerk – a German officer.</span> <span id="s1324">And the answer, according to Nagorka was, he asked to see an embassy official.</span> <span id="s1325">And this was a key bit of evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: We’ll talk some more about that later.</span> <span id="s1327">What else did you do at the documentation center?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Well, we spend all the time going through documents, every now and then finding something of interest, identifying, writing abstracts, and sending them on to – to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1329">The – some of them were – at that point in Nuremberg, the medical trial was going on, but subsequ – they were looking for materials for subsequent trials, the Ministry of Justice, and various other ministries.</span> <span id="s1330">And you just sort of – either you were told, or you were given advice where to look, or you sort of followed a hunch, or you followed something, so – something followed a trail which suddenly opened up.</span> <span id="s1331">By far and away the mo – well, almost the most interesting or comprehensive trail led to the Reich’s Chancellery, Hitler’s office.</span> <span id="s1332">Because every time one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight, they would send an – a copy to Hitler’s Secretary of the Chancellery.</span> <span id="s1333">So there you would have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back.</span> <span id="s1334">I mean, when a peop – person like the Minister of Post got mad – or the Minister of Agriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him – accused him of having an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the Ministry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty letter, and also send a copy to the chancellery.</span> <span id="s1335">So that – there was a lot of information obtainable there.</span> <span id="s1336">But mainly, you would stumble across something.</span> <span id="s1337">Or, they would – somebody would identify a certain event, and he – you would dig into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: How did you get that kind of training, to do this kind of research?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: I have got no training whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1340">Let’s face it, I mean, the U.S. government’s just terribly short of people.</span> <span id="s1341">So you – you got into it.</span> <span id="s1342">You – you had a more than rudimentary knowledge of the German government by that time, and you just sort of – there was no training for this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1343">I mean, you couldn’t afford to have somebody sit there and translate this stuff to – for somebody else to analyze it.</span> <span id="s1344">I mean, some of it – obviously the – some of the people at Nuremberg, some of the prosecutors spoke no German.</span> <span id="s1345">So you translated relevant documents for them.</span> <span id="s1346">But you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: So you didn’t translate everything you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Oh heavens, no.</span> <span id="s1349">You only trans – you made a judgment and you translated what was import – what you thought was important.</span> <span id="s1350">But you know, as they say, in the land of blind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: So that was a big responsibility you had going through that kind of information, and trying to decide what was relevant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1353">I mean, sometimes you would – you had this supervisor whom you could ask.</span> <span id="s1354">We had a – a former German, who is now a professor of political science at some college in the east coast, and he was our supervisor.</span> <span id="s1355">So you could go to him, and – and say well, what do you think of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: How big a group of – of translators or – or researchers were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: I don’t know how many people were doing that.</span> <span id="s1358">I mean, we – we were a group, I would say that I immediately worked with about 10 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: What other areas were you doing research in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Well, as I say, it – it – whatever the trials, whatever subsequent trials, I mainly – we mainly did the Ministry of Justice, where, as I say, we found out after three months that two months earlier, our main defendant had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1361">But then his deputy was still alive.</span> <span id="s1362">Then you had the – you had the … I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1363">I don’t remember who.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1365">When you were in Nuremberg, did you see any of the well-known names, like Goering, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Oh yeah, of course, they were sitting in the courtroom, sure.</span> <span id="s1367">Well, every time you went – I mean, they didn’t have much of a choice, they were all there.</span> <span id="s1368">You had – you had – you saw them, obviously, on the dock.</span> <span id="s1369">The only people I really got to know outside was Hoffmann, who was Hitler’s personal photographer, whose daughter had married Baldur von Schirach, the head of the Hitler youth, who was on the dock.</span> <span id="s1370">And she often – so she was with her father often, and I had the opportunity, I had permission a – permission to carry a camera in the courthouse.</span> <span id="s1371">And so I would often talk to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Is this a personal camera, or for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1374">Yes, personal camera.</span> <span id="s1375">Came up, had qui – made quite a few photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Do you still have those photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Do these people look bigger than life, or less larger than life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Well, you saw them in the context that they were – were there.</span> <span id="s1380">I would say for the most part they were certainly not big in life any more.</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, you knew that they were prisoners, you know they were on trial for their life.</span> <span id="s1382">I would say the only one who – whom you might – not larger than life, but – was Goering, who – whose presence was – was – he wa – he was an imposing presence, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: What was your reaction when you, let’s say, heard he committed suicide?</span> <span id="s1384">Were you angry, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Too bad.</span> <span id="s1386">I felt –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Too bad what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: – that he cheated the – the hangman.</span> <span id="s1389">No, I mean, it’s – it was not anything – it was – I – I – I sort of felt sorry for the prison staff, who – obviously somebody’s – somebody was going to be blamed for it.</span> <span id="s1390">No, not – no – I mean, how he went really wasn’t all that important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Well, let’s jump back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1392">Oh no, you had also said that you had seen – you had said that you had seen von Schirach when you were younger, and then a second time in the dock.</span> <span id="s1393">Did he look any different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Well, he was a lot closer the second time, because the first time, obviously he had no – I mean, I wasn’t looking for trouble.</span> <span id="s1395">I just saw him out of the – out – looking out of the apartment.</span> <span id="s1396">And he was down at that – must have been about 1937 - ’38.</span> <span id="s1397">At that time he was head – head of the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s1398">He subsequently then became Gauleiter of Vienna, and so on, and it was in that capacity that he ended up in – in Nuremberg and got 20 years.</span> <span id="s1399">He was a lot closer then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: So how long did you stay in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Well, I stayed in Berlin until about March, I guess, March or April 1947, and then decided it was go – time to go back, to quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: What made you decide that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Well, I decided I couldn’t quite go on having only two years of high school, it was time to go back to school.</span> <span id="s1404">And of course, I came back about the time a great many G.I.s came back, or were back, and had decided with the – thanks to the G.I. bill.</span> <span id="s1405">And so there was a great deal of competition for places in school, and American colleges, which of course the attendance exploded as a result of that.</span> <span id="s1406">But I – so I – as I say, ninetee – early 1947, I figured I better go back, finish high school.</span> <span id="s1407">Well, do something.</span> <span id="s1408">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: You had not had a high school degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: No, I had two years of high school, that was it.</span> <span id="s1411">And then I applied to a couple of places, and I remember I applied to Rutgers University, and – but the one that I applied, that I finally went to, was the school which would admit me without finishing high school; they didn’t care, and that was the University of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1412">So in fall of 1947, thanks to the G.I. bill, because without it I certainly would – oh, I’m certainly would have gone to Rutgers, which was out of state college or university; I was off to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1413">And spent three years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: And what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Well, in Chicago, the old days of Robert Maynard Hutchins, you didn’t – they told you what you were going to study, you didn’t tell them.</span> <span id="s1416">It wa – it was an interesting situation.</span> <span id="s1417">They – you took 28 ou – battery of 28 hours of tests, and then they said here are the courses you have to take, and when you finish these courses satisfactory, you get a B.A. degree.</span> <span id="s1418">And I did, and in 1949, I got my B.A. Obviously I picked up something in between.</span> <span id="s1419">Then spent a year taking – well, let’s see, I spent one semester, after finishing the college of the University of Chicago, I spent one semester in the School of Social Service Administration, and decided that that was not the appropriate career for me.</span> <span id="s1420">I had nothing against the School of Social Service Administration, I just couldn’t quite see myself working with some of the people that were taking courses with me, and then switched back to political science, until the end of 1949 – ’47?</span> <span id="s1421">No, no, 1950.</span> <span id="s1422">And in 1950 then decided to go to Stanford University in order to – I wanted to – to do some research on the Grynszpan case and the Hoover Library of War and Peace had the best materials.</span> <span id="s1423">So I went out there, and then spent a year there gradu –</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Do-Doing research on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: No, no, no, I was – well, I got a second B.A. there.</span> <span id="s1426">Stanford University looked at my – the fact that it took me two years in Chicago to get a B.A., they were horrified enough that I didn’t finish high school.</span> <span id="s1427">But the fact that I only spent two years getting my B.A., and to Stanford, in order – the way to get your B.A. is to be in school for four years.</span> <span id="s1428">So I got my second B.A. there, in political science.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Well, then something happened which – you know, you hear these stories only in America, something that I still consider amazing, and which I tell some of my f – my – especially my European acquaintances about.</span> <span id="s1431">The State Department put out a call to all the colleges and universities for a special intern program.</span> <span id="s1432">Every school in the country was invited to provi – to designate somebody for an intern program – or nominate somebody.</span> <span id="s1433">And eventually, in early – you’ll have to pass something called a JMA, which was a – this was during the time of the Korean War, there was a freeze on federal hiring, except if you passed this exam.</span> <span id="s1434">And you – the prerequisite was passing the JMA.</span> <span id="s1435">Well, to make a long story short, out of the 22 people picked by the State Department, I was one of them, from Stanford.</span> <span id="s1436">And I still find this amazing, because there was certainly no need for this – the government agency at that point to pick somebody who’d been in the country only 10 years.</span> <span id="s1437">It was ju – I just found it ab-absolutely amazing, because it was a special program.</span> <span id="s1438">And so we came together, there were 22 of us from all over the United States.</span> <span id="s1439">And that’s how I then entered my first job, State Department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: And your career after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Oh well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1442">After that I joined the Foreign Service.</span> <span id="s1443">I joined the State Department in 1951, joined the Foreign Service in 1955 – four – ’54 – no, ’55.</span> <span id="s1444">1955 to 1957, I was assistant cultural officer in Vienna, then back to Washington for two years, 1960 to ’62.</span> <span id="s1445">The ama – new American embassy at Lomé Togo.</span> <span id="s1446">Lomé at that point was so new that most of our mail went to Lima, because nobody in the State Department mailroom really had heard of Lomé.</span> <span id="s1447">Then from Lomé back to Washington for two years.</span> <span id="s1448">Then to eastern Nigeria for two years, which at that point was on the verge of becoming Biafra, just before the civil war.</span> <span id="s1449">From there a year to Sierra Leone.</span> <span id="s1450">You ca – as you can see, I – I hit all the beauty sp – actually we di – we liked – we very much liked all of Africa, with the exception of sieral – Sierra Leone.</span> <span id="s1451">I guess we got a little satiated at that point.</span> <span id="s1452">From there, three years to Tunisia.</span> <span id="s1453">From Tunisia then a year and a half, almost two years to Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span id="s1454">Now, there was quite a switch.</span> <span id="s1455">From Bangkok, Thailand onto a year at Cornell University for a sabbatical, where – I guess you call it a sabbatical.</span> <span id="s1456">Then back to Washington from 1973 to 1976.</span> <span id="s1457">And at that point I was sent to – I was detailed by the State Department to an organization in which the United States at that point was not even a member, namely the International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1458">We went there for one year and stayed 10, and retired in 1986.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Woop.</span> <span id="s1461">Well, I got married while – in my last year in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: And is your wife also from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Yes, she is from Berlin, and I met her through somebody with whom I’m – I worked in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Let’s talk a little bit now about your book and your research on Grynszpan and what – what – again what inspired you in – in the course of your research.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Well, it was an interesting case.</span> <span id="s1466">I don’t – I don’t catcha – I – I – the book, eventually I named, “The Day the Holocaust Began,” because I do feel that the beginning of the Holocaust, or – was with Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s1467">It was used by the Nazis as an excuse.</span> <span id="s1468">But it was the beginning, it was the first time, really, with a couple of minor exceptions of centralized – centrally directed anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish activities in Germany.</span> <span id="s1469">And while there were obviously earlier ones, like the boycott of nine – April 1933, the book burning of May 1, 1933, but after that it was really these – most of the things that happened were locally inspired, or locally activated.</span> <span id="s1470">This, the events, once they got going, and even though Crystal Night was not centrally directed in the normally accepted term of the word – the wor – yeah – afterwards, it certainly was, and that was the beginning, to me, of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1471">I – I found this young man – the story, of course, is that somebody, his parents – a young Polish Jew, living in Germany, born in Germany.</span> <span id="s1472">His parents had lived in Germany since 1911, walked into – heard – heard that his pare – he was living in Paris, heard that his parents had been shoved over the border into Poland.</span> <span id="s1473">In – in late October 1940 – no, ’38, they sent him a postcard in Paris, where he was living illegally with his uncle.</span> <span id="s1474">He walked into the German embassy, shot the third secretary.</span> <span id="s1475">The third secretary, after having what to the ra – to those of us in the foreign service can only call a meteoric rise, within two days he became first secretary.</span> <span id="s1476">But he died.</span> <span id="s1477">And that was then the beginning of the events of November ninth to 10th, the night of the ninth - 10th of November.</span> <span id="s1478">He was held wi – in France.</span> <span id="s1479">Subsequently he said he had killed vom Rath because of the postcard he had gotten from his parents, and so on.</span> <span id="s1480">He then was subsequently turned over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1481">They were going to make a major propaganda trial for – in which there were two defendants, world jury and in an – in the form of Herschel Grynszpan, and they were going to try to prove that the shot of Paris 1938 was the same as the shot of Sarajevo some 20 years earlier, in other words, that they had caused World War II.</span> <span id="s1482">The Foreign Ministry was behind it, they hav – had to have some excuse, they were desperately looking for an excuse for the outbreak of World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: So how did you do your research?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Well, the research of course, I – I did a lot of it – I got a lot of it at – at – at Stanford, materials.</span> <span id="s1485">I got a lot of zer – not Xerox, Photostat copies of documents in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1486">And then in th – read an awful lot and research, got a lot of materials; for instance, as an example, the full Goebbels diary was at Stanford, or the – the Photostat of the entire microfilm was – was at Stanford.</span> <span id="s1487">Worked there, and over time, eventually actually, later on went to – met with his – with vom Rath’s brother, who was a lawyer in Wiesbaden, when we were living in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1488">Did – found the Frenchman who had done a great deal of work on the same thing, and exchanged documents with him, and this was basically how it worked.</span> <span id="s1489">I mean you – it’s a never ending thing.</span> <span id="s1490">And actually I had my first chance to publish my work in 1952 or ’53, when somebody in England heard about it, and I was offered that they would publish it, and in the State Department, being a very junior officer at that stage of the game, I had to – at that time it was necessary to submit manuscripts to a review committee.</span> <span id="s1491">And after talking to these people, they said send it over, I sent it over to them.</span> <span id="s1492">I had a document written.</span> <span id="s1493">And about four weeks, five weeks later I get a call back saying this is a very interesting – we’ve just made a couple of suggestions where we wouldn’t – since you’re now a member of the State Department, where it would not be totally appropriate, but we’ve marked the place.</span> <span id="s1494">Well, the document came back and it weighed about twice as much as it did before it went out because they put paper clips on all those places.</span> <span id="s1495">Well, they had a paper clip almost on every other page.</span> <span id="s1496">And what had – had happened was that the French Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, at that point was go – who had been the French Foreign Minister, he was going to testify for the Germans, or at least so the documentation said, was going to testify in this big trial against Herschel Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s1497">Well, by this point, mis – Georges Bonnet had become – 1950s – Georges Bonnet had become [indecipherable] to Franco-American Friendship Society, and it would just not do, saying that he had collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1498">And without it, the story wouldn’t have made quite as much sense.</span> <span id="s1499">So I put it away and kept it – kept it packed up for 35 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: And then what prompted you to wer – t-to bring it out again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Well, when you – when you work and you – the people usually ask you what are you going to do afterwards, you say you’ll write a book.</span> <span id="s1502">And then when finally it comes you retire, you gotta put up or shut up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Did you learn a tremendous amount by doing this research?</span> <span id="s1504">Did you come to conclusions you didn’t think you’d be coming to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Yes, very definitely did.</span> <span id="s1506">The biggest conclusion – first of all yes, you obvi – I obviously did a great deal of research into the era, into the life of the Polish Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s1507">I mean, here’s – here are – here are people that came to Germany in 1911.</span> <span id="s1508">In 1938 they’re shoved across the border as Poles.</span> <span id="s1509">You learn about why they were pushed across the border, and here you can attribute that to the actions of the Polish government as much as to the German government.</span> <span id="s1510">It’s a story that’s not too well known, but the fact of the matter is, it was – it was provoked by the Poles.</span> <span id="s1511">But the biggest thing that I think I learned is that to me Herschel Grynszpan to start with, was an assassin.</span> <span id="s1512">I don’t like assassins, for any reason, regardless.</span> <span id="s1513">And I was not terribly favorably well disposed towards him.</span> <span id="s1514">I learned two things.</span> <span id="s1515">One, before his probable death – in other words, we still don’t know exactly where he died, although we have a pretty good idea – this young man, from becoming a young, hot-headed assassin, became a true hero.</span> <span id="s1516">Secondly, whatever damage he did an – to Jews, which resulted in Crystal Night, I think he saved many more lives, or his act saved many more lives than the – the – the death that he caused; for the very simple reason that immigration of Jews from Germany and Austria started high in 1933, went down through 1937, early ’38, and then immediately after Crystal Night, immigration shot up.</span> <span id="s1517">So a lot more people left Germany as a result.</span> <span id="s1518">So in the end, he really – his act really saved lives, even though 110 - 115 people died in the immediate aftermath of Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab.</span> <span id="s1521">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1522">The book, and the research on the Grynszpan case, and when you did your research, did you interview his lawyer, or did you interview other people, and – and did you interview other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: I interviewed a number of people, I interviewed the psychiatrist, the German psychiatrist who examined him on behalf of the German government.</span> <span id="s1524">In fact, I visited him in a hospital in – in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: His – his name?</span> <span id="s1526">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: [indecipherable] there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: I interviewed his lawyer –</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Did – did you learn anything from the psychiatrist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: No, I got his medical opinion, which was reinforced by the documentation we found.</span> <span id="s1532">He found – he found him a sla – somewhat o – more than average intelligent young man.</span> <span id="s1533">Quite mature for his age, but at that point, of course, he had been in German hands for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1534">I should say this, that he was treated very well by the Germans, because he was a special prisoner, they wanted him for a big show trial.</span> <span id="s1535">He – and while in prison he was allowed to keep his hair.</span> <span id="s1536">He usually worked in – worked in the kitchen on food distribution, which means that wherever he was imprisoned, he had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1537">He was not, as far as I can tell, mistreated.</span> <span id="s1538">And when the trial finally opened, a decision finally was made to postpone the trial indefinitely.</span> <span id="s1539">Hitler personally described him, or said that he was his personal charge.</span> <span id="s1540">In other words that nothing was to happen to this young man without Hitler’s personal decision.</span> <span id="s1541">Now, it probably – whether it – whether it finally did happen, happened with Hitler’s knowledge or not, a – chances are he died at the – towards the very end of the war.</span> <span id="s1542">He survived most of the war.</span> <span id="s1543">But let’s see, we interviewed – or I interviewed vom Rath’s brother, I interviewed Moro-Giafferi.</span> <span id="s1544">Moro-Giafferi was the French criminal lawyer who was hired by Dorothy Thompson and a journalist group to defend Herschel Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s1545">And him I saw in Paris in 1946 – 40 – late – in December of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Did he give you any insights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1548">He was, as far as I’m concerned, he cracked the case in – as to what the – the subsequent argument or this – the – what the – the argument that Grynszpan used to avoid a trial.</span> <span id="s1549">Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan avoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan on the world stage, on trial – for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite the main newspaper people from around th-the – the neutral Europe.</span> <span id="s1550">They – it was a big to-do – was to be a big propaganda trial.</span> <span id="s1551">They had built a special courtroom [indecipherable] new telephone lines.</span> <span id="s1552">It was to be a big to-do.</span> <span id="s1553">And Herschel Grynszpan finally announced t – before – shortly before the trial was to take place, that he had killed vom Rath because vom Rath had made homosexual advances to him.</span> <span id="s1554">Now, obviously homosexuality is not what major propaganda trials are made of, especially if the victim was supposedly involved.</span> <span id="s1555">Well, when I finally did speak to hersh – to Moro-Giafferi in Paris, he – by the way, he was a – a man about five foot tall and five foot wide, who when I saw him the first time, greeted me with the statement that he had ever – only ever lost one man to the guillotine, and that was Bluebeard, and – which I said could be forgiven.</span> <span id="s1556">And he was the number one criminal lawyer in France in – in the 20th century; certainly the first half of the fu – 20th century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every – every major criminal trial, especially murder trials.</span> <span id="s1557">Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he says, well, let me explain where he got that idea.</span> <span id="s1558">He says, when I initially took up his defense – and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point was a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when foreign correspondents were still major figures, in – in the days when you didn’t have instantaneous CNN coverage and so on.</span> <span id="s1559">He said, I told – I asked Herschel why he had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what happened to his parents.</span> <span id="s1560">And I explained that this matter – Moro-Giafferi speaking – I explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards political crimes.</span> <span id="s1561">However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much more lenient.</span> <span id="s1562">And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able to confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in town that he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that there was a homosexual connection between the two.</span> <span id="s1563">Well, according to Moro-Giafferi, Grynszpan rejected this out of hand.</span> <span id="s1564">But then a few years later remembered it, used it, and basically said to his cellmate, they’re not going to make me – make another show trial out of me, they’ve done enough damage already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: What did you – what did you want to accomplish by doing this research and writing this book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Well, I just wanted to put it on paper, and put it in history.</span> <span id="s1567">I don’t think it’s that terribly important, because if that hadn't happened, something else would have triggered what happened subsequently, where there would have been a Kristallnacht, it probably would have happened differently.</span> <span id="s1568">But I certainly don’t think that Herschel Grynszpan caused it; he was the excuse.</span> <span id="s1569">And so I don’t consider this book as you know, that terribly important.</span> <span id="s1570">It’s – to me it’s an interesting footnote to history.</span> <span id="s1571">I don’t over – don’t want to overdramatize the importance of it.</span> <span id="s1572">It’s – it’s an interesting – it’s a fascinating life, it’s an interesting individual, certainly the way he turned out to be.</span> <span id="s1573">And as far he – he – I have the utmost respect for him, and I felt his story needed to be told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: And is your book the definitive book on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Until the next one comes out, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Can we talk now about some general questions?</span> <span id="s1577">Do you think you’re a different person today because of what you went through as a young – young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Oh heavens, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: In every which way.</span> <span id="s1581">I mean, you – you – you – you can’t help but be affected by these events.</span> <span id="s1582">I mean, if I had had a normal childhood, if I’d had different acquaintances, yes, of course we’re all – we’re all changed a great deal.</span> <span id="s1583">I’ve no idea what we would have been like otherwise, but there’s no question.</span> <span id="s1584">We’re more – I think more introspective.</span> <span id="s1585">We – we have a different view of life, more serious view of life.</span> <span id="s1586">No doubt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: You had said earlier that you lost part of your childhood.</span> <span id="s1588">Do you think you ever got it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: No, I don’t think you can – there’s no way that you can get it back.</span> <span id="s1590">And you know, it’s gone, but nerit – you – you – you – it – it – it affects you and it changes you and – and then also, keep in mind it’s not just what happens to you, it’s also what happens to the people who – that you associate with.</span> <span id="s1591">For instance, the people that surround you.</span> <span id="s1592">I mean, as an example, my wife lost both her parents at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1593">Being associated with some – with these people, the more immediate victims, undoubtedly affects you.</span> <span id="s1594">On the other hand, at the same time, of course, you appreciate much more what you have.</span> <span id="s1595">And I think that’s of – that’s a positive side of it, that you – you are much more appreciative.</span> <span id="s1596">You realize what life can be like and what life is like now.</span> <span id="s1597">So there are both negative and I guess, in a way, indirectly certain positive aspects to it.</span> <span id="s1598">But change, a change that, for all of us, are – are profound.</span> <span id="s1599">Or the – the – that the attitudes, or the – the – our feelings and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: You went through a difficult time when you had to leave your parents and you were in Switzerland, and you were by yourself with those two families.</span> <span id="s1601">When your children became that same age, did that bring back that time to you?</span> <span id="s1602">Is that a difficult time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yes, it – it – it certainly – it certainly affects you, you certainly think about it.</span> <span id="s1604">I remember sitting, of all the – of all the places, it really hit me when I saw “Der Ring,” Wagner’s Ring, where Wotan leaves his daughter surrounded by a ring of fire.</span> <span id="s1605">It really hit me right then and there.</span> <span id="s1606">So yes, there are – there are many times, and you try to guard your children, of course, from that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1607">One of the things I do when I do inscribe my book on the Holocaust, or, “The Day the Holocaust Began,” I usually write, may our children never fully understand what is written in this – what is written here.</span> <span id="s1608">So you try to protect them, but i-it undoubtedly affects your life, your attitude, your habits.</span> <span id="s1609">The whole – your outlook on life, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: What kind of habits are affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Well, I we – as I say, I would say mostly – habits maybe is not most – best word, but your – your – the way you view life and the way you live life and the way you take it.</span> <span id="s1612">The way you either appreciate it – appreciate it, or the attitude that you have to life, it affects, i-it’s – it permeates everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: Is it always on your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: No, not necessarily.</span> <span id="s1615">No, but it has shaped your mind, it has shaped your thought, and that is where the change then comes in.</span> <span id="s1616">No, it’s not constantly on my mind.</span> <span id="s1617">If it is I would be at – then it would be primarily negative.</span> <span id="s1618">But it has changed your mind, and that is where it comes in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Are there any other s-sights or sounds that trigger your childhood experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: You mentioned the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1623">Well, no, not really.</span> <span id="s1624">It’s – it may very well actually, you know, you do think of it at ra – strangest times, of course.</span> <span id="s1625">But to – to – you can’t really describe it.</span> <span id="s1626">It’s something that happens.</span> <span id="s1627">It’s not the same thing that triggers it.</span> <span id="s1628">But yes, it – it’s brought forth by all sorts of things, whether it’s a – a book that you read, a – a picture that you see, a – a – a story that you hear, all sorts of things can trigger.</span> <span id="s1629">Because it – while it may not be foremost in your mind, it certainly is very close to the surface, it’s bound to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Did you join the foreign service – did that – did the inspiration to join the State Department Foreign Service come from, in any way, from your experience of being born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: I really don’t know, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1632">I developed an interest in international relations and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: What was that – what I meant was it – was that purely intellectual, or because you had seen tyranny firsthand, did it inspire you to try to make a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: No, na – na – I wouldn’t – it can’t – I don’t think it’s possible I – my case, to trace it to that, no.</span> <span id="s1635">It’s – it was – it was an interest in – like intellectual interest and knowledge of – of European history.</span> <span id="s1636">And interest of – well, I mean, it’s – I – I – I don’t think – I haven’t really thought about this, I don’t think that it is traceable back to my experiences as a youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: If someone asked you – whom you met would ask you, are you German?</span> <span id="s1638">What would you answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: No.</span> <span id="s1640">Then it come – then it depends what – what the next question – no, the answer is no.</span> <span id="s1641">I will, depending on the questioner, respond and tell them what I am, or who I am.</span> <span id="s1642">But I don’t – I cannot recall anybody – I mean, keep in mind I’m – I’m fortunate.</span> <span id="s1643">I don’t have a distinguished accent –</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: I just meant someone knew that you understood German, or in some way knew you had some kind of connection to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Well, it depended who it was, the answer would be no.</span> <span id="s1646">I mean, basically, essentially, the answer is no.</span> <span id="s1647">I do not feel German.</span> <span id="s1648">I do not feel any special affinity for Germany.</span> <span id="s1649">I have no special affinity for Germany, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Let’s now talk a little bit about the museum.</span> <span id="s1651">I know you’ve done a lot of work in the historian’s office and so forth.</span> <span id="s1652">Could you describe your first encounter with the museum, and when you began work here, and how you learned about the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Well, I got involved with the museum when I went to see Sybil Milton in the historian’s office and wanted to see what – whether I get any comments or a blurb for the back page of the book, and I’ve been paying for it ever since.</span> <span id="s1654">I did get the blurb from Sybil, and she made some very nice remarks about it, but as I say, from that point on, I’ve bil – I’ve worked with the historian’s office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: When did you begin working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Oh, this must have been about eight years ago.</span> <span id="s1657">It was – well, si – it must have been – well, when the book was in its former state, so it must have been about ’89, so we’re talking about eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: And what kind of work do you do here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Well, on the Days of Remembrance book, it depends.</span> <span id="s1660">I haven’t right now, since there’s a change, I’m not working with them now, but we have been doing various things on the Days of Remembrance book that’s on the chronology, for year by year chronology of what happened where.</span> <span id="s1661">Then we have recently done some work in connection with the claims by American soldiers at – or Americans who are seeking restitution from Germany for incarceration in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1662">And so there’s a question of definition, what is a concentration camp, because it’s not always clear.</span> <span id="s1663">So we’ve been making – this is the Justice Department, we’ve been helping the Justice Department on that.</span> <span id="s1664">So there’s a wide variety of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: I-Is this something you’re doing now under the auspices of the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: And so what do you directly do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Well, right now I don’t.</span> <span id="s1669">I mean, we finished that particular job.</span> <span id="s1670">It’s usually either going – doing some research and documentation in the library, writing up the materials.</span> <span id="s1671">It depends which one you’re doing.</span> <span id="s1672">I’m – I’ve done quite a bit of writing for them on these Day of Remembrance books that they put out every year.</span> <span id="s1673">As I say, for a while there we were doing, in those books there’s a chronology, and – so you go back and try to find things that happened, or where they happened, during year X and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: You said Sybil Milton had asked you to start working there, but really, why do you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Oh, I find it stimulating, I find it interesting, I find – I f – one of the things, of course, I appreciate there in that office, is that they have usually a number of young people, young Europeans; German, Austrians, who are working there.</span> <span id="s1676">For instance there’s some Austrians who work there in lieu of their military service.</span> <span id="s1677">And it’s interesting to be around them, and to exchange ideas and see what they think, and so on.</span> <span id="s1678">It’s a fa – I find it interesting, challenging, I mean, I ge – I get a lot of intellectual stimulation from my computer, but not that much, you know, they can’t do everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: What is the response of these young Austrian interns when they hear your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Oh we – I don’t normally tell my story.</span> <span id="s1681">It – it – there’s usually somebody needed around there who puts a little bit of balance.</span> <span id="s1682">And I mean, you have the, on the American side, you have, for the most part, a number of people who know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1683">Then you have these young – relatively younger people.</span> <span id="s1684">And then they – the – there needs to be, or it’s helpful occasionally to have somebody who either was there or was directly connected, who can put a little bit, slightly different perspective on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: So you feel you bring a special insight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Yes, I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Has working at the museum affected your memories of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Well, it jogged it every now and then, yes, it certainly does.</span> <span id="s1689">I mean, you come across documentations, or things certainly, when you go back, you go back and do research on stuff that – things that happened, or came out during the – during the Nuremberg trial, or – yes, it – it – it obviously keeps it – it keeps it current, it keeps it alive.</span> <span id="s1690">Yes, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: You – you said a moment ago that you do bring a special – you do bring special insights.</span> <span id="s1692">What – what – can you give us an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Well, you can talk about the abstract – in the abstract about certain things going on.</span> <span id="s1694">We’re –really we’re talking about the Nuremberg trials, an insider’s view.</span> <span id="s1695">Not necessarily a – a – well, a – a sort of – a – a – well, a – how should I say?</span> <span id="s1696">An ide – whatever – well, I don’t – I – I – I really don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s1697">Basically, what comes with actually having – having experience that – or being around a lot of people who have experienced it.</span> <span id="s1698">I think – I think it – of some help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: You can flesh out the picture a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: If you have friends, or – or have you encouraged other people or survivors to work at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: No, it’s – it’s ga – that’s a highly personal sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1703">I’ve encouraged a lot of people to go there, both friends and acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1704">And I guess I think there are even – there are a couple of them that either are working there, or have in the past worked there as a result.</span> <span id="s1705">But I wouldn’t – I would not want to recommend somebody to work there, if it doesn’t come to them themselves.</span> <span id="s1706">It’s – it’s not the sort of place, I mean, that – I mean, it took me long time to take my wife there, for me to – for my wife to go there.</span> <span id="s1707">It depends – it depends on the individual.</span> <span id="s1708">And it has to come out of them, I don’t think that it is nece – certainly somebody who is closely involved with it, who has a personal experience and so on, I’ve encouraged people to go to visit, but I would – I would not encourage somebody to work there if they didn’t get that idea on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Do you have any kind of special relationship with other volunteers who are survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: No.</span> <span id="s1711">I – I don’t really have too much of a contact with too many others, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Do you have any impressions of the museum’s non-survivor staff and non-survivor volunteers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Both Jewish and non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Well, let me say this way.</span> <span id="s1716">I – I have the feeling that being – I n – I know there are a number of survivors – first of all, of course, I have trouble with the word survivor.</span> <span id="s1717">I do not consider myself a survivor.</span> <span id="s1718">I know people who’ve been in Lódz; they’re survivors.</span> <span id="s1719">Then of course then, I am not a survivor, I’m a – I’m a refugee, you can call any sort of thing, but survivor, I don’t feel I am.</span> <span id="s1720">Then, of course, then there’s the – the group in between, and that is, for instance, my wife, who is out – who was never in a conce – went to – to England in a – in a children’s transport.</span> <span id="s1721">Had a much tougher time, and of course, most of all, lost her parents.</span> <span id="s1722">Does she belong in the survivor cat – she doesn’t consider herself to be a survivor.</span> <span id="s1723">It’s – it’s very difficult, but to me, the – I don’t think there’s any question.</span> <span id="s1724">To my wife’s cousin, who was in Lódz, or was in – in Auschwitz, no question either.</span> <span id="s1725">It’s that in-between, gray area.</span> <span id="s1726">That’s one point.</span> <span id="s1727">The second point is, I don’t think that by virtue of being a survivor, you become an expert.</span> <span id="s1728">No, quite frankly, I’ve – I’ve made myself very unpopular already.</span> <span id="s1729">I mean, I’ve only attended one survivor group so far, and I’ve made myself unpopular [indecipherable] by basically saying, just because somebody’s a survivor, they don – does not mean that they’re necessarily the best guides.</span> <span id="s1730">So I’ve been accused since then of being an academic, or being too – too feeling that you have to have university degree and so on.</span> <span id="s1731">Which isn’t, of course, at all what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1732">I’m just saying that, being the be – being the best guide, or a guide, it’s interesting to be able to say to a group, this person lived through it, but that does not make that – that’s important, but it doesn’t make necessarily a – a qualified guide, or the best guide.</span> <span id="s1733">There might be somebody who had no connection with it, and yet still is able to do a great job.</span> <span id="s1734">So, I have a – perhaps a slightly different point of view than some of my fellow volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Have you had any memorable experiences working at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Are there any particular parts of the museum, the exhibits, that you identify with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: No, I’m affected deeply by certain areas.</span> <span id="s1739">Obviously, like some – everybody else be it the – the picture gallery, be it th-the – the shoes.</span> <span id="s1740">I mean, you can’t help but be affected by.</span> <span id="s1741">But not – it – it – it’s a – and I’m sure different things affect different people, although there’s certain things like these, that aboundly affect just about everybody who’s – has any feeling whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Well, is there anything else you would like to add before we conclude the interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: No, I think you have been very – this has been rather exhaustive, and I don’t think I’ve ever talked quite as much as this in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s1745">This concludes the interview of Gerald Schwab.</span></p>
