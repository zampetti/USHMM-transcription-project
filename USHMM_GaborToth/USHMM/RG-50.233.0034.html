id="s35">There’s no one to ask anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s37">You mentioned that your father had four stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: He had two manufacturings of berets in two prisons, one was in Seerbu and the other one was in Berzowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: So prisoners actually produced these berets?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s41">The berets, they were -- I mean -- the schoolgirls used to -- not the Jewish ones because.</span> <span id="s42">Before the war, I guess the beret with the number here and then that what he manufactured, just the berets.</span> <span id="s43">He imported lingerie and stuff from Germany before the war.</span> <span id="s44">He was 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How old was he when he started his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: He started his family -- my parents were married in 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Were you a

id="s51">And my father was a big soccer fan.</span> <span id="s52">They won this thing with Macabee.</span> <span id="s53">In fact I remember every season, all the players that came in, who were invited for lunch in my house.</span> <span id="s54">Because he didn’t have a son, only two girls, he used to drag us every Sunday to the soccer game.</span> <span id="s55">That would bother the hell out of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: These were the Jewish soccer leagues that played?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: And the non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s58">I think they were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s59">From Poland, the soccer players came, from all over.</span> <span id="s60">He was a very avid, ardent fan.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: He didn’t play, just as a fan?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Did your mother work in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s65">Legal secretary as a young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: She was?</span> <span id="s67">Did you live in a home or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: In an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: What do you remember about that apartment?</span> <span id="s70">About the size or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Being afraid.</span> <span id="s72">Not very large.</span> <span id="s73">There was a living room and dining room.</span> <span id="s74">There was a large kitchen.</span> <span id="s75">We had a maid in the little, olden days, who slept in the kitchen on a cot.</span> <span id="s76">Separated like this and there was a large bedroom and the living room had a sleep couch, something like that.</span> <span id="s77">That was in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s78">Then my father bought, built an apartment, bought it.</span> <span id="s79">We never took possession of that because we fled.</span> <span id="s80">I mean everything started to happen.</span> <span id="s81">Nothing came of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So he eventually bought the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, in a different location.</span> <span id="s84">But we never did get to live there.</span> <span id="s85">When we started to furnish and they were finishing it, we were not allowed any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What kind of schools did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: I went to a kindergarten, there was a Romanian school.</span> <span id="s88">It was, you know, not a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s89">Then I started primary grades there.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Also the Romanian schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">Herescu School was the name of it.</span> <span id="s93">H-e-r-e-s-c-u.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you also go to Cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No, we had private teacher at home.</span> <span id="s96">It was hard because like I said, the Romanians were not big fans of the Jewish people and so there were no Jewish teachers per se.</span> <span id="s97">Especially for girls, but we had a teacher come to the house, to teach us.</span> <span id="s98">A Jewish teacher, named Mr. Clipper.</span> <span id="s99">He always had an onion and some bread in his pocket and when we didn’t read it right, he’d hit us with the ruler.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Oh, really?</span> <span id="s101">And the onion and bread was just for him to munch on?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Right.</span> <span id="s103">That was standard equipment for Hebrew teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: He taught you just Hebrew or also Jewish history or studies?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: How many days a week would he come to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: In the beginning, twice a week.</span> <span id="s108">But then when things got bad and we couldn’t go out or to school for that matter, he came every day.</span> <span id="s109">Then in the morning and there was a group of us, children who didn’t have to go on the street.</span> <span id="s110">You know, they were skipping on the fences to come.</span> <span id="s111">He would teach us Hebrew and Judaism and his daughter would give us classes so that we could -- we were not allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s112">Math and geography and Latin, oh God, I had 12 years of Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What do you remember about any favorite subjects you had in public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Mostly recess.</span> <span id="s115">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s116">Not really.</span> <span id="s117">I liked history and I liked geography and I hated math.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Do you remember any incidents of anti-Semitism from the other children, the Romanian children?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s120">We used to come home from school when we were little.</span> <span id="s121">My mother came -- brought us and then picked us up.</span> <span id="s122">Afterwards we’d come home on our own.</span> <span id="s123">We were beaten up every time we came home.</span> <span id="s124">We were beaten by the Christian boys who came from school at the same time.</span> <span id="s125">Used to throw stones and I remember I had a friend who was the priest’s daughter that lived next door.</span> <span id="s126">She used to go with me and sort of like try to protect me and chase them away.</span> <span id="s127">But yes, there was spitting and stone-throwing and “dirty Jew” and that kind of thing, that was the order of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: You lived in an integrated neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s130">We had the Greek Orthodox Church, the prominent religion in Romania was Greek Orthodox.</span> <span id="s131">The church was right across the street from us and the priest’s daughter was a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s132">We played together in her house, in my house.</span> <span id="s133">He was very kind because when they came to take us away, many a time he would shield us.</span> <span id="s134">I remember the daughter’s name but I cannot remember his last name.</span> <span id="s135">Irina was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Irina.</span> <span id="s138">I-r-i-n-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: That’s a very Romanian name.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, it’s Irene actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Irina.</span> <span id="s143">And then we were not allowed to go to school any more, you know, the Germans --- So we didn’t--we had these lessons at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you remember what year that was?</span> <span id="s145">Or how old you were when you stopped going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I guess eight, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s147">I have such a mixture in my head of Bucharest, Romania and ---Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s149">I can check it.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Czernowitz and Cuba.</span> <span id="s151">Anyway, I must have been eight or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: What do you remember about -- did somebody give you a reason why you weren’t going to school any more, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s154">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s155">I did one year of what they called lyceum a high school, one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s158">One year and it was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s159">It was Hoffman, Hoffman Lyceum.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t know if I finished the year or not.</span> <span id="s161">In Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t remember if I finished the year or not.</span> <span id="s163">I know that because I had a number here and I had a beret with a number here.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s165">So that was a private Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s167">Hoffman, it’s called.</span> <span id="s168">I don’t know if I finished the year or I didn’t finish the year.</span> <span id="s169">I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s170">But that’s about it.</span> <span id="s171">The rest I took -- we were being taught.</span> <span id="s172">Every neighborhood tried to have somebody nearby that could go without going out on the street.</span> <span id="s173">So that’s how we learned and we came after the war in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s174">I was, I did an exam.</span> <span id="s175">I was admitted into high school.</span> <span id="s176">It was really individual teaching and she was very dedicated, this woman.</span> <span id="s177">She was the daughter of ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: This was Mr. Clipper’s daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Right.</span> <span id="s180">And she was very dedicated and she was determined to teach, for us not to be without schooling.</span> <span id="s181">We did that.</span> <span id="s182">I didn’t like it but we did it.</span> <span id="s183">But then there was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s184">Because we couldn’t go on the street anyway so we did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Were you a well-to-do family before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I would say yes, I would say yes.</span> <span id="s187">So many standards of well to do.</span> <span id="s188">We were very comfortable, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Would you take trips at all in the summer months or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s191">We used to go to --.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Carpathians?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s194">We used to go to --.</span> <span id="s195">First of all, as little children we went to a place called Kimpolung which was in the Bukovina.</span> <span id="s196">Then later on we became more sophisticated.</span> <span id="s197">That was from Bucharest.</span> <span id="s198">Czernowitz, we went to Kimpolung which was in the mountains.</span> <span id="s199">We had sort of like an efficiency and my parents went for bath.</span> <span id="s200">My father came on the weekends, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: A spa of some kind or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I don’t know, yeah, more or less, yeah.</span> <span id="s203">My mother went for this bath.</span> <span id="s204">Once she took us to -- I was very little.</span> <span id="s205">She took me to Czechoslovakia, to Prague.</span> <span id="s206">What was the name of it?</span> <span id="s207">Some resort, I hated it.</span> <span id="s208">I cried because I couldn’t take those -- the smell.</span> <span id="s209">She took me with her into this, like a spa.</span> <span id="s210">They were taking these mud baths and the mud things -- I hated it.</span> <span id="s211">I only got to go once.</span> <span id="s212">After that we went to Kimpolung, you know, a lot of people were there.</span> <span id="s213">We had a river, in German it’s called the Prut River, we used to go every day there.</span> <span id="s214">In the summer, whenever there were no threat of pogroms.</span> <span id="s215">Every -- I remember distinctly, I don’t know with what, whether there was a real schedule, every two months, every three months, but I know that every once in awhile, when the rumor came out, we had to go in hiding.</span> <span id="s216">That was before anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: You’d pretty much lock yourself in the apartment and ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s219">We went -- this guy hid us.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s221">And the pogroms were committed by Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Romanians, Ukrainians, the Cossack group.</span> <span id="s223">I am ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Would they go as far as to kill Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s226">They would go so far as to take a rabbi and take hair by hair, pull his ---.</span> <span id="s227">That’s what happened to Rabbi Mark, Cherna’s rabbi, temple.</span> <span id="s228">It was the Germans afterwards.</span> <span id="s229">First thing they did.</span> <span id="s230">It was a plaza like; it was a big temple.</span> <span id="s231">It was an orthodox; we didn’t know anything about conservative or reform then.</span> <span id="s232">So the women’s balcony was up there and the men were down there.</span> <span id="s233">It was a very beautiful plaza and they went in and they made all the Jews dig a grave.</span> <span id="s234">They took Rabbi Mark and they absolutely tortured him, shot him that he fell inside the grave, inside that pit.</span> <span id="s235">.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: In the plaza, this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s238">The Germans did that and a few other people from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s239">Then they liked the way that this came out so they went from house to house.</span> <span id="s240">I remember on four occasions, my father was already standing, was all the men together.</span> <span id="s241">Something always happened and I cannot give you an explanation.</span> <span id="s242">Somehow, that they were saved.</span> <span id="s243">Either somebody called them away or something, I don’t know what it was but it was dug.</span> <span id="s244">The hole was dug in our garden and my father was standing around.</span> <span id="s245">My mother and my sister was sitting there, you know, from the window.</span> <span id="s246">Only the men.</span> <span id="s247">Something happened, either with the war, I don’t remember what it was but somehow he was saved.</span> <span id="s248">His father died like this too.</span> <span id="s249">So error and fear is what I grew up with.</span> <span id="s250">Possibly I can’t remember because of that; I thought I pushed it out of my life.</span> <span id="s251">There were better times when we came to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s252">As I said before, my mother -- my father -- my relatives actually in Bucharest decided that -- little by little to bring us out of there.</span> <span id="s253">Because Czernowitz was very bad.</span> <span id="s254">My mother got somehow a certificate that she needs an operation in the capitol, in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s255">As two minors, we went with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: She didn’t need an operation, this was __?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: A fake?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Right.</span> <span id="s260">We got there and it was great.</span> <span id="s261">We couldn’t go out because they were looking for people from Czernowitz to re-deport them.</span> <span id="s262">So we were hidden for a good three months in somebody’s house until that thing blew away, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s263">It took my father seven months to walk from town to town; from the northern Romania into the capitol, Bucharest.</span> <span id="s264">He arrived almost before the Germans started to bomb.</span> <span id="s265">That’s how we were reunited and we had four years of constant bombardment in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: In Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s268">So we were going constantly --.</span> <span id="s269">There was a big, big building.</span> <span id="s270">One of the biggest, where my aunt and uncle lived and we were with them.</span> <span id="s271">I don’t know which bomb was it, the British or the American took two stories off that.</span> <span id="s272">We were under -- well they were building, the building was already done with, what is it called?</span> <span id="s273">not for bomb, for shelter, was an air raid shelter down there.</span> <span id="s274">We practically lived there because it was -- in the morning, the British, then the silver, the Americans came; then the Russians.</span> <span id="s275">So we were back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s276">At least they didn’t have time for the Jews.</span> <span id="s277">A lot of people were killed in shelters because the bombing it had to be.</span> <span id="s278">It was such a mixed feeling.</span> <span id="s279">We knew the bombs, they coming to bomb; but we were happy they were coming.</span> <span id="s280">So a lot of people perished in the -- Jews and non-Jews, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So those four years, you pretty much stayed in your aunt and uncle’s home and didn’t venture out much?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, yes, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s283">No, I remember going to, on the corner there was a movie, Ingrid Bergman and -- what was the movie?</span> <span id="s284">I just saw it on television recently -- I never saw the end of that movie until we got to Italy.</span> <span id="s285">It was -- the bombs were coming so I didn’t see that movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s287">So you were at the movies and you had to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Intermezzo.</span> <span id="s289">Well the alarm was sounding.</span> <span id="s290">There was pre-alarm that went when they left Italy.</span> <span id="s291">The pre-alarm they had to evacuate the movie immediately.</span> <span id="s292">So we had only about a block to go.</span> <span id="s293">My sister and I never saw the end of it until we got to, I think, America or Cuba, the end of the movie, Intermezzo.</span> <span id="s294">Then we did our -- after that we did our equivalency, we went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: In Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: In Bucharest.</span> <span id="s298">What kind of school did you go to?</span> <span id="s299">When did you start going back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: After I -- they hold an exam for those, the equivalency.</span> <span id="s301">I was taught at home; so were many others.</span> <span id="s302">We went into junior high school.</span> <span id="s303">The junior high school and high school and I got my baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s304">What is it called?</span> <span id="s305">Finish of high school, the big exam.</span> <span id="s306">There was an oral exam and a written exam.</span> <span id="s307">The oral exam -- they were communists, of course, and you couldn’t say anything about ---.</span> <span id="s308">You had to say, you had to lie.</span> <span id="s309">They twisted history a lot and you had to go along with that, otherwise they failed you.</span> <span id="s310">And it was a very tough exam, a whole day exam.</span> <span id="s311">I remember my mother fasting on that day because we knew we were trying to get out and she wanted me to have that document with me.</span> <span id="s312">I passed it and then there was years until we got the visa for, the transit visa for Hungary and Austria but the exit visa expired.</span> <span id="s313">So we went for two years until finally it happened.</span> <span id="s314">We took a lot of our stuff, like some china and some crystal that were in the family for a long, long time and we shipped it to Israel to my aunt.</span> <span id="s315">That’s how come I have these -- whatever pictures I have.</span> <span id="s316">Because when we left Bucharest, we were told that you’ll come crawling back and you don’t even need anything to take with you.</span> <span id="s317">They examined my teeth and the hair for diamonds and for whatever.</span> <span id="s318">My father buried a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s319">They now have a refrigerator factory there so there’s no chance of going to get that.</span> <span id="s320">We came out and went to Switzerland first and my father got some money out from what he had long before the war.</span> <span id="s321">If we didn’t have that money, we could never have made it.</span> <span id="s322">We bought some clothes and we tried to go to consulates, to get a visa.</span> <span id="s323">Switzerland only gave you so much stay and you couldn’t stay any longer and they would not prolong it.</span> <span id="s324">So we came to Italy.</span> <span id="s325">In Italy we went to the American embassy and they informed us that we can’t get a visa.</span> <span id="s326">We lived in Italy for eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Where in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: In Milano.</span> <span id="s329">We traveled through a lot of this -- whenever an embassy was .</span> <span id="s330">There was a question of Costa Rica or Cuba or Venezuela or whatever.</span> <span id="s331">My father, deep inside him, was hoping that the Russians would go away and he would be able to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: To Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s334">Czernowitz is gone.</span> <span id="s335">Was given away.</span> <span id="s336">He never told us when there was a boat.</span> <span id="s337">Finally we got a visa to Cuba.</span> <span id="s338">According to my father’s cousin in America; he said that’s the closest, forty minutes.</span> <span id="s339">So you wait a couple of weeks and then you’ll come here.</span> <span id="s340">A couple of weeks turned out to be ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: It was 40 minutes between Cuba and the U.S., right?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: So we chose Cuba.</span> <span id="s343">We went to the Cuban embassy in Italy and we got our visa.</span> <span id="s344">Then he was holding off.</span> <span id="s345">Every time we go to check when there’s a boat to Cuba, he said, there’s no boat to Cuba.</span> <span id="s346">He thought maybe they’ll go away, maybe we’ll be able ---.</span> <span id="s347">He just ---.</span> <span id="s348">We wanted to go to Israel and we were advised not to.</span> <span id="s349">We went through a lot so much already and I mean, ’48; the State was born in ’48.</span> <span id="s350">This was ’47 and there was a lot of things going on there and so finally, he couldn’t hold anymore and we took a boat.</span> <span id="s351">We went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s352">We had falsified papers in Italy, I want you to know, from the Romanian government –in-exile because we only had a visa for 30 days and it came, what, eight months we stayed there.</span> <span id="s353">So they kept falsified on our passport, that we have.</span> <span id="s354">We got a Cuban visa and a false Romanian visa.</span> <span id="s355">Even the language was not correct because they were a government-in-exile.</span> <span id="s356">They forgot how to speak Romanian from King Michael’s.</span> <span id="s357">So we got our Cuban visa and we came to Cuba.</span> <span id="s358">We stayed in Cuba and waited and waited.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: The entire time, trying to leave Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s361">Right.</span> <span id="s362">No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s363">We couldn’t get a visa.</span> <span id="s364">My father was -- how can you sit in a hotel.</span> <span id="s365">How long can you --?</span> <span id="s366">My father went into business.</span> <span id="s367">We had an apartment.</span> <span id="s368">I was working, my sister was working.</span> <span id="s369">I went to business school and learned steno and I was a secretary in six languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: You’re living in Havana?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: In Havana, yes.</span> <span id="s372">And so is my sister, import/export companies.</span> <span id="s373">We were very happy.</span> <span id="s374">My parents suffered and they, I mean it was hot.</span> <span id="s375">The hurricanes, they’re -- besides when an American visa comes.</span> <span id="s376">We go.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: What year did you go to Cuba, what year did you leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Left Europe in ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Do you remember the exact date?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No, I remember we got --– no, I don’t remember the exact date.</span> <span id="s381">We got to Cuba in 1948, the hottest year, the hottest summer, well, it was all year around.</span> <span id="s382">The biggest hurricanes, that was Cuba.</span> <span id="s383">Then we came here to the United States and my father again went into a different business.</span> <span id="s384">He -- his cousin was in knitwear so he worked with him for a while and then he opened a wholesale store, down on Ludlow Street.</span> <span id="s385">He was selling to stores and he was manufacturing himself.</span> <span id="s386">In other words, not manufacturing but contracting; sweaters and all kinds of knitwear.</span> <span id="s387">Then he had a heart attack and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: How old was he when he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Fifty-eight.</span> <span id="s390">My mother was 67 when she died five years later.</span> <span id="s391">It’s just, you know you go through so much and you -- she just couldn’t live without him.</span> <span id="s392">Of course, my sister and I ---.</span> <span id="s393">My sister lives in Florida, in Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s394">She lost her husband.</span> <span id="s395">Suddenly for -- a very, very strange --.</span> <span id="s396">There were 14 people in cases like this in the world.</span> <span id="s397">He was number 15, he had cancer in his heart, can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s398">They removed almost half of his heart and they replaced the wall with woven, imitated --.</span> <span id="s399">He lived for a year and a half.</span> <span id="s400">I met Charlie on a blind date.</span> <span id="s401">Never knew what a blind date was, always wanted to know.</span> <span id="s402">Because in Cuba, there were 8,000 Jews in Cuba and everybody knew everybody, if not intimately, but of everybody.</span> <span id="s403">Nobody knows what it means to have it like that, that was it.</span> <span id="s404">Now are you going to behave Charlie or do you want me to talk for you or what?</span> <span id="s405">{Male voice: I’ll do my best}.</span> <span id="s406">Pull yourself together and just.</span> <span id="s407">You ask your questions, he’ll answer, how’s that?</span></p>
