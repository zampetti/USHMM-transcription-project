I went to the Young Israel on East 29th Street and to the Jewish Center around the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">WH: So how did you come to Vineland ?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">IG: I was making $32.00 a week making pocketbooks and wallets in my cousin's factory.</span> <span id="s53">We were five in the family and I couldn't make a living.</span> <span id="s54">We paid $55.00 rent a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">LG: Word got around that Jews were buying farms and you could be your own boss and you don't have to worry about the language that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">IG: And you could keep Shabbos.</span> <span id="s57">My family in Europe was chassidisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">LG: Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, and in the summer I went to Camp Yeshiva in Swan Lake (Louis retrieves some faded black and white photos of himself with camp bunkmates and shows them to me.)</span></p> <p><span id="s60">IG: In Europe I also lived in the country, like a farm.</span> <span id="s61">I liked to be outdoors.</span> <span id="s62">It wasn't like a chicken farm here, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WH: Did the JAS lend you money?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">IG: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">$3,000.00.</span> <span id="s66">The most we had was about 10,000 chickens.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WH: What happened when the disease came?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">IG: Oh, when the disease came, we were very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: And this is the farm?</span> <span id="s70">You're still living on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">LG: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s72">I remember when the hurricane came, I was standing here, looking out the window with my mother and the whole roof on the coop opened up like you open a lid on a box.</span> <span id="s73">It blew away in just 20 seconds.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WH: Did you have a partner?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">IG: How did it work out?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">IG: Very bad.</span> <span id="s77">Not bad but very bad.</span> <span id="s78">What he wanted I didn't want and what I wanted he didn't want.</span> <span id="s79">He was a bad person.</span> <span id="s80">The JAS said not to go in with a partner.</span> <span id="s81">It worked out terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">LG: And the funny thing was they were friends before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">WH: Did you look in Connecticut to buy?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">IG: Yes, but there they had bungalows and not only chicken farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WH: Where were most of the farmers from in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">IG: From the shtetls of Europe, not the big towns.</span> <span id="s87">And Jews there made a living by buying geese, chickens, or sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: Did you feel any antisemitism here?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">LG: No.</span> <span id="s90">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s91">Mostly Italians lived here.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: How about the other Jews here?</span> <span id="s93">How did they act?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">LG: Not too good.</span> <span id="s95">They were cool to us, like we were invading their turf.</span> <span id="s96">First we were a trickle but then it became like an avalanche, these Polish Jews, the survivors, by 1952 or 1953.</span> <span id="s97">By 1955, they started to leave.</span> <span id="s98">A lot of them had passed away.</span> <span id="s99">I knew most of them because I went from farm to farm inoculating the chickens they had.</span> <span id="s100">And I think they died from what they went through during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: How did your father live this long, until 86?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">LG: God is with him.</span> <span id="s103">There was no shul here, so my father started a minyan in one of the upstairs rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">IG: I've had so many operations, that I was 99% gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: You remember the scandal about the Goldhaft book?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">IG: Yes, he spoke bad about the refugees.</span> <span id="s107">He was not good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">LG: He got rich from selling the vaccine he invented.</span> <span id="s109">It's ironic because he wouldn't have gotten that rich if not for selling the vaccine to the refugees he made fun of.</span> <span id="s110">He looked at the greener like they were a little uncivilized, like a snob looks down on people.</span> <span id="s111">Some of the people never forgave him even though he apologized for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">LG: The crux of the matter was that people looked down on us.</span> <span id="s113">I went to high school here and the Jewish kids stuck together.</span> <span id="s114">I'd made friends with some of the American Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s115">And they were considered the natives and we were the strangers.</span> <span id="s116">Some were very nice even though they were very wealthy, like Danny Rudolf.</span> <span id="s117">But others looked down that we were uncultured, rough.</span> <span id="s118">They were sitting here during the war, lacking for nothing; they werenâ€™t afraid for their lives, they didn't have to scrounge for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s119">And the greewners here, they were hungry, they were desperate to make a living.</span> <span id="s120">I mean, look, some people came without money.</span> <span id="s121">You come to America with two or three thousand dollars, what could you do?</span> <span id="s122">Sometimes some of these greeners exerted pressure, they tried so hard.</span> <span id="s123">They didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s124">And the Americans took it wrong.</span> <span id="s125">They said the greener are over-aggressive, they want to be richer than us.</span> <span id="s126">They said you just came off the boat.</span> <span id="s127">My grandfather built this house and like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WH: Are any of the survivor synagogues still around?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">LG: Only the Shearith Hapleita shul here in Vineland.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">WH: Why did you stay these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">LG: It was a good life.</span> <span id="s132">When we had free time we used to go to the river in Norma, they called it the Jewish River, and relax.</span> <span id="s133">We would play cards there and speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s134">The kids would play the jukebox.</span> <span id="s135">It was on the Alliance Beach.</span> <span id="s136">As far as staying was concerned, those survivors who died, their wives had to leave the farms.</span> <span id="s137">Then, a lot of survivors who did well, they got too cocky.</span> <span id="s138">They weren't happy just making a living.</span> <span id="s139">This guy wanted a new car, this guy wanted a mink coat and new furniture.</span> <span id="s140">But there's just so much you can get out of a farm.</span> <span id="s141">A lot of them didn't figure on that and they thought it would always be blue sky.</span> <span id="s142">And then they owed money to the suppliers.</span> <span id="s143">Many went into debt, especially after 1955, when the price of eggs began to drop.</span> <span id="s144">And they had a fancy lifestyle.</span> <span id="s145">My parents lived the simple life, nothing extravagant, no vacations.</span> <span id="s146">I'm not knocking the others, just stating facts.</span> <span id="s147">We survived because we didn't owe any money.</span> <span id="s148">People owed money, they repossessed the farm.</span> <span id="s149">That's what happened to my friend who owed $18,000 in feed.</span> <span id="s150">Had some of these people stayed, their farms would have had value.</span> <span id="s151">We now lease part of the property to a used car dealer.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">LG: I went to City College and got a degree in Business Administration.</span> <span id="s154">I worked for Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Moody's Investor Service for about eight years.</span> <span id="s155">Had I stayed I probably would have been a vice president now.</span> <span id="s156">But I left and went into a business, women's shoes, but it didn't work out and then I didn't feel like going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: How do you explain the Holocaust in religious terms?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">LG: I had a rabbi in Torah Vodaas who used to say: "A lot of times God makes something bad happen because the Jews have it too good somewhere."</span> <span id="s159">When we lived so well with the Gentiles we had high intermarriage rates and it happened in Vineland too.</span></p> <p><span
