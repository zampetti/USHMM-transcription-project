id="s3">RG.50.233.0056</span></p> <p><span id="s4">April 12, 1992</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Oceanside, New York</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Abstract This is an oral history of twins, Rene Slotkin (born Rene Guttman [Gutman]) and Irene Hizme (born Renatta [Renate] Guttman), recorded on April 12, 1992 in Oceanside, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">The twins describe their stories and memories, starting from their birth on December 21, 1937 in Teplice-Sanov, Czech Republic, and continuing through their early lives in Prague, their experiences in the camps, and their eventual immigration to the United States.</span> <span id="s8">Their father, Herbert Guttman, was arrested as a political prisoner in December of 1941 and eventually he was taken to Auchwitz, where he died.</span> <span id="s9">In 1943, Rene, Irene, and their mother Ita were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and then later sent to Auschwitz, where the family was separated and where their mother perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Although the siblings were kept completely separate while at Auschwitz, both children became subjects in Joseph Mengele’s medical experiments on twins.</span> <span id="s11">Upon liberation, they did not reunite for several years, during which time they were sent to various homes and orphanages.</span> <span id="s12">Thanks in part to an article in Life Magazine that contained a profile of Ms. Hizme, Irene was brought to America by Operation Rescue Children and adopted by an American couple, the Slotkins.</span> <span id="s13">When the Slotkins discovered that Irene had a brother, they began searching for Rene, and eventually found him living in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s14">The family adopted Rene as well, bringing him to the United States in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Interview with Irene Hizme and Rene Slotkin</span></p> <p><span id="s16">April 12, 1992</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Oceanside, New York</span></p> <p><span id="s18">R: My name is Rene Slotkin.</span> <span id="s19">This is now April, 1992.</span> <span id="s20">I was born Rene Guttman [Gutman] in 1937 in Tepice-Sanov (Teplitz Schoenau) which is in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic).</span></p> <p><span id="s21">What is your specific birth date?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">R: December 21, 1937.</span> <span id="s23">And I am not sure how long we actually lived – or how long I stayed in Tepice-Sanov, but my first recollection is living in Prague.</span> <span id="s24">Um… Irene, you have something?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">I: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s26">My name is Irene Hizme and I was Renatta (Renate) Guttman, I was born the same day and I am a half an hour older than Rene.</span> <span id="s27">Um…I don’t remember Teplice-Sanov but I do remember Prague and we lived upstairs in an apartment.</span> <span id="s28">We had a terrace— it overlooked a yard, um…I don’t think it was a very big apartment.</span> <span id="s29">I kind of remember a lot of things being in one room.</span> <span id="s30">Um… our crib – we slept in a crib – and it was in the room where our parents’ bed was as well.</span> <span id="s31">And someplace down always was a table.</span> <span id="s32">That’s kind of all I remember.</span> <span id="s33">There was a long flight of stairs to get upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">R: Yeah, the staircase – I remember that too.</span> <span id="s35">‘Cause I remember falling on the stairs once and cutting my chin and having a burning sensation when I was treated for it.</span> <span id="s36">And, lo and behold, years after, after the war when I first remembered this, I looked and there is a little scar there.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">You recently took a trip where you recall a certain streetcar or a trolley?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">R: Well, after the war, I returned to Prague because— because we had some friends who had some documents and pictures of us when were much younger, before the war with our parents.</span> <span id="s39">I do remember then seeing a trolley car with the number 22.</span> <span id="s40">I didn’t know what was 22 at the time but the image is 2-2.</span> <span id="s41">We followed the routes of the tram at that time – number 22 – and I was able to locate this particular apartment building and it turned out to be the right one, so that was a bit exciting.</span> <span id="s42">But even more exciting was being able to, at the time, to get – this must have been in 1948 – just before I started my trek to the United States, to be able to get actual pictures of myself and Irene and my parents together.</span> <span id="s43">It sort of really gave me some roots for the first time ever— something tangible to be able to look at and know that I had a beginning and parents like everyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">I: I have very sporadic memories of our childhood, but I do remember that we were beautifully clothed.</span> <span id="s45">We had beautiful clothing – matching outfits.</span> <span id="s46">You know there was always— I remember, particularly, we had these um… you know— not these, with bells on them so our mom could hold us with like a leash.</span> <span id="s47">Not a leash, but you know what I’m talking about— I don’t know how you call that— how do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A harness—</span></p> <p><span id="s49">I: A harness.</span> <span id="s50">And they had these little bells on them.</span> <span id="s51">I remember that very clearly.</span> <span id="s52">I remember also very often going to a park which must have been near our home, with our parents.</span> <span id="s53">And most vividly, I remember, one time there was a huge storm and we went to the park afterwards and all these trees had fallen down and we were climbing – you know like kids do – on them, walking along the trees— it was really a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">R: The pictures are of us, our parents and ourselves in the park.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">I: We even have pictures in the park.</span> <span id="s56">And I remember – this is just something that came to my head – I remember candy that we used to get.</span> <span id="s57">Like a marmalade, um… it’s like the Passover candy that they used to make.</span> <span id="s58">You know those jelly… jelly kind of candies.</span> <span id="s59">I remember that for some strange reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Do you remember what they tasted like?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">I: Yeah, kind of orangey.</span> <span id="s62">That was weird, I just… we also had, we had a certain number of toys.</span> <span id="s63">And we used to play upstairs in the apartment, the one specifically I remember, we had punches (ph 058) like conductors on a train and we would play train a lot and we would punch the tickets.</span> <span id="s64">And I also remember having a doll, which Rene very nicely threw down from the balcony and smashed to smithereens.</span> <span id="s65">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Was that one of those celluloid dolls from the time or…</span></p> <p><span id="s67">I: Yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s68">R: It was big.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">I: Yeah, a big doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">R: From that period, what I remember is being in the yard of this building and stepping on a bee—</span></p> <p><span id="s71">I: Yeah, he was bitten—</span></p> <p><span id="s72">R: And I was bitten by a bee and even now, when I think about it, my foot starts itching.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">I: Yeah, right on the bottom of your foot, I remember that so clearly, it’s funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Did they take you to a hospital or was it just taken care of at home, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">R: I think it was just taken care of the way you would take care of a bite today.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">I: And the other thing I remember so clearly, is when mom used to put us to bed, we played kind of a game.</span> <span id="s77">She would put our hands in a certain order and we would see if we could wake up in the same position.</span> <span id="s78">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">I: I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">So you shared a crib?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">I: Yes, we shared a crib.</span> <span id="s83">You were on the… right.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">What have you learned now in terms of what your father did, in terms of his occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">R: My father was in the export/import business and I think this somehow led to his accusation of being a spy— because I imagine that he had dealings with foreign countries.</span> <span id="s86">He was originally from Germany, the whole family is from Germany so this is what he was accused of, and I think on the basis of that he was jailed and sent to the camps.</span> <span id="s87">My mother I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">I: Our mom, she also worked, she was very good in math, so I think she had something equivalent to possibly an accounting job, which of course, once laws that you couldn’t hire Jews came about, you know she was laid off.</span> <span id="s89">But she did have a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Do you know if you were a fairly well-off family or typical middle class or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">R: I can only judge by the clothing that we wore from the photographs we have, we can show you.</span> <span id="s92">We seem very well dressed and our parents also.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">I: I think…by that time, our parents had fled from Dresden to Czechoslovakia where we were born, but I think our aunts from Dresden kept sending us clothes.</span> <span id="s94">It was our aunt that sent us clothes.</span> <span id="s95">Because our parents could not buy anything.</span> <span id="s96">Because by then our father was out of work and so was our mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">R: In other words, after we left Germany— when they left Germany, that was the whole down…</span></p> <p><span id="s98">I: Yeah, they no longer had any source of support and it was our aunt that sent… When did they leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">I: Well we were born in ’37 so it must have been around then.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">I: There are a series of letters between their father and the aunt in Germany— about ten letters that we have, describing the children’s behavior and how…</span></p> <p><span id="s102">R: Yeah, that is terrific to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">I: Memories for the future… they are wonderful.</span> <span id="s104">They’re in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">You don’t know specifically what your father imported and exported?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">But he was arrested in Czechoslovakia, I see.</span> <span id="s108">Do you have any recollections of his being taken or…</span></p> <p><span id="s109">I: I do.</span> <span id="s110">I definitely do, again, not clearly but, one night, there was a knock on the door, a very loud knock— and there were soldiers who had come and they came to take our father away.</span> <span id="s111">I remember our mom was crying.</span> <span id="s112">We didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s113">It was late at night and we never saw him again after – at least I don’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s114">R: I just remember what she said.</span> <span id="s115">It was a disturbing event, it did happen but that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">About how old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">R: I would say four.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">And are you the only children of your parents.</span> <span id="s119">No brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">(Silence on the tape for a few seconds) Any other memories that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">I: Something in the letters, maybe?</span> <span id="s122">I can’t recall the letters.</span> <span id="s123">I do remember at some point that we used to stand on line to get food— I sort of remember that.</span> <span id="s124">Um… the people stood on line.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Do you know if your family was religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">I: I have no recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">R: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Did relatives ever come to visit you in Czechoslovakia, that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">R: No</span></p> <p><span id="s130">I: I do remember once though, that in the summer, it must have been summertime, I don’t know when, but we went someplace where there was water, like a beach.</span> <span id="s131">That’s all I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">R: It would have to be a lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">I: Maybe a lake, I don’t know but I remember being…</span></p> <p><span id="s134">R: I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s135">See what thirty minutes makes?</span> <span id="s136">A big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">One of those memories…(everyone laughs).</span> <span id="s138">Well, you have good recollections of being injured (to Rene).</span> <span id="s139">What do you recall about the changes in Prague or changes in your life once the Germans occupied?</span> <span id="s140">Or what is the first significant memory you have of a real change in your lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">I: My first significant memory is waiting to get on this train to go someplace.</span> <span id="s142">It was a nice train though, you know it was like a sleeper or something, with windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">R: I think that was Theresienstadt that we were going to.</span> <span id="s144">I remember too, chronologically speaking, that is the next memory after.</span> <span id="s145">Because the previous memories, it wasn’t a good life… a good existence, I don’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">I: Umm, it was, I think I… as a child, I sensed something was not right but…</span></p> <p><span id="s147">R: That’s right, that’s what I’m saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">I: Our mother was rather sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">R: ‘Cause I don’t remember my father, obviously my mother— she would have to have been sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">I: I remember a certain sadness, but the next thing, as I said, was really this train ride to someplace else to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">R: That was Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">I: That was Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Do you remember taking anything with you, in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">I: Well, we did have some stuff but… I… this is… I… the only thing I recall is that I had a locket.</span> <span id="s155">I had a locket that I… a heart, and I remember having that for a long time even when I arrived in Auschwitz and I was very brazen.</span> <span id="s156">We would stand on line for the showers and we would have to strip naked and I had enough presence of mind to know that I had to take this thing off and I would hold on to it.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t know how I did it, but I did it.</span> <span id="s158">I lost the locket however, somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">What did the locket look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">I: It was a heart shaped locket.</span> <span id="s161">It had pictures inside of it— I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">This was a gift from your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">I: It must have been, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">You don’t recall taking a toy with you or umm…?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">R: The only thing I remember was my mother’s shoulder and the texture of the dress that she wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">On that day, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">R: Not on that day, but from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s168">That’s one of the things – since you asked us something tangible – this is what I do remember.</span> <span id="s169">And I think there was a picture taken—</span></p> <p><span id="s170">I: Picture taken of us—</span></p> <p><span id="s171">R: Picture was taken of us at that point in time and—</span></p> <p><span id="s172">I: We have the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">R: Yeah, we got the picture and you know, it confirms this shoulder that I was leaning on.</span> <span id="s174">We have it right here.</span> <span id="s175">And, but I don’t remember taking anything with me, like a personal toy or anything like that.</span> <span id="s176">No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">So you remember how her dress felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">R: Yeah, it was coarse…</span></p> <p><span id="s179">I: But I do remember that our mom did carry a bag with something.</span> <span id="s180">That I remember but I don’t know what was in it really.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Do you remember anything about the train journey itself, and getting to the train station outside Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">I: Actually, the train ride was kind of… I don’t know, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s183">I think it was maybe our first train ride.</span> <span id="s184">It was a pretty nice train ride.</span> <span id="s185">It wasn’t bad, as I recall, that trip to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">R: I have a blank on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">You do?</span> <span id="s188">You don’t remember the march to Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s189">What are your first memories of Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">I: Unfortunately, I think I have very minimal memories of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s191">Again, only, I remember cobblestone roads, pavements, brick buildings, I always see these bridges over water, I don’t know if it’s from there, I don’t know, but that comes to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Were you staying with your mother there?</span> <span id="s193">Were you still with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">R: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s195">I remember you being sick there (to Irene).</span></p> <p><span id="s196">I: It’s possible, I was sick a lot…</span></p> <p><span id="s197">R: Over there, I do remember you being ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Was she taken away to the hospital in the camp or…</span></p> <p><span id="s199">R: To some infirmary but she didn’t stay overnight or anything.</span> <span id="s200">She would just go there and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">I: And in Theresienstadt, I also remember standing on line and I remember the carts with dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">R: Yeah and on the cobblestone too.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">I: They just… yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">R: Hard pushing, the wheels would get stuck between these rocks and everything would come to a halt and they would have to get everybody on the side to get this thing started again, rolling and they lost a few bodies every once in a while, that rolled off.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">I: Umm… Do you recall what your day to day life was like there?</span> <span id="s206">Did you… there was an underground school.</span> <span id="s207">Do you recall ever getting taught…</span></p> <p><span id="s208">I: I can’t recall.</span> <span id="s209">I think we were too young for the school.</span> <span id="s210">I am not sure we attended.</span> <span id="s211">But I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">R: I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">I: I don’t recall it at all.</span> <span id="s214">Well recently, there was a film made about Theresienstadt and in the film footage, which we saw in the Village just this year, there was a kindergarten, and on the bottom steps I spotted Rene in the film, so he was part of the kindergarten group, whether they were active or not.</span> <span id="s215">It was part of the Nazi propaganda film footage.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">I: I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">R: I don’t recall either.</span> <span id="s219">It is possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">I: It is possible.</span> <span id="s221">And I don’t know if you recall this, I don’t know if it’s an ____ (??</span> <span id="s222">ph 14) time for me, but at one point, do you remember standing in a field, just for hours and hours on end, I don’t know for what.</span> <span id="s223">No?</span> <span id="s224">It is just something that is kind of flitting in and out of my head lately, but I can’t exactly recall…</span></p> <p><span id="s225">R: I remember something, it was fields, it was dark, was dark and I think we were waiting for the train to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">I: No that’s a different…</span></p> <p><span id="s227">R: That’s a different… ‘Cause I remember taking quite a walk towards that train.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">I: Oh yeah, I remember that too, but that, no, this was just a lot of people were there and we were just kind of standing around waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Well that did happen.</span> <span id="s230">There was an occurrence like that where many people were taken out of the camp and held in a field, in a forest outside of Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">I: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Yeah, so this is what I have read and what I have heard from other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">R: And what was the purpose of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Well actually, last night Inge Auerbacher talked about that too, for what she remembered, she was an older child, that it looked as though they had plans to kill everybody.</span> <span id="s235">You know, she put it, “Babi Yar style,” you know, shoot people into mass graves, but it didn’t materialize for some reason – luckily – and everyone went back to the camp, back to Theresienstadt, so that might have been— it might be that you recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">I: Hmm.</span> <span id="s237">Well, on occasion, that is how they handled epidemics.</span> <span id="s238">There was some kind of disease and they couldn’t handle it, well that would be their medical solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">And actually, before the film, they did deport many people also, before they filmed the propaganda movie.</span> <span id="s240">Because they knew that it was too crowded.</span> <span id="s241">Do you remember if your mother was with you all day or did she leave you during the days as if to go to some kind of labor detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">R: I don’t think that she was with us all day but I … I do remember running wild in the place.</span> <span id="s243">I do.</span> <span id="s244">And I’m throwing things into windows and from windows down, and I’m sure that happened while I was unsupervised.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Do you remember if you were with other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">R: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s247">War games, I guess you would call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">I: Don’t you remember drawing, some inkling of memory, I think you once mentioned to me.</span> <span id="s249">I don’t know, it doesn’t come to me at this moment.</span> <span id="s250">The head of the children’s school was in your transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and his name I forgot but it will come to me in a minute.</span> <span id="s251">Very influential person, because he kept such a wonderful spirit among the children there and um… I think that when I mentioned it to you once, you did remember drawing.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Do you remember any thoughts you had about these wagons with dead bodies, I mean, did you think it was interesting as a child, do you recall any thought you had then?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">I: My thoughts were that I didn’t understand it, didn’t understand what it was but I…</span></p> <p><span id="s254">R: I don’t think that it made the emotional impact that it would to somebody a lot older.</span> <span id="s255">‘Cause it was just something… we were learning new things and I think it was just another thing for us to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">I: It was life, whatever it was, that is what happened to some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Do you have any memory of wearing a star?</span> <span id="s258">I: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">R: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">What do you recall about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">R: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Do you recall getting it, or do you just recall wearing it…</span></p> <p><span id="s263">R: I just had it.</span> <span id="s264">I don’t know where even.</span> <span id="s265">I don’t know… where would that have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Probably in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">R: In Prague, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s268">Very small, but it was there and “Juden.”</span> <span id="s269">I remember people pointing to us because of it but uh… it’s the first time I ever…</span></p> <p><span id="s270">I: Mentioning Prague, I just remembered something.</span> <span id="s271">And probably – maybe this didn’t even happen – because Prague was never bombed was it?</span> <span id="s272">I remember sirens, I remember sirens and I remember that we would go downstairs— must have been Prague because where else would I have gone downstairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Was this a large building that you lived in?</span> <span id="s274">Many apartments or do you know…?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">R: Not terribly, I would say like six, seven stories.</span> <span id="s276">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">I: Yeah, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">R: Going down…</span></p> <p><span id="s279">I: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s280">And all the other people in the building went down too— there were other people there too.</span> <span id="s281">Yeah.</span> <span id="s282">Was there food down there or any provisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">R: Would this fit?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Yeah, it could.</span> <span id="s285">I don’t know off hand but it might.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">R: It is very vague— very misty.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">In your home, did you speak German?</span> <span id="s288">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">I: I think we spoke German.</span> <span id="s290">Because I seem to understand Yiddish after the war and I couldn’t figure out how, so— it had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">An early implant—</span></p> <p><span id="s292">I: An early implant from someplace.</span> <span id="s293">See, the grownups thought that I didn’t understand what they were saying but I understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">R: Seemingly, we understood but I don’t remember what language, but when anybody spoke, especially the Germans there, I knew exactly what they were saying.</span> <span id="s295">So that would have to be.</span> <span id="s296">But I am sure that since we grew up in Czechoslovakia, that we must have learned that too— the first few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">I: But see…</span></p> <p><span id="s298">R: Or you don’t think that we were out all that much?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">I: No, I don’t think that we were out and I think that you learned Czech after the war, because I have no recollection of Czech at all, German yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">R: I don’t remember the language, I just remember understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Do you remember, do you have any memories of any of the S.S. guards or the soldiers?</span> <span id="s302">What they looked like or um… treatment of other people or of yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">I: Well the first recollection that I have of the S.S. – I guess – or the soldiers or whatever, was when we took this very long walk in Theresienstadt to the train that was to take us to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">R: There were dogs there…</span></p> <p><span id="s305">I: And they had dogs there.</span> <span id="s306">It was a long column of people who were marching, it was at night, there was snow on the ground and it was very, bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s307">And if people didn’t walk quickly enough, they would shoot them.</span> <span id="s308">They would just shoot the people.</span> <span id="s309">There were shots that rang out and I just saw bodies kind of falling.</span> <span id="s310">I don’t know – again – I don’t think that I really understood that they were dead or that they weren’t going to get up again and there were dogs and I remember that I was kind of tired and I didn’t want to go on this trip— my mom…</span></p> <p><span id="s311">R: Our mother held us by our hands, pulling us,</span></p> <p><span id="s312">I: Pulling us…</span></p> <p><span id="s313">R: I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">You were being roused awake or…</span></p> <p><span id="s315">I: Well, it was at night…</span></p> <p><span id="s316">R: It was at night, but it started… at the evening, it was probably… it wasn’t an arousal in the middle of the night, it was something that was ongoing in the evening…</span></p> <p><span id="s317">I: And it seemed like a very long walk, but that might have been that we were so little…</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Little legs—</span></p> <p><span id="s319">I: Little legs, it seems that the transport card, which was posted on the wall in Theresienstadt – and that is when you knew your time had come to go.</span> <span id="s320">We recovered these transport tickets and they are in a museum in Israel, in a kibbutz – Givat Chaim Yihud – they have a whole slew of things about Czech-all the Czech families that were in Theresienstadt and that’s in fact, where Rene and I found an affidavit that indicated that our mother had died in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">R: And our names are there—</span></p> <p><span id="s322">I: Our names—</span></p> <p><span id="s323">R: With dates of birth are there, everything is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">I: And what transport numbers – the numbers that we had on the transport – to Theresienstadt and from Theresienstadt and to Auschwitz and the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">R: December 15—</span></p> <p><span id="s326">I: December 15 to Auschwitz…</span></p> <p><span id="s327">R: To Auschwitz— 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">I: To Theresienstadt it was August.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">R: About a year-August—</span></p> <p><span id="s330">I: 1942.</span> <span id="s331">Or September 9, I am not sure, I always get confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">R: No it was August…</span></p> <p><span id="s333">I: Yeah, it was August.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">R: A little over a year…</span></p> <p><span id="s335">I: There was also another artist that was on that same transport – and he has drawn account after account of what happened that night – and you can see in his black and white drawings the pitch black of night and the entrance into Auschwitz – the spilling out of the prisoners from the cattle cars – and it’s a very clear image of what they actually went through.</span> <span id="s336">Bernard… um… I forgot his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">This photograph of you two and your mother, where was this taken, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">I: Theresienstadt</span></p> <p><span id="s339">R: Theresienstadt Was there…do you remember why it was taken, did there just happen to be a photographer in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">They were doing these things…</span></p> <p><span id="s341">I: Doing these things and I think they sent it out to family members to say – “We’re fine.</span> <span id="s342">Everything is great.”</span> <span id="s343">Do you think that this was probably done early?</span> <span id="s344">Do you recall that it happened shortly after you arrived in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">R: I couldn’t say.</span> <span id="s346">We were there over a year, empirically, knowing this now.</span> <span id="s347">I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">I: It is hard to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">R: But looking at us, I would say that we looked pretty good— so—</span></p> <p><span id="s350">I: So it might have been early.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">R: Early.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Do you have any memory of the clothes that you were wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">R: No, I remember what my mother was wearing – how it felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">I: But I remember… my hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">R: I remember your dress… that dress… colors.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">I: I remember that dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">R: Sort of reddish, purplish…</span></p> <p><span id="s358">I: Reddish, purplish right.</span> <span id="s359">Yeah.</span> <span id="s360">And I remember—</span></p> <p><span id="s361">R: —and there was yellow lines, right??</span></p> <p><span id="s362">I: Yes!</span> <span id="s363">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s364">So the squares are purplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">R: Yeah, basically a purplish background, they were like squares and also like yellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">I: See that.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">R: But obviously this is the first time ever that I am remembering this.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">I: But I remember that my mom always made me a thing on top of my head…</span></p> <p><span id="s369">R: Yeah the long—</span></p> <p><span id="s370">I: I had long hair and she always had… yeah right.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">R: Ita.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">And so you recall walking to the transport to Auschwitz, and the dogs and the guards shooting people who were straggling I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Or beating them, or yelling and the dogs barking.</span> <span id="s375">Yeah, they just had to get the trains loaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">I: It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">R: Yeah, it was our first real display of real uh… force against the people – that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">I: It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">And your mother was pulling you along?</span> <span id="s380">Had you by the hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s382">She had two of us, she couldn’t carry much of anything else right?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">I: But she also did, she still had something.</span> <span id="s384">A small parcel of some sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">What do you recall about the transport itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">I: That was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">R: That I remember.</span> <span id="s388">Uh… we were absolutely jammed into this car, I can smell the stench of what went on in there.</span> <span id="s389">Everything went on in there.</span> <span id="s390">And we were there for a very, very long time.</span> <span id="s391">People were trying to faint and fall down, but they almost couldn’t because—</span></p> <p><span id="s392">I: It was so crowded, you couldn’t turn around or anything.</span> <span id="s393">It seemed like an endless journey.</span> <span id="s394">Just an endless journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">You were all together in a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">I: Yeah, with lots and lots of other people.</span> <span id="s397">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s398">I remember being very thirsty.</span> <span id="s399">I remember biting my hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">What did biting your hand do?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">I: I wanted to cry but I knew that— I didn’t dare cry, I think</span></p> <p><span id="s402">R: That was really a strange environment, we really didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s403">This was so unnatural.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">I: I didn’t understand what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">R: Heard the clickety click of the train rolling, just on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Do you remember anything about your mother on this transport?</span> <span id="s407">Anything that she was doing or saying to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">R: She was up there— I was down.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">I: Yeah, she was standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">R: She was holding us close, that is all I remember.</span> <span id="s411">There wasn’t any contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">I: I kind of remember hanging on to her legs.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">R: Yeah right.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">I: I remember that I wanted to sit down.</span> <span id="s415">I wanted to sit, but there was no space, you couldn’t turn around.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Do you remember other children on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Did your mother have any food with her?</span> <span id="s419">Do you recall her passing any bread to you or potato or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">I: I would think that she must have had something but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">So this journey took quite a while?</span> <span id="s422">Several days?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">I: At least a day, I would think.</span> <span id="s424">We arrived December 18, so it took three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">R: I think that there were people who died on that ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">I: Oh, there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">R: Because, when they opened the doors, they were lying, there was no movement down.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">You remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">The stench was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s431">That I can smell every once in a while, actually.</span> <span id="s432">“Heraus”— it was German again and the dogs and “schnell,” “macht schnell.”</span> <span id="s433">And again your mother had you— you were thrown out of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">I: And miraculously enough, we stayed with our mother.</span> <span id="s435">There was a whole Czech Lager, a special family Lager for the Czech families that everybody stayed together-men, women and children.</span> <span id="s436">It was a special— from December to March, we stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">So, other twins have recounted them yelling for twins, “Zwilling, Zwilling” (ph 445).</span> <span id="s438">Do you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">I: We heard that also but it didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s440">Well— maybe it did but I don’t… because I remember that we went with our mother to the hospital to be… whatever— to be checked out and the reason I remember this – I love to tell this story – the reason I remember this is because he (Rene) was such a cry-baby when it came to doctors.</span> <span id="s441">Now, I was scared that he was going to cry and that they were going to beat him up or hit him, because I was such a stoic.</span> <span id="s442">(Laughs) So somebody examined you two and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">I: I remember that she was with us, one time, she was there with us.</span> <span id="s444">But that might have been when they knew that we were twins.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Did you two, did you know you were twins?</span> <span id="s446">It might sound like a silly question, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s447">I: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">R: No, no.</span> <span id="s449">It had no meaning.</span> <span id="s450">It took on meaning later, I think, when we were separated and I first got into the group of the male twins that I realized I was a twin.</span> <span id="s451">Even then, I wasn’t sure that I knew that it was different than being just a normal kid.</span> <span id="s452">But what it really meant uh… So after it was “Haraus” out of the cars, you were taken directly to this Lager?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">I: This barrack, yeah, this Lager where all the other Czech families were and my recollections of then are really— again, we were with our mother, there was very little food— I remember we used to get a piece of dark, black bread and um…some kind of slop to drink— I don’t know, something that tasted awful and but I recall seeing people beaten in that Lager, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s454">But… Were there just women and children in that Lager or did it seem like whole families were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">I: I think it seemed like whole families were together.</span> <span id="s456">But I am not… what do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">R: I don’t have any recollection of any of this until we were separated and then I start to pick up memories.</span> <span id="s458">Because I was totally on my own then, and then I really had to… it seems like we were really guarded.</span> <span id="s459">I just don’t remember any of the outside things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">I: I remember, sometimes we had to stand outside in the mornings for something or other-when our mother was there-I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Any other recollections of your day in this Lager?</span> <span id="s462">Do you think you were just in there the whole day or…until these Appells came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">I: I have no…</span></p> <p><span id="s464">R: Not in that period.</span> <span id="s465">I start remembering after we were separated, I started to have day activities and then I start remembering our morning roll calls uh… I remember the bigger and older were taken off to work and uh… Where were you taken then?</span> <span id="s466">You were removed…</span></p> <p><span id="s467">I: At some point, I think it was in March of that year or April or whatever, maybe in June…</span></p> <p><span id="s468">R: ‘44</span></p> <p><span id="s469">I: No, it was ‘43</span></p> <p><span id="s470">R: No, ’44.</span> <span id="s471">We got there in…</span></p> <p><span id="s472">I: That’s right, December ’43, so sometime in ’44, I recall one particular terrible day when I just recall that we were ripped away from our mother and I recall a loud scream and um… I knew something— something had happened.</span> <span id="s473">You know, something was happening that was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Was it your scream that you heard or…</span></p> <p><span id="s475">I: I think it was my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">R: I think it was my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">I: She was trying to hold on to us and we were just grabbed…</span></p> <p><span id="s478">R: Pulled away from her—</span></p> <p><span id="s479">I: Pulled away from her and… This was within the Lager?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">I: Yeah, inside.</span> <span id="s481">And then the next thing I knew, I was in someplace different with just other women and girls and Rene wasn’t there anymore and my mom wasn’t there anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">How were you taken to this new place?</span> <span id="s483">Do you remember, were you walked, or did they put you in a truck or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">I: I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">What are your recollections about this?</span> <span id="s486">(To Rene)</span></p> <p><span id="s487">R: Same.</span> <span id="s488">The very same.</span> <span id="s489">And then I was just there in this new surrounding-it was very close to one of the ovens – the Crematoria – because I saw people walking in constantly— one way.</span> <span id="s490">And that is where I start remembering how my days were – hunting through garbage for a potato and seeing these daily beatings in the roll call lines in the mornings.</span> <span id="s491">Also, very vividly, I remember, prisoners – the Russian soldiers and the Polish soldiers – they were shot.</span> <span id="s492">They were lined up against the ditch and they were just shot.</span> <span id="s493">And the children – I was just six years old – we would look over the pit and see some of them still twitching and I remember pulling – not me, but some of the older boys – they pulled one fellow out who was obviously still alive but he did have a big swelling in his head – which had to be a bullet most probably – and they took him into the barracks and put him on one of the bunks.</span> <span id="s494">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s495">But these things happened almost daily – the shootings.</span> <span id="s496">Somebody was always being shot.</span> <span id="s497">There I also remember the sirens – they were more frequent occurrences as the war grew – the sirens and the hum of the airplanes above and always an S.S. trooper standing in front of the barracks at the time, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">I am just going to pause this for one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">*START OF SIDE TWO (2)-COUNTER 625 So Rene, you were taken from your mother and brought to Lager B-2B uh…how were you initiated into the new Lager?</span> <span id="s500">What do you remember first about coming there?</span> <span id="s501">Did anybody show you the—</span></p> <p><span id="s502">R: Yeah, there was concern by older people who were like me – they were twins, this I know now – and one of their big concerns was getting me a pair of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">You were barefoot at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">R: I must have been, or maybe they didn’t fit or something.</span> <span id="s505">I needed shoes, and somehow they managed through the black market to get me shoes for a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s506">I even remember the color of the shoes – they were a yucky brown, you know – up to here.</span> <span id="s507">They covered the knee— no, not the knee, the ankle.</span> <span id="s508">And they were like, you know, a caramel color brown.</span> <span id="s509">But they were almost like brand new and so I felt like I was being taken care of, but it was a totally different existence.</span> <span id="s510">I was really… my eyes were opened, I questioned like, “What’s going on?”</span> <span id="s511">“Who is the master of this?”</span> <span id="s512">I remember asking, “Who is in charge here?”</span> <span id="s513">You know like who can I ask?</span> <span id="s514">Who can I talk to?</span> <span id="s515">And in the background, all the mornings, the cold, the hunt for potatoes in the garbage and the endless lines of people walking to this…and… Did you go around with other twins or the other people in the… the other children looking for scraps?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">R: I always remember being alone.</span> <span id="s517">Totally alone.</span> <span id="s518">I know they were there but the hunt was always alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Do you remember a time that you were especially successful in finding something to eat?</span> <span id="s520">A substantial piece of bread, a whole potato?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Yeah, these moments happened, but I had to go inside and have it cut up so that I could warm it on the stove inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">You warmed the potato?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">R: Yeah, there were moments.</span> <span id="s524">They were wonderful moments when you found something that you could really eat but nothing really substantial like finding a box or anything like that.</span> <span id="s525">Maybe a big potato that wasn’t totally rotten— that was a find.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">You mentioned that you were questioning many things.</span> <span id="s527">Did you… what did people tell you or… what did you ask about this procession going into the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">R: I never asked that, that was just something that was happening.</span> <span id="s529">But I asked, “Who is the master of… who is the master of the world?”</span> <span id="s530">I think I asked.</span> <span id="s531">I was told “Hitler” Okay.</span> <span id="s532">I was satisfied.</span> <span id="s533">That was an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">The prisoners answered you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s536">And part of, I guess, daily activity – I have to retell – is the sleeping thing at night.</span> <span id="s537">On these bunk beds and ____(??</span> <span id="s538">ph 55) and so close to the wood, smelling it and also getting pushed and many times, just being able to squeeze in someplace, to have a space.</span> <span id="s539">But alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Did you always sleep in the same approximate spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">R: I was just asking myself the same question.</span> <span id="s542">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s543">I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s544">Do you remember anything about that in your…?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">I: Well, you know, my memories are a little different than Rene’s.</span> <span id="s546">But we did have bunk beds as well, and there was this long oven down the center, and I think we were somewhat assigned to beds, but I am not sure that everybody always went to these same beds.</span> <span id="s547">I particularly remember one night, having to get up and having to go to the bathroom— well, not that they had bathrooms but… outside in the back, and then coming back and getting totally confused as to what side of the barrack my bed was on.</span> <span id="s548">And I really got into a state of panic, but I knew I had to get into a bed, and I kept going over— you know, I would go over and ask somebody if I could just come in next to them, and I remember being pushed away and them saying, “This is not your bed.”</span> <span id="s549">And the more his happened, you know I just was panicking, and so I remember climbing over the oven and saying well maybe… I was so confused.</span> <span id="s550">And finally somebody had pity on me and let me come in with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Was anybody taking…did anybody “adopt” you?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">I: No.</span> <span id="s553">There was just no kind of organization of any sort.</span> <span id="s554">It seemed to me that most of the girls were older.</span> <span id="s555">I didn’t really see too many— certainly not younger than me— I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s556">And no one seemed to be in charge and I… I remember particularly being extremely, extremely lonely.</span> <span id="s557">It was like the worst thing.</span> <span id="s558">There was no one.</span> <span id="s559">And I remember that we would receive bread and some soup, and I tried to save my piece of bread, I figured that if I held on to it longer that I would have it for the whole day.</span> <span id="s560">But then somebody always stole it from me at night.</span> <span id="s561">Now, I don’t know if it was somebody else or it was the rats who ate it, but I never had it in the morning.</span> <span id="s562">And um…did I learn?</span> <span id="s563">No, I did this every night.</span> <span id="s564">I remember that there were two girls that were with me and they had little pouches, and they used to hide their bread in the little pouches.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">It was a separate pouch?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">I: Yeah, a little thing… I… and I would say, oh I wish I had one of those— but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s567">Um… I vividly also remember going to the hospital.</span> <span id="s568">And being sick.</span> <span id="s569">And I remember standing— that’s when I remember standing for roll call— that was in Auschwitz in the morning— almost every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Once you were in that Lager…</span></p> <p><span id="s571">I: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s572">And I remember it distinctly because I always tried to hide behind somebody big so that I wouldn’t be seen, so that I wouldn’t be chosen for anything.</span> <span id="s573">I didn’t question – I hardly spoke to anyone – but I was beginning to comprehend from what I was hearing that terrible things were going on— that whatever was happening was terrible.</span> <span id="s574">Although to me at this time— this was life and I didn’t remember anything else.</span> <span id="s575">I didn’t think this was wrong, right or otherwise.</span> <span id="s576">I just knew that if I wasn’t spotted, I wouldn’t maybe get chosen for something and um…I remembered that I could – from out of the door of the barrack – I could, at some point… I remembered that I had a brother, and I remembered that he was to the right— this way.</span> <span id="s577">And if I looked out this way, then his barrack was there.</span> <span id="s578">And I remember this on a night in particular when there was some kind of explosion and there was a big fire and I was terrified that his barrack was the one that was on fire.</span> <span id="s579">Um… I remember often seeing people run into the fence and uh…get electrocuted.</span> <span id="s580">And I remember on one particular occasion— and there were dead bodies on the ground, I remember one time trying to hide among these dead bodies.</span> <span id="s581">I don’t exactly know why— I don’t know what it was I was scared of, I think I just wanted to disappear and thought that maybe this was a good, convenient way to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">These were bodies outside the barrack, stacked up or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">I: Yeah, just…right.</span> <span id="s584">And I thought that this way, I could hide somehow and it would all be over.</span> <span id="s585">I don’t really know what went through my mind.</span> <span id="s586">It was a child’s idea – you know – be still like everybody else and no one will notice me.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">What about the other children in that particular Lager?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">I: There were some older children but I again— it seemed like they hung around with each other.</span> <span id="s589">So now, later on, I know that they were other twin girls, so I guess that they hung around with each other.</span> <span id="s590">I didn’t have my twin— because he was… we were not of the same sex so it was a little harder.</span> <span id="s591">But throughout all the time in the hospital and through experiments and through horrible times, I always felt that Rene was alive and I said that I have to stay alive to take care of him.</span> <span id="s592">This was like my mission in life and I very clearly remember umm… standing on line – it was always cold, of course – and we were going into the showers, standing naked and again.</span> <span id="s593">I bring up the locket – for a long time, I was miraculously able to hang on, hide the fact that I had this locket, and always put it back on after I came out of the showers.</span> <span id="s594">I also remember that somehow I knew already that not everybody came out of the showers, so every time we were lined up like this, I remember that fear, like oh my God, is this the last time?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">After the shower you would be lined up?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">I: No— before.</span> <span id="s597">Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">What happened when you got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">I: I was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Did you get yourself to the hospital or…</span></p> <p><span id="s601">I: I think somebody else must have.</span> <span id="s602">Periodically, I was taken to the hospital because I had certain medical procedures I guess, done to me— like— again— I don’t remember exactly why, or what for, or the very detailed specifics.</span> <span id="s603">But I can remember that, at one point, I had blood taken out from my neck.</span> <span id="s604">You know… I don’t… but it is vivid because it was extremely painful.</span> <span id="s605">And another time, I was strapped to a table of some sort, and there was a doctor – he was in white and he had a scalpel.</span> <span id="s606">Well, I didn’t know it was a scalpel then.</span> <span id="s607">I realize it now that it was… and um… he cut me.</span> <span id="s608">And I remember also being x-rayed.</span> <span id="s609">I remember a lot of x-rays, kind of stuff and of course being measured and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s610">But I also remember – and I don’t know what this has to do with anything – but wires.</span> <span id="s611">Wires attached to me and um… something with electric… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s612">And, I remember, um… remember seeing in one room— in some room, I don’t know… there were eyes.</span> <span id="s613">Don’t ask me— Like eyes?</span> <span id="s614">Just independent eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">I: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s616">But I also remember getting injections that made me very sick because then I found myself in kind of a hospital bed or something and um… I remember throwing up a lot and having diarrhea, and I was extremely sick.</span> <span id="s617">I remember though that there was some nurse there who kind of looked after me, and I think there was one point when they were cleaning out the hospital.</span> <span id="s618">I don’t know— again, now, they were probably just going to kill everybody, I am not sure, but there…it was a very hurried kind of thing.</span> <span id="s619">There was a big commotion and this person grabbed me and just stuck me under her skirt and it was all dark and she just said be quiet.</span> <span id="s620">You know— she didn’t have to tell me twice and um…I think she saved me, I think she saved me from something… I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">When the doctor cut you, do you remember anything about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">I: I just remember I must have fainted or… I don’t remember anything else after that except waking up in a lot of pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">And during any of those examinations, you were never with Rene?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">I: No.</span> <span id="s625">The only time I remember being with him is when we went with our mom that time.</span> <span id="s626">I don’t ever remember being there again with Rene.</span> <span id="s627">‘Cause I never saw you again after that.</span> <span id="s628">At least I don’t remember seeing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">R: I was there a couple of times, but nothing like… at least I don’t recall— the only thing I recall is being measured, the touch of the very cold instruments and the word “Runken” – that’s x-ray, I think, in German.</span> <span id="s630">I remember that.</span> <span id="s631">So there was a lot of that going on but that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">What were the measurements?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">R: Around the head, body, head, everything.</span> <span id="s634">Because they were sort of trying to… they were putting you in between something, to see how, I guess how big— it wasn’t like they were taking a tape measure, they put you against something cold, steel—</span></p> <p><span id="s635">I: There was steel, it was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">R: Very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Who was the person doing the procedure?</span> <span id="s638">Um, did they talk to you or ask you anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">I: Um, I just remember being terrified, and I knew that I had to just not cry and just do everything that I was told.</span> <span id="s640">No matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">When you were… How was it that you knew you were taken to be examined?</span> <span id="s642">Did, one morning, somebody— soldier come in and take you, or did you know that on a particular day you would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">R: I was walked over by one of the older boys.</span> <span id="s644">I am sure that I was the youngest kid there.</span> <span id="s645">I was walked over by one of the older boys and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Do you have a recollection of the “twins’ father?”</span> <span id="s647">The gentleman Zvi Spegel (ph 202)?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">R: He could have been the one.</span> <span id="s649">I know of him only in… 1985, I learned of him.</span> <span id="s650">I met [him] in Israel, Zvi Spegel.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Did he remember you?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">R: No.</span> <span id="s653">I think his mind was sort of on the blink at that point.</span> <span id="s654">But there was somebody else in 1985 who remembered me, which was very heartwarming.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">I: And he was part of Zvi Spegel’s group.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">R: And he was part of that group so obviously I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Some of the other male twins have described seeing each other… seeing the Soviet prisoners in the next half of the barracks.</span> <span id="s658">Do you recall any older men there?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s660">The only… the Soviet… the soldiers, I remember they were periodically shot, they were the ones that were always taken and disposed of… the partisans (ph 214)?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">I: Do you remember Adolph (ph 215)?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">R: No.</span> <span id="s663">But the only one I would remember is that young kid— that one other one that I met in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">I: Peter Grainfield?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s666">Peter.</span> <span id="s667">Very vaguely.</span> <span id="s668">I met this man in Israel and he was the only one that would have been my size.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">I: He was about a year younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">R: And that was extremely young.</span> <span id="s671">Because I don’t think the older boys would— even socially they wouldn’t associate with us.</span> <span id="s672">Because I think that the next up was at least three or four years older and at that point, that is a big difference so— we were alone, except that I was told that I played with him.</span> <span id="s673">And I kept looking at him and uh… I sort of… it stirred some memories, but nothing specific.</span> <span id="s674">Nothing specific really.</span> <span id="s675">What I was going to say… You were asking about who did some of the experimentation – the Museum at Auschwitz now has the documents, which we got copies of, of our names – both our names and numbers – matching and all that.</span> <span id="s676">Irene has a document where there is a signature of blood testing and Mengele’s signature on the bottom of it-so he could have been one of the gentlemen who participated in this-pretty sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">They took blood from you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">R: I don’t recall them taking blood from me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">But you recall the x-ray procedures?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">R: I recall the x-rays and measuring, that I remember.</span> <span id="s681">The other things… Did these x-ray procedures take a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Time didn’t have much meaning to me.</span> <span id="s683">It just happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">You both had numbers?</span> <span id="s685">You were both tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">What do you recall about receiving those numbers?</span> <span id="s688">Was that when you first entered Auschwitz or when you were transferred to the separate Lagers?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">I: Since our numbers are so different, I would imagine that it must have been when we were separated because we had totally different numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">R: Yeah, my number, I remember it being put on, it hurt.</span> <span id="s691">There was an awful stench all around me, it was muddy and it was like a needle pricking me, but in terms of time, when they put it, I can’t put it anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">You said it was muddy.</span> <span id="s693">It was done outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">R: It was muddy when I walked up to… yeah, it was done outside.</span> <span id="s695">Whoever it was, they were sitting at a desk with a cover over it but I stepped into it like from outside.</span> <span id="s696">And um… I’ll show you my number, I have a very clear number.</span> <span id="s697">It reads this way: 169061.</span> <span id="s698">And that’s confirmed by some of the records.</span> <span id="s699">But when I first saw that number with my name next to it – also, only in the last few years – that really gave me the chills again, confirming dreams, memories of long, long ago.</span> <span id="s700">Which still affect you, I guess.</span> <span id="s701">I’m sure they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Did anyone tell you that you had to be accountable for this number in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">R: You know, after the war, which is really— for children, I think, the hardest part— this is like another Holocaust starting or use… That’s how I look at it.</span> <span id="s704">I took an awful lot of beatings because of this number because that identified me as a Jew, in Czechoslovakia, after the war, when everything was supposedly very nice and good.</span> <span id="s705">There was no relief for children who… seven years old, all alone.</span> <span id="s706">I mean parents can appreciate this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s707">When you become a parent you will understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Irene, do you have recollections of receiving a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">I: I drew a blank on that.</span> <span id="s710">I do remember just vaguely, a needle jabbing my arm but I didn’t make anything of it.</span> <span id="s711">I just saw that everyone had one of those— I wanted one also.</span> <span id="s712">I wanted to be like everyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">You described an explosion you heard.</span> <span id="s714">Do you recall this explosion— fire coming out?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">R: No.</span> <span id="s716">But my feelings about Irene being alive, the way that she felt, I felt that too.</span> <span id="s717">And I do remember seeing her once, through the wires, and I knew it was her… it had to be.</span> <span id="s718">Some time had elapsed since we were separated, uh… I think it was toward the end, but I knew that she was alive because of that— I just knew that she was alive.</span> <span id="s719">That just confirmed the whole thing for me— that she never died in my thinking— she was always alive in my consciousness until we met in the States many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">What are your next memories about Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">R: Well, just prior to liberation, there was this incident of us being taken and almost done away with by another officer other than Mengele and uh… very clearly do I remember this incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Another doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">R: I don’t know if it was a doctor, an officer.</span> <span id="s724">And I remember Mengele coming in just in the nick of time in his green convertible and stopping this whole procession, and I also remember – and Irene I guess had that feeling many times – I knew that this was going to be deadly.</span> <span id="s725">I mean this fear instinct I guess – I had a feeling that this could be the end for me – and the horrible feeling.</span> <span id="s726">So Mengele stopped this.</span> <span id="s727">And also, towards the end of… there was this march that we all went on, that they marched us out of… I mean, the last week or so— weeks… again, time is meaningless— but I do remember a lot of excitement among the German soldiers and distant artillery fire getting louder and louder and them taking us on to this march— that was a pretty gruesome type affair because they – again – shot anybody or just… anybody who wouldn’t/couldn’t continue they just… This was January, 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">R: This was January.</span> <span id="s729">Right.</span> <span id="s730">And that was a long, long haul if I remember.</span> <span id="s731">I can’t put it in terms of hours, but then all of a sudden the German soldiers were gone and the Russian soldiers were around us – in white uniforms.</span> <span id="s732">I remember one officer being on a horse – I think it was a pink horse (laughs).</span> <span id="s733">A very big— huge animal.</span> <span id="s734">But they were all dressed in white and that was the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">So you were en route on the march?</span> <span id="s736">You hadn’t reached anywhere in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">R: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">And you realized that people were being shot if they were straggling behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Do you remember making a conscious effort to—</span></p> <p><span id="s741">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s742">I had to keep going, and she was my strength, and I knew I had to make it for her, as was the case for many of my other hardships that came about later.</span> <span id="s743">She gave me the strength to keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Did you have a blanket with you or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">R: Don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Do you recall getting any bread rations before the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">R: Nothing.</span> <span id="s748">I do remember the Russians marched us into a warehouse of some kind after this happened and there was a tremendous scramble for food.</span> <span id="s749">I wanted to get in on this.</span> <span id="s750">I do remember getting a can of some kind and rolling it and then I finally got somebody to open it— it was sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s751">That is my memory of this thing – big yellow, yellow, golden kind of a can – it was huge to me then.</span> <span id="s752">I don’t know how big it really was, but I had to roll it, I couldn’t lift it.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Surely, you ate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">R: I had something of it.</span> <span id="s755">A lot of people didn’t do so well because they overate, I understand.</span> <span id="s756">That was liberation from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">And for you Irene?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">I: I went…I must have been at a different camp (laughs).</span> <span id="s759">Kind of towards the end, before liberation as I know it now, I sensed something had changed.</span> <span id="s760">Uh… there wasn’t— suddenly there wasn’t this order in the day anymore.</span> <span id="s761">We weren’t being put outside, we weren’t standing… somehow there was no order anymore and I – at that point – was, I must have been quite sick because I remember just that I was on the ground.</span> <span id="s762">I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s763">And there were other people also lying on the ground – I don’t know if it was because they were hungry or sick or what.</span> <span id="s764">I do remember something had changed— I wasn’t quite aware of what— but there seemed to be people who were kind of a little bit… saying that we’re saved – I didn’t know what that meant – and the next thing I knew was that I was picked up by some Polish lady and she took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Within the camp?</span> <span id="s766">You were still within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">I: In the camp, but she took me out of the camp.</span> <span id="s768">So I was not part of this march – you know, that was not me – I was already gone.</span> <span id="s769">And um…I was with her a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Where did she take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">I: It seemed she lived in Auschwitz, in the town proper, and she took me to her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">For how long did you stay with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">I: I was there until Rescue Children extricated me.</span> <span id="s774">It must have been… This is an organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">I: Yes, an organization to get back Jewish children.</span> <span id="s776">But um… I remember Christmas very vividly, so I was there at least a year.</span> <span id="s777">I remember her telling me that Santa Claus is going to come out of the moon— she says to me— I believed her.</span> <span id="s778">Yeah, right!</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Did she have other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">It was just her?</span> <span id="s782">Was she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">I: Um…I think she was married, but I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">I guess, I suppose you learned Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">I learned Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">And when did this relief organization find you and take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">I guess about a year later and um… I first went to Prague to an orphanage and then I went to France to an orphanage and then a different orphanage blah, blah, blah… a lot of orphanages.</span> <span id="s788">I got shuttled around a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">And Rene, after liberation and the warehouse, what was your…</span></p> <p><span id="s790">R: The next recollection I have, I understand that I was in a hospital in Bratislava – so I am told –and I had some TB – tuberculosis – a touch of it.</span> <span id="s791">And the next… the memories for me, really begin in Czechoslovakia in a town called Košice (Kaschau) (ph 390), in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s792">A big orphanage in a hospital complex.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Was this specifically a Jewish orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">No.</span> <span id="s795">There were nuns, Mothers, around taking care.</span> <span id="s796">And uh… there was an administrator there – a doctor Kelina (ph 395) who, after some time, took me out and uh… with his wife— they had no children, and I lived with them.</span> <span id="s797">Subsequently, they had a child— Did they have a child?</span> <span id="s798">Or am I mixing it up with the other one?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">I: They didn’t have any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">R: No, they did not.</span> <span id="s801">I am mixing him up with his brother.</span> <span id="s802">I lived with him for a while and they had to flee because somehow the Communists… somebody made some statements regarding this man and he just got wind of it and he had to flee.</span> <span id="s803">So he left me with his sister and that’s the family – the Mann family – and lived with them for a good number of years.</span> <span id="s804">They were the ones that had the other children, Bebe and Otto (ph 410) and they treated me very well.</span> <span id="s805">There I went to school – in Czechoslovakia – but there again, I was the only visible Jew and they were waiting for me everyday after school with stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">So the other Czech children…</span></p> <p><span id="s807">R: There was one other Jew, I remember, but we both had to run for our young lives at the time.</span> <span id="s808">And it was a good thing that we were still young and so the people that were waiting for us couldn’t do all that much harm.</span> <span id="s809">They were still youngsters also, but they were serious and they were mean— so we had to run.</span> <span id="s810">I mean that after we were let out, we had to…</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Sprint home?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">R: Sprint home, very fast, sprint a long way too, because I lived very close to the school, they knew – they blocked my way – so I had to go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s813">It was always a big circle— sometimes it led into the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">What was the name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">R: Kojista (ph 429).</span></p> <p><span id="s816">And the family’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">R: Mann.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">M-A-N-N?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">R: Yes, M-A-N-N, Joseph Mann and…</span></p> <p><span id="s820">I: Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">R: Edith, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">This was the sister…</span></p> <p><span id="s823">R: The sister yes, of Doctor Kalina.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Unknown Woman: Just as an interesting point, later on we found out from people in New York City here, that the search for the Jewish children that had been taken for a million reasons into Polish homes – Christian homes – the way that they discovered who was a Jew in these homes was that the rescuers would go to the town Bishop, or whoever was the religious cleric in the town, and they would ask for all the baptismal certificates of the children.</span> <span id="s825">And if there were four children in one home and three baptismal certificates, the fourth one was the Jew.</span> <span id="s826">And they would exchange monies, or whatever the town needed – the Bishop I am sure was paid also – and then the children were rescued.</span> <span id="s827">So, because of that, the American Jewish Organizations were trying to raise funds to have monies to pay for these children and through one of these organizations called Rescue Child, they were having dinner after dinner,</span></p> <p><span id="s828">I: It was called Rescue Children.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Unknown Woman:…Rescue Children, Inc., one of them – the prime mover of this – was a gentleman from Long Island and he, he went into Europe to one of his orphanages that had been set up for all these rescued orphans and he found Irene in one of them.</span> <span id="s830">And he said, “Oh, you’d be perfect to come back to America and just help us raise funds.”</span> <span id="s831">This was just, like, your picture perfect orphan— with beautiful, full banana curls and a sweet face.</span> <span id="s832">And somehow he convinced her that she should come to America with him.</span> <span id="s833">and subsequently, she was made part of this Life Magazine article – Nov. 17, 1948… all about… 1947… right, that’s how Irene was taken out of the Polish home, by the way.</span> <span id="s834">One of these emissaries of Rescue Child… Rescue Children Inc…</span></p> <p><span id="s835">I: Well I’m not sure, there were other organizations that worked in Poland.</span> <span id="s836">I think that Rescue Children came into the forefront later on when many of these children were in France and they were trying to find their parents here in America— find relatives for them or else ship them to Israel or whatever.</span> <span id="s837">But when I was in Poland, you know Rene was talking about school – I was in – she was obviously a Catholic lady— I was in all Catholic school and I went to church…</span></p> <p><span id="s838">R: So did I. I went to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Did you know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s841">I went to the end of the line.</span> <span id="s842">Many times I snuck away when they went to church, but many times I did go and went through the whole… whatever I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">I: I went to Church.</span> <span id="s844">I knew I was Jewish because I had this number on my arm.</span> <span id="s845">I also was— as Rene said, I also was— getting very sick.</span> <span id="s846">Because I lay in bed, and I remember doctors coming and flitting in and out of fever, or whatever.</span> <span id="s847">And um… she was a very strict lady.</span> <span id="s848">I had to feed her bunny rabbits— she had rabbits.</span> <span id="s849">Which she would then cook.</span> <span id="s850">I couldn’t eat them because I was taking care of them.</span> <span id="s851">And, in the summer, she had family that lived out on a farm, and I remember that it was a very long walk— it took almost half a day to get there.</span> <span id="s852">And there were other children there and I hated going there because they made fun of me because I had this number.</span> <span id="s853">And nobody defended me and I cried.</span> <span id="s854">I cried a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">What would they say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">I: They made fun of me because I had this number— that I’m a prisoner of some sort, they kept saying.</span> <span id="s857">I cried a lot.</span> <span id="s858">But, with everything, when the Jewish organization – which might have been the Joint Distribution… uh I don’t know…Distribution Co., came to pull me out of that home, I had really come to like being Catholic.</span> <span id="s859">I thought it was like… nifty.</span> <span id="s860">You know, Church, the whole bit, rosary beads.</span> <span id="s861">And I didn’t want to leave – you know I really did not – I was very upset.</span> <span id="s862">I remember the first orphanage where I came to, I met somebody who I am still friends with to this day – her name is Miriam, she lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s863">And she was about seven years older than me, and she kind of became my mother figure— but she had also had… was from Poland and we were both sitting there with the Rosary beads plotting our escape from this orphanage because we wanted to go back, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">I: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">This was when you were in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">So they removed you to Prague and from Prague you were taken to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">I: Yeah, I was outside of Paris in 525, and that’s where I was selected actually by Herbert Tenszer – he used to be a Congressman from here – and he chose me to come.</span> <span id="s870">And he promised me that he would send me back— promised.</span> <span id="s871">He didn’t keep his promise.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">So you came to New York at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">I: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">And Rene, you had an exodus out of Europe also?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">R: Well, my exodus really tied to…related to her being taken in by somebody who lived out here on Long Island.</span> <span id="s876">A friend of Herbert Tenzer – was widely active in the organization – Mayer and Dina Slotkin – which is my name now – Rene Slotkin.</span> <span id="s877">And they took Irene in and that had to be maybe like ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">I: Yeah, it was at one point before I came to them, I was with the Novicks, and they dragged out of me that I had a brother.</span> <span id="s879">Because I had never spoken about it and…</span></p> <p><span id="s880">R:So they took Irene into their home, right here in the Five Towns, and then they started to search for missing Rene.</span> <span id="s881">And it is a long and fascinating story but uh… Life Magazine was somehow instrumental in locating me because this Dr. Kalina that I mentioned, had escaped.</span> <span id="s882">He had gone to Israel and somehow…</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s885">And he had gotten hold of this Life Magazine, and in it, he saw Irene as Irene Guttman.</span> <span id="s886">The names clicked and he put it together – so he got in touch somehow with somebody here in New York and told them that I was living in Czechoslovakia with his sister.</span> <span id="s887">And they – the Slotkins – sent somebody over into Europe to get me out.</span> <span id="s888">And there was a lot of red tape, I had to go through Germany and documentation and Switzerland for a while— not a direct route, and uh… I finally ended up…</span></p> <p><span id="s889">I: 1950—</span></p> <p><span id="s890">R: 1950, March 29, in Idlewild Airport, rainy night— I’ll never forget that and we were reunited on that evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">So you remembered your last name.</span> <span id="s892">There was no reason why you should remember that your last name was Guttman, but I suppose you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">R: Well, why?</span> <span id="s894">That was my name, all the way through until… that was always my name— I knew my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">I: The Polish lady changed my name from Renatta to Ivenka (ph 588).</span> <span id="s896">So that’s how Irene came.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Unknown Woman: Zvi Spegel also reinforced everybody’s identity in the camp— for the boys.</span> <span id="s898">He would have the boys… a newcomer come in right away, and they were greeted in like a circle and everybody would introduce themselves so their names were constantly being reinforced and who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">End of Tape 1 counter number 598</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s901">I: It is only in retrospect now that June is talking about it a little that I do remember when I was in Poland, that every once in a while we would take this long walk – it seemed like a long walk to me – and we would shift through this mountain of ashes – looking – she told me I should be looking for gold.</span> <span id="s902">And it was just… I couldn’t stand doing it… it was just… So these were crematory ashes then?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">I: It was just the worst.</span> <span id="s904">The worst.</span> <span id="s905">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s906">And in the town where she lived – right across – her apartment kind of faced this village square – but to the right, down the road, was where the Russian soldiers were housed and I recall that she would sometimes send me there with things to… To trade or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">I: I don’t know what, it was always wrapped up.</span> <span id="s908">So she would make me go there, and I hated going there because I was afraid of these Russian soldiers-although they were very nice – I was scared of soldiers – it was a soldier and my recollection of soldiers was not somebody that I wanted to deal with – not after Auschwitz, so it was very scary for me – but she would make me go.</span> <span id="s909">I have no idea what transpired.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">R: I do want to say one thing about the Slotkin family.</span> <span id="s911">That it is amazing to me now that I am a parent and have children, that they had the willingness and uh…the charity to extend themselves to a war orphan like Irene and then not knowing at all what I would be like, certainly a questionable background.</span> <span id="s912">And to spend these huge amounts of funds to send somebody to Europe to get me, to bring me over here and to adopt me at the age of 12… I am not sure that I could do it, knowing where I came from.</span> <span id="s913">I just don’t know— I really have to say that these were the most marvelous people to be able to do such a thing.</span> <span id="s914">And uh…I think that there are other stories like that too.</span> <span id="s915">The Jewish community really went out at that time, once they knew what was going on really and in the open and things like this and I think that this should be known.</span> <span id="s916">I think the atrocities of what happened should be known, but I think that some of the good things that came about should also be publicized.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">When did you learn what became of your mother?</span> <span id="s918">Or did you seek out the information, did you ever confirm what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">R: It was confirmed in ’85, when we went to this museum in (ph 034), Israel.</span> <span id="s920">But I think I knew, right then and there when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">What about your father?</span> <span id="s922">Did you ever find out when and where he was sent?</span> <span id="s923">Was that ever obtainable?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">R: It was found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">June: Sometime in December 1941, he was taken to Auschwitz, because the records came back— one record that we have of his demise says December 1941.</span> <span id="s926">And he might have been one of the earliest prisoners that actually helped at Birkenau.</span> <span id="s927">That was when it was being built.</span> <span id="s928">They sent it political prisoners at that time and he fit that bill.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Because of his import/export background?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">R: Therefore accusations of spy activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Unknown Woman: It seems that he was the first sent to the Petschek (Petschkův) (ph042) prison – which was actually the Petschek Palace and the Nazis turned it into an interrogation prison from where no one ever returned.</span> <span id="s932">We learned… got this from other people who lived in Czechoslovakia at the time and we met them in 1985.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">R: I do remember going with our mother to a place with packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Unknown Woman: Maybe you went to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">R: Maybe.</span> <span id="s936">I don’t remember visiting or seeing, but I do remember going to this very sound, fortress-like structure and bringing packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Unknown Woman: There’s a marker outside the Petschek now with the names of all the people who went through there— so it’s possible that their dad’s name is on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">R: Herbert.</span> <span id="s940">Herbert Guttman.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">There are some documented stories from some of the other twins, at least for the boys, about playing— being taken to a field to play soccer.</span> <span id="s942">Do you have any recollections about anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">R: Obviously I wasn’t big enough to be picked for the team.</span> <span id="s944">No, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s945">I played soccer after the war in Czechoslovakia, a little bit like a national pastime, like baseball is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Unknown Woman: One of the older twins who talked to us in 1985 – and he just mentioned – that Rene was shepherded by this communist.</span> <span id="s947">Zvi Spegel set each person in kind of a pecking order.</span> <span id="s948">This twin had to take care of that twin, or this person had to take care of that twin and since Rene and Pepe – Peter Grainfield – were the youngest, they were given an adult male, and this fellow was named Otto, and he was the one who kind of kept Rene away from the wires.</span></p>
