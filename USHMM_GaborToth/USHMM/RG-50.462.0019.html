I was a very good little artist and I liked to draw.</span> <span id="s49">In the pre-Christmas time I drew a Santa Claus and he had his knapsack full of gifts for children, and he had a flag sticking out which was a swastika flag.</span> <span id="s50">And I was lauded for a good rendition of this thing, and I was very proud that it was shown to all the other age kids and held up as a model of good art.</span> <span id="s51">And when I took it home to my father, he took me aside and said, “Don’t ever do this sort of thing again.</span> <span id="s52">We are ashamed of this flag.</span> <span id="s53">This man Hitler has even changed the flag in Germany and we don’t want to show it and you shouldn’t show it in connection with Santa Claus.”</span></p> <p><span id="s54">HS: And after these first three years, where did you go to school, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">AR: Then I was changed into the city school system, and what followed me there was that every time I was put in, my dad’s name was recognized.</span> <span id="s56">When I had to say my dad was Eric Weidemann, they said, “Was he the Social Democrat?”</span> <span id="s57">and I would say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s58">So that there was always a slight suspicion on the part of a lot of these administrators of who I would be like.</span> <span id="s59">And I always felt put on a carpet because I had to prove that I was a good student, that I was as good or better than the others, because politically my family was suspect.</span> <span id="s60">I was, I never felt, really, that I was being persecuted for that, especially, but I was, I had a very critical attitude and I was very skeptical and I was on my toes half the time.</span> <span id="s61">And as I progressed with my education, I was checked and balanced very well because I would come home and discuss certain things with my father and he would always set me right on things.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">HS: This was at a very young age, like 9, 10 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">AR: Yes, and in a time like that and in a political system of that type, you learned very early that you couldn’t say everything you thought, that you thought twice before you said certain things to certain people, and that you also felt you were justified in lying, that is, paying a certain amount of lip-service in order to appear non-suspect.</span> <span id="s64">When you switched from the school to the home, you operated on two different planes, and my fortune was that I had a father who constantly supervised and guided me and balanced me in my views.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">HS: How about the other students?</span> <span id="s66">What was their attitude?</span> <span id="s67">Did you find out what their parents felt by their behavior?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">AR: When you had an intimate relationship with a close friend, you would occasionally talk about things of a political nature.</span> <span id="s69">The easy way was always to leave it out and limit yourselves to school and recreational activities.</span> <span id="s70">The political background of your parents were usually quite apparent because you knew what profession they belonged to, what positions they held.</span> <span id="s71">And in Germany, there is traditionally—or there used to be traditionally—a tremendous degree of class consciousness anyway, and you knew where you fit in and you very often knew where the others fit in, especially on the high school level where there was a selective upper-middle class group of people.</span> <span id="s72">Very few belonged to the working class in those days—maybe 5%.</span> <span id="s73">The rest of them belonged to the upper middle class.</span> <span id="s74">And all the others knew that my dad was a fired civil servant, so that this also meant he couldn’t be trusted on the Nazistic base.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HS: And it was also a small town.</span> <span id="s76">Everybody knew, not everybody, but most people knew who everybody was.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">AR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">HS: And especially in the neighborhood, you knew about everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">AR: Yes.</span> <span id="s80">In our neighborhood, for instance, there were people that belonged to the Nazi Party and they just slid along, so to speak, to keep their jobs.</span> <span id="s81">But we also had the neighborhood officials that reported directly to the Party and they were the dedicated people.</span> <span id="s82">And you were taught from early on in Germany that the way to greet each other was to use the “Heil Hitler” salute.</span> <span id="s83">And if you refused to do that as an adult, you could occasionally run a risk of being turned in.</span> <span id="s84">And my father told us not to use that.</span> <span id="s85">We could use it in school—that was beyond his control—but privately, when we went for walks and met people we would always say, “Guten Tag” and never “Heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s86">And as the Nazi time progressed and we entered the war, that became actually an act of opposition and was quite risqué [Perhaps she means “risky.”</span> <span id="s87">-ed].</span></p> <p><span id="s88">HS: Were there many others who greeted you back with “Guten Tag” instead of “Heil Hitler?”</span></p> <p><span id="s89">AR: Most people in those days in the small town, on an informal base, would answer the way they were spoken to.</span> <span id="s90">So if you said “Guten Tag,” they would say “Guten Tag.”</span> <span id="s91">If, however, they were in uniform and you said “Guten Tag,” that would be an affront and they would probably even try to rebuke you by raising their voice and saying, “Heil Hitler.”</span></p> <p><span id="s92">HS: Did you have many friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">AR: I did not have too many friends.</span> <span id="s94">I had some very good girlfriends, but just few, maybe two of them.</span> <span id="s95">I was withdrawn because actually I was taught to be on my toes and I don’t think that helped me being very sociable.</span> <span id="s96">I also was a very ambitious young girl.</span> <span id="s97">I always felt I had to prove to the others that I could be as good or better, and that is not very, that doesn’t lend itself to being very popular.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">HS: Did you have Jewish girls in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">AR: I did not, because when I started high school—that was in 1936-37—the situation had already gotten critical.</span> <span id="s100">And since most high school students belonged to the upper-middle class, these Jewish families had already moved from my area.</span> <span id="s101">I remember that there were one or two girls in school who were what was called then half-Jewish, whatever that was, and they were accepted, but they stood out.</span> <span id="s102">Everybody was aware of them, and so you had this attitude of the Nazi daughters to ignore them and the others falling over backward to be extra special nice.</span> <span id="s103">So that they really had a hard time being like everybody else.</span> <span id="s104">And all of a sudden, in 1938, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s105">That coincided somehow with the Kristallnacht activities, that they were forced to be taken out of the public schools.</span> <span id="s106">And even those...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HS: Do you remember that particular night, or the days around that date?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">AR: I remember that because I saw pictures in the paper of broken shop windows and all kinds of vandalism, and men in Nazi uniforms standing in front, and my father talking about that, and explaining to me that from then on the Nazis would keep a record of anyone insisting on shopping in these stores.</span> <span id="s109">And a week later, I remember that my dad had to go to get a pair of shoes and went to a store that had been boarded up but was opened again.</span> <span id="s110">And the local paper published his name and showed him in front of the store, saying, “He insists on buying from Jews.”</span> <span id="s111">So that didn’t go on much farther because they drove them out right after that, totally.</span> <span id="s112">So I remember this, the Kristallnacht, but I didn’t understand the scope of it.</span> <span id="s113">To me it meant that on downtown Main Street, three shops were vandalized.</span> <span id="s114">And my father was the one that told me that the Nazis went in and that they invited the population to loot.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HS: And they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">AR: And they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">HS: And did you hear, or your father hear, what happened to the Jewish owners?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">AR: My father knew that they were leaving, and I don’t know under what circumstances they left.</span> <span id="s119">Whether they were arrested, or whether they were deported, I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s120">I just remembered at that time that harm had been done.</span> <span id="s121">And we didn’t really know whether the families had a chance to emigrate.</span> <span id="s122">However, I knew about some families that owned department stores that my grandfather had business relations with.</span> <span id="s123">And they stayed in town waiting for a visa to leave for Australia.</span> <span id="s124">And during that time, they were under a state of house arrest.</span> <span id="s125">They were not arrested properly, but it had been indicated to them that it wouldn’t be safe for them to be seen in the streets any more, and they had young children and asked my grandfather, “Would it be possible that the nanny could take the kids into our garden so that they could get fresh air and use the swing?”</span> <span id="s126">And I remember that they came twice a week and very cautiously just walked through the garden to play in the sandbox and use the swing, and I looked at them.</span> <span id="s127">I couldn’t understand why they didn’t go the public park.</span> <span id="s128">And my grandfather told me, took me aside and said, “I don’t want you to talk about it.</span> <span id="s129">That’s none of your business.</span> <span id="s130">These kids will use the swing and you will share it with them, and you will understand later on why we do this.”</span> <span id="s131">And so I had a feeling that they were very special people.</span> <span id="s132">However, in what way they were special, I did not fully understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">HS: Do you know what happened to that particular family?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">AR: Yes.</span> <span id="s135">They were disowned, that is, all their holdings...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">HS: Confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">AR: Were confiscated, but I think they made it out before the war broke out, and emigrated to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">HS: And they stayed there.</span> <span id="s139">That...</span></p> <p><span id="s140">AR: That’s the last I heard.</span> <span id="s141">I also remember that my pediatrician, when I was a little kid, was a man by the name of Dr. Lansberger whom I really loved.</span> <span id="s142">He was a very gentle man, and we applied for another check-up and I was looking forward to going there.</span> <span id="s143">And all of a sudden—that was in 1937—we went there and he was gone.</span> <span id="s144">And then my dad said, “He left because it wasn’t safe for the family.”</span> <span id="s145">And I think they emigrated to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HS: Did you, do you remember that you ever saw any signs of anti-Nazi activity?</span> <span id="s147">Or did your father tell you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">AR: My father listened, even before the war, to the BBC in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s149">And that was a dangerous thing, because if they ever caught you or anybody denounced you, you would end up in the penitentiary or in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s150">So that, since the papers were censored very heavily and subject to Nazi propaganda, this was really his only source of genuine information.</span> <span id="s151">And he indicated to me that there were forces working together in the underground, and that, even if Hitler started a war, he was convinced it would be finished within a few years because there were people caring and because they would probably try to do anything they could to finish that war.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">When the war actually started, I was scared to death because I was convinced it was lost.</span> <span id="s153">My dad always took a big world map and showed us the Western allies, the Eastern allies on the other side and Germany.</span> <span id="s154">And he said, “You don’t have to be very bright to see that one little country can’t subjugate the whole world.”</span> <span id="s155">And so, when the war broke out, he said that we would probably lose that, as soon as the Russians joined the war.</span> <span id="s156">And he was absolutely devastated when Hitler struck a deal with Stalin and decided to checkmate the Eastern front.</span> <span id="s157">And obviously that prolonged the war, but it never shattered his conviction that we would lose it sooner or later anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">HS: Did you have any relatives who also were opposed to Nazis and suffered through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">AR: Yes.</span> <span id="s160">My uncle...the husband of my aunt on my mother’s side, was a city manager in Brandenburg and exposed in the sense that he also belonged to the State Parliament.</span> <span id="s161">And he was a speaker of the State Parliament belonging to the SPD.</span> <span id="s162">So his name was well-known.</span> <span id="s163">And as soon as the Nazis came into power, they rounded up anyone that had had an exposed position.</span> <span id="s164">And so they rolled up at 3:00 in the morning with a truck in front of the house downtown and hammered on the front gate.</span> <span id="s165">And my aunt woke up and opened the door and they pushed past her and said, “Where’s your husband?”</span> <span id="s166">, pulled him out of bed in his pajamas and threw him on the truck and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s167">And they didn’t know for at least ten days where his whereabouts were.</span> <span id="s168">He wasn’t in the municipal prison and he wasn’t any place else they could establish.</span> <span id="s169">And ten days later, someone sent out a message that he had been seen at Sachsenhausen, in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">HS: This was a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">AR: Concentration camp, north of Berlin.</span> <span id="s172">And he was not allowed to send any messages and he returned after about two months.</span> <span id="s173">And he had worked in the city government and also helped work in the pub we had—my grandmother owned a pub—and was a very rotund, very healthy looking man.</span> <span id="s174">And when he came back, he had lost 100 pounds.</span> <span id="s175">He refused to talk about any of his experiences to the family and he couldn’t look anyone in the eye.</span> <span id="s176">He always looked down.</span> <span id="s177">He was in a prolonged state of depression and shock, and it took him about a year to work his way back to some degree of normalcy.</span> <span id="s178">And when Hitler’s headquarters in East Prussia was blown up by a rebellion of his officers in 1944, he was rounded up again alongside a lot of the people that belonged to the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">HS: Are you talking about the 20th of July, 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">AR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">HS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">AR: And he was gone then again for about two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">AR: The same one.</span> <span id="s184">And he was sent back to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s185">And he was sent out with the warning that if he took up any contact with any member of the underground, he would be hanged.</span> <span id="s186">And so, overtly, he stayed very neutral, stayed in the house, didn’t move around, didn’t make any phone calls and survived to the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">HS: Then he recovered?</span> <span id="s188">Or did he...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">AR: Yes, he did recover and he was again very active in reconstructing the Social Democratic Party.</span> <span id="s190">And since it was in the DDR, that is, in the East Zone, he very soon ran into trouble with the Communists and had to flee there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">HS: And he went to the West?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">AR: He went to the West and became a city manager in Langenhagen, close to Hannover.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">HS: In West Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">HS: And how about your father, did he get reinstated?</span> <span id="s195">Or did he...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">AR: My dad got reinstated and became the director of social work in my home town.</span> <span id="s197">The mayor then was a Communist and he was, my dad was a Socialist, a life-long Socialist.</span> <span id="s198">And that lasted for about two months, and then they made him resign again because they didn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s199">They thought he was not truly a, you know, a fellow traveler of the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">HS: And did he stay to the end in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s201">AR: Yes, he stayed.</span> <span id="s202">He went back in private industry.</span> <span id="s203">He had been trained during the Nazi times.</span> <span id="s204">And until his retirement he stayed in Brandenburg.</span> <span id="s205">He was a very loyal local patriot and couldn’t see to leave for the West.</span> <span id="s206">And so he spent his last years in Brandenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">HS: And when did you leave for the West?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">AR: I left in, very legally.</span> <span id="s209">I was never a refugee.</span> <span id="s210">I was admitted to the Humboldt University in East Berlin as a student, as a freshman.</span> <span id="s211">And when the Free University opened in West Berlin, I switched and became a member of the first semester there.</span> <span id="s212">And that’s where I had my initial contact with Hanna Silver...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">AR: Who opened her home to a lot of hungry students.</span> <span id="s214">And we were very active politically and needed a warm place to go, and she did not just provide the warm place but also a wonderful meal once a week, and we were sitting in her home discussing politics after 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">HS: And you also helped with the establishment of the Free University, with the groundwork for it, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">AR: Yes, in a way we did.</span> <span id="s217">We were sort of charter members, helping it from the initial stage into being a more successful institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">HS: And when you started to go to the Free University, did you have any Jewish students there?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">AR: I think we did have students that were members of the Jewish faith, but at that time, you know, it, I can’t recall.</span> <span id="s220">I couldn’t pinpoint anyone; they were just buddies.</span> <span id="s221">It didn’t matter, and I don’t think there was any real profile.</span> <span id="s222">They had student groups and clubs from the Protestant Church and the Catholic Church, but I didn’t belong to any of those, and I had friends in any of the groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">HS: Did you know of any German non-Jews who helped Jews either to hide or to leave or support?</span> <span id="s224">Did you hear anything about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">HS: They didn’t get any meat rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">AR: And my grandmother would always make sure that since she had an orchard, that this woman could come over and get fruit for her kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">HS: And vegetables.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">AR: And vegetables and things like that.</span> <span id="s229">And there was always a degree of concern.</span> <span id="s230">Were they still there?</span> <span id="s231">You know, if they didn’t show up for a week, she would send us over and say, “Tell her there is food there,” just to check.</span> <span id="s232">And they actually stayed.</span> <span id="s233">And I don’t know what happened to the husband.</span> <span id="s234">It might be that the husband was not Jewish, that the wife and the kids were.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">HS: But they survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">AR: They did survive, yes.</span> <span id="s237">And you know, persecution took many things.</span> <span id="s238">I remember we had an elderly couple next door in that same house.</span> <span id="s239">They were Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the husband was taken and he did not survive.</span> <span id="s240">They made him abjure in prison.</span> <span id="s241">If he promised to sign that he would never follow his faith, they said they would let him go.</span> <span id="s242">And he didn’t, and I think he was beaten to death.</span> <span id="s243">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">AR: For being a Jehovah’s Witness.</span> <span id="s245">And those people that actually harbored or helped Jews hide away obviously did never talk about it.</span> <span id="s246">And I got very cynical about this after the war because suddenly you heard of many people bragging or protesting that they had helped Jews, that I discarded a lot of these things as just trying to whitewash their own, or trying to cover up feelings of guilt.</span> <span id="s247">And I am sure some people did.</span> <span id="s248">But they were very often the ones that never talked about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s250">HS: You did know people, of whom you know they had help, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">AR: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s252">But as I said before, there was danger in ever mentioning things while it was going on, so they were very tight-lipped and very calm.</span> <span id="s253">As a matter of fact, they might have camouflaged it, by being overtly, even pro-Nazi to make sure that no one suspected anything.</span> <span id="s254">I knew about a woman who helped by traveling to Switzerland, clearing passport possibilities, and while going across the border attempting and being successful in smuggling out assets for the family that was supposed to leave.</span> <span id="s255">I also knew of people that tried to help in giving food to Jewish people, families, in a very casual way, to make sure that they didn’t starve because everybody knew that you were not given the same ration if you were part-Jewish or Jewish.</span> <span id="s256">You were on the very lowest subsistence level, as far as rations were concerned.</span> <span id="s257">On the other hand, I can’t be terribly specific because I was really too young to be involved, and also rather young to be made a confidant in things like that.</span> <span id="s258">You had to always worry that if people had knowledge, the pressure could be such that they might give something away.</span> <span id="s259">And so I am sure that in my family there was a certain amount of caution executed not to mention too much to us kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">HS: Could you tell me about any experiences you had with acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">AR: In our neighborhood we had actually a very close relationship with one another, and one of the neighbors was, in the beginning of the Nazi era, quite sympathetic to the system.</span> <span id="s262">He had risen and felt very important and tried to indicate to my father that he wasn’t following the right course in his reluctance to accept that system.</span> <span id="s263">The war broke out and this man was drafted into the infantry.</span> <span id="s264">And before he left, he talked to my father and said, “We’ve had our differences politically and so on, but now I am leaving my wife behind, and she will live in this house all alone.</span> <span id="s265">Would you mind looking after things in my absence?”</span> <span id="s266">And my father said, “Of course, I’ll see to it that I can help.”</span> <span id="s267">And he was trained and sent to the eastern front.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">HS: Was he drafted into the regular army?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">AR: He was drafted into the regular, run-of-the-mill GI type of troop, and he left for the eastern front and we didn’t hear from him for a while.</span> <span id="s270">And a year later or so, his wife suddenly received news from a sanitorium, a rehabilitation hospital, and we were a little bit surprised about it; and then she indicated a few months later, again, that he was due on leave.</span> <span id="s271">And when he came back he visited my father and was in uniform and as he rang the doorbell, and we didn’t even recognize him.</span> <span id="s272">He had aged by about 15 years.</span> <span id="s273">He looked very worn and he was white-haired and he was very nervous and he had lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s274">And my father asked him in and he said, “I would like to talk to you, but I can’t do it here.</span> <span id="s275">Can we go out and go for a walk in your garden?”</span> <span id="s276">My dad said, “Yes, we can,” and disappeared, and they were gone for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s277">And later on, this man had already left again, going back to wherever he had been treated and asked my father [“my father asked” may have been meant.</span> <span id="s278">-ed.]</span> <span id="s279">how he had been doing and then he hesitated and he said, “I’ll tell you.”</span> <span id="s280">He came back and he actually cried.</span> <span id="s281">He apologized to me and said, “You were so right about that system.”</span> <span id="s282">They had sent him to Russia and at first he was just part of the occupying force.</span> <span id="s283">And one of the days he had been rounded up, his whole platoon, for special duty.</span> <span id="s284">And they took him to a village and he found out shortly before, that he had been detached to be an execution platoon and taken out into the open area someplace quite away from the rest of the troops.</span> <span id="s285">And they were told they would have to shoot these civilian people.</span> <span id="s286">And he recognized that they had been Jewish people that were driven out of the villages and rounded up that way.</span> <span id="s287">And as they were getting ready—they got the orders to shoot—this man just fainted and went berserk, just didn’t remember anything from that time and had to be taken to the mental institution.</span> <span id="s288">And my father told me that and indicated that it confirmed everything that he had heard over the BBC radio news and so on.</span> <span id="s289">And he had not known the scope of it or the immediacy of it, and here one of our very own neighbors was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">HS: And was an eye-witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">AR: He was an eye-witness and I think he, as long as he lived, never forgot this.</span> <span id="s292">And he mentioned it many times after the war even to my father that he owed him so much, that he owed him this apology, he owed it to all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s293">But that my father had predicted it, and he didn’t want to believe, and it had to go so far that he would be thrown into the situation before he could see.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">HS: Did he completely recover from that or did he still suffer?</span> <span id="s295">You mentioned he had nightmares and...</span></p> <p><span id="s296">AR: Yeah, I think he never really completely recovered.</span> <span id="s297">He was depressed much of the time, and I think he was on some kind of a disability pension.</span> <span id="s298">He had been a very active man—a stone mason—and I don’t think he ever worked regularly after that.</span> <span id="s299">He suffered from depression.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">HS: Did you listen to the BBC on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">AR: I did not, but I knew my father did.</span> <span id="s302">My father got up every night at 2:00 P.M.</span> <span id="s303">That was when one of the broadcasts came on.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">HS: 2:00 A.M.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">AR: 2:00 A.M. I’m sorry, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">HS.</span> <span id="s307">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">AR: And he would wait until everybody was in bed.</span> <span id="s309">We had a maid that lived in the house and we didn’t know whether she was to be trusted, so we couldn’t listen at 10:00 or 8:00.</span> <span id="s310">He listened at 2:00 A.M. And he would take a wool blanket and put it over his head and then tune in the radio so that any kind of jamming distortions wouldn’t be too much noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">HS: Which was so very loud, the jamming...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">AR: Yes, and we would sit at breakfast in the morning and he would tell us the latest news about the various fronts and so on.</span> <span id="s313">And that, too, was quite dangerous.</span> <span id="s314">If you were caught or if somebody denounced you, you would end up in a camp some place.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">HS: Did you know of other people who were listening to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">AR: Yes.</span> <span id="s317">My grandmother had a blind cousin, and this person—he was quite advanced in years—he listened and had renters in his own little home, and he had some kind of an argument with them.</span> <span id="s318">And in revenge they turned him in and he ended up in the penitentiary in Baltsen [Belsen?]</span> <span id="s319">and he was done away with by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">HS: He did not sur-, they killed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">AR: He didn’t, they...gave him a term.</span> <span id="s322">He had to serve five years for listening to a foreign radio station.</span> <span id="s323">But he never survived until the end of the war, and as far as we can see, he was put away because he was inferior because of his blindness in addition to having...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">HS: Listened to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">AR: Listened to...</span></p> <p><span id="s326">HS: Foreign radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">AR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">HS: So, in other words, your father was always rather well-informed?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">AR: He was.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">AR: He was well-informed because he insisted to...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">AR: To...listening to the BBC...</span></p> <p><span id="s334">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">AR: And he considered that a very objective newscast.</span> <span id="s336">My youngest brother started out listening to Radio Moscow, and my father was quite disturbed about that because he didn’t trust the Russian news reports.</span> <span id="s337">So father and son would have occasional discussions when the maid was not around, and they were comparing notes on how certain things had been reported.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s339">And did your father tell other people who did not listen, trustworthy people, that he spread what he had heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">AR: Yes he did.</span> <span id="s341">As the war progressed and things got worse and worse, there were more and more people that really did tune in on those broadcasts.</span> <span id="s342">And there was a kind of a grapevine of people that knew each other that could compare notes.</span> <span id="s343">However, you had to be very careful and cautious in whom you approached on these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">HS: How were the last days of the war just before the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">AR: Towards the end of the war, about six weeks prior to it, I was taken out of high school and put in a factory to supposedly help the last war effort.</span> <span id="s346">And by that time fighter planes were flying over, we were being bombed in my home town, and the moods of the active Nazi population changed.</span> <span id="s347">You saw fewer and fewer brown uniforms.</span> <span id="s348">They were carefully folded up and not flaunted any more.</span> <span id="s349">And you would see in the paper, in the local paper, “We will fight with our last drop of blood.”</span> <span id="s350">As the Russians approached from the East, by the end of April, and we also heard that the Western front had totally collapsed, we were told that our home town would be declared an open city, that there wouldn’t be any unnecessary fighting and that our mayor, who was a Nazi-appointed active supporter of the system, would stick it out with us and help us through the difficult times.</span> <span id="s351">Within a week prior to the final occupation, this man took a Red Cross ambulance and left with his family in that Red Cross ambulance towards the West across the Elbe River and gave himself up to the British troops.</span> <span id="s352">That was the kind of support that they provided.</span> <span id="s353">There were some Nazi teachers that stayed and didn’t flee.</span> <span id="s354">The majority of the Nazi leadership really did flee.</span> <span id="s355">But some of my teachers in high school did not, and what we heard immediately after the occupation was that they were arrested and disappeared towards the East and we don’t know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">HS: You mean, arrested by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">AR: By the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">HS: And were...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">AR: And were removed...</span></p> <p><span id="s360">HS: Shipped to...</span></p> <p><span id="s361">AR: Shipped away.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">HS: To the East.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">AR: But the local leadership had prudently removed themselves towards the West because they expected better treatment from the American and British and French troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">HS: By that time, were there any Jews you knew of left in Brandenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">AR: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s366">I knew of people—this was very technical.</span> <span id="s367">If they were half-Jews, for instance, then they had a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s368">But truly Jewish families, I don’t think were any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">HS: Were left by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">AR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">HS: And did any come back immediately after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">AR: Yes.</span> <span id="s373">No, not...people that practiced the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s374">I’m sure of that.</span> <span id="s375">The synagogue had been burned.</span> <span id="s376">They didn’t come.</span> <span id="s377">And in additionl to that, it was even aggravated by the fact that that was Soviet-occupied, and I don’t think they would have liked to come into the Eastern part of Germany in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s379">Yeah.</span> <span id="s380">So this was, then, the end of the Thousand Year Reich, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">AR: Yes, that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">HS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">AR: The Thousand Year Reich had crashed.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">HS: And after that you went to West Berlin, eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">AR: Yes.</span> <span id="s386">Originally there was no real separation between West and East Berlin because [not clear] the wall didn’t exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">HS: The wall [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s388">AR: I was admitted to the University, the Humboldt University, which happened to be in the eastern part of Berlin, and that’s where I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">HS: And then you changed over to the Free University.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">AR: I changed over to the Free University when the conditions in the East became very oppressive.</span> <span id="s391">The Russians controlled the curriculum and...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">HS: And then you were fortunate to move, to live in the West?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">AR: Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s394">HS: And you didn’t have to...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">AR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">HS: Escape from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">AR: I lived in the western and the free part and occasionally visited my home town and watched conditions there, but I never returned there to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s399">O.K. [tape off then on] There is one more incident worth mentioning in connection with the plot to assassinate Hitler.</span> <span id="s400">The police came to Father and told him that there would be an action, Aktion, and he is on the list to be arrested the following day—this was in July ‘44—and that the police would take him in and put him in jail for protective custody.</span> <span id="s401">He was not questioned, and well-treated.</span> <span id="s402">Four days later he was told to go home.</span> <span id="s403">The action is over.</span> <span id="s404">So this stay in jail literally protected him from arrest and the fate of many others.</span> <span id="s405">Thank you very much Anne Dore.</span> <span id="s406">By the way the name is Anne Dore Russell Nee Weidemann.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">ANNE DORE WEIDEMANN-RUSSELL [1-1- PAGE 8] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive ANNE DORE WEIDEMANN-RUSSELL [1-2- PAGE 13] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive</span></p></body></html>
